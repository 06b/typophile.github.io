  "content": "Hey people,\n\nI have been asked to suggest a couple of typefaces for setting the book that is being published by my art and design school for this years graduating students. The students that are designing it, were thinking about using FF DIN for it. But they sort of asked me as ’type consultant’ to give them some alternatives.\n\nI want to suggest a few typefaces that have a similar square and mechanical look, but with a more humanistic touch, so to speak.\n\nI’m thinking about typefaces like [Flama](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152510/http:/www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/?page_id=10) and [Apex New](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152510/http:/www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/). They have a similar feel, but are less rigid. So typefaces like Klavika are too square.\n\nI have a few others in mind, but I’m hoping you guys can point me to some typefaces I might otherwise overlook.\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ SOS!
