This lack of attention to detail is pretty sad. Here are some random examples. Trust me, there are MANY more.\n\nAvant Garde (avantgarde.gif). The Adobe OpenType version vs Berthold. Adobe loses, big time.\n\nAmerican Typewriter (amtype.gif). Once again, Adobe OpenType loses to Berthold.\n\nBembo (bembo.gif). One more time. Adobe loses.\n\nAachen (aachen.gif). HEY! Adobe gets it right. This time Bitstream screws the pooch.\n\nWhy is this even an issue?\n\nBefore you defend Adobe, don’t. I’m just stating that their version has this problem, not saying that they suck.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [avantgarde.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/files/avantgarde.gif) | 6.71 KB |\n| [amtype.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/files/amtype.gif) | 8.06 KB |\n| [bembo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/files/bembo.gif) | 6.29 KB |\n| [aachen.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/files/aachen.gif) | 6.94 KB |\n\n [‹ typographic holiday gift?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/node/16618 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Happy New Year! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/node/17034 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

With [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) fonts, you can have several sets of figures, proportional figures in addition to tabular figures. However, with your standard Postscript/TrueType font, the decision has to be made about which style of numerals will be most useful. Apparently in many cases this means tabular figures.\n\n"

I have to assume that these Postscript fonts have proportionally lining figures. That said, a lot of them have terrible spacing between the 1 and 9.”\n\nThere’s your problem right there! Your assumption is wrong. Most regular PostScript fonts were released by large foundries with tabular figures only as default. So the default behavior is going to be just what you see. If Berthold adds kerning to certain number pairs (as most foundries do with letter pairs), then those combinations would look better. But if there is only one set of figures, the thinking goes that it should do the most jobs, and satisfy the most uses. Since tabular figures are essential to tabular sets of figures (money), the default figures are tabular, and the font won’t contain any kerning pairs between those figures because that would wreck the alignment of the tabular columns.\n\nSo, though I think we all agree that tabular figs are not typographically useful most of the time, they have been a very common default style in PS fonts for years. If you do not want to invest in OpenType (see the new [Bembo Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011044424/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/RecentReleases/2005/04-06-2005.htm)!), you could alternatively edit the kerning table for your font so that you get the behavior you want every time without hand-kerning.\n\n"
