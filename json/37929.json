I wrote and researched it using the best type history sources available. A novice Wikipedian calling himself an “amateur linguist” recently tried to remove the statement about Renaissance and later roman lettering versus ancient Roman lettering on the grounds that _he thought_ it sounded like original research. He was out of his depth. I advised if he had trouble believing the statement as the published opinion of major type historians he should find a copy of the source I used and verify it for himself.\n\nIn general, Wikipedia cannot be trusted unless the content you’re reading is cited with a verifiable reference.
