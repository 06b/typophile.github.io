  "content": "Hi, This may not be strictly a Type ID board question, but I was told this is a sample of PostSerif by Richard Lipton from 1998, for Font Bureau. Maybe associated with the National Post (newspaper?). I Googled these key words and was not able to find confirmation. Does anyone know if there is an italic face for this family? I found something that talked about versions of FB Miller being done for the National Post, and I wonder if this is another name for Miller Condensed.\n\nDoes anyone know about this typeface?\n\n [‹ (x) Funky unicase display font - P22 Sniplash {Stuart}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172756/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19201 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) West Texas Roadhouse logo - Adobe Rosewood {Tiff} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172756/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19202 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Seems that Lacava has collaborated with Font Bureau a number of times, but I cannot link Richard Lipton with Lacava Design, or the National Post design.\n\nThanks Marc, that was a good lead. I must admit I never heard of Lacava Design, but she’s been involved in many newspaper makeovers.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

He said that they did indeed design Post Serif for the National Post newspaper in 1999, and that it was done in four weights: Light, Roman, Bold and Bold Condensed (notice no italics). He said that they also licensed several cuts of Miller to the Post, both before and after the work on Post Serif. The Miller versions were mostly for display type, he said.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
