The A and H have been changed to have normal crossbars, but otherwise this seems like the source (or inspiration) for this lettering.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

A little height/width tweaking seems like it would match very well.\n\nThe gold sans at the top is something else that looks commonplace.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
