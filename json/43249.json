It's not a piece of work I've done so I really have no idea.\n\nAll I know is that it was a clean font before it was made to look distressed so ignore all of the chips and dings.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018071325im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fontsample_4099.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fontsample.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018071325/http:/typophile.com/files/fontsample.png) | 28.05 KB |\n\n",
