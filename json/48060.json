I'm pretty sure that it was a free font that I downloaded around 2003-2004. When I go into the Properties/Font window in Mediaface (CD labeling software), it says that the font is \"Sleepwalk,\" but I can't find anything by that name and it didn't offer any substitutes.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130609215817im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Sleepwalk_4217.jpg)\n\n",
