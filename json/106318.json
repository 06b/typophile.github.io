The conceit behind Aperçu was to create a synopsis or amalgamation of classic realist typefaces: Johnston, Gill Sans, Neuzeit & Franklin Gothic.\n> \n> Since its release in August 2010, Aperçu quickly found its position in the market, being used across a variety of different media and sectors around the world in both print and web. It has been utilized by institutions such as MOMA, De Wiels, Zeit Magazine and the Walker Art Center.\n"
