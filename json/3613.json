  "content": "I have an old non-latin postscript type 3 font for which there is no type 1 or TT versions. In OS X this font is recognized by Carbon applications like MS Office but is not recognized by Cocoa applications i.e. TextEdit. Is there a way to have Cocoa applications recognize PS type 3 fonts?   \n   \nI tried converting it to a PS type 1 font, but being non-latin, the results are unacceptable.   \n   \nWill Acrobat 5 or 6 allow me to embed a type 3 font in a pdf file, so I can re-print it in the future?   \n   \nWill appreciate any assisstance. TIA.\n\n",

It might make more sense to turn it into TrueType or OpenType.   \n   \nYou can embed Type 3 in PDF, but what will that accomplish? Is this some document you will never want to change?   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
