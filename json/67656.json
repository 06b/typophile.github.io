Dan Reynolds' [Malabar](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.linotype.com/5831/malabar.html). Some of the work of [Feliciano Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/) (Merlo, Rongel, Stella). [Adrian Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.linotype.com/793/adrianfrutigertraces.html) has done great work his entire career - more recently, new releases of classics like Univers Next and produced new designs such as Frutiger Serif. [Gerard Unger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.gerardunger.com/) is notable (Swift).\n\nFor broader surveys see [Typographica's Favourites of 2008](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/typographica.org/2009/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2008/), and [TDC Best of 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/tdc.org/tdc/tdc2-2009-winners) and [2008](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.tdc.org/news/2008Results/) - which gives you an idea of who's who, out there.\n\n"

      "content": "To me, [Christian Schwartz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/christianschwartz.com/) because he consistently delivers outstanding designs, [Ludwig Übele](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.ludwiguebele.de/) because his designs are much more ineresting than most stuff designed at the moment, [Lucas de Groot](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/) simply because he designed TheSans, and Robert Slimbach, who has given us some of the most useful types available today. And, last but not least, Adrian Frutiger, the greatest master of all.\n\n"

One of the most versatile and inventive designers.  \nAll his fonts are supreme, for instance I love [Renard](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/index.html) and [Arnhem](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105121531/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/fred_smeijers/).
