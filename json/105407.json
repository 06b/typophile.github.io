Part super-hero, part … something else, you probably know him for his work at A List Apart, the Superest, or Mojo.  \nLooking hand-drawn and with its trousers pulled up high, this condensed serif display face is oddly wonderful. Randy Jones was just the right chap to bring Cornell’s lettering to digital fontdom. Wobbly cup serifs and a smattering of bouncy ball terminals combine to make this single cut a delightfully eccentric face that’s really fun to use. It bears some of the hallmarks of Jones’ Olduvai, and comes replete with numerous wordmarks and pictographs, plus a number of stylistic alternates. I wonder what Batman and Robin have up their other sleeves.  \n--end quote--  \nLink to [Olduvai](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018235323/http:/marketplace.veer.com/font/Olduvai-Family-UMT0000054?skeywords=UMT0000054).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018235323im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PhaetonPromo_5018.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
