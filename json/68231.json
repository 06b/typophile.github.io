  "content": "Dear collueges from all over the world,  \nas you might know, I am working in the letterpress pre-print market:  \n [www.bleisetzer.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20130221011535/http:/www.bleisetzer.de/ \"www.bleisetzer.de\")\n\nBut although I am a writer of short stories and others and I am just preparing my new literature blog at [www.preussen-blog.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20130221011535/http:/www.preussen-blog.de/ \"www.preussen-blog.de\") (its not ready yet, sorry.)\n\nRight now I am working on an essay about the smell of languages.  \nI for myself associate e.g. french with love & erotic, finish with a motor bycicle and so on... I think its always depending on what you individually learned in your first 20 years and what your special country culture says to you, what you associate to a language.\n\nBut now the question, where I'ld like to ask for your help:\n\nWhat do you as a non german associate with the sound of german language?\n\nThanks in advance for your help. I hope, I do not disturb too much with my OT question.\n\nGeorg\n\n",

So I have been indoctrinated with the impression that the German language is harsh and evil. The Tool recording plays on that, with words that are completely innocuous made to sound like a satanic ritual.\n\nCar ads here (Canada) are disgusting, with their cliché of the humourless German engineer. It's not just Japanese or American manufacturers who exploit that stereotype, but some German too, e.g. Audi, with a seriously guttural man's voice saying the tagline \"Vorsprung durch Technik\" (Progress through technology).\n\nAs an aside, I find that English spoken with a German accent is very pleasant. That may well be because of the Germans I have known in recent years, in my dealings with FontShop.\n\nEven more of an aside, I thought Kate Winslet's German accented English in _The Reader_ was brilliant.\n\n"

Actually, I can identify with both, getting something positive out of both these clichés.\n\nThe scent of German is dominated by motor oil and decay. Maybe due to the fact that motor oil and decay smell somehow stronger than the scents renowned as more ‘humane’. Or maybe because we lack the ability to mask the bad smell properly by spraying rose petal or bubble gum scented air freshener.\n\nAlso check this great film:\n\n[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7688523464781787807&ei=7qmYS4\\_jJ...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130221011535/http:/video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7688523464781787807&ei=7qmYS4_jJqLe2wLAp63ZAg&q=faust+film&hl=de&view=1&dur=3# \"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7688523464781787807&ei=7qmYS4\\_jJqLe2wLAp63ZAg&q=faust+film&hl=de&view=1&dur=3#\")\n\n"
