  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m working on a font where the node connections show up as sharp in the node propersites window when I’m sure it should be smooth.  \nAre there any reasons why this could be happening?  \nIs there a way fixing the nodes propersites to the correct connection or is it a question of going through each glyph and changing it in the node propersites window.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115063323/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_34.jpg) | 56.15 KB |\n| [Picture 2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115063323/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_6.jpg) | 56.79 KB |\n\n [‹ InDesign CS and font weirdness!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115063323/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38619 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [AFDKO 2.0 : Post your feedback here ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115063323/http:/www.typophile.com/afdko2 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You can activate in the preferences: Glyph Window \\> Appearence.\n\nThen it would look like this, and it is easier to see what kind of node you are dealing with and if you double-click on a sharp node that could be smooth, it will automatically “correct” this node.\n\nRED = sharp  \nPINK = Smooth\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071115063323im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/colorednodes_4373.png)\n\n"

There is a problem with FontLab changing connections represented as smooth to corners—with the x instead of the o—when you re-open a glyph window (I think), or copy and paste a glyph (definite). As I understand it, this actually doesn’t change anything with the font when you export it, as the different node types are indications for convenience of designers, and not part of the font’s code. Still is it annoying, and hopefully they will fix it.\n\n"

Which ideally should have another one_\n\n“Yellow” nodes with retracted BCPs may look like they have one or zero BCPs, but the BCPs are there, in plain view, covering the node. Just Alt-drag them off.\n\nAlt/Option-dragging also works on sharp and tangent nodes. Alt-drag from the node to pull out a BCP, or Alt-drag from a straight line-segment to create BCPs from both adjacent nodes (convert to curve).\n\n"
