Is there a font that matches the English KozGoPro yet with a much smaller file size? Here's a spec sample of KozGoPro Medium, which just by itself occupies 5.3 MB:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018045558im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KozGoPro_350x200_6243.jpg)\n\n",

However, it doesn’t match precisely – in terms of weight and metrics.  \nMyriad is (has been) available as a [Multiple Master](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018045558/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Multiple%20Master) font. Maybe you can generate your own Myriad that matches Kozuka?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018045558im_/http:/typophile.com/files/koz-myriad_3459.png)\n\n"

      "content": "I agree, Christian, the file size shouldn't be a concern. And I noted that. Still, it makes no sense to me why the whopping 5.3 MB is required for a medium weight font that looks similar to a number of others. For example, thanks to Florian, I see where KozGoPro is a near match with Myriad Pro, yet my open type file for Myriad Pro-Regular requires only 78 KB. I guess what it comes down to is that I'm compulsive about wanting to keep my installed fonts as lean as possible.\n\n"

The number of glyphs it contains is at least an order of magnitude bigger than the one for a latin script font like Myriad.\n\n"

      "content": "What Riccardo said. In numbers: Kozuka Gothic contains 15.713 glyphs, Myriad a mere 842. By the way, Myriad is not just ‘Latin’, it covers Greek and Cyrillic aswell. And the file size of Kozuka Gothic is not just due to the East-Asian characters (although that makes for most of it). It also holds scads of circled, squared, bracketed and reversed figures and letters, box drawing glyphs, full sets of rotated glyphs and italics, etc.\n\n@Dave (dtw), I doubt that there’s such a direct link to a ‘stand-alone Latin’ for the Laton part of Mincho, as it is the case with KG and Myriad. If there was any Adobe typeface involved at all, it might have been Utopia.\n\n"

      "content": "All six weights of Kozuka Gothic Pro (and Kozuka Mincho Pro for that matter) are based on the Adobe-Japan1-4 character collection, and include 15,444 glyphs. However, the font being discussed is the \"Pro-VI\" version, which is based on the much larger Adobe-Japan1-6 character collection that includes 23,058 glyphs. (The \"Pro-VI\" versions have since been replaced with \"Pr6N\" versions that include the same glyphs, but are JIS2004-savvy.)\n\nAnyway, about Myriad being used for the Latin glyphs of Kozuka Gothic, that is true. And, I should point out that Myriad MM was used, and in addition to selecting an appropriate instance, the resulting glyphs were also scaled. Below is what we used for each of the six weights:\n\nExtraLight Myriad MM Weight=140 Width=600 Scale=112% (102% vertical)  \nLight Myriad MM Weight=250 Width=580 Scale=113% (102% vertical)  \nRegular Myriad MM Weight=340 Width=560 Scale=113% (102% vertical)  \nMedium Myriad MM Weight=480 Width=530 Scale=114% (102% vertical)  \nBold Myriad MM Weight=620 Width=500 Scale=114% (102% vertical)  \nHeavy Myriad MM Weight=750 Width=470 Scale=115% (102% vertical)\n\nBut, back to the original question and concern: if you want to use the Latin glyphs in Kozuka Gothic, the easiest path is to simply use Myriad Pro. ;-)\n\nDr. Ken Lunde  \nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV Type Development  \nAdobe Systems Incorporated  \n [lunde@adobe.com](mailto:lunde@adobe.com)\n\n"

I plan on using Myriad MM (Multiple Master) as explained in this article and a tool such as Typetool [http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018045558/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\") that should be able to do so as mentioned on page 80 of its manual : [http://www.dtpsoft.de/downloads/manuals/TT3MacMan.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018045558/http:/www.dtpsoft.de/downloads/manuals/TT3MacMan.pdf \"http://www.dtpsoft.de/downloads/manuals/TT3MacMan.pdf\")\n\nHowever, I can't find Myriad MM font anywhere. Or at least the real one. I've been able to download so-called Myriad-MM.ttf but I am not sure they actually are real Multiple Master fonts. When I open them with Typetool I don't get the pop-up I'm supposed to have if I trust what's written on the manual.\n\nIf anyone has any idea where I can find the real Myriad MM ? If you can tell me how can I check if the font I found is indeed a Multiple Master font ? What is multiple master fonts file extension by the way ? is .ttf possible ? If you can tell me how I am supposed to use Typetool or any other tool out there that could help me.  \nI read that Open Type fonts are the next generation of Multiple Master fonts... can this be achieved using Myriad Pro ? Or do I really need to find Myriad MM if I want to recreate Kozuka Gothic Pro Extra Light ?\n\nThanks in advance, I am completely lost, I've been looking for a long time and I can't find any answer...\n\nNick\n\n"
