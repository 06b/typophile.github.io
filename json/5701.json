But, I've been wondering if I should I create a business name (would it seem more professional/substantial or just gimicky)? I know it's a very personal decision, but I'm curious as to the process others have used to come up with their names, is it ok to use a private joke? Does it have to be something the client \"gets\"? Also, many of the other posts have debated over whether or not an individual should have a personal logo. I feel that as a graphic designer the answer is yes. Attached are 2 business card designs, please let me know what you think, if you have a preference, and how you think they can be improved upon. Thanks in advance, I value all of your input.   \n   \n ![kncard a](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108140951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41082.jpg)   \n   \n ![kncard b](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108140951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41083.jpg)\n\n",

Keawekane is both difficult to say and hard to remember, for most people.   \n   \nYour typelogo has good potential. I can see that you are lining up the \"N\"s (although, optically, the bottom/darker \"N\" looks larger) at the end of the names, and the leg of the \"K\" continues down to create the crossbar of the \"N\". I'm not sure if I like it, as is; but, I'm not sure why either. The large \"N\" seems too wide, but I can't put my finger on what else is bothering me.   \n   \nYou have kind of a cool \"K-N\" shape coming out of the \"K-i\". Have you tried fiddling with anything like this.   \n ![KN monogram](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108140951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41088.jpg)   \n   \nI definitely like the landscape bizcard layout better, but I'm not crazy about either.

Your name is great for that purpose, easy to say, easy to remember.   \n   \nThe way you have executed it, I see an arrangement of 'classical typography with some effects'.   \n   \nThe effects:   \n   \n1   \nVery crowded arrangement.   \n(Too crowded: Ki, AV (in particular) and VI)   \n   \n2   \nAlignment of whatever can be aligned   \n(Unless it has Herb Lubalin-like quality I try to avoid alignments like NN and (in particular) the diagonal KN -- they seem a little ackward)   \n   \n3   \nMixture of UC and lc (i, s and t being lc)   \n(It's ok to mix, I guess)   \n   \n4   \nThe st-ligature   \nTo the casual spectator the arrangement is basically UC, so the ligature is a little out of place -- I'm just being the devil's advocate here!)   \n   \nIt's a well-balanced logo, but I don't think 'classical feeling' together with 1-4 does the job. The biggest drawback is that you show the world what you regard as good typography, or good design ... and those alignments aren't so modern ...   \n   \nI think you should consider other ways of writing that name.   \n   \n--   \nSoren O\n\n"

You're voicing many of my own concerns that have been nagging at me but I've been squashing. While looking over past projects trying to determine \"my style\" I was a little discouraged to see no unifying look. Hopefully that is a strength - meeting the client's specific needs rather than imposing an pre-established treatment. I understand the trap David wrote of, having a classically designed mark and putting off cutting edge prospective clients and vice versa. However how does one design an identity that says 'I'm a designer, I can do your project no matter your needs/style'. My identity will be my first impression. I don't want my card to get lost in the shuffle and be mistaken for an accountant's. some more research will help I'm sure. Does anyone have recommendations of good, or even bad (shows you what to avoid) self-identity logos?\n\n"

They did however remind me of signal flags so I looked up what the signal flags would be for my initals and incorporated them into most of the attached designs. Signal flags are a form of visual communication which is what graphic design is all about. The K flag means I want to communicate with you. But the N flag stands for no or negative - not a great concept to associate with one's id. however, historically it also used to symbolize rendezvous. I don't expect a lot of people to actually decypher the flag symbols. I do hope it will be fairly self evident that they represent K and N, but the flags are simple enough to just be graphic elements. Also, a subtle nautical theme seems appropriate on a personal level. But that goes back to some of my original questions, how reflective/personal should a personal identity be?

If I understand David correctly, I think he may have read a little too much into Tom's \"billboard\" comment. I agree with David, in that a designer's identity shouldn't alienate clients by overdesigning too much of their own unique style into it (unless the designer wants to specialize and their objective is to target a very specific clientelle); but, I also agree with Tom, in that a business card can play a very powerful role in making or breaking a meaningful marketing or communications opportunity between you and a potential client. Afterall, most of us don't have much of a budget for marketing and signage, and until you get a client into your door, there is a good chance they will never see your portfolio. In my personal experience, only about 10% or less of my clients ever see my portfolio. My visual portfolio has yet to make a difference in whether or not I land a job. What I would call my relationship/experience portfolio is what brings in the work, or rather, results in the referrals that keep me working.   \n   \nI apologize for taking up so much of your critique space here, Kirsten, but this seems to be a worthwhile discussion.   \n   \nBelow is my logo on my stationary suite (a product of this forum). I am posting this because it supports the points that both David and Tom have made. The logotype is a derivative of Clarendon, which is a timeless typeface with subtle enough alteration that I believe David would approve of it. The stationary suite, however, is a selling tool. I use the two PMS colors, die cutting/punch cutting (\"Q\" and radius corners), letterpress, and stock selection as an example of how I can customize a piece that all of my clients use, but few of them have capitalized on for differentiation. Of course there are better pieces to illustrate this, but I can't carry them around wherever I go.   \n   \n ![Creative Squeeze](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108140951im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41992.jpg)   \n   \nKirsten, I prefered your initial direction better than your last postings.

This is my ultimate problem, and my ultimate solution at the exact same time. I apologize if my extreme minimilist theories are spoken as if I was wearing blinders. I feel like that sometimes.... oh well, there is no turning back.   \n   \nUltimately the question is who your marketing to. The more types of people and clients you feel you can reach the more neutral the identity should be.   \nThe more specific the clientel the more specific the identity.   \n   \nScott, I like your identity, A bit cute for me, but extemely well considered none the less.\n\n"

I decided to keep the ital \"i\", visually I like having one character with a twist and hopefully it's contrast to the roman will be a reminder of the correct spelling and pronuncation. The first posting is the logotype itself followed by possible business card applications. I thought about Daniel's comment about process and so, two cards have a die-cut and fold. I haven't decided upon colors yet, so if some of the shades appear different it's not your monitor nor your eves. Finally, I tried to rework the flag concept into something I like but nothing was successful.

IMPO an all small caps version is better than an all Caps/Small Caps version. I think you might disagree but when you open up the letterspacing you will see why I feel that in my gut. the K and the N are way too dominant. The italic i should be the subtly dominant feature of your logo. right now the K and N are cramming the i's elegance. Give the i some breathing room!\n\n"
