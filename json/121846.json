I'm pretty sure this isn't Imprint, because it doesn't look at all like Caslon. (Similarly, it isn't the Phemister Old Style.)\n\nI think I should be able to recognize this typeface immediately, but I'm embarassed to admit that I can't.\n\nAlso, I see that it is not Number Twenty-One from Linotype; that doesn't have a descending J, and it has a different type of Q in the italic.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Linotype Baskerville \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [bowfinpw](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317104354/http:/typophile.com/user/2088 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

The italic 'k' is I think the key to separate it from the Monotype and ATF versions. It also has that unusually long J, and the italic Q seems to match.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
