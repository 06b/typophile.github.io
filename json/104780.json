I've also seen it in a couple of other video games, as well as a few other places, especially the numbers.\n\n",

Wonder if this font is an obscure font that isn't common or just hard to find?\n\nI've tried using an image editor and doing numerous amounts of editing to try to get \"whatisfont.com\" to ID the font for me, but I get ones that are kind of close, but not it (the number \"5\" doesn't match as well as the characteristics of the shape of the \"9\" on the left and right hand side (how it kinda bulges out. NOTE I've seen the number \"0\" of this font and the left and right sides bulge outwards as well, like the \"9\", and the \"S\" is almost like a straight line in the middle portion of the letter, and the \"V\" is curved on only the right hand side.  \nAlso the number \"3\" has the bottom part of the number kind of like the \"5\"\n\nHopefully someone can ID this font, whether it's a commercial or a freetype font, but hopefully a commercial one is out there somewhere as commercial fonts that you purchase tend to have a full character set.\n\n"
