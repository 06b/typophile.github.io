It's the wrong way to draw a K.   \nHowever, you've devised a system with the   \nother letters that makes that K a very likely   \npossibility. Contrast this with your \"Kotica\"   \nwhich takes our common method of drawing a   \nB, for example, and forces it into some   \ngeometry where it feels forced.   \n   \nAm I the only one who thinks this?   \n   \nGood luck with it.\n\n"
