What a treat. Dennis Ortiz-Lopez has done it all and if you don't believe, check it out. Ortiz-Lopez estimates he has created 600 typefaces in his career, most of them built on a grid in Fontographer.   \n   \nsome of his type is at   \n [http://ortiz-lopez.com/OLFOLPOLH.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20061126101909/http:/ortiz-lopez.com/OLFOLPOLH.html)\n\n",

You're not interested in functionality.   \nMaybe he'd be happier as an accountant?   \n   \nSure, simply making fonts for the market, without an appreciation for Shape and/or without an understanding of reading is indeed very boring - it's like being a grocery bag boy (and many of those fonts would indeed look smashing on grocery bags). I personally try to express the power of shapes, but am also very grateful for my innate curiosity of how things work deep down.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Dennis \\*is\\* a complete freak, but a wonderful, trippy guy with a great and twisted sense of humor... talk to him on the phone for 5 minutes, and you'll be in another world. His type treatments and logotypes for pubs are inspiring, and works of art in themselves; his layered typefaces are really fun to play with.   \n   \nMy only complaint about Dennis' work is his aversion to creating characters other than the basic alphanumerics for fonts that are to be sold commercially... I don't know if he's gotten past that, but it used to drive me nuts...\n\n"

I know nothing about the character sets in Dennis' Hebrew types - I only have experience with his Latin designs and revivals.   \n   \nCommercial types in particular should have a full character set with basic punctuation, currency, etc., whether Latin or non-Latin. This is merely my humble opinion as a typographer, a graphic designer, and as someone who works with type designers in getting fonts prepped for market. It's a bummer to find the perfect typeface for a project, only to discover that it's missing the question mark or \"curly quotes.\"\n\n"
