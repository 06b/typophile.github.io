They must not be to obvious at close inspection, but notable in a large block of text.\n\nAlso typefaces with letters that are denser then the rest (with the same effect on text color in large blocks of text) are of interest.\n\n",

We’re “drawing” with text, hence I’m looking for design features that could give me some shades. We’ll use white space (paragraphs, line breaks) and italics (speach) for light shades, and capitals plus the stuff I’m requesting here for darker shades. It will be quite big, and divided in narrow coloumns allowing us to construct the sentences more carefully. It will be a real short story illustrating itself.\n\n"
