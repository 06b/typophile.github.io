  "content": "Hello-\n\nI'm looking to find a type face the works well with this logo. Right now I've just thrown garamond on there. I'm looking for something a bit more edgey, but still carries a sophisticated stance. I've been searching forever and just cant seem find anything that complements it well. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch!.\n\n-one8e\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [VR.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020085609/http:/typophile.com/files/VR.jpg) | 27.77 KB |\n\n",
