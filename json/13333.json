Tops of letters are more curved on artcraft, serifs of S are slightly different, etc. I used the font preview at the fontshop site, but increased the size to 288pt and 388 pt and could see slight differences.\n\nCould the logo have used a knockoff font or is another close font? God knows there are dozens of variations on Garamond, Palatino, Times, Goudy - just to name a few.\n\n"

Best of luck trying to deal with Castcraft and I have no idea if the CG font is available anywhere these days.\n\nAs to the curvy tops of the letters, that is a distinctive feature of the typeface. A font without those wouldn’t be Artcraft. Surely that feature was removed by the logo maker.\n\n"
