      "content": "With Word you can’t get what I would consider flawless. You can only get “good” enough.\n\nMake sure your image has at least 150 ppi resolution (this will look good enough on most business printers but if you need better quality though larger file size, make it 300 ppi). Save the image as a Word acceptable graphic (PNG. JPG, etc.) Place the image in Word. And then double-click the image and reset it’s width and height at 100%. You’ll also want to arrange the logo image behind the text or in a way that won’t interfere with actually using the document template to write with (when you double-click the image you can see a tab about Word-wrap for options on that). Then print and make adjustments as necessary until you get a result that you and your client approve of.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"
