  "content": "This is the domain address of the (now defunct) 99fonts.com website/blog that specialised in ancient middle eastern/hebrew etc typefaces. I had noticed the guy pulled the site down some time ago, but I thought that he might be coming back...but no, so now this great name is available again !\n\nIt still gets a tonne of legacy traffic (about 5000 Unique Visitors/month), so would be a great domain name for someone either starting up a new design & typography blog/website, or somebody who already has one and is looking for some instant, highly targeted traffic (via 301/302 redirection).\n\nCheck it out here:\n\n[http://cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Desi](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817142118/http:/cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Desi \"http://cgi.ebay.com.au/99Fonts-COM-Desi\") ... 911.c0.m14\n\nCheers,  \nPat\n\n",
