I draw for the last 48 hours and i tried to build all latin characters.\n\nThere are some characters i fell in love with like a, e, g, y, x ...  \nbut there are some few characters where i have some problems. ... s, S, z, Z, L, F, E\n\nMaybe someone can give me a good hint.  \nThank You.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071438im_/http:/typophile.com/files/black_test_4012.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [black\\_test.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071438/http:/typophile.com/files/black_test.pdf) | 404.55 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Very good stuff.\n\nThere are a few parts that are unexpectedly thin and could be thickened, like the joins of g, the curled terminal point of g and Q, and the crossbar of H.\n\nThe key to improving s,S,z,Z may be to remember that the bottom does not have to be the same as the top.\n\nT is unique in its lack of softness. The bottom should probably be rounded. If you can't find a different solution to the straight flat top of T, you might distribute that flatness to a few other letters like L and Z so it is not alone. But E and F look good to me as they are.\n\n"

Now it's more squarish.  \nI also fixed the top of g and made it a little bit bigger.\n\nThe punctuation and diacritics are the next topics right now. I'm thinking right now of the period, maybe i'll make it more squarish, too. Like the i and j dot's.  \nDollar, Euro and Ampersand have to be reworked. There are too many differences when i compare them.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071438im_/http:/typophile.com/files/erste_promo_blog_04_3861.jpg)\n\n"

Why don't you use the same top as on the original E and F for the T? The original E and F look faaaaaaaaar better! Check some serifs like on d: is it really facing the direction you want?\n\n"

Yours however feels a little too quirky and awkward, compared to what you've achieved in the rest of the face. The z, & and $ might be in the same boat. I think you are closer in other triple-tiered miniscule letters (a & e). Your \"g' however is verging on fantastic!\n\nFor what it's worth! I love where you are going with it. Keep it up, please!\n\n"

At least consider adding a serify bump to the top terminal of /5/.\n\nThe section mark looks too black. /#/ probably too. The copyright is terrific! I like the asterisk too.\n\nI agree that flipping the top serif of /d/ to the other side is worth trying.\n\nKeep up the good work.\n\n"
