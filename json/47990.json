  "content": "Yesterday I punched in the alarm code for the very last time when I left [Magelaan](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018114829/http:/www.magelaan.be/), the communication agency I worked at for the past 13 years. I closed the door on a 17 year career of graphic design and communication and transitioned from a life as employee to a life as independent. It was bittersweet parting, because I left behind more than just colleagues but friends.\n\nThis morning I took my bike and rode the 10 minute trip to FontShop’s Belgian franchise. From now on I will fill my days with stuff I never studied for. I will write. I will market. I will educate. I will network. I will mostly do that for FontShop USA and BeNeLux, but I already have my first type foundry client. My days will be filled with nothing but type, my first and only true (professional) passion.\n\nMost people when they near their forties hit a midlife crisis, because they realize this is what they'll probably do until their retirement. Me, I just changed my career. This is about as exciting as it gets.\n\n",
