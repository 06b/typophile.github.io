The card will have a tagline and graphic on the reverse side. Essentially working with the type blocks at this point. Haven't really locked things into a grid yet. Just playing with compositions.

This is good news, as it may allow me to carry over a graphical concept that exists in the letterhead. Currently, the fine print and the line grid on the other pieces is at/based on 10.5pt. This is a bit big for the card so I'm going to change them to match the card's final type/grid -- probably 9 or 10pt.\n\nDan:  \nThe logo which resulted from that old thread still lives at the website: [http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150112215912/http:/www.mauimountaincruisers.com/ \"http://www.mauimountaincruisers.com/\").\n\nI comissioned our very own Aquatoad (Randy Jones) to implement a double stacked \"M\" and fine tune Leviathan to make it look more authentic. He's done a bang up job!\n\nTimd:  \nI know! The email adress (long TLD) provided the biggest challenge with this layout.\n\nBen:  \nYes, I really like how 2B leads the eye, and the simple, large negative spaces make for a more cohesive composition.\n\nWill post some variations soon.\n\nThanks,\n\n-t\n\n"

This may be too slavish, e.g., the bottom margin on the 2B1s is too small yes?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the leading, especially as regards to the bottom text block? Is 9/13.1 too much?

I still haven't chosen final color/s. Plan is it for to be two-color, or one- if possible.\n\nThe concept for the back of the card is that of a tire tread. I'd like to deboss the tread pattern and have it be slightly darker than the ground to give the impression of (err...) an imprint. Any thoughts on how to best execute this would be MUCH appreciated, i.e., color, how deep, etc.?\n\nWhat about the cruiserguy pattern? I tried varous sizes and stroke widths. To my eye, 5-high was too busy/small.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the upper vs lowercase title on the card's front? I just can't decide on this; I like them both. Are the margins sufficient for a safe trim?\n\nInput on typography, composition, and color are all welcome.\n\n[http://typophile.com/system/files?file=card-front-lc.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150112215912/http:/typophile.com/system/files?file=card-front-lc.gif \"http://typophile.com/system/files?file=card-front-lc.gif\")\n\n[http://typophile.com/system/files?file=card-front-uc.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150112215912/http:/typophile.com/system/files?file=card-front-uc.gif \"http://typophile.com/system/files?file=card-front-uc.gif\")\n\n[http://typophile.com/system/files?file=card-back.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150112215912/http:/typophile.com/system/files?file=card-back.gif \"http://typophile.com/system/files?file=card-back.gif\")\n\n-t\n\n"

Take one of their bikes with a little water on the tread and roll it over some paper and scan that. The tracks look like a Jeep.\n\nYou also have a very expensive business card in that its full bleed on both sides. Is it necessary? The letterhead also is a bleed 3 sides. I suggest using that letterhead for promotions only and make most of the letterhead without the mountain graphic for general corespondence. Remember part of your job as a designer is watching out for your clients budgets. Once I had my personal letterhead with a bleed on three sides, but the reason it didn't cost much was I used Standard letterhead paper (8 1/2\" x 11\") and had it trimmed to Monarch size (7 1/4\" x 10 1/2\").\n\nIts a bit late, but isn't the concept of this type of adventure, to do it as a group experience? If it is why show one bike rider, shouldn't it be a group of riders?\n\nOverall its nice work.\n\n"

If it interacted it would become a true secondary element.\n\nCard: I'm boring, Tim. I would prefer the card to be horizontal on both sides. It is a pet peeve of mine. Just me. Nothing personal. However, Do you need the biker and the tracks on the back? This doesn't happen anywhere else. Biker change to percentage of tracks and remove tracks. I like the tracks on the front. I think you've worked the type to near perfection for what you have to work with. I'd only suggest, perhaps, letterspacing a hair the title.\n\nOverall: I really like these colors. Reminds me of Moab. I do wish you had the track on the envelope or letterhead, but I understand about costs. Great job!\n\nBTW Great to hear you used Randy. Looks like he did what needed doing.\n\n"

I may actually have a photo of the tread around here somewhere. The crusier bikes have a strange tread pattern. I had actually built this pattern out of the form of the \"A\" in the logotype -- which is also used as 'arrows' elsewhere in the set. I didn't want it to be too literal, but it might sell better if it was the actually tread. Not sure I have time for this unless I can find that photo.\n\nAs regards to costs and bleeds. The printing is going to fall well under budget due to the fact that I procured parent size sheets (Speckletone - Madero Beach) directly from French and because it's a 2-Color job.\n\nAs far as \"group experience\" goes -- one could go either way on that. Some go as groups others as couples, and solo. The tour does ride as a group, but many people refer to it as an individual experience with the incredible environment.\n\nTiffany:\n\nMoving biker left may work nicely. I'll play.\n\nYou said \"vanishing point,\" am I to assume that you processed a road into the horizon as a opposed to a mountain?\n\nNot sure how to get biker guy to interact more on the envelope. Not a lot of options here as far as I can tell. Ideas?\n\nCard: I had the biker only on the back, but it just seemed a bit boring. The tracks kind of tied it all together in a subdued sort of way. I like the size of the biker -- any bigger and it's not recognizable -- smaller and it's not prominent enough.\n\nAs per [Mark S's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150112215912/http:/www.ms-studio.com/) (and your) suggestion -- all the 9pt text could probably use a bit of tracking.\n\nColor: yes the Moab like colors work well. In fact Maui's \"red dirt\" is a very similar color due to it's high iron content.\n\n[A Photo of Haleakala Crater](http://web.archive.org/web/20150112215912/http:/www.mauimountaincruisers.com/inc/img/mars_lrg.jpg) -- only slightly digitally exagerated.\n\nMahalo to everyone for your expert input.
