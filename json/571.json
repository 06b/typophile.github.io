  "content": "Hi everyone,   \n   \ndoes anyone have experience with ttf fonts under Linux? I'm rounding up a typeface with a ttf version. I had 3 different people test this under Windows and it works perfectly. But someone under Linux has major problems with it. This is what he said:   \n   \n- The typeface is visible, he can select it but there is no preview   \n- He tried to use the font with the following results:   \n \\* terminal program crasher irreparable   \n \\* mozilla webbrowser renders all the texts invisible   \n   \nThis person is running everything under Linux and has a substantial amount of windows ttf fonts that he runs without any problems.   \n   \nI created this font with Fontographer 4.1.5 on a Mac with OS9.2.   \nThe encoding under Font Information is set to Windows.   \n   \nDoes anyone have an idea what happens?   \n   \nThanx,   \nRen\n\n",
