      "content": "Just to state the obvious, part of the reason there's so much skepticism is due to the connector positions. This would have to be a very involved OpenType font to simulate the \"random\" connectors found in your sample. For example, the \"on\" combination connects up top, the \"su\" a bit lower, the \"an\" quite tight and lower still, and the \"co\" and \"cy\" connections are also at different levels. When drawing a script type the connectors are always drawn to a grid, at the same level, so that any character combination will \"fit.\" Some OpenType fonts will have substitutions to create the illustion of randomness, but this sample is just too random to believe that it's a font. It has nothing to do with how \"casual\" the characters look, it's how they fit together that leads to the conclusion that this is actually handwriting.\n\n"

I think it looks an awful lot like a font called [Desyrel](http://web.archive.org/web/20130607090527/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg3.html) (forth row down). It is by Dana Rice and can be found with the [Apostrophic Lab fonts at TypOasis](http://web.archive.org/web/20130607090527/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/a_d.htm).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
