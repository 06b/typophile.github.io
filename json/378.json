  "content": "THE FONT BUREAU announces the retail release of Amplitude, an extensive new sans serif series for text and display inspired by functional type seen every day in phone books and newspapers. Ink wells carved out of the juncture of strokes give it a distinctive appearance in headlines while compensating for ink spread at small sizes. Amplitude offers an appropriate solution for nearly any corporate or publication design problem. Weighing in at 35 styles, with 7 weights in 5 widths, it is one of Font Bureau's largest and most flexible families.   \n   \n [http://www.fontbureau.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819033923/http:/www.fontbureau.com/)   \n   \nFor a press kit or more information, please email [info@fontbureau.com](mailto:info@fontbureau.com)   \nor call Harry Parker or Robb Ogle at 617 423 8770.\n\n",
