  "content": "Hi,\n\nSomeone sent me this for an ID and I have run out of ideas. I thought it looked familiar, but I can't place it. The y and w are quite distinctive, and even the D seems a bit oddly shaped. In some respects it looks a bit like a customized Optima, but what do you all think?\n\nThanks,  \n- Mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701114057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AdeleRyan_6319.gif)\n\n",
