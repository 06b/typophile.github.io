The best I've found so far is [Saarikari](http://web.archive.org/web/20120622134209/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/testpilot/saarikari/regular/), which at about NZ$180 isn't too unreasonable, and has that nice pseudo-monospaced feel, and handles pretty well at smaller sizes.\n\nIf anyone had any suggestions for something else that might be in the vein of what I'm after I'd love to hear them.\n\nThanks very much!\n\n",

      "content": "I did see the link (and I know what you meant by \"pseudo-monospaced\"). Courier has so many idiosyncracies that you can't evoke it and stay reasonably readable. It's monoline, its serifs look like stems, but most of all it's monospaced. Being monospaced is a curse in terms of readability; pretending to be monospaced is just diluting that curse. Is it possible to dilute it enough? Maybe, but I highly doubt it. I think when you dilute it enough you've already gone way beyond looking monospaced at all. Probably because readability is in a different ballpark than conscious evaluation. And I haven't even elaborated on it being monoline and having ridiculous serifs.\n\nCourier is simply not something to emulate for extended reading, no  \nmatter how much it might appeal to a certain ideology or aesthetic.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Something _slightly_ removed from the serifs/sans-serifs generally used for body copy.\n\n"
