The first Dr. Peter Karow Award was  \npresented to Dr. Peter Karow himself at the third DTL FontMaster  \nConference at Castle Maurick in 2003. So, in this case it took  \nactually an extra year before the jury (Dr. Peter Karow, Dr. Jürgen  \nWillrodt, Peter Rosenfeld and Frank E. Blokland [chairman]) came to an  \nunanimous decision for the second award.\n\nThomas Milo and his company DecoType developed with ACE, which is an  \nacronym for ’Arabic Calligraphic Engine’, new advanced technology for  \nArabic text setting, which needs a far more sophisticated approach  \nthan for instance the Latin script, based on a thorough analysis of  \nthe Arabic script. Not only served Milo’s typographic research as the  \nfundament for the ACE technology, clearly it also formed a basis for  \nthe development of the OpenType format, although this is a less known  \nand acknowledged fact.\n\nFor more information and to give your own congratulations: [http://typophile.com/node/63486](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103122011/http:/typophile.com/node/63486 \"http://typophile.com/node/63486\")\n\n",
