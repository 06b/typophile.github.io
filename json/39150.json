  "content": "Hello Everyone.\n\nI am webmaster of an association’s website that hosts scanned images of vintage books on calligraphy and penmanship: [http://www.iampeth.com/books.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192224/http:/www.iampeth.com/books.htm \"http://www.iampeth.com/books.htm\")\n\nToday I was contacted by a typographer that would like to create a couple of fonts from some images on our website, that were originally published in a book:\n\n[http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis\\_pen\\_art/dennis\\_pen\\_art\\_page27.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192224/http:/www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page27.html \"http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis\\_pen\\_art/dennis\\_pen\\_art\\_page27.html\")  \n [http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis\\_pen\\_art/dennis\\_pen\\_art\\_page28.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192224/http:/www.iampeth.com/books/dennis_pen_art/dennis_pen_art_page28.html \"http://www.iampeth.com/books/dennis\\_pen\\_art/dennis\\_pen\\_art\\_page28.html\")\n\nThe artwork in the book was created by W.E. Dennis, and published in 1914 by the A.N. Palmer Company.\n\nIf we agree to provide high-resolution scans of these pages to aid this typographer in his creation, could IAMPETH (the owner of the website) be liable at all? Would we be violating any type of copyright laws?\n\nI would be very grateful for any advice you could offer.\n\nTrying to do the right thing,\n\nJames Ivey  \nDallas, Texas\n\n [‹ Is typophilia dangerous?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192224/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39136 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Moving to Europe (likely Athens) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192224/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38990 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Since we (IAMPETH) don’t own the copyright for the book or the artwork, it didn’t even occur to me to consider terms of use.\n\nI guess part of the dilemna is, since we don’t own the copyrights, is it even our permission to give?\n\nIf he (the typographer) were breaking any laws by creating and selling the font, would we (IAMPETH) be getting ourselves into hot water by providing the scans? kind of like “aiding and abetting” a law-breaker... that kind of thing.\n\n"

We’ve got the original book, and he needs high-res images to start creating his font.

I’m ready to go for it, but we’ve got cooler heads than mine that are expressing concern.\n\n"
