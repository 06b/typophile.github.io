  "content": "Hello everyone… I know that the \"what printer should I buy for typeface proofing\" question has been done to death over and over on Typophile, so I will try to keep my question really specific.\n\nI'm about to buy a laser printer in Berlin. I've narrowed my search down to two possibilities: the HP LaserJet 1022 and the HP LaserJet P2015.\n\nIn England, I've inherited an 1022, but I don't have it with me when I am in Germany, and I will be leaving it in Reading (hello Reading MATD class of 2008–2009!) when I relocate back to Germany for good at the end of September. The 1022 is nice, but it doesn't render outlines 100% perfectly. It is close though.\n\nSo I need to buy a printer for the longer haul. I can easily afford another 1022, but the twice-as-expensive P2015 (300 euro vs. 130 euro) looks good as well. I don't care about printing speed, since I only proof a few pages at a time. Both printers print 1200 x 1200 dpi. But if I can get better (really) outline rendition on 12 point type, the price increase of the P2015 would be worth it, I think.\n\nDoes anyone here use the P2015? Would you recommend it? Thanks!\n\nP.S.: At Linotype, I used a P3005, which I just love, love, love! If I can find one in my price range, I'd probably buy it instead. But this isn't really my question.\n\n",

I had heard some good things about real PostScript Xeroxes, but online, I could only find a single b/w Xerox Phaser in my price range, and just had PostScript 3 emulation. I could get a big Ricoh, but only if I had it shipped from the US. That would surely take too long, and I'd have to pay import duties as well, which in my experience seem to average about 20% of the cost. I couldn't find any Xantes in country either.\n\nSince I'm proofing unhinted type, I think that I'll be allright for now. I've had good experiences with the HP 3005, so I have my fingers crossed.

Direct to plate prepress has killed the market, The only people on the planet who want Linotronic photo paper output are type designers like us and we are all too broke and too few to be worth the effort. :-)\n\nI find the lightweight settings on laser printers just reduces the density of toner applied giving you the appearance of lighter weight but not really accurate enough to help you refine a typeface at text sizes or smaller.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

AFAIK there's something else that causes more or less toner to amass on the drum, in effect making the \"silhouettes\" fatter or thinner.

You can see general printing ability and rendering of pixel images but type design needs to see how a printer pours pixels into a bezier outline--how does it choose to deal with rounding, how much hinting affects the output, how it interprets PostScript, how much toner spread it generates, etc.. At large sizes, this is less of an issue but at text sizes, it can be quite significant.  \nI even notice a difference using the same printer and type if it comes from the originating app like InD or from a PDF generated from it. Oddly enough, even Adobe products like InD and PDF don't always match when printed to a laser printer. I don't know if this is do to PostScript interpreter, the operating system rendering, or differences in the way each software sends to the rendering device.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
