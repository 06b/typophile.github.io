It's got some similarities to a bunch of chancery typefaces. The show used a drop shadow variant but a non-shadow version would do me just fine.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DangerBay.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419133633/http:/typophile.com/files/DangerBay.jpg) | 17.43 KB |\n| [DangerBay-Drop.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419133633/http:/typophile.com/files/DangerBay-Drop.jpg) | 15.52 KB |\n\n",
