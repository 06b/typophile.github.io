It’s changing all single quotes, double quotes, apostrophes, en dashes and em dashes to various other glyphs.\n\nThe text is set in TNR in the Word doc and I’m applying a paragraph style set with Californian. I end up having to do a Find/Replace with every import.\n\nDoes anyone know how to solve this issue?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217131123im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/glyph_Issues_6630.jpg)\n\n [‹ Type and Environment / Local Community](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217131123/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37436 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for resources on font: Romane ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217131123/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37922 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

With past versions of InDesign I was able to import Word docs and apply paragraph styles without losing bold or italic formatting and without having to deal with the glyph conversions.\n\nMiguel, saving as RTF worked, but I fear the idea of having to do this with all Word docs. I work at a magazine where stories are all saved as Word documents.\n\nGus, The TNR is TrueType. And I’m applying the styles in Word. I could apply Californian to the Word document I guess. But doing so would be time consuming given the volume of stories.\n\nEveryone, Thanks for your help.\n\n"
