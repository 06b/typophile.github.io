We are confident that the forthcoming conference will provide an excellent opportunity for typographic professionals, experts and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, establish collaborations, and present the results of their research and creative work, to share their views and ideas of the shorter- and longer-term developments in the industry, to take a long, hard look at its past and present, and to peer into the crystal ball trying to see its future.\n\n**Time and place**\n\n_ATypI’o8_ is to take place from 17 to 21 September in St. Petersburg, Russia. _TypeTech_ technical workshops will be held on 17 and 18 September. The main conference will open with an event on the evening of 18 September, with sessions running from 19 through 21 September.\n\n**Theme**\n\nThe theme of the conference is _The Old · The New_. This topic is perennially relevant to the creative work of the communication designer, and especially important in our times of rapid advancement of communication technologies. Addressing the many issues and challenges of _The New_, as well as its complex relationship with _The Old_—at different levels: psychological, intellectual, methodological, practical, &c.—may provide for a better understanding of the direction in which we as a community are moving, and for the creation of a professional agenda adequate to the challenges of the day.\n\nFor more information on the conference visit the _ATypI’o8_ [home page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314100634/http:/atypi.org/05_Petersburg).\n\n**Audience**\n\nMost conference attendees are involved in the craft, business, or technology of type design and typography. They include managers, software engineers, program managers, type and graphic designers, Web and information designers, educators, lettering artists, enthusiasts and connoisseurs of typography, and anyone involved in creating or using type.\n\nOur audience is very interested in the design and manufacture of type, the practice of typography, all forms of calligraphy and lettering, the technology of printing and reading, graphic design in its many forms, and everything to do with typographic communications.\n\n**Sessions**\n\n_ATypI’o8_ may run more than one concurrent session, to maximise the value provided. Meeting formats may vary, to provide for a mix of lecture, demonstration, and discussion, and to support different learning styles. They may include keynote presentations, workshops/tutorials, technical demonstrations, panel discussions, and round tables.\n\n<dt><em>TypeTech Forum</em></dt><dd>Wednesday, 17–Thursday, 18 September 2008</dd>\n\nThe ATypI’o8 _TypeTech Forum_ committee invites submissions of abstracts for presentations on any theme related to technology in type design and typesetting. As in 2007, there will be no separate introductory section this year; potential presenters should assume that their audience is versed in the basics of type technology, such as Unicode and OpenType.\n\nProposals are welcome for practical demonstrations as well as lectures and panel sessions. Preference will be given to talks which have not been done before at _TypeTech Forum_ or ATypI.\n\nAppropriate topics could include, but should not be limited to:\n\n- New methods in typeface design and production; \n- Approaches to testing fonts; \n- Issues and solutions for font development; \n- New technologies in typesetting. \n<dt> <em>Main Conference</em>\n</dt><dd>Friday, 19–Sunday, 21 September 2008</dd>\n\nAll topics of theory, practice and history of typographic communications are welcome. Special emphasis should be given to those topics that help develop the conference theme of _The Old · The New_.\n\nTopics could include, but should not be limited to:\n\n- Typography and type design: tradition and innovation; \n- Typeface revivals: _déjà vu_? \n- How does the development of communication technologies affect the relationship of typography and writing? \n- From voice messaging to text messaging: typographic newspeak; \n- Reforming writing / reforming typography: innovation by decree? \n- Polyglot typography: from the Rosetta Stone to the World Wide Web; \n- Methods of multi-script type design; \n- International style and national authenticity. \n\n**Publication**\n\nIf your paper is accepted, we will include your proposal in the conference programme. We will publish your biography and paper details on the _ATypI’o8_ Web site and include the same information in the printed programme that will be distributed to all attendees upon their check-in. We strongly encourage you to send us your slides or other visual material in advance so that we can also include them, with all required copyright notices, on the conference CD/memory stick, which will be given out to participants at the start of the event.\n\n**Conference language**\n\nThe ATypI official language is International English. All submissions, papers and presentations should be provided in English. Interpretation from/to Russian may be provided for selected talks.\n\n**Submission**\n\nA submission must contain a title and an abstract of the proposed presentation (100 words maximum), and a speaker’s biography (100 words maximum).\n\nTo submit a proposal, [download and fill out the form](http://web.archive.org/web/20080314100634/http:/www.atypi.org/05_Petersburg/60_call_for_papers/ATypI2008_Call2_Form.pdf).
