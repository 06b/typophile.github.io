      "content": "1) As previously said, very generic, nothing really specific. Suggestions by Alex look fine to me.  \n2) sorry, don't understand what you want exactly... Do you mean \"Bond Street\"? Because I wasn't able to spot any \"Brook Street\" lettering anywhere... For the rest, Smythson identity has been designed by [Saturday](http://web.archive.org/web/20140925100328/http:/saturday-london.com/category/clients/smythson/). They may use some bespoke typeface for all their materials. On their website, thery're using [Brandon Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20140925100328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque/) and [Electra Display](http://web.archive.org/web/20140925100328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/electra/) but I suppose it's not the one you're after.  \nFor the rest, can't get out of my head that main woodmark SMYTHSON could be easily done starting with some [Futura Extra Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20140925100328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh/xlight/) manually extending differently each letter.
