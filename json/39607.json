Of course, I was only alive for 1979, so I don’t really know what to change to get away from that 1970s feel, unless its just a color thing.\n\nAnd don’t nick me for the stolen sheep dancing across the top; that was _not_ my idea.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025845im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BuildingCodes_Cover_6539.png)\n\n",

      "content": "What about less restraint on the typesize? I think you could get away with enlarging those bars with the type in it quite a bit. That way the type, instead of the orange background, takes the leading role.\n\nThe 1970's feel is probably because of the colors. To me it doesn't really feel 1970's, but I wouldn't really know either because I'm from after 1980. But brown and orange was their thing, right? ;)\n\n"

      "content": "My question would be, why red and orange anyway? Whether or not that's a \"70's\" look, it's a pretty harsh combo, and reminds me for of fast food than anything.\n\nI'd think Greens and Blues would be a better palette to work from, especially since the content (assuming) is more of a guide to the less than exciting world of building to code and the use of permits...\n\nAlways thought the organized cutting mat grid was a nice touch for topics that require a more linear approach of thinking (which is usually a foreign thing for creative types.)\n\nAnd I like Jelmar's suggestion, it does seem like the text is floating in a sea of orange...\n\n"

      "content": "It does seem to be those bars that's giving it a bit of the 70s look. Remember those stripes they used to have in racing cars?\n\nI think it's a good suggestion to be less rigid with the type, does it really have to be all caps?\n\nBeyond that, I wonder if the design really connects with the content of the book. I'm not sure what the particular constraints of the project are, but it looks a little generic from here. Some sort of content cues may help.\n\nIt could be an idea to break the page into two background bands of white and orange to give it a greater sense of structure.\n\n"
