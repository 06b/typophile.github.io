  "content": "I've been taking graphic design at Parsons and want to apply for a masters, preferably in the NY area. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions regarding the MFA graphic design programs at Pratt, Yale, and SVA? (and any other schools you would recommend.) How are the teachers? Is the program more theoretical or is it practical? What are the students like (supportive? nasty? drugged out?...etc)? And does the school have a good hit ratio in the job market? Any help greatly appreciated!!!!!\n\n",
