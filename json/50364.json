  "content": "I'm working on a logo for a company that currently does embroidery promotional gifts (caps, T-shirts etc.). Right now their logo is second to non existing. They want to have one. I was playing a bit with the idea and came up with a few. Three of them are presented in the PDF. If you could comment on them.\n\nSo the logo should reflect professional promotional gift producing company that may handle complicated custom made works. Since I know them personally I know they are very dedicated and very accurate at their work. So their products are really fine produced.\n\nBTW. Name as in logo #1 hides a word \"stitch\" (in our language), their original line of work. That's why I was thinking not to go completely into embroidery symbol since the name implies on it already. And I know that the end result will contain at least three basic colours (red, blue and yellow).\n\nI would like to know which of these is worth pursuing if any at all. And if they also maybe remind you of any other logo.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Logo Preliminary 1 (09.10.08).pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818111409/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo%20Preliminary%201%20(09.10.08).pdf) | 16.19 KB |\n| [Logo Preliminary 2 (14.10.08).pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818111409/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo%20Preliminary%202%20(14.10.08).pdf) | 4.15 KB |\n| [Stationery I (17.10.08).pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818111409/http:/typophile.com/files/Stationery%20I%20(17.10.08).pdf) | 34.23 KB |\n\n",

From the versions of 1, which I would like to see with your thoughts of colour if it is to have the red, blue and yellow, I can see a, possibly too obvious, play on stitch and hyphen but I don't get a complicated, passionate, detailed approach, maybe seen with product(s) or in a context with them it could work in the way a simple versus complex juxtaposition. Of the three I would pursue the first to develop with the aim of refinement but also to see if anything else strikes you in that direction.\n\nTim\n\n"
