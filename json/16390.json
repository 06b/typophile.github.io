(Obviously, since it's a prison tattoo, it's definitely hand-lettered!!!) But perhaps you could suggest something that's reasonably close to it. Perhaps some of you forum members who are currently behind bars might have a unique insight!  \nThanks, DK~\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100312102239im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tattoo.jpg)\n\n",

The beauty of these pieces are that the flourishes are integrated within the characters and words used, which is virtually impossible to create using a type font.\n\nYou can get close using the swirly [ITC Edwardian Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20100312102239/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-edwardian-script/edwardian-scr-itc/index.html).\n\n"
