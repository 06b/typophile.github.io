It is also deeply rooted in [Bauhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701133546/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus) (or [Pump](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701133546/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/pump)). To me, it's either a freebie or a complete custom job based on the same /o shape (mainly no optical correction):  \n- /t = /o half bottom + 2 strokes  \n- /a = cut /o + 1 stroke  \n- /n = /o half top + 2 strokes  \n- /g = /o + (/o half bottom + 1 stroke)  \n- /e = cut /o + 1 stroke  \n- /d = /o + 1 stroke\n\n"
