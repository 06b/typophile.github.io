I am open to any suggestions! Thanks so much guys and have a great one!\n\n[http://luc.devroye.org/FabianDelange-Eclectic-2011.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417081918/http:/luc.devroye.org/FabianDelange-Eclectic-2011.jpg \"http://luc.devroye.org/FabianDelange-Eclectic-2011.jpg\")  \n [http://freetypography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/electic.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417081918/http:/freetypography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/electic.jpg \"http://freetypography.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/electic.jpg\")\n\n",
