I’m trying to mach their sequence on each font of the familly. How can i use the same table throughout the entire familly, when i allready have all the fonts created?\n\nRegards\n\n [‹ FontLab question](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828095544/http:/typophile.com/node/47940 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font display problems Adobe / PC apps. ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828095544/http:/typophile.com/node/47907 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Thanks for reply.\n\nI tried drag them around a bit, but it was a little difficult to control.\n\nI will try to save my encoding as you suggest and apply it to the other fonts as well. I guess i could save it from the toolbar glyph menu , but I’ll have to figure out were to import it next.\n\nBest\n\n"

Just type the names of the glyphs in the order yu want them, and they will appear in FontLab that way.\n"

I presume it will be saved in the location you mentioned.  \nSo then i will have my encoding available as the default encoding? I thought it would apear as imported encoding, not the default... But I will try it and see how it goes.\n\nThanks for reply  \nBest\n\n"

This was just to show in which menu your encoding will show up .)\n\nName your encoding to what you want it to be called, and then look for that name in the drop down menu as shown above.\n\nWhen you save your encoding, make sure it is saved in the right folder and also give it a proper name when saving it.\n\n"
