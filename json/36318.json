  "content": "OK, this can’t be that difficult...\n\nIt looks like a simple san-serif, but for some reason, I am having a DICKENS of a time trying to ID it EXACTLY. So many fonts (like Avenir) come close...but I am looking for something with the same perfect roundness and symmetry in the O’s and the lower e’s. Even the counters within the p’s and d’s look like circles, and aren’t off-center, elongated, or squashed. The descenders and ascenders aren’t super tall, either.\n\nCan anyone help??\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080614010816im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/SP_A0052_5024.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080614010816im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/SP_A0037_5191.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Psychedelic \"Fillmore\" on 60s San Francisco poster - custom drawn {Nick Curtis}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080614010816/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36346 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Serif face w/ nice ligatures - Mrs. Eaves {Jelmar Geertsma} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080614010816/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36344 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
