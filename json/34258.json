  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI've been working off and on for months on a new identity for my company. I'm a web designer/developer, and I also do branding and usability work. Not much print work. Maybe 10% of my clients request logo work.\n\nThe work below was inspired a bit by some logos from the fashion industry. I want something more 'iconic'--that's based on my name--that isn't just a standard font treatment.\n\nI want to up the sophistication level of my image and not go the standard \"web 2.0 route\" that seems so popular these days amongst my web design colleagues. In other words, I want a long lasting mark that can carry over to other companies I might start that also will have my name on them.\n\nI took the font named Dinamo Regular and used it to create the icon you see below. I've also included what the standard letters from Dinamo look like that I used. It's However, my sense is that my finesse and execution is off. I'm unsure at this point as to how to make it better. Here's what I'm looking for help with:\n\n1. insight or opinions on how I might make the icon itself better  \n2. Thoughts about using Granby Light (the display font you see) along with it.  \n3. Thoughts about the layout of the logo OVER the company name, as opposed to another position, etc.\n\nI greatly appreciate any help in advance. I'm definitely more big picture designer than I am strong in typography and icons, but I'm trying to improve.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110524040549im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dbr-logo-1_5543.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110524040549im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dbr-component-1_3735.gif)\n\n",

I suppose I worry about that being a little less memorable. What are the pros that you see in using that kind of approach? That lowercase r does make for a nice mark :)\n\n"

I always found the Nike swoosh story endearing. And I need to remember that the logo is not the be all and end all. Nike's brand is strong today not because of the swoosh, but because of everything else. The swoosh is just an immediate way to identify it.\n\nThank you again. Most appreciated.\n\n"

Flip it, and you've got a j. I've tried, for a LONG time, to find a mark that could somehow represent us both. He disliked what I would do, and I dislike the ones he created.\n\nYet..now we have a J and and R. I could keep it just that simple r, or I could try to play around to represent the J, too...though really it accomplishes both. Astute clients may realize this, but it doesn't require them to realize it to be a strong mark.\n\nI got that font for its \"s\", actually. But now...the r may very well have saved me. Thank you again. truly.\n\n"

The majority of my target market is going to be American...but I'm going to look into the campaign you reference as well as run this by a few Canadian friends of mine to see if they have similar reactions.\n\n\"An accident.\" Really good points about the web 2.0 aspect. Last night, I tried one out with the font \"Priori (San)\" (LOVE that one) for the title part. I've included it below in a couple of variations, as well as two versions with \"Mrs. Eaves.\" I think I like the 4th one down best, because the lowercase \"d\" in it has some similarities to how the \"r\" is handled. Priori or Mrs. Eaves might help give it a bit more of a classical feel versus all bubbly/high techy.\n\nAlthough I like the centering of the bottom one, centering like that can be tough to work with at times.\n\nI appreciate your insights. I've gotten to the point where I don't take criticism personally much--the only way my work will improve is if others help me see the weaknesses or potential problems in it as well as bring up potential \"associations\" like Kristina did.

Why don't you play with both in separate shapes, instead of combining them in one symbol? For starters, you can use them to frame something else. Just an example, I'm sure you can come up with something better :)\n\n"

One of the things I've enjoyed about posting this here is the brainstorming it's helped me do. I have a hard time with sketching/coming up with concepts. Sometimes other's ideas help trigger new ideas in my brain. I wish I had a few outsourcers or employees who I could brainstorm with all the time! :)\n\n"
