  "content": "My apologies for being somewhat off topic, but i urgently need the separation values for Pantone 186 C, since the Pantone Process Guide is nowhere to be found in the studio :-(  \nYour help is very much appreciated, we’re going in print on monday morning…\n\nP.S. Just found C0, M100, Y100, K10 as the appropriate value on the web, and could of course make up my own, but my gut feeling tells me there’s got to be Cyan involved? I want to double check with the Guide as I’m sure you’ll understand… Many many thanks in advance.\n\n",

Or Adobe InDesign, or QuarkXPress? Because their color palettes will allow you to select a Pantone color and then break it up into CMYK values... And the results will be true blue! (Pardon the pun... I couldn’t help myself.)\n\n"

It’s good to know there’s a place with a lot of helpful people aound like this, in case things get rough. Thank you all.\n\n"
