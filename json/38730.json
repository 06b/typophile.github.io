  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m starting thinking my question are boring but I’m curious and new in the (fantastic) world of typography.\n\nSo, my last question concerned the choose of a typeface for a novel book body. Now I’m asking how much the ligatures are important in a book.\n\nCan ligatures influence the choose of a font?  \nI just found the font “Esta” (“Esta ligatures”) with a large number of ligatures (e.g. for s+h, s+t, s+k, f+r, f+y etc. etc. etc.).\n\nDo you know other typefaces with similar range of ligatures, suitable for a novel book body?\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ starting a font type project](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203174509/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38841 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [So who lined up outside the Google store this morning to be first in line for a Google Phone? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203174509/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38816 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "The most important thing about a font is not if it has ligatures or not. If it does have them then you aught to ask - is this better than not having them - eg is this an improvement? And if it doesn’t, does it suffer from not having them? There are plenty of fonts that have poorly designed ligatures so having ligatures and even larger numbers of ligatures are not a mark of quality per se. Quality has to do with if the font supports reading - this applies to the ligatures as much as any other aspect. Learning which fonts support reading & which ones don’t can take time. The other relevant question has to do with the tone struck by the font when set in text. Of course a good fit with the paper to be used in the book is an issue too.\n\n"

I agree with Eben, ligatures do not improve legibility/readability per se. It’s just that some faces actually need them to set properly, some don’t (which in return doesn’t make either better than the other, per se). To me Ligatures just seem to be a bit of an overestimated topic as of late. Like Eben, i’d choose a typeface rather going by things like content, style, tone/color, and yes, sometimes by era. If you’ve come that far, then you can still look if the font actually includes all the ligatures you might need and if thery’re well drawn. To me giving the sheer number of ligatures first priority in chosing a typeface is like bying a car just because it features an ashtray while others don’t.\n\n"

But I’d avoid the st, ct etc. ligatures, which draw too much attention to themselves in body copy (at least today; maybe four hundred years ago readers were used to them). Many typefaces, however, are designed such that ligatures aren’t required; in such cases, an fi ligature, for instance would look silly (e.g. Trump Mediaeval).\n\n"

Not emphatically, but gently. Using a rule of thumb rather than looking & deciding on a case by case basis may work most of the time but it’s not ideal.\n\nThe goodness or badness of a ligature for text is always on the same basis - ’does it solve a problem in a way that supports reading’. BTW some classic ’st’ & ’ct’ ligs I have seen are quite thin and don’t distract too much. And actually they may have even supported reading. Where as ’st’ & ’ct’ ligs that were made after they fell from common use were I think made for a different reason - to attract attention & look old. My guess is that the different motivation resulted in a showy presentation - and so they are not good for reading. But they were probably good for making a sign look ’old’ - maybe. Also, depending on the design you might get a nice sy lig for instance. Keep in mind too - just because it hasn’t been done doesn’t mean that it cannot be done.\n\nThere is also such a thing as a Spontaneous Ligature - where letters are allowed to overlap but retain their basic design. I know Verdana has at least one.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with your statement ’does it solve a problem in a way that supports reading’. And what I meant before, I don’t think ct/st/etc ligs are _important_ for book body type (which was the original question), you don’t _need_ them for legibility. At least not as much as some of the other ligatures; c and t do not collide into each other, and they are perfectly legible on their own. A loop between those letters, no matter how thin, attract (my) attention. :)\n\nI’ve read a book a while ago set in a Garamond-like typeface which for some reason had ligatures turned off (I guess), and the f collided with the b, h and other f’s, and it was really distracting in my opinion. I think it was so apparent, that even non-typophiles would see it.\n\nBut I guess if you look at it on a case by case basis, there might be occasions where more different ligatures are appropriate. But I still think that such a decision would probably be made on a stylistic basis (to make something ’look old’ or ’luxurious’) rather than for legibility. But maybe I’m wrong. I haven’t read any studies about ligatures in long text, if there are any. :)\n\n"

Generally designers make the connecting loop to round or large and this bothers me both as someone reading and a designer.
