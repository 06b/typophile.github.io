  "content": "If you were building the ultimate font management software what features would you add?\n\nMy suggestions will be based on Extensis Suitcase for Windows, the \"Missing Features\" and design changes:\n\n•I love the simplistic approach Suitcase takes, but it's missing features that seem apparent to me? Such as, Drag and Drop file management, in the key of iTunes. It creates a data base/file management system without me having to keep up with it.\n\n•To be able to maintain rich data about the fonts I use, including Foundry, Style and Family and any other information that I'd find useful for finding and using my fonts. I could sort through on demand by columns such as name, styles, weights, foundry, designer, category or whatever. Such as sorting all the sans serif fonts by simply clicking a tab/column that would make life so much easier.\n\n•A quick \"Mix\" feature using keywords or drag and drop to create \"Sets\". Just like iTunes.\n\n•A character counter for quick viewing and a detailed pop-out character map. Since the advent of OpenType, Character maps can get up into the 1000s for a single font, it would be nice to see all of those characters before activating a font.\n\n•Font Management should appear easy, I feel as if I do a lot of \"maintenance\" outside of the software and that should be the softwares job.\n\nI'd like to hear what some of your thoughts are for features you'd like to see.\n\n",

Regardless, I think a lot of the \"font management\" apps out there don't actually give much help in the way of managing one's fonts.\n\nExample: I collect fonts piecemeal. I try to organize them into folders on my hard drive based on Foundry, and then add them to Suitcase creating Sets based on that font;s Style. It's a laborious process that If I would accidentally delete a set, I'm pretty much screwed till I find the time to \"re-manage\" my font collection.\n\nIf the actual software keep track of my fonts for me, this wouldn't be much of an issue, and then if I could set-up a keywords/tags for specific fonts to help me find them faster, that would be another piece in the management issue I have with Suitcase.\n\nIn essence, Suitcase isn't a font management application, it's a font activation tool and that's about it's limits.\n\n"

The software is just there for activating fonts, but when it comes to actually managing the fonts I usually just use spotlight to grab a file by name and fire it up, as opposed to the old method of just dumping every single font into a management app and dealing with them all that way. I don't really do much with sets; most of the sets I've set up only became sets because FontExplorer does it automatically when I add families, it isn't something I need to do on my own. As for type previews, I don't find myself using that feature very often because just seeing the words set in FontExplorer is usually too detached from context to be especially helpful.\n\n"

The new Suitcase for Windows implements the same Font Sense technology from Suitcase Fusion. When a font is added to the database, a unique identifier is created based on several values within the font. It's similar to a checksum. During auto-activation, this can be used to distinguish between different fonts of the same name.\n\nThe other advantage of Font Sense is that it could be used to match up metadata. I wish Suitcase had a good way to import/export metadata. I think I want everything filip blazek lists. Lots of metadata-- the ability to sort and group by metadata--and the ability to share it.\n\nA related feature that I consider critical is the ability to back up data. There's no point creating a bunch of sets and adding metadata if I don't have the ability to back up this effort or migrate it to a new system. I probably replace my laptop every 18 months. I back it up once a month. If my current hd dies, I know that I can restore my setup. On Suitcase for Windows, this can now be accomplished by restoring the Vault to the same relative location. However, I consider it a necessary feature for any font manager.\n\nIn the professional publishing world, some of these features are accomodated by client/server font management solutions like Font Reserve Server.\n\n"

This would be especially helpful in terms of migrating data across multiple computer if you don't have a server system. Like in a school computer lab, everyone uses the same fonts, why can't they create a \"default\" group of sets and port them to all the computers that might not be setup on a server.\n\n<cite> In the professional publishing world, some of these features are accommodated by client/server font management solutions like Font Reserve Server.</cite>\n\nIdealistic, but not practical for the single user.\n\n"

I honestly don't understand anyone who sees Font Explorer or Suitcase as just an activation tool, that is a limited use of a sophisticated application (altho I will point out that Andrew is using windows). As a designer I really rely on the sets I've set up as a starting point. I want to use a sans but am tired of falling back on TheSans or Scala so I browse thru my sans et voila, Abadi.

My complaint isn't the ability to set these up, but that \"I\" have to set them up and maintain them, and if for some reason I delete said sets, I don't have them backed up anywhere and would essentially have to recommit the time and effort that I already committed to setting up new sets. In my eyes, that's not font management. It's a lot of work for a small part of the design process (no offense to the part fonts play in design, just the tool to get the fonts into the process.)\n\nAnd I am on a Windows system, which I've noted before has been shunned against by Extensis. I'm no dummy I can see all the great features available in Suitcase Fusion for Mac. Why can't I have those same features in my Windows version?\n\n"

As I said above, tho, more sophisticated tagging - i.e. that didn't require manual maintenance from the user - would require the foundries themselves to tag the fonts and it probably wouldn't be retroactive anyway to the fonts you already own. I don't see how you can expect a font management tool to instinctively \"know\" how to organize your fonts. I think categorizing your fonts is NOT a small part of the design process. It's a time commitment up front, when you first load the fonts in, but not a lot of work to maintain and update as you add new fonts. And if you don't delete them, there's no problem.\n\nYes it's nice that in iTunes a lot of the songs come already tagged by genre but personally I end up labeling them quite often myself.\n\nPersonally I prefer the option of making my own categories anyway.\n\n"
