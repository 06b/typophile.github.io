  "content": "Hi typophiles! I've been looking frantically for this font. A printer told me it is an old letterpress font used several decades ago. I'm very keen to get my hands on the digital equivalent.\n\nIt seems like a fixed-width sans. It reminds me of the typeface used for embossing serial numbers in metal plates.\n\nHope you guys can help me out.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142855/http:/typophile.com/files/font_48.gif) | 5.12 KB |\n\n",
