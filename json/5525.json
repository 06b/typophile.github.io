For a while I only saw a truncated \"E\" until the other half from the Z came into focus.   \n   \nI wonder if there is a way to make another suggestion in the upper left serif of the E.

Its not the logo that will make or break the company, its the product they offer. Who knows in two years they might move from that location and the pyramid icon will be lost as an idenity\n\n"

On the beginning I was thinking about something more inscriptional as well, but realized that the roman letter little to do with egypt so I tried to make it stand for elegance and refinement and as a vague reference to the napoleonic campaign on Egypt and the french XIX century by the modern style. This may be historically imprecise but so would have been using inscriptional romans.   \n   \nHowever I used Quadraat Sans spaced bold caps on display texts.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107234329im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41472.jpg)   \n   \nFinally as a comparison I\n\n"
