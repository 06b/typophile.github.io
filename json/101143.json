I can't find the problem on the web.\n\nWhen I copy my glyphs from Illustrator and paste them into FLS the shapes transforms from smooth rounded corners into just cornered. In Illustrator the anchor points is set to smooth. Why do FLS change my anchor points?\n\nMy English is to limited to explain the problem. Please see the attached images.  \nThe black and grey image is in Illustrator and the white image with a black line is in FLS.\n\n/  \nTheapbo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918080125im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Illustrator_CS6_6193.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918080125im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FontLab_Studio_5_4941.png)\n\n",

You need to do some configuration in illustrator first, in order to be compatible.  \n [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOTLwmmrv8s](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918080125/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOTLwmmrv8s \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOTLwmmrv8s\")  \n [http://font.is/fontlab-using-illustrator-to-draw-fonts-for-importing-int...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918080125/http:/font.is/fontlab-using-illustrator-to-draw-fonts-for-importing-into-fontlab/ \"http://font.is/fontlab-using-illustrator-to-draw-fonts-for-importing-into-fontlab/\")\n\n"
