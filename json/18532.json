Although there are comparable American faces which would be more authentic.\n\nWhile drivers look at signage briefly, signs are also a part of the urban environment that exists for everybody. This environment should not be reduced to a utilitarian lowest common denominator under the tyranny of the automobile.\n\nConcerning accident prevention: In the interests of road safety and climate change, it would be a good idea to make city centres pedestrian precincts, ban the manufacture of SUVs and limit all cars to 35 hp per seat.\n\nWith insurance companies leading the way, GPS chips in automobiles will soon be used to monitor the movement of various kinds of vehicle within municipalities, and progressive taxation may also be applied.\n\n"
