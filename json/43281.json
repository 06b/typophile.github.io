  "content": "Hi! I've been on a treasure hunt looking for a font similar to Wendy (see sample). I need a script face that's a little more sophisticated and not so widely used. Because I'm going to be using it all lowercase, it's important that the \"b's\" and \"l's\" have flair. If this helps: the Wendy font is a little too round, or full, and skews towards the children's market. Thanks for your input!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [wendy sample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224091405/http:/typophile.com/files/wendy%20sample.jpg) | 40.59 KB |\n\n",
