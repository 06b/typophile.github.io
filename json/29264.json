      "content": "_\"Looks like Carlos by Jason Castle\"_\n\nThere seem to be a couple of modifications to [Carlos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017130801/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carlos/light-condensed/charmap.html) -- look at the top of the b and the t. Since Carlos and [Casablanca](http://web.archive.org/) are both based on Carlos Winkow's 'Elektra/Electra' and both have a taller 't' and a 'b' with a left-right incline on the top of the stem, this font is a modification of one of them. It also looks like the right legs of the 'h', 'm', and 'n' have extensions below the baseline, compared to the two commercial fonts we identified. (There was also Image Club's 'Arquitectura', as another font based on this design, but it does not match the Epson typeface either).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
