The term is a simplification of \"Bouma-shape\" as used by [Insup Taylor](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Insup%20Taylor) and/or [Paul Saenger](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Saenger), derived from [Herman Bouma](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Herman%20Bouma), a [retired] Dutch scientist.\n\nMost cognitive psychologists reject this hypothesized importance of the bouma in reading, immersive or otherwise. The dominant reading model in cognitive psychology is the parallel letterwise recognition model. Research experiments which would have different predicted outcomes for the two different theories have supported parallel letterwise recognition over the bouma theory.\n\nSee also: [Notan](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Notan), [word shape](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Word%20Shape)\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Bouma as Bounded Map](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/typophile.com/node/15432)\n\n**Additional Articles:**  \n [Wikipedia: Bouma](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923014638/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouma)\n\n",
