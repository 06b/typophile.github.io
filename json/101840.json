[Neuropolitical](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/neuropolitical) matches almost everything but /N and /O are less extended (easy to fix for /O, less for /N). Some more similars (need customization rounding some corners, cutting some finials, extending some crossbars or redrawing some glyphs from others): [Changelling Neo](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/changeling-neo) (bowlers off), [Bitsumishi](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/bitsumishi-pro-v2) (best /O but rest is way off), [Neuropol X](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/neuropol-x) (/O off, cutting some finials), [Pirulen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/pirulen) (nice base but needs many tweakings), [Good Times](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/good-times) (very close but /O off), [Stereo Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/stereo-gothic), [Sui Generis](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719011441/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/sui-generis)\n\n"
