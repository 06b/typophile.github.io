  "content": "I recently had some technical computer problems and pretty much had to reinstall Fontlab… I did save my com.fontlab.fontlab5.plist from a backup on one of my externals but even still I'm slightly paranoid as to if my preferences are set as they should be…\n\nI know I received a few tips in the past for exporting only OpenType PS fonts and it had to do with the name records which was pretty important… not sure if anything else was as important I can intuitively remember most of the other settings… does anyone know for sure any of the preference settings that I should be alerted to, to ensure continued success upon export?\n\nThis time I'm going to take extra precaution and export my preferences to a new backup folder just in case.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nMike\n\n",
