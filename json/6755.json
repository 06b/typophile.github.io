      "content": "I think the combination of strong \"piecemeal\" stems & curves and wedge serifs is cool. The vertical proportions are great for a text face, but since this is more of a display face (at least the weight you're showing here) you might make the ascenders a bit shorter.   \n   \nAs for the glyphs, they all make sense to me so far, so I'd say make the rest and see how it goes. The two things I'd note right now are: the foot serif on the \"r\" should be longer; and the curve-ear join on the \"g\" needs modeling to relieve the clotting (like you already have with the \"n\").   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

When i look it from far, there is a hole beetween r and g.   \nThe ascender is too high, even for a text typeface, in my opinion.\n\n"
