  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m look for a single letter to match a logo. I’m a designer but have never understood the nuances of typography. I’ve also a bit of a passion for cars. My perennial project car is a 99 Porsche Boxster.\n\nI would like to personalize my Porsche Boxster “S” to a Boxster “K”. All Porsches of late (Including mine) have the same distinctive type face for there product name/logo. The type face is incomplete alphabetically. Of all the model names currently available, none have a letter “K”.\n\nAll I’m looking for is the letter “K” in the same vein as the Porches script logos. I can provide 5 or 6 of these logos for reference. I’ve really little to pay for this indulgence, but I do 3d graphics’ and 3d modeling and more (krokodesign.com) and could trade time for time…dunno…\n\nBelow is the type face as used for my car.\n\nLet me know if you can help, Thanks\n\nPK\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202192538im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/porsche-boxster_emblem_5044.jpg)\n\n [‹ B-17 Nose Arts Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202192538/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39049 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Literature on design of Cyrillic Alphabets, anyone? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071202192538/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39054 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In other word, a “K” which appears to come from the same font family.\n\nA complete font family is not available and probably doesn’t exist\n\nRegards, PK\n\n"
