At sizes below twelve points Mrs. Eaves disappears on the page, thanks to it's horribly small x-height. At sizes twelve points and slightly above it looks better, but the spacing is still way off. It's like Licko squashed it and then pulled it apart. It breaks the cardinal rule of typography (praphrasing Eric Gill, or was it Tsichold?) that word/letter spacing must be tight. And a larger x-height makes for far better legibility and readability, too.\n\nPeople are swooning over this typeface, and I really don't understand why. Maybe the ligatures are causing this mysterious suspension of reality. Maybe its distinctive design has overshadowed its shortcomings. Either way, It's a chore to read it. Licko's reasons for these oddities certainly dont justify them. I switch to a good Baskerville or Sabon and I relax, my eyes no longer straining to move over to the next unnecessarily distant letter and word. Did Licko forget to finish the kerning? Jenson seems very similar to Mrs. Eaves in its letterforms, but the spacing is far tighter, the way it should be.\n\nSorry for the rant, but I'm trying to find a reason to like this face as body copy. It just doesn't stand lengthy reading. Oh well. Perhaps someday I'll get my money's worth out of it.\n\n",

You can have a serif font with gorgeous letterforms, but if it fails as body text its value diminishes considerably, at least in my book.\n\nAll obvious stuff, but it's worth mentioning, I think.\n\n"

We should should thank her for that. And I think it's worth metioning that no face Baskerville style face looks quite so happy or perky as Mrs Eaves. Particularly in the ligatures. To me the face has a kind of Californian - or maybe sf/bay area - optimism. Put the font on a package or invitation and you get the subliminal impression that you too can have the happiness that the font radiates. That quality too could be irritating or impressive depending on what your intent is. To me, it explains why graphic designers like the font so much - a built-in optimistic/sensual emotional character. Why people think it looks 'feminine' is beyond me.

The problem is most people are too busy staring at her hair and cleavage to notice she has trouble communicating. You could say that the problem is subvisible, and so escapes general criticism, like how laymen think sans fonts are just as -or even more- \"legible\" (read: readable) than serifs.\n\n\\* The font. I have neither seen a portrait of  \nSarah Eaves nor read about her speech skill.\n\nWhen it comes to reading, a font's various attributes make it suitable for certain sizes. Mrs Eaves has vertical proportions suitable for 14 point at the lowest (and this is why some people will reject it outright as a text face - I personally think a large book, like one placed on a lectern, maintains 14-16 as a possibility for text). Mrs Eaves also has a color (lightish) suitable for sizes slightly above the nominal ideal (~11pt). BUT: its spacing is for sizes around 8! In addition, its spacing is just plain bad - although very few people (not even most typographers) will notice. And it's not an issue of kerning: although Mrs Eaves has deplorable kerning, it would still work much better if its base spacing were decent.\n\n\\> Mrs. Eaves could get a passing grade if they invested some time in spacing\n\nNo, it could be <cite>great</cite> if they did so. And they had a chance, when they released the OT version. Now, there <cite>is</cite> a good reason not to change a font's spacing when you re-release it (some clients will hate the reflow) but there's also a bad reason lurking in the background: hubris. Mrs Eaves's spacing hamartia was heavily discussed early on, and it's possible that fixing the spacing would have been an embarassing admission, and artiste-ic climb-down some people can't manage; these tend to be the same people who cannot tolerate any criticism of their fonts, and generally don't engage in criticisms of the fonts of others: they consider it all sacred Art. Which is of course entirely anti-user.\n\n--\n\nI guess in the end, most people find that being in the  \ncompany of great beauty is worth more than being able to  \nactually understand anything meaningful that beauty says.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Why is that? Does it hold for condensed and expanded forms equally?\n\nIsn't spacing part of what makes up colour? That is, a font only has a certain colour under a certain spacing. Where the spaces between the letters and inside the letters are in synch, in a font such as Mrs. Eaves the typographical result will have an even texture but lightish colour. When the spacing is tighter than that given by the condition in which the whites are in synch, the colour may be darker, but the texture less even. [later edit: added the word \"texture\"]\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131222104057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131222104057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n"

      "content": "\"Do fonts with a small x-height require tight spacing?\"\n\nPeter, to be specific, all the factors Hrant named interact, all the time. The size a face is set at affects the behavior of spacing, and x-height also affects it, differently, at different sizes. There isn't an easy way to pick apart which feature (x-height, stem thickness, serif length, overall spacing) is causing a specific effect. They all affect each other.\n\nI would say colour in a text face is a very imprecise and subjective thing to describe, when other factors such as evenness of spacing, and differentiation of letterforms are so much more crucial to the performance of a face.\n\nHrant has explained this above: Mrs. Eaves has letterforms and proportions which are appropriate for a specific size range, almost exclusively above 14 points. However, it seems to have spacing appropriate for sizes \\*much\\* smaller. This means that at small sizes, where the spacing is more appropriate, the face looks weak and tiny. At sizes where the letterforms hold up, the spacing is blowing apart. There's no size or setting that makes the face really excel, and certainly not for extended text.\n\n"

      "content": "Carl, in my comment about colour I was not defending Mrs. Eaves. I was formulating an observation about the relation of spacing to texture and colour. (This might have been unclear. I originally wrote: _Where the spaces between the letters and inside the letters are in synch in a font such as Mrs. Eaves, the typographical result will have an even texture but lightish colour._ I have now moved the coma so it reads: _Where the spaces between the letters and inside the letters are in synch, in a font such as Mrs. Eaves the typographical result will have an even texture but lightish colour._) [etc.]\n\nI'll try to write a little more about the intent of my question about the relation of vertical proportions to spacing later.\n\n"

      "content": "Peter, I figured you were trying to go beyond Mrs Eaves and into specifics of how the various parameters of a face relate - sorry I was lazy in my previous reply, in fact missing an important aspect:\n\nThose factors I mentioned are certainly not the only ones, and in this case specifically the issue of width comes strongly into play, with a wider font indeed needing more letterspacing, but also with a wider font being better for smaller sizes (so another area where there's an imbalance in Mrs Eaves).\n\nIn terms of x-height, as we know about Latin in general, it's more important to consider that than the point size (although not at the expense of ignoring the weight of the extenders completely). So a font having a wide body (relative to the x-height) is more significant than a font simply having a small x-height. And good letterspacing depends on the proportions and color in the x-height region more than anything else.\n\nWhere vertical proportions as a whole come into play however is in the suitability of a font for a given point size, since extenders play a greater role the deeper you go into immersion (the more you rely on the parafovea). There's of course a limit to how small you should make the x-height, since the fovea will always carry a notable chunk of the weight of reading.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, you're right about my intent.  \nMy purpose was to indicate that a letterform-set with a wide average horizontal dimension relative to the vertical in the x-height area--because of the amount of internal white produced--requires a loose spacing to set properly, so the spacing Licko provided might not be wrong relative to the intrinsic demands of the letterform.\n\nTight spacing is only productive if the design allows it, that is, if the counters are small enough in the horizontal dimension to bear it. Tightening the spacing of a font which is not made for tight spacing leads to other problems. Tight spacing is not a readability value at normal text sizes in itself. Words with tight spacing and compact counters benefit the perceptual integrity of the visual wordform, or as Noordzij might say the \"consolidation of the word\". But there is a discrimination affordance constraint for compact counters at small sizes. These countervailing pressures control the fitness of the face. In general I agree with the assessments about the fitness of the face for various forms of usage described above. It just strikes me as a face with an appeal incommensurate with it's fitness. It is a Bernard Modern in a way.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131222104057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131222104057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n"
