  "content": "I make handmade books. I make the paper and do all the binding by hand. I do not do this professionally, and I have figured out ways around investing in expensive equipment to letter the spines. I need advice on purchasing an inkjet printer so I can print, mostly text and line illustrations, on my handmade paper. I will be printing PDF files, so as I understand it, crisp text will not be a problem with higher-resolution (1200 dpi) printers. I don’t want to use a laser printer because ink lasts longer.\n\nHere are my requirements:\n\n1200 dpi or higher  \nReasonably high-quality text  \nDecent speed (1 or 2 pages a minute is fine)  \nPrints on custom paper sizes up to 11x17 (or 12x18)  \nPrints on art/handmade paper  \nPrints 4-color, though I will mostly be printing black or brown text, and some secondary colors (like red or green)  \nCosts under $500 (but will spend more if someone thinks it is necessary or worth it to do so)\n\nThanks for any advice you can give!\n\n [‹ Page Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145356/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41009 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Helvetica NOW poster contest... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821145356/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41017 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I strongly suspect that you’ll have great difficulty finding any inkjet printer that can handle art/handmade paper (though probably easier than finding a laser printer to do the same). IF you could find one, you’d find that the absorbency characteristics of art/handmade paper would be truly awful for inkjet printing - the bleed would be just enormous.\n\nNow, if you \\*want\\* an overinked letterpress look to your printing, maybe you won’t mind that last point. But I suspect you wouldn’t find the particular style of ink spread very lovable (major “wicking” along fibers of the paper). But in any case I’ll bet you won’t find an inkjet that can physically handle such paper, anyway.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong, and it may very well be that there is/are some specialty inkjets just for this purpose. I just haven’t heard of them.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

If you get a paper that has been treated to work on inkjet the problems Thomas mentions will be minimized if not eliminated. If I tell my rip what paper I’m using and set my profiles right the text is not far off a coated paper.\n\nWhat I was never able to overcome was the tendency of the printer to distort the length of the document. Something about the thickness of the paper and weight would throw the printers ability to correctly gauge how much paper to pull through off. A 21” deep document might come out at 20.25” etc. That problem might not be an issue with sheets.\n\n"

      "content": "I sometimes add sizing to my paper, which solves the bleed issue. I know that many ink jet printers have an “art paper” setting — I assume this is to compensate for excessive bleed? It’s ok if the final product is a little rustic — it’s the look I’m after.\n\nAlso, I’ve been able to line up my pages fairly closely (not exactly) on other printers, and this is fine — it lends to the handmade impression.\n\nMost inkjets seem to emphasize their “photo” capabilities, which I could care less about. I cannot find any models that currently tout any of the qualities I’m looking for.\n\nI’ll check out the 3000. If anyone has recommendations for specific brands/models, I’d be grateful.\n\n"
