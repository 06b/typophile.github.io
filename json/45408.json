My (admittedly old) Photoshop comes up with PMS 620C, slightly darker. 619C is a bit more lighter.\n\nIf you happen to use Illustrator, you can try [this script](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907051014/http:/www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/index.cfm?event=extensionDetail&loc=en_us&extid=1045730), which sounds really good.\n\n"

Having said that the CMYK colours in the Pantone solid to process book are in my opinion often nowhere near the Pantone colour. What do you do?\n\n"
