  "content": "Hi Everyone! I have an assignment that I hope you can help me with. I’m designing a Lego advertisement billboard which is targetted towards parents about their past interactions with Lego.\n\nWhat I need is a typeface that reflects on the 1950’s (Because Lego first began to use plastic injection moulds around this time), however needs to have a friendly, inviting mood. The other problem is that the typeface can’t look too out dated because it’s a billboard for the present time. I’ll bulletpoint things to make it easier:\n\n- Require a 1950’s typeface  \n- The type needs to have an inviting, friendly mood  \n- When parents look at this billboard, the typeface should have a nostalgic feel  \n- The typeface can’t look too out dated (Sounds like a contradiction - how can it be nostalgic and not look too outdated???)\n\nIt seems like I’m having trouble. I thought about using Comic Sans since it has a kid like feel, however, doesn’t reflect a 50’s feel.\n\nIf anyone has some really good suggestions about choosing a good typeface or anything else, Please post! =)\n\n",

It's \"childish\" in a certain way and has some features suggesting 50s lettering. Still it's modern in many ways.\n\nI also suggest you to study Lego packaging from the 50s, recycling some things from the old packages might do wonders.\n\nWhat ever you do, please - I repeat - please, don't use Comic sans.\n\n"

Most of the websites offer typefaces to download (about $150+) for certain fonts. As a student, I don't have that kind of money to give away, especially on a tight budget. Fonts such as Brown, Grenadine, or Antique Olive Nord would be great! I'm quite interested in the font grenadine.\n\nIf anyone by chance has the font grenadine by Akemi Aoki, please reply.
