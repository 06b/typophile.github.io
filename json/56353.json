  "content": "I’m working on a collection of dingbats specifically for a font that I created. It will include directional devices - arrows and pointing hands. Should I create a cell for each direction (left, right, up, down) for each symbol? Or, is one sufficient and the user can point them wherever they want to? I’ve noticed in other symbol fonts that there were redundant pointers for each direction.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe dingbat fonts are redundant?\n\nOpinions? Comments? Rude gestures?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[_...from the Fontry_](http://web.archive.org/web/20090330135604/http:/www.thefontry.com/)\n\n [‹ What's wrong, if anything, with this W?](http://web.archive.org/web/20090330135604/http:/typophile.com/cms/node/56381 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Baskerville - Thoughts? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20090330135604/http:/typophile.com/cms/node/56254 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
