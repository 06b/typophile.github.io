[Geometric 415](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143642/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/) is close. [Neutraface](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143642/http:/houseind.com/house.php?kit=NEUTRAFACE-FO&sub=view) (from House Industries) would work. [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143642/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/) is OK too but some characters are different. Can't easily find an exact match but any of the above should do the trick. Neutraface gives you the funky 33.\n\n"

I'm wondering if the 3s were from a different font.   \n   \nAnyway, I'm thinking that maybe Relay would be another font that could pass.   \n   \nAgain, thanks.\n\n"
