Any suggestions for period dingbats would also be apprecited. Thanks.\n\n",

Benton in the next 2 years; or [Golden Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/golden-type-ef/), originally designed in 1892 by W. Moris. The latter has SC and OSF versions. 'Chelt' was such a widespread favorite by the early 20th century, all printers had it in their inventories, so it's a very characteristic style of that era.   \n   \n(BTW, it's nice to be back from vacation, I must say).\n\n"

Faces like Egyptian would often be used as a boldface for De Vinne or Bruce Old Style. Ronaldson was also popular. Unfortunately, the closest thing available to it today is [Tiffany](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-tiffany/), which doesn't really have the same antique feel (unless you're talking about 1970s antiques :-). Faces like the original (non-ITC) [Bookman](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bookman/) and [Cushing](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/itc-cushing/) were common. Also [Romana](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/romana/). I've got a children's history book from 1889 that uses [Art Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/art-gothic/) for section headings. Jonathan Hoefler's [Knockout Series](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143610/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/series_e.html) would not feel out of place.   \n   \nOf course, it's not just the type choices, but how you set them. I would recommend getting hold of or at least looking at books from the late 1800s to get layout ideas.\n\n"

Since that's where my head was at your suggestions initially came as a surprise. Don't get me wrong, I understand the reasoning behind your suggestions. I'm just wondering if I should be considering using an old style font for most of the text, with \"period\" fonts for initial caps, heads, subheads, etc. Is this a \"cop out\"? I'm interested in your reactions.   \n   \nI'm anxious to get my hands on copies of the images, to become more familiar with the look of the material (seen briefly in a meeting yesterday). And I agree, Mark, that it would be a good idea to do some research into the books of the period. Thanks.\n\n"

Similarly, Garamond's fonts were made in the 1600s and were not revived until the 1920s.   \n   \nThe late nineteenth century was big on \"antiques,\" which evolved from Caslon's types, and moderns, such as De Vinne. (Caslon's original faces, which were from the 18th century, were not popular again until they were revived the early 20th century.)   \n   \nOld style, in the sense usually meant today, meaning things like Bembo, Jenson, Garamond, Caslon, etc., is a very 20th-century thing. Even a lot of the moderns, like Bodoni and Dido, and transitionals, like Baskerville and Bulmer, were out of style by the late 19th century and didn't make a comeback until the 1920s. Most of the faces we call \"old style\" now were considered obsolete in the late 1800s.   \n   \nIf you look at books and other things published back then you will see what I mean.\n\n"
