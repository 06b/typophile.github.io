The fictional brand uses the distinctive Heine font and colour scheme.\n\nThis kind of thing has been going on for years in Formula 1 ( [example](http://web.archive.org/web/20100704083244/http:/www.sporteconomy.it/files/image/foto2005/midlandf1(1).jpg)) to avoid tobacco advertising bans. I've always thought this practice shows the power of typography, and would make for a great magazine article, coffee table book or undergraduate dissertation subject.\n\nDoes anyone have any interesting examples of this genre they’d care to share?\n\n",
