  "content": "hello,\n\nas a part of my architectural studies at the university of darmstadt in germany, i'm currently working on an analysis of the relationship of typography and space and character of a city and the impact they have on each other.  \nmy main emphasis so far is:  \n:: how much a city's type (ci) represents its charcter, and/or space  \n:: can one type represent the many different charcters and atmospheres most modern citys include in their metropolitain area?  \n:: how much does a type named after a city represent the city, what is the inspiration for the name?  \n:: are there other ways of creating a city's typography?  \n:: does a city have a certain typographical style? in the signs? in the graffiti?  \n...  \ni'd be happy about any comment, link and every other bit of information, that would help me gather information on this subject!\n\nbjörn asmussen\n\n",

That's fourteen pages on one aspect of the typography of one city, so producing a study about the typography of all cities in the world would probably be either overly large or overly generalized. You might want to narrow your project. Good luck!\n\n"

But I did study architectonics under [**John Hejduk**](http://web.archive.org/web/20111231003207/http:/www.architectureweek.com/2003/0108/design_1-1.html) who was more a poet visionary than a brick-and-mortar architect.\n\nAlso, I've always felt that Antoni Gaudí's [Casa Batlló](http://web.archive.org/web/20111231003207/http:/www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Casa_Batllo.html) in Barcelona was as textured as Catalan manuscripts, if that's what you mean.\n\n"
