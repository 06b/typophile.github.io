This tasteful and well crafted Humanist display face  \nexudes an air of dignity along with subtle playfulness. Alternate  \nletterforms and ligatures give this capitals-only font expanded  \npossibilities for any given text.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/monumental.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906160924/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/monumental.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/monumental.html\")\n\nKomusubi: Hajime Kawakame (JAPAN)  \nP22 Komusubi is a new font family from Hajime Kawakami. It features Latin  \nas well as Katakana and Hiragana. This lively display font comes in regular  \nand bold for all three alphabets. In Japanese, Komusubi means to tie a  \nstring or ribbon lightly. The Nipponian lyrical atmosphere of the word  \n“Komusubi” reflects the casual tone of the font itself.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/komusubi.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906160924/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/komusubi.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/komusubi.html\")\n\nDriade: Gabor Kothay (HUNGARY)  \nDriade is a group of fonts based on a personal calligraphic expression. It  \nis exotic but still familiar, readable and graced with a human touch.  \n“Aged” features irregularities found in Kothay’s original brush drawings.  \n“Lined” pares the letterforms down to their basic forms.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/driade.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906160924/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/driade.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/driade.html\")\n\nMystic Font: Terry Wudenbachs (LIECHTENSTIEN).  \nThe P22 Mystic font knows all. Aside from allowing for type design in a  \nfaux eastern script, this font peers into the world of the spirits for  \nguidance and enlightenment. Sure it has small caps and ligatures as  \nOpenType features, but it also has a special “oracle” feature which will  \nanswer your most mystifying questions. The design itself was based on an  \nactual Ouija board. Somehow the spirits became embedded into the font  \nitself and now when a question is typed, an answer is revealed (provided  \nthe contextual alternates feature is enabled). It is not known how the  \notherworldly harbinger was able to integrate into OpenType scripting, but  \nwho are we mere mortals to question this power? Ask and ye shall be  \namazed!\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/mysticfont.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906160924/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/mysticfont.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/mysticfont.html\")\n\nFonts starting at $19.95.\n\nTo request additional information or sample images, please reply to this  \nmessage.\n\nThank you for your support.  \nJim Chambers  \nP22 Type Foundry  \n——————————————-  \nP22 type foundry, Inc.  \n International House of Fonts  \n Lanston Type Company  \n Sherwood Type  \nPO Box 770  \nBuffalo, NY 14213  \n [http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906160924/http:/www.p22.com/ \"http://www.p22.com\")  \nPhone: 716-885-4490  \nFax: 716-885-4482  \n——————————————-\n\n",
