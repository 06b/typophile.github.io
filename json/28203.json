TTX is well explained over [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20111222215344/http:/www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html), but in brief: ttx wil decompile your OTF file to a xml file so you can check, modify or debug your font in a plain text environment. TTX allows for roundtripping so you can recompile your ttx file to an Open Type font file. I heard some people struggling with it, but it works perfectly for me.\n\nPaul\n\n"
