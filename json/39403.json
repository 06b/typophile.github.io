Some of them have tried to get their clients to bring in better designers, and Blue State Digital has made huge improvements on the web, but too much of their design still stinks. Given how many great designers are liberal Democrats it shouldn’t be that way, but the Democrats are still really lagging behind Republicans when it comes to campaigning.\n\nI do like the Obama, logo, tho. Sure it’s a little over the top, but in a campaign season when a mutant like Kucinich is allowed into the debates, it takes a lot to stand out.\n\n"
