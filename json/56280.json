  "content": "As a student I am still learning about typography and the units of measurements involved. However it has occurred to me that the point is based on the inch, which as far as i know is now used exclusively in the United States. I was wondering if there was another standardized measurement system for typography based in the metric system. So far all of the resources that i have been using have only referred to American typography. If someone could give me some insight in this matter or any starting points for my research that would be appreciated.\n\n",
