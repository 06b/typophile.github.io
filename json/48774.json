  "content": "I've just begun working on a logo for a small jeweler. They gave me absolutely nothing to work off of- no existing designs or ideas of what they do or don't like. Their clientele remains fairly ambiguous as well. I'm flying blind.\n\nI came up with a ligature for a lettermark based on the lowercase j and m from ITC Modern No. 20. I really like the flow from the descender in the j up into the loops of the m.\n\nI'm unsure how I like Modern No. 20 for his name though, in the combination logo.\n\nOpinions?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [jmcombo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330022646/http:/typophile.com/files/jmcombo.gif) | 3.77 KB |\n| [jmligature.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330022646/http:/typophile.com/files/jmligature.gif) | 3.62 KB |\n\n",

I'm going to play around with that idea tomorrow, thanks.\n\n**jayyy:** I'm now afraid you might be right, although I hadn't noticed that myself. I read your post from my iPhone while having a few beers with friends. I held it up and asked three people \"what two letters are these?\" Two said \"jm\", one said \"jn\".\n\n**EileenB:** Oh - I have. There's a lot of sans and scripts out there. I'd like to set Jason apart a little. When I said that \"I'm flying blind\" in my first post, I meant that I couldn't get much information from my client regarding their specific target market.\n\nThanks for everyone's input - and any more is of course eagerly welcomed. I will post revisions here, when I make them.\n\n"

I prefer your second posting (2:32pm) perhaps it's my monitor but on the earlier version the type is breaking apart. Are there any quality problems when you actually print the file? Also the tighter kern works better for me with the \"jm\" ligature. Have you tried aligning the baseline of \"markesteyn\" to the baseline of the \"m\"? the name seems to be just floating there.\n\n"

That might also solve the \"jim\" problem.\n\nThe kerning within the name is not balanced at all. You need to go through and even the spaces between letters. For example, the \"j\" and \"n\" in jason are too far from the \"aso\". And the \"r\" in markesteyn is too far from the \"k\". I'm also wondering what this would look like with a sans-serif font for the name. Might be worth a look.\n\nGood progress on this so far.\n\npenn\n\n"

I'd make it go a bit to the right and then ending on top of \"m\". But not too much to still make it look visually right from the top of \"m\". Check the \"item\" where the ligature arc also goes a bit more to the right as expected, but visually it looks perfectly round and nice.\n\nThe wrong arc also makes the left stem of the \"m\" much higher then the rest of the letter so it becomes unbalanced.\n\nOtherwise: very nice job and interesting ligature.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

I updated it on a different vector, but I'm migrating to a new computer right now and don't have Illustrator installed to do a \"Save As\" of the updated vector. It should suffice to say that it looks better.\n\nThanks for everyone's help! I think I'm done with this one.\n\n"
