I’m on Vista. I absolutely need to use this font. How can I get access to it from those Adobe applications?\n\nProblem #2 : I have several Japanese fonts but they never show up in the font menu of Illustrator CS2. Why? They show up in all the other progs, even Photoshop 7.0.\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n",
