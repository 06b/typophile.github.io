These fonts allow missionaries under the auspice of organisation affiliated with SIL to translate and publish in the those languages, but most importantly it gives the people themselves better access to orthographies of their languages.\n\n"

Quite a few derivative designs have legitimately emerged from these donations.\n\nI should note though that if you want a serious Cyrillic Charter, you should get the one designed by Vladimir Yefimov and published by ParaType rather than the one that comes with Charis, which is rather hideous.\n\nA.\n\n"
