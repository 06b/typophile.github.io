Unfortunately, the only digital version I'm aware of is called Tango Regular by WSI - a company that made its living selling batches of knockoff fonts to software companies who then bundled them with its software.\n\nEdit: Mike Yanega offers a [showing of Tasmin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202004057/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces6.html) including numerals.\n\n"

However, I think she may have thought I was the font usage police. I have been unsuccessful in trying to find a place to purchase Tango, but really the link displaying Tasmin Bold will do very nicely!\n\nThank you very much!\n\n"
