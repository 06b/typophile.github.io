Since the printing took a   \ngruesome four days, a different color was used each day in order   \nto break the monotony of hand-fed printing. Therefore there are   \nfour different colored covers; copper, dark red, black, and brown.   \nWe have unearthed 20 copies of the copper colored covers, and are   \noffering them for sale on a first come first serve basis.   \nEmigre #16 featured the inauguration of Emigre Music. It includes   \ninterviews with Bruce Licher, Fact TwentyTwo, Every Good Boy   \nand others. It also includes a large pull out poster announcing   \nthe birth of Emigre Music.   \nEmigre #16 was published in the original size of 11 x 17 inches.   \nPrice: $25.00   \n   \nSee the cover image at:   \n [http://www.emigre.com/EMag.php?issue=16](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020142312/http:/www.emigre.com/EMag.php?issue=16)   \n   \n   \n--------------------------------------------------------------   \nPress Time! 2 Poster Set   \n   \nLimited edition 2-poster set.
