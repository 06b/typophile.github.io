Its a clean, sharp sans that isn't too mechanical. It might suit your needs. [Geogrotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20141129175351/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/emtype/geogrotesque/) might be an option as well.\n\nJeo.\n\n"

I also don't know how much type is on these certificates, if not so much, then you could use all caps, you just might need to have contrast in sizes.\n\nI like DIN a lot, its clean, precise, ledgible, not too mechanical, not too humanist, good for corporate identity or as a text font.\n\nJeo.\n\n"
