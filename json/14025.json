It has been argued that Besley’s foundry was not the first to offer a typeface of this kind, but the act of naming the face and registering that name secured the grounds to defend its ownership. By the mid nineteenth century typeface names were acting as marketing tools and marks of property and effectively this remains the case.  \n-- from [_Thirty-six point Gorilla_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123081658/http:/www.typotheque.com/site/article.php?id=62)  \nby Emily King\n\nIf I find more I will post it.\n\nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!\n\n"

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Craw several times at Type Directors Club meetings, so you know it can't be as old as the original Clarendon.\n\nI don't think you will find EVERY variation of the original Clarendon, but just know that the two above are very well known and accepted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I never met Robert Besley!\n\n"
