In Quark you just use the control key, so I am sure there must be a simple way to do this without turning off curly quotes in Preferences every time an inch mark is needed.\n\nSo can someone enlighten me?\n\nMuch thanks!\n\n",

I tend to use a little of both. So, in InDesign, you could set the quotesingle & then just slant it about 15 degrees for a reasonable prime/minute/foot. And of course, the quotedbl for minute/inch.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
