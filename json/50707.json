I have two version at the moment, a rounded one which quite look like a typewriter font and the typical slab serif approach. As always, crits & suggestions appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417171719im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Q_Slab_3503.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417171719im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Slab-1_6484.jpg)\n\n",

It strongly resembles Lubalin Graph, as any geometric slab-serif is likely to, but I think you noticed that too and included features to differentiate this. Am I right?\n\n"
