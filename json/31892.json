I assume your video editing software when it sees a 72dpi just then doesn’t bother resizing it to ensure that every pixel you created in photoshop is brought over as a pixel in your video image.\n\nIt’s a setting that you need to have, but really isn’t related to print dpi what-so-ever. Just an old habit of photoshop’s. ;o)\n\nAnd now back to this thread...\n\n“My understanding - and I’m not a web designer - is that when preparing graphics for the web you should always be working in 72 dpi (or ppi). That way you are dealing with the images at the size they will display on screen.”\n\nThe dpi really doens’t matter. It’s just a particular setting in photoshop to make it easy to know when you are truly seeing all the pixels (100%). The image, itself, retains no dpi info online.\n\n“But… a question pertaining to topics raised in the other thread - does it affect image loading speed if the graphic is at a higher dpi (same pixel dimension)?”\n\nNot at all. The dpi setting isn’t used at all by the web browser. All it cares is what the actual image is in pixels.\n\n“Maybe I need someone to sit down and explain it to me.”\n\nI’m trying but probably not fully getting the point across.

Either way, it has to fit the physical size and aspect ration of a film frame.\n\nSo, if you retain a physical ’printed’ size to an image, and increase or decrease the dpi, yes, it will increase or decrease the file size, as you are adding or removing pixels.\n\nHowever, if all you care about are the pixel dimensions (as one is on screen) then increasing or decreasing the dpi won’t change anything on screen.

It assumes 72 dpi for web use as a sort of arbitrary convention - that number describes the original 1984 Macintosh screen. Computers now generally have smaller pixels (a 20-inch iMac, for example, at 1680x1050, is around 98 ppi). The main thing, from Photoshop’s point of view, is that a 72-dpi image will either have small enough pixel dimensions to work on the web or it will have large enough spatial dimensions to alert you to the problem.\n\nThe whole thing is easiest if you acknowledge that print and web are different beasts.

I think there may be a cultural gap here that’s hindering communication between people who just use images and people who muck about with file formats. A Photoshop user might think of pixels as just the things visible on the screen, and might think the underlying data are something different. This would seem like a sensible assumption, because it corresponds to the reality of preparing image files for printing. But actually file formats such as JPEG and GIF consist of “abstract” pixels that ideally correspond to the pixels on your screen. There’s a file header that contains various information about the file (including, in JPEG/JFIF format, 4 bytes that define the ppi values); everything after that file header is just a compressed or uncompressed array of pixels. When you open up a JPEG in Photoshop and then select “Image Size”, the display tells you the dimensions in pixels at the top and the dimensions in your units of choice (inches, centimeters, etc.) below. The pixels in the upper half of the Image Size dialog are the image data - no matter what dpi the Resolution box shows, the amount of image data is equal to the pixel dimensions.\n\nWhen Photoshop (or some other image viewer) displays an image at 100%, that means that one abstract file pixel is equal to one screen pixel.\\* When a Photoshop file is sent to a printer, though, it doesn’t work in pixels - it works in units of area. So when the file gets printed, it is converted into different information based on the dpi setting in the file. So you are correct that the amount of data depends on ppi in the world of (print) production, but Darrel is also correct in saying that changing the ppi of a file has no effect on the file size unless you also change the pixel dimensions.\n\nWeb browsers will display the image at 100% unless forced to do otherwise, like in the example from Patty’s site that started this thread. So for web use, the size on screen depends solely on the pixel dimensions, and ppi has no effect. This is very different from how images are prepared for print in Photoshop, but it’s the reason why, in the alternate-size image example that Dan posted, it’s necessary to have separate files for each size.\n\n\\* Obviously, if the image is being displayed at something other than 100%, either some pixels of the file data are being dropped out or additional pixels are being extrapolated. This doesn’t affect the file size, because the number of pixels actually stored in the file remains the same.\n\n"

      "content": "I really don’t know why this topic is so difficult to understand, but obviously it is, as I run across people every now and then who confuse things...\n\nI’ll try to explain:\n\nLets start with print: PPI means Pixels per Inch.  \nYou have a certain amount of Pixels, distributed on the length of one inch. The more Pixels you have, the smaller they get, the sharper the image looks like.  \nThe PPI-Value set in Photoshop is only a number: It defines the relationship between number of pixels (pixel dimensions) and the physial size of the image (length and width dimensions). There is no additional information in this number.  \nIf you have a picture with 300\\*300 pixels, and a dpi value of 300, it will print 1\\*1 inch in size. If you take the same picture, and change the dpi value to 100 (picture is still 300\\*300px large!), it will print 3\\*3 inches. There is the same amount of pixels printed, resulting in a grainier picture with larger pixels.  \nI think this quite clear.\n\nSo let’s switch to screen:  \nHow large is a Screen with 1600\\*1200 pixels? It differs. There are small 12” notebook displays with this pixel dimensions, and large desktop displays as well. Both have the same pixel dimensions, but the differ in: PPI. A small notebook display has let’s say 200 pixels per inch, a large desktop-display maybe 100. The Pixels of the Desktop Display are larger.  \nWhat happens if you display a picture with 300\\*300 pixels here? It will display in different sizes. On the notebook, you will have a picture of 1,5\\*1,5 inches. On the Desktop, the same picture will be 3\\*3 inches. Each pixel of the display shows one pixel of the picture.  \nAs the notebook pixels are much smaller, the resulting display of the image is smaller too. There is (yet) no way to determine, how big a picture (in inches) is displayed on a screen. All you can do is give pixel dimensions.\n\nSo what is it about 72ppi (or 96ppi)?  \nWell, for some purposes, the operating system has to convert pyhsical lenghts to pixels. This happens for example with type. You say “my window titles should have the size of 10pt”. pt is a physical length. But the operating system has to display pixels, so it needs to know what “10pt” is. Ideally, you would tell the system, how large your screen is in inches (lenght, height). Then, if you say “10pt”, it could display the type exactly 10pt. But until today this is theoretically possible, but practically not, as for programming reasons. So, the system \\*assumes\\* your screen has a physical resolution of 72ppi (apple) or 96dpi (windows), even if it is not exactly true. For most desktop displays, the value today is between 90 and 100ppi, so 96 is quite a good number (72 was quite good in the 80ies and even 90ies, but displays became better).\n\nSo: if you have a 96ppi screen, and you take a picture of 96\\*96 pixels in photoshop, and enter the value 96ppi, it will show exactly as large as it would print (1\\*1 inch).\n\nBut all of this only matters if you want to print a picture. The PPI value is worthless on a screen, which dimensions are unknown to you (which happens on the internet or on TV).  \nAs Aluminium tells us with the tower of Babel, if you have the same number of pixels in a picture, it does not matter whether it is saved at 30000ppi or just 30. On screen, each pixel is shown 1:1, size according to the size of the actual display. If you took this picture to photoshop and print it, the printed size would differ dramatically (this does not apply to print from a internet browser, they act like displays when they print).\n\n"

You have much more control over the appearance of your project.”\n\nYes, I think that sums it up perfectly. Printing an image is based on two variables: the pixel dimensions and the ppi setting in the file, which combine to create a size in inches. Web display is also based on two variables: the pixel dimensions and the user’s monitor settings, which the designer has no control over. The 72 ppi convention is artificial, and usually incorrect (since most people use monitor settings somewhere around 100 ppi now), but it does provide a way for people who are more accustomed to working in inches to get a rough idea of how big the image will be.\n\nProblems are most likely to occur where the designer doesn’t really understand that print and screen display work in basically different ways. This could be a print designer saving images with overly high pixel dimensions for use on screen, or it could be a web designer not realizing that the images with low pixel dimensions will look like crap if they’re printed out. It’s probably useful nowadays to speak both “languages” to some degree.\n\n"

Knowledge about the pixel size is important, in the way that it represents the actual information stored in the picture.\n\nLet me pose a rethorical problem: suppose you want to print a very small picture — and with “small” I mean few pixels, of course ;-) — for example your avatar, which measures 60 times 60 px. If you want, you can resize this picture to be 10 inches wide at 300 DPI, right?

However, the catch is, and I am sure that you realise this, that you can’t really add any information to the original picture in this way. The final picture will have the resolution 300 DPI in one sense of the word, but that number says very little about the image quality.

      "content": "It’s late and my brain is empty, but one thing jumps out at me, in the differences between web and print, that I’m surpised no one else has mentioned, especially on a discussion group called “Typophile” . . . when I hear Patty mention that she likes the control in print design compared to the web, I immediately think of type as much as pictures, perhaps even moreso. In web design we cannot know how lines of type are going to break, and we cannot control the color of type, cannot subtly track the word spaces in a line of FL text to make the rag more even, cannot ensure that we won’t have more than two lines in a row that end in a hyphen. This is the part about web that I am still trying to accept — it’s exciting, but it’s a bit like walking into a frontier town in the wild west where only some aspects of life are ordered and predictable. For me, the careful massaging of type on a book page is one of the most challenging, meditative, and satisfying things I could ever do. I love it, and I hate having to give up that subtle degree of control when I do web design.\n\nAt this late hour, I also see something rather amusing. We have all learned to think of vector art as resolution-independent and pixelated (bitmap) art as resolution-dependent. Right?\n\nWell, having read this whole thread from the beginning, I would summarize by saying that designing for the web — for which the _lingua franca_ is pixels — is resolution-independent! Apart from the density of an end user’s display, we need not care about anything except pixels. (Video is different from computer displays, as Ch has pointed out.) So that is the ultimate in simplicity. For the web, a pixel is a pixel is a pixel. Whereas design for print is _dependent_ on resolution! Does anybody else think this is a bizarre twist, or is it because it’s 1 in the morning and I’m the only one laughing?\n\nI also want to return to something Patty said a bunch of posts up from here: she said the pictures of those two guys would print at the same size and a lot of people said no! But if I understand this correctly, she was showing us two picture boxes in an app such as QuarkXPress. One picture was blown up to 300%, the other one reduced to 90%. But both pictures would indeed be the same size because they would be printed on paper with identical dimensions. the density of their contents might be different (and the file sizes of the scans different), but the pictures would be the same size on the printed paper.\n\nTaz Tally is saying that pictures for the web ought to be saved in Photoshop at 96 ppi rather than 72 ppi. Have any of you heard this? (He says it during a Silverfast scanning software video at lynda.com.) I don’t understand why he thinks we should save them at 96 ppi when they are still going to display as plain ol’ pixels! The file sizes will be identical, and the pixel dimensions will be identical, but the _print size_ will be smaller. What advantage is there in that if one is making a scan strictly for the web?! (The only thing I can think of is that he wants his 4x6 inch snapshot print to appear on the screen at roughly the same size (thus returning to WYSIWYG) but no two monitors are alike, so what good is that? Am I missing something essential here?\n\nOne last thing about resolution. So much of it depends on appropriate understanding of viewing distance, rather than going for whatever is the highest absolute quality. I make very big photomurals (sometimes 50 feet long) and although most of them are doneon photographic paper, I’ve made a few public art projects using traditional paper billboards. These are made by silkscreening CMYK process inks onto the paper. When you see a billboard from your car or from the subway, the image looks normal, and very sharp. If you walk right up to it, you’ll find that the color separation was made with a 15-line screen! The ink spots look like golf balls! For the _designed_ viewing distance, you don’t need a screen ruling any finer than that.\n\nIn 1984 I bought an electronic typesetting system for the book-printing company where I was working. Up to that time we were setting everything in hand type or on the linotype. (Yes, that is correct, all hot-metal in 1984!) I bought a Monotype Lasercomp because it gave us access to Monotype’s distinguished library of types. The Lasercomp’s resolution was 1000 dpi. My friends a couple of states away, who did the same kind of work in book production, had a Linotronic with a resolution of 2540 dpi. One friend from that plant came over and looked at the output from our machine with a high-power loupe and commented gently that he could see the rough edges on the letters from our machine, whereas the Linotronic edges were smooth. He was quietly happy that their machine produced smoother edges.\n\nHe was right, but I would also say that the type from our machine, once burned onto a plate via contact in a vacuum frame, its image inked and then transferred to rubber blanket, and then transferred _again_ to uncoated paper such as Superfine or Dulcet, would read just fine. Our books were meant to be read at a distance of 12 or 15 inches (30 to 38 cm) and in that situation, 1000 dpi vs 2540 dpi didn’t matter. But the difference between a 133-line halftone and a 200-line halftone could be perceived immediately with the naked eye: you could feel grain in the 133 and it was absent in the 200.\n\nSo we agonize about resolution all the time when paper is involved.\n\nTime to get horizontal.\n\n"

If you scan at 300ppi, you will get a picture about three times as large on a usual screen, so if you only want to scan for screen use, 96dpi will be the “right” resolution if you don’t want to magnify or show details.  \nToday, almost every normal desktop screen has a physical resolution of 90 to 100ppi, rather than about 72ppi in the 80ies. Special devices like laptops, handy displays, etc. may differ, but they are used in different viewing distances. Or they are used for special tasks. You can’t care about the special ones...\n\nAs for choosing a ppi-value for a picture you want to use on screen, and you already have (not scanning yet): You \\*have\\* to choose a value in most picture file formats, but its completely irrelevant on screen. There, only pixel dimensions count. You can set the value to 3ppi, 30, 300 odr 30000, the picture will not display any different, nor will there be more or less information in the picture, thus the filesize will be identical.

That’s the information.\n\nyeah, EVENTUALLY, but here upstream ppi also represents real information. information seems to be defined differently at different platforms in the process.  \nyou’ve preferenced your definition of information over mine. why in the name of odin should i ignore the term “resolution” ? my work is all about resolution! usually high data density elements that must be conformed down to lower resolution media.\n\n\\>\\>There is no density to choose.\n\n??? says who ? on your end, maybe because density (in the plastic sense) is fixed and meaningful only according to the end user’s monitor, but on my end NO, there IS density to choose, and tweak, so i can prepare YOUR end to discard it with optimal results !  \n(see above first quote from your post: “of course you convert”).\n\ni understand there are no inches on the web (!!!!) and if i eventually define my image as 100 x 100 pixels the “original” dpi is thrown away. okay ? got it.\n\nread this: I UNDERSTAND.\n\nwhat i object to is the blanket statement that ppi is irrelevant. if the process includes it  \nat any stage, it’s relevant. granted this argument has included (on my part as well as others) some cross-terminology : dpi / ppi / resolution.\n\nyou say it’s irrelevant, but i say the web equalizes “resolution” (in the “print” sense),  \nbut file size is relevant across all platforms, and resolution - however defined - effects file size. don’t tell me it doesn’t unless you’ve figured out how to derive all your nutrition from air. i’ve heard that’s possible...\n\n"

      "content": "here’s another way to explain it, for those of you who still care:\n\ni design a postcard for a client. the working file is relatively hi-rez, specified in photoshop as 6 inches by 4 inches at 600ppi. in pure pixels that’s 3600x2400, with a file size  \nof 24.7 M. “too big for the web”.\n\nnow i want to display it as close to “actual size” as i can on a web site.  \nby actual size i mean apparent physical size, the way a postcard looks sitting in front of you. right there is a chance for misunderstanding: you might say 3600x2400 is the actual size, “but on the web it will be huge.”\n\nbut i say “postcard size” is the actual size, and i want it to appear approximately “life size”, knowing that it will vary somewhat, but within a tolerable range, from one monitor to another. so i reduce the image, in photoshop.\n\nmethod 1) maintaining 6 inches by 4 inches but down to 96ppi (or 72ppi if you prefer). the resulting file is now 576x384 pixels, weighing in at a more manageable 648 K.  \nit has also suffered noticable loss in resolution.\n\nmethod 2) simply adjust the pixel size to 576x384, while maintaining 600ppi,  \nbut the “inches” measure in photoshop drops to .96 x .64 - again, detail (information)  \nis lost. it’s not the same file size, nor is it the same resolution.\n\ni’d appreciate some restraint, if not an apology, in the “you just don’t get it” department.  \ni get it, i got it, i’m gonna go get some more of it.\n\n"
