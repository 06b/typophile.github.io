  "content": "Dissertation writing is an academic pursuit that requires painstaking work, tedious analysis, and heaps and heaps of patience. While it is admittedly a complicated process in itself, there are still ways to make the load a bit more bearable for every writer.\n\nHere then are five guidelines that will lighten the usual burdensome weight of dissertations:\n\nSet [Deadlines](http://web.archive.org/web/20090705092309/http:/particletree.com/notebook/the-importance-of-deadlines/)  \nPut some constructive pressure on yourself by setting up deadlines for every section and chapter of the dissertation. Although a large majority detests having to put up with these time limits, the truth is that people normally go through a more difficult time without these deadlines to push and encourage them. It is these bothersome deadlines that spur you to write on a regular basis, thus keeping you progressing and moving forward in your dissertation.\n\nBefriend the [Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20090705092309/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library)  \nIn your dissertation writing, you must accept that the library will be your second home for the next several months. Endeavor to maximize all the rich resources it can provide for your paper. Books, journals, magazines, old newspaper clippings: these library materials contain concepts and ideas that can definitely strengthen the argument and essence of the dissertation. Be sure to pour over every relevant source available.\n\nIncorporate a Note-taking Technique  \nAs you’ll be immersed and bombarded with innumerable information as you move along in your dissertation writing, you should integrate a [note-taking system](http://web.archive.org/web/20090705092309/http:/www.dartmouth.edu/~acskills/success/notes.html) to help clear your head. It does not have to be one specific method. You can use a set of index cards, or a software program, or even a simple notepad. Whatever scheme works for you, stick to it throughout your dissertation. As your research increases by leaps and bounds, your notes will aid to organize your thoughts, thus bringing all the dissertation concepts neatly together.\n\nLook Back  \nMonths to years of sifting through statistics and information can evolve your dissertation into something far from your primary objective. If you do not wish for this to happen, it’s then recommended that you constantly refer back to the initial articles that prompted your study. Such a practice will redirect you to your target path as well as remind you of supposed important elements that you have neglected and forgotten due to the streaming tide of data coming in.\n\nLet Go  \nSee the bigger picture by taking a step back from your dissertation. Sometimes, to gain more perspective for your piece, you must learn to breathe and leave your paper for periods of time. A fresh and recharged mind is more capable of handling the rigors of [dissertation writing](http://web.archive.org/web/20090705092309/http:/www.bestdissertation.com/) and analysis than a stressed and drained one. Also, when the time comes to end your paper and you still have not included everything you planned to say, just let go and accept it. Be gracious of the fact that not everything can be incorporated in your dissertation. The more you let go, the more you will be able to end with a good and powerful conclusion.\n\nBy integrating these five guidelines, you’ll be more organized to author your dissertation, as well as be more open-minded for possible dissertation predicaments and surprises.\n\n",
