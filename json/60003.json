Please use a simulated process (CMYK) and create the appropriate color separations\" \n\nHe has asked for Illustrator files. I am totally unknown with \"simulated process\". Pls can anyone help me what & how to do it. I can not say my customer that i can not do this:( Pls help to sort out this.\n\n",

Also, ask your client if they want \"simulated\" process color for an intentional retro look.\n\n"

      "content": "\"Simulated process\" means setting it up with four colors, but the colors aren't CMYK, and typically there's an underlay color because the substrate (usually a dark T-shirt) isn't white. In your case, you could have black, two shades of brown, and white. Check out [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20110128115306/http:/www.impressionsmag.com/impressions/content_display/screen-printing/e3ia99a083a1bd87a2b808db05af2df38fe) about it, and/or google \"simulated process separations.\"\n\nAlso, it's probably worth mentioning that antialiasing is a bad idea in printing in general, so you'll want a version (if you don't already have one) at a higher resolution without antialiasing. You'll need to know the final size they're printing this at.\n\nThere probably are plug-ins to streamline this process, but essentially you want to end up with a Photoshop file with a channel for each color. When you make a new channel, you can pick the color and screen angle, and then you can move the appropriate parts of the image into the new channel.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

I second the idea of talking straight to the printers to find out what they want and how many colours are there at your disposal.\n\n"
