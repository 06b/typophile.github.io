  "content": "What's the better way to put regional variations of characters in a font? I ask because sometimes there's stuff that is not part of an standardized glyph shape —like the different forms for the Eng in Sami and African languages— but just some kind of stylization that may look unfamiliar or incorrect to people that don't speak that language. As an Spanish speaker, I've seen that half of the time the tilde over the N is simplified in a macron, and there's some weird variations sometimes. There's no problem because the macron isn't used in the language and the fact that there's a bar over the N is enough to identify it. The same happens with other languages, which may use the same stylization over a letter that in another language may feel awkward or confusing.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106093925im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ntilde_5744.png)\n\nThe same with some stylized version of the greek characters I have seen in some fonts, which even if logical may look odd for people that is not too used to them.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106093925im_/http:/typophile.com/files/greek_4555.png)\n\n",

If anyone's confused, they can contact you and you can change the accents in the next version.
