  "content": "In a recent paper [“How Does Arabic Orthographic Connectivity Modulate Brain Activity During Visual Word Recognition: An ERP Study” _Brain Topography_, April 2013] Haitham Taha, Raphiq Ibrahim and Asaid Khateb show “that instead of slowing down reading, orthographic connectivity in Arabic skilled readers seems to impact positively the reading process already during the early stages of word recognition.\n\nThe practical relevance of this for typographers and type-designers working on Latin-based scripts might be in the realm of ligaturization and contextual alternatives. It also has a bearing on discussions of how reading works. A good theory of how reading works should explain why or how connectivity has a positive impact on processing. It should explain why ligaturization and devising contextual alternatives might be beneficial.\n\n**Abstract** One of the unique features of the Arabic orthography that differentiates it from many other alphabetical ones is the fact that most letters connect obligatorily to each other. Hence, these letters change their forms according to the location in the word (i.e. beginning, middle, or end), leading to the suggestion that connectivity adds a visual load which negatively impacts reading in Arabic. In this study, we investigated the effects of the orthographic connectivity on the time course of early brain electric responses during the visual word recognition. For this purpose, we collected event-related potentials (ERPs) from adult skilled readers while performing a lexical decision task using fully connected (Cw), partially connected and nonconnected words (NCw). Reaction times variance was higher and accuracy was lower in NCw compared to Cw words. ERPs analysis revealed significant amplitude and latency differences between Cw and NCw at posterior electrodes during the N170 component which implied the temporo-occipital areas. Our findings show that instead of slowing down reading, orthographic connectivity in Arabic skilled readers seems to impact positively the reading process already during the early stages of word recognition. These results are discussed in relation to previous observations in the literature.\n\nAvailable for a fee online at: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-012-0241-2](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820223418/http:/dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-012-0241-2 \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10548-012-0241-2\")\n\nWhile seeming to adopt the ‘parallel letter recognition’ based orthographic processing framework implicit in the “Interactive Activation Model” of Rumelhart and McClelland and in the “Local Combination Detection” model of Stanislas Dehaene as their starting point in their “Introduction,” the authors use ideas that appear to be at odds with such accounts in their “Discussion,” specifically the idea that “N170 ERPs could represent a logographic processing strategy in visual word recognition,” which is the result of more frequent exposure to connected words. The authors draw this explanation from: G. Simon, L. Petit, C. Bernard and M Rebai, “N170 ERPs could represent a logographic processing strategy in visual word recognition.” [_Behavioral and Brain Functions_, 3:21, 2007]. For the authors of the Simon, et.al., paper, a logographic processing strategy is “a more holistic process where words are processed as a global visual pattern [rather than on an orthographic basis as a string of letters].”\n\nFor my part, I'm not convinced the N170 ERPs actually represent a _logographic_ processing strategy in visual word recognition. For typophiles, conceiving of word recognition in “more holistic” terms might seem attractive, but it’s unclear what “processed as a global visual pattern” means. Currently prominent developmental theories of reading acquisition distinguish three phases, 1) a pre-alphabetic logographic phase when readers recognize words (for example, those appearing in their everyday environments, such as the names of restaurants, brands of candy, their own or friends’ names printed on cubbies at school) on the basis of salient or distinctive visual cues and contextual features in or around the written words; 2) an alphabetic phase when readers use spelling-sound rules to read words; 3) an orthographic phase when words are recognized by larger spelling patterns, especially morphemic units. [This description is freely adapted from the work of Linnea C. Ehri.] The idea that in skilled readers the N170 ERPs represent a _logographic_ processing strategy in visual word recognition doesn’t seem to recognize the perceptual learning in early visual cortex which takes place during and after the orthographic phase.\n\nMy alternative to the “global visual pattern” idea is an “intrinsic integration” account. I think the facilitating effect of connectivity actually has to do with the fact that connectivity frustrates the channeling of _feature_ (closure, aspect, extendedness) and _role-unit_ or _glypheme_ (stroke and counter) level information into independent letter slots, as the Interactive Activation Model assumes. In an script system characterized by connectivity, feature-analytic processing encourages an holistic or across-the-word gathering of fine-grained, location-specific role-unit level information. A re-coding of words at this more elemental (than letter) level, and more fine-grained than “global visual pattern” level probably represents a 4th phase in reading acquisition, and is the result of perceptual learning at the neural level during phase 3.\n\nSo connectivity through ligaturization and contextual alternatives in the late-alphabetic and orthographic phase might actually facilitate the emergence of the rapid automatic “visual word-form resolution” capabilites fundamental to immersive reading of extended text.\n\n",

More problematic, I think, is the very poor spacing shown in this table, in particular the lack of kerning for non-connecting pairs in the PCw and NCw examples. If this accurately represents the stimuli as shown to participants, then the test may have a significant flaw, because the words as thus displayed are abnormal, and do not reflect normal written or good quality typographic practice. Of course, Arab readers are sometimes presented with text that lacks kerning, just as English readers are, but finding a significant advantage for Cw stimuli in badly spaced text is not the same as finding a general advantage.\n\n[Spacing is also very bad within the Cw stimuli as shown in the table. Basically, this is a very bad font. But since the nature of the spacing problems affect connecting and non-connecting sequences in different ways, I don't think they cancel each other out.]\n\n"

I think the letterwise-decipherment model says that when the letters are individually decipherable (since people do know them individually) reading should not suffer.

Indeed, the Cw have no spaces between the letters while such spaces exist inside the NCw. These spaces may contribute, at least partly, to the time consumption during the visual processing of the NCw, due for instance to longer gaze duration (Roman and Pavard 1987), higher number of fixation/saccades etc.\n\nIn other words, they acknowledge that their results may be affected by the internal spaces in the non-connected sequences, although they do not register that the size of these spaces might be a factor. They go on, rightly, to suggest that this would need to be independently tested using eye tracking methodology. They also suggest that differences in spatial frequency between connected and unconnected sequences might be a factor:\n\n> ...it is possible to assume that NCw words are of a higher SF than Cw words and thus at least some of these differences might be explained by such physical differences.\n\nAnd this is the actual conclusion drawn by the authors of the study:\n\n> The data presented here show for the first time that words’ connectivity does not impact negatively reading and word recognition processes in skilled readers of Arabic. Our analysis shows that processing connected letter forms, which are standard and inevitable in written Arabic, does not present any particular difficulty. However, further research still needed to investigate how the effects observed here compare really to word frequency and to spatial frequency effects among readers of Arabic.\n\nIn other words, their results show that connected script does not have a negative impact on word recognition for experienced readers -- and that is really interesting and contrary to much prediction or assumption --, but the apparent positive advantage _cannot_ be definitely explained as a result of connectivity independent of other factors.\n\n"

If Hebrew shares a characteristic with English/Swedish/French and so on that Arabic does not, a bias towards the Latin script as the paradigm for writing systems would also favor those Semitic scripts which more closely resemble it.\n\nAnd researchers are biased towards easily testable and falsifiable explanations which don't involve attributing mysterious powers to the human brain.\n\nMy biases tell me that the bouma is likely to be the source of the observed phenomenon, and they also tell me that a short learning curve is _also_ an important virtue in a script. (The Chinese script does inflate the cost of mass literacy so that it's only achievable by First World countries like Japan; that, at least, is indisputable. Or is it? In some quarters, claims by the People's Republic to have achieved universal literacy are accepted.) Thus, even if the Arabic script is superior for the skilled reader, it's not sufficient reason to switch.\n\nAt least, the Turks switched to the Latin script, which, because it has lowercase with ascenders and descenders, also has quite a bit of bouma in its words.\n\nYet, both the Jewish people and those Asians influenced by Chinese culture have been distinguished by their success, even under adverse conditions. Despite Hebrew being low on bouma and legibility, and Chinese being low on bouma and having a high learning curve. As I've noted, I think the _bar mitzvah_ and the Imperial civil service examinations are the explanation - in both cases, literacy is tied in with cultural identity, and so sitting still for education conflicts less with the emotions of the hot-blooded youth.\n\n"

Ascenders, descenders, bowls and counters are role-units._\n\nPart of the genius of the Perso-Arabic script is that it classifies some sub-letter shapes as preservable and some as dispensable, such that the graphotactics of Arabic writing largely involve replacing the dispensable parts of letters with connecting strokes that join together the preservable parts. A large number of Arabic letters, in their isolated forms, consist of a preservable initial shape and a dispensable tail. When the letters are joined, the tail stroke is replaced with a connecting stroke. This is the general rule; there are, of course, exceptions, some particular to individual styles and mostly involving cursive construction of dual-joining (medial) forms. So for example, the general pattern can be observed in the graphotactics of isolated, initial and final ع, but the medial form represents a cursive construction derived from the preservable part but visually disinct in result.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nPS. Simplified Arabic can be analysed as applying the general pattern more strictly, such that many of the cursive formations of medial letters are replaced by straight duplications of the initial form preservable part.\n\n"

If we had vocal systems that worked the other way round, so favoured vowel sequences as the main means of distinguishing words, we would presumably have developed writing systems with more vowel signs, and would find vowel-only writing to be easier to read than consonant-only writing.\n\n"

It turns out to be a bear of a problem.\n\nThe authors compare rates of reading letters, words, syllables, and whole texts. The problem is that some languages have a lot more letters (Finnish) or syllables. So, for example, English and Spanish seem to be at the top for words per minute, but Chinese, which is slow in words per minute, is faster for reading a whole text, because of the economy of Chinese in terms of words needed to express the same thought—it's not a conjugated language, for a start.\n\nI don't know what to make of this. There do seem to be differences in decoding text, but their influence may be swamped by other factors. It may be that the cognitive constraints are much more significant than visual decoding ones.\n\n"
