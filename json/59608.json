Tropicana's Botched Redesign\n\nTropicana drinkers, it turns out, are as passionate about packaging as they are about pulp. That's why they rebelled when parent company PepsiCo and consultancy Arnell overhauled the juice line's packaging in January as part of a $35 million branding campaign called \"Squeeze.\"\n\nTropicana fans said the simplicity of the new design reminded them of store-brand generics. And who wants to be mistaken for a generic consumer?\n\nWithin a month, the public's flogging by e-mail, phone, and blogs forced PepsiCo to bring back the old straw-in-an-orange cartons. Other parts of the campaign remain, but PepsiCo will probably think twice before it tries updating this icon again.\\<\\<\n\nI'm not so sure I agree. While I understand the connection between the sparser design looking more like generic products, I think generic products are becoming the freeway for cleaner design. Also, if it harkens a generic counterpart, wouldn't you prefer feeling like you've purchased the cheaper product?\n\nJust a thought.\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130704054100im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tropicana_6548.jpg)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20130704054100/http:/www.avoision.com/portnoy/images/2009/february/redlineAds_3.jpg)\n\n",
