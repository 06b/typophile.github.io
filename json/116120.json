  "content": "Hey,  \nI have a font which I need to simplify the outline on. That means getting rid of all bezier curve in every single letter and turn them into something similar as the image I've uploaded.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803034130im_/http:/typophile.com/files/a97_4018_3615.jpg)\n  \nDo you know how to do it in any font software?  \nI have access to FontForge and Glyphs. But if you know how to do it in Font Lab or any other software I would be happy to know how.\n\nAny help is very much appreciated :)  \nThank you\n\n",
