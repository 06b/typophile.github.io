  "content": "Hi guys. This is my first post here, but i have been sneaking around for some time.\n\nI have done graphic design for ages. I have always had a special love for typedesign. By now i have reached the age og 30 where restlessness decrease, and the time to deepen into the the world of typographic perfectionism.\n\nThe last year i have done some designs and some half done font sets in Fontlab. As i haven't been drawing the last 10 years i have done my designs in Illustrator but it's not satisfying to see how creativity \"stock\" in the tool-palette.\n\nI want to start all over. Re-invent my drawing skills and learn to draw type the hard way. What books should i go after. I have already ordered \"Learn Fontlab Fast\" for the \"Production\" part, but i need a good book or two dealing with composition and design in the drawing phase.\n\nI really hope you guys (i am sure you can) can help me go rookie again :)\n\nBest regards  \nBenjamin\n\n",
