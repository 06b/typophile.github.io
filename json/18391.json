Most of his typefaces derive from the alphabets he learned from stonecarving teachers.\n\nPerpetua, Joanna, Aries, Golden Cockerel\n\nMichael Harvey also has done a lot of carved lettering, as well as a bunch of very nice lapidary typefaces. One of Michael’s other major influences is his prolific work as a letterer for book covers, so his typefaces reflect this as much as they reflect his stonecarving work.\n\nStrayhorn, Mezz, Ellington, Andreas\n\n"
