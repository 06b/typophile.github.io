  "content": "I am trying to find a new type combination for a well established company... A font pairing that is a new style, yet won't go out of style in a few years or look too trendy. Even an old trusted font that is making a comeback? Was thinking of using Gotham for headlines, Baskerville or Archer Pro for subheads and Gotham Narrow for body copy....but then it just seems like Gotham is overused and everywhere these days. What's something comparable, has same impact as Gotham but not everywhere you look?! And a nice complimentary font to it?\n\nSoooo...What are your top three favorite font pairings that are tried and true, your go to fonts that you're using right now??? Go!\n\n",

So, please...any new or favorite font combination suggestions....greatly appreciated!!!! (This is for a well-known food company....mostly for their internal communications.)\n\n"
