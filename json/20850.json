I realise that this will lead to imperfect results, but for an enforced need of expediency, it could be my only option. For the sake of curiosity, it will also be interesting to see the level of quality versus a manually grafted set.\n\ncheers\n\n",

In addition, the number of pairs derived from a MM instance is extremely small compared to the number of pairs in the 2 masters.\n\nA separate issue, but an important one, is this: After compatibilizing my outlines scrupulously, testing successfully with the \"Blend Fonts\" function, instances from a MM have erratically exploding shapes; some points simply migrate randomly, many units away from their correct location. This behavior is different from what results when outlines are not compatible or path order is switched between masters. I include some examples.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108212723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sevenwack_3941.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108212723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Hwack_4780.gif)\n\n"

The subfolder structure of the both folders is identical. If the user macro folder doesn't have a particular folder that is present in the application macro folder, just create one.\n\nThe locations of the folders for Windows are described in the manual. Note that you can change the location of the user folder in FontLab Studio 5's Options/Preferences dialog. For example, on my Windows machine, it's D:\\FL\\Studio5 rather than the default C:\\Documents and Settings\\Adam Twardoch\\Application Data\\FontLab\\Studio5.\n\nAdam\n\n"
