  "content": "This isn't truly typography-related, but i figure there might be people here interested in this sort of thing anyway.. I just wanted to mention that i was recently able to get ahold of the reprinted and seemingly not-so-easy-to-get-ahold-of [Saul Bass and Associates book](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015164756/http:/youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0125) (originally from 1979). i found it online at a specialized bookstore in Holland called [Nijhof & Lee](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015164756/http:/www.nijhoflee.nl/bookstore/) and it costs for €36 + shipping, which wasn't too bad. it's certainly no definitive book on all things Saul Bass, but given the slim-to-none existence of Saul Bass books in general, it's worth having if you're a fan like myself.\n\n(the first link has some samples from the book)\n\n",

I'd just come back from the Design Museum show and didn't notice the production date on the DVD so mistakenly assumed it was the same comprehensive showreel I'd just seen there, so was rather disapointed! Luckily I'd only hired it.\n\n"
