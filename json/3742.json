  "content": "Ok, so here's a random question. Some background first... I've been doing some OT conversions for a friend who's done some beautiful work using only FontCreator (he must be more patient than i) and i sent him a couple versions, including a TTF with OT info. Would he be able to make minor adjustments in FontCreator without throwing off the embeded OT instructions? If so what are the limits? Any insight would be helpful. thnx again.\n\n",
