      "content": "That rule at the bottom of the second page of the spread doesn't serve any useful design purpose. If it's to indicate the end of a chapter, that's already obvious from the fact that the text doesn't fill the page. It is especially unnecessary if you choose the column alignment where the left column goes to the bottom of the page. But unless you plan to have a rule at the bottom of all pages, I would eliminate it in either alignment scenario.\n\n"

Do you think extending it under both columns is a good idea or should I leave it only under the column it is referencing? (in this case balancing columns would be silly imo)\n\n"

It is, for me, more important that a thought begins and ends cohesively than the bottom of the page always align. I tend to like a little vertical rag, it helps add variety too.\n\n"
