      "content": "There is very little difference between News Gothic and Trade Gothic. News Gothic was designed by M. F. Benton for ATF hand-set metal. Trade Gothic was developed many years later by Jackson Burke as a copy of News Gothic for setting on the Linotype system. There are only a few characters which differ noticeably in design (the cap 'Q' comes to mind). The main difference, I think, will be that the set of Trade Gothic is a little looser due to technicalities of the Linotype system.   \n   \nBut digital News Gothic varies considerably between different foundries. I once provided a quick comparison [here on this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000236/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8060.html).   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
