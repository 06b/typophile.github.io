I can't duplicate the problem by myself on any of my programs on Mac.  \nI've had some clipping issues sometimes before with fonts exceeding the UPM but now the strange thing is that the font gets clipped directly under baseline?!\n\nAny idea what's this about?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420170832im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unnamed_6576.png)\n\n",
