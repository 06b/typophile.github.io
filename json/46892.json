  "content": "Looking up 'Ieuan Rees' on the internet today I came across a Typophile thread of 26 Nov 2004 on David Jones' lettering and on the lettering on the front of the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff. Further down the link Typohile members Dan Reynolds, 'Porky' and John Hudson passed favorable comments on an inscription of mine in Welsh Slate at the Glynn Vivienne Gallery in Swansea, Wales.  \nUnfortunately it was wrongly attributed to another Ieuan Rees from Newport who is a Graphic designer. I come 65 miles further west from a place called Ammanford.  \nBelow is rather a bad photo of that inscription together with a few more in a similar style, as well as one or two in different styles.  \nAll the letters I carve are my own designs and I have designed 3 fonts which have been designed specifically for carving.  \nA recent Typophile thread was on the Trajan Fonr so I have included a photo of a headstone showing my version of the Trajan Roman Alphabet .  \nIf some of you would like to see samples of my work in different catergories please have a look on the link below to my homepage.\n\nIeuan Rees\n\n[http://homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees \"http://homepage.mac.com/ieuanrees\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MUSEUM OF WALES CARDIFF .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/typophile.com/files/MUSEUM%20OF%20WALES%20CARDIFF%20.jpg) | 144.05 KB |\n| [SCULPTURE COURT .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/typophile.com/files/SCULPTURE%20COURT%20.jpg) | 468.3 KB |\n| [PRYER .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/typophile.com/files/PRYER%20.jpg) | 224.06 KB |\n| [GLOWYR .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/typophile.com/files/GLOWYR%20.jpg) | 126 KB |\n| [DAVID BARTLEET .jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/typophile.com/files/DAVID%20BARTLEET%20.jpg) | 654.82 KB |\n| [MAVIS BOULDER.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824142844/http:/typophile.com/files/%20MAVIS%20%20BOULDER.jpg) | 550.25 KB |\n\n",

You know that they were meticulously chiseled of course, but It feels like a special brush just cut through the stone in easy, graceful strokes.\n\n"
