  "content": "(From the January issue of [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype)'s [LinoLetter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/www.linotype.com/38-21255/issue200701.html))\n\nFor more than half a century, Prof. [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf) has been designing typefaces that have helped define how our world communicates. Now we are pleased to present his newest series of families, Palatino Sans and Palatino Sans Informal. An extension of the [Palatino](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Palatino) idea, which was first made manifest in 1950, these groundbreaking sans serif typefaces offer another interpretation of the sans serif genre. Whether set alone or used in combination with each other or the Palatino, Palatino Linotype, or Palatino nova typefaces, Prof. Zapf’s new font families bring a new level of subtlety to typography. In celebration of the release of these new families, customers who make any purchase at Linotype.com through February 28, 2007, will receive Palatino Sans Informal Light as a test font – absolutely free!\n\nMore information about [Palatino Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/www.linotype.com/111707/palatinosans-family.html) and [Palatino Sans Informal](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/www.linotype.com/113189/palatinosansinformal-family.html) can be found at – [http://www.linotype.com/3201/palatinosans.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/www.linotype.com/3201/palatinosans.html \"http://www.linotype.com/3201/palatinosans.html\")\n\n",

      "content": "_these groundbreaking sans serif typefaces_\n\nWe've seen informal faces before. Sumner Stone has done a few.  \nWe've seen underexposed/overexposed and \"press gain\" artefact faces effect before -- from Akira in Acanthus, for instance.\n\n_a new level of subtlety_\n\nWe've had micro-detailed sans faces before. Cronos, for instance, approaches it from the typographic direction, whereas Highlander does so from the lettering direction. Both these are faces carried by Linotype.\n\nThis is not about the typeface, but about the marketing and publicity.  \nIt's Palatino that isn't, with dodgy hype.  \nFor Zapf and Typophile, it could be tighter.\n\n"
