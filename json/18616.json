But I happen to know that the Latinized symbol for the Chinese renminbi, which is theoretically identical to the Japanese yen symbol (it shares the same Unicode code point), is more frequently written as a Y with a single crossbar. So you want to watch the context.\n\nA similar letter apparently appears in [Kazakh Cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20101029193315/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D2%B0).\n\nAs for the Euro symbol, I doubt it would be recognizable with just one bar--it would look too much like the Ukrainian Ye to me in any event.\n\n"

A double bar yen would therefore seem to fit visually with this and the rest of the currency (double bar $ anyone?)\n\n"
