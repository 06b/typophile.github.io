I am looking for a typeface to do my typography design with that relates to my concept \"there is no nothing, nothing is everything.\" So a typeface that conveys just that, or means nothing or somehow relates to nothing or even everything would be great, even if its name contains the word nothing in what ever language although it has to be a good typeface. If you could help it will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
