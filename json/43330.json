(I'm looking for something beyond, \"Yeah, bad fonts!)\n\nThanks.\n\n",

When someone asked me about them, I felt embarrassed because I didn't know what the \"correct\" name was, assuming there was a label for these kinds of fonts.\n\nI Googled \"novelty fonts\" and came up with this site [http://ingrimayne.com/fonts2/\\_noveltya.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121742/http:/ingrimayne.com/fonts2/_noveltya.html \"http://ingrimayne.com/fonts2/\\_noveltya.html\") that referred to \"fonts in which the letters are made from things, from paper clips to bugs to tools\" as letterbat fonts, which I had heard of a long time ago but didn't remember.\n\nI agree with Nick that there is a distinction between letters that are made of things, like tools, and fonts that are embellished with vines, hearts, stars, etc. I'm not sure I like rebus fonts; that reminds me of the game (show) \"Win, Lose, or Draw,\" or Pictionary.\n\nSo far, I like Novelty, Picture fonts, and Pi letters, letterbats, embellished fonts, decorated fonts. I even found dinglets and dingfonts in a Google search!\n\nThis probably doesn't interest the pros who set type or do layouts for magazines, advertisements, newspapers, brochures, etc. But every once in a while it's nice to use fun fonts. Even though Judith Sutcliffe's Hibiscus is not very much liked by professional types, I once saw it used in a travel advertisement. And I'm sure more than one restaurant has used a font embellished with chili peppers. And yes, some of these fonts shouldn't ever see the light of day again (e.g., fonts made out of spermatozoon, poop, etc). Whether we like or hate all or some or none of them, why shouldn't there be a taxonomy of even these fonts?\n\nMaybe we should have a contest!\n\n• Fonts with each letter made of a different element (different tools, musical istruments, animals)  \n• Fonts with each letter made of a common element (nails, logs, barbed wire, typewriter keys, paper clips, bamboo, people in different poses)  \n• Fonts with letters embelished with picture elements (hearts, flowers, stars, eyeballs, bees, bugs, vines)  \n• Fonts with letters inside a picture element (animals, soldiers, trains, blocks, baloons, pumpkins, footprints, leaves)\n\nEven if this doesn't go any further, I thank those of you who uderstood my question -- and contributed ideas, comments, suggestions, and answers.\n\n"

I don't see how splitting into abstract sub-genres would increase clarity. Functionally, Ch's categories all function the same way. In a railway theme font: railway cars with letters on them, letters made of tracks, or letters that look like railway cars all perform the same basic function. Choosing one over another is just a matter of taste\n\nConcrete subgenres are self-evident. Flower theme fonts, footprint theme fonts, feces theme fonts etc.\n\n"
