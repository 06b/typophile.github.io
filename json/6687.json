  "content": " **Veer Announces: The Charles Bluemlein Script Collection**   \n   \nVeer is pleased to announce the availability of the first installment of faces in the [Charles Bluemlein Script Collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=213). Newly refined and digitized by Alejandro Paul exclusively for Veer and the [Umbrella](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/umbrella/) type library, these eight faces were based on the calligraphic renderings of Charles Bluemlein. Rescued from obscurity to bring calligraphic life to your designs.   \n   \nThe unusual way in which these scripts were originally assembled and created - by collecting different signatures and then building complete alphabets from them - is fascinating in itself. Because the set of constructed designs looked nothing like the original signatures, fictitious names were assigned to the new script typefaces. The typeface styles were then showcased in Higgins Ink catalogs.   \n   \nAlejandro Paul and Sudtipos bring the Bluemlein scripts back to life in a set of expanded digital versions, reflecting the demands of today's designer. Extreme care has been taken to render the original scripts authentically, keeping the fictitious names originally assigned to them by Bluemlein.   \n   \nThe typefaces in this collection are available [individually](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=213) or in a [complete package](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000069) containing all eight faces.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Miss Le Gatees](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49000.gif)   \n   \n [Miss Le Gatees](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000075) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mr Canfields](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49001.gif)   \n   \n [Mr Canfields](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000076) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mr Dafoe](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49002.gif)   \n   \n [Mr Dafoe](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000077) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mr Keningbeck](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49003.gif)   \n   \n [Mr Keningbeck](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000078) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mr Lackboughs](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49004.gif)   \n   \n [Mr Lackboughs](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000079) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mr Rafkin](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49005.gif)   \n   \n [Mr Rafkin](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000080) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mr Sheppards](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49006.gif)   \n   \n [Mr Sheppards](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000081) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Mrs Von Eckley](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/49007.gif)   \n   \n [Mrs Von Eckley](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222059/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000082) by Charles Bluemlein & Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella** }   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \nFor more information regarding these new type products, contact:   \n   \nJacqueline Wallace   \n403 313 4942   \n [media@veer.com](mailto:media@veer.com)\n\n",
