      "content": "Brent you fall into the same problem a lot of designers have, there is no reason everything has to be justified to look good. interactive/dvds doesn't need to be letterspaced, it actually looks like a mistake because the i is hanging (visually) to the left (justifing with the L serif) and the s is hanging to the right (justifing with the crossbar of the T). The graphic doesn't read, it could be a pizza. If you feel you really need a graphic make a drawing that the average consumer could recognize. This is not a logo for designers. Now the word LOCKHART needs a lot of work on the letterspacing. Establish the spacing on the biggest problem the LO, its currently floating, then work on the color of the spacing on the other letters. Good start, look forward to revisions. One last thought loose the color when working on a logo. Make it work in black and white and then look at colors.\n\n"

The silhouette of the disc feels more like propellers now. Perhaps the connection from the 'O' to the curves should be a straight rule (thinner than the type strokes)?\n\n"
