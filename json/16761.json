  "content": "Like some other recent critique posts, this font was created for Amy Conger's class at City College of San Francisco. It lacks any adjustment to the vertical and horizontal strokes to make the weights appear balanced. It is not kerned, and the widths of the letters are not adjusted systematically. The font is not adjusted for ink trapping, so on most output devices the a, b, d, g look thick.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Cyclist.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123065303/http:/typophile.com/files/Cyclist.pdf) | 404.45 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "On first glance, many of the curves look bumpy and the stroke weights are inconsistent. Look at the m and n for example.  \nClean curves are very important in particular for a geometric sans like yours. Take some time and learn to make clean curves keeping BCPs perpendicular and their handles of even length. Then come back to your glyphs and give them a new workout. Type is about rhythm.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
