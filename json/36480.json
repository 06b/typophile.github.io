I get the sense they were trying to protect both American foundries from European competition and to help job shops that were constantly having to buy faces that would only be used for a job or two and then sit mouldering and thus not making money. I guess part of the problem was the ad agencies would spec some awful face for a project, the job shop would have to buy it — all metal at the time - not a $60 download from myfonts.com.\n\nAnyway, the funny thing to me was how did they expect to enforce their rulings? Free economy, supply and demand and all that. If an agency wanted some really bad egyptian how did this group think they could stop that?\n\nNot earthshaking, but an interesting read.\n\n—  \nMike\n\n"
