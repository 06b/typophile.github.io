(hvite on black background) I am looking for a version that has thicker hairlines basically. The client i am buying it for have a lot of old readers / brochures are read under bad lighting conditions / a lot of different designers are handling the typeface etc., so it needs to be.. well, easy to handle.\n\nAnyone know any good alternatives? Or revivals, or fonts that are based on Baskerville? I am using it with Futura so it needs to work well with that font too.\n\nCheers\n\n [‹ How wide should letters be?

The Futura is only used in large titles and I’m not sure of the version.. But i guess as long as the Baskerville is close to the “theoretical” Futura I guess it is good\n\n"
