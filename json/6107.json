      "content": "I think Dan is quite right about the logo being pre-digital. The serifs on the 's' look very unusual and exaggerated; the 't' looks like a slanted version of Modern No. 20 or ITC Modern No. 216, but not the italic from those; The 'e' looks like an italic e from almost any font; and the 'r' looks like a custom letter (or at least nothing from the Modern family), since it has no foot serif, and a chopped off terminal on the arm of the 'r'. Of course, the star in the O is added.   \n   \nIn other words, you could probably re-create it only with some significant editing, or custom drawing.\n\n"
