  "content": "Alianza is a complex typographic system wich includes three different but complementary styles so far: Slab, italic and script, with nine weights each one; plus three sets of ornamental fonts: labels, negative labels and ornaments.\n\nThe soul of the family is a slab feeling applied judiciously to the italic and script styles to make it coherent with the whole system.\n\nEach style has three sets of figures: Proportional lining, tabular lining and old style.\n\nYou can mix the three styles in a single piece to obtain more expressive results without worring about the uniformity and complementing the design by using the ornamental sets.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Portada%20PDF_4281.png)\n\nAvailable for purchase at  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/alianza/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/alianza/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/corradine/alianza/\")  \n [https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151/https:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-slab \"https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-slab\")  \n [https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151/https:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-italic \"https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-italic\")  \n [https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151/https:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-script \"https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-script\")  \n [https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-ornaments](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151/https:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-ornaments \"https://www.fontspring.com/fonts/manuel-corradine/alianza-ornaments\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Triptico_4131.png)\n\n",
