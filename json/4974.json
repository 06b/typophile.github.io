It's a font called [Good Girl](http://web.archive.org/web/20050819074844/http:/www.dafont.com/en/search.php?nb_ppp=40&texte=canoe%2Bsurfing&nq=1&q=goodgirl) by Cathy Davies, who states in   \nthe copyright area, \"GoodGirl was inspired by a font in 1960 Modern   \nTeen magazine.\" and \"No copyright; use as you wish\".   \n   \nMs. Davies also created several [other retro fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20050819074844/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/davies/cathy.htm).   \n   \nOh, and a bit from her bio: \"In 1997, Cathy Davies casually put some   \nfonts she designed on a website as a free download. Within two years,   \nthese fonts had been used in graphic designs from TV commercials   \nto mainstream rap albums to riot girl zines.\"\n\n"
