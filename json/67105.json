I'd like to find something really close - I've looked at a lot of fonts trying to find out what it is. The lowercase 't' seems more unusual in other serif faces that I've looked at.\n\nI thought it might be a fairly new typeface - but then I'm not good at spotting anything but the glaringly obvious with fonts - anyway that's why I put it up on this forum. I felt someone here would recognise it.\n\nHere's a shot of a cover:\n\nPete\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100212132858im_/http:/typophile.com/files/weekend_mag_6502.jpg)\n\n"
