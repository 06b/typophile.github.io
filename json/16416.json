  "content": "Hi everyone, my challenge is this: Identify all the typefaces used in the old CCAC stationary for both campuses.\n\nSome back story...  \nI'm doing my thesis project on breaking graphic design...yadayadayada...Bob Aufuldish a professor here at CCA made this stationary which breaks the rule of never use more then five typefaces at one time for anything...yadayadayada..Michael Vanderbyl said to name all the faces instead of just showing the stationary...\n\nI don't have an extensive knowledge of the typefaces out there to know what all these faces are. I have found a few: Crafts (picture 2) is Rockwell, architecture design (picture 5) is Scala Sans Caps, and I think Art (picture 5) is Bodoni.\n\nI have some other guesses: Oakland (picture 2) is Bembo, edu and Oakland (picture 2) is maybe in the Clarendon family, Oakland (picture 6) is Walbaum, and that's all I have so far.\n\nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nFerdinand\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_13.png) | 358.76 KB |\n| [Picture 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_7.png) | 318.15 KB |\n| [Picture 3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%203_6.png) | 282.4 KB |\n| [Picture 4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%204_0.png) | 303.78 KB |\n| [Picture 5.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%205_0.png) | 249.86 KB |\n| [Picture 6.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%206.png) | 336.52 KB |\n| [Picture 7.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%207.png) | 585.42 KB |\n| [Picture 8.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102101042/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%208.png) | 547.71 KB |\n\n",
