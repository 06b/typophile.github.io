  "content": "I was looking through the Google book archive, and found a curious thing:  \nMost German books printed in 1800s have the following numeration(?)  \nscheme printed at the bottom of the pages. Initially, I assumed those letter and number combination to be binders marks, destined to aid in folding pages. But the irregularity of their appearance seems odd. They always appear on the recto page, never seem to go above 5, and are followed by a varying number of unmarked pages until the next letter is introduced.\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what those are?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020171847im_/http:/typophile.com/files/numero_4184.gif)\n\nRecto: A  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: A 2  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: A 3  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: A 4  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: A 5  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: Nothing  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: B  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: B 2  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: B 3  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: B 4  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: B 5  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: Nothing  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: Nothing  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: Nothing  \nVerso: Nothing  \nRecto: C  \nVerso: Nothing  \n...\n\n",

Kind of odd -- both are possible, but are generally the same for the larger part of a book. (The decision to print either a 12-page or a 16-page sheet depends on the sheet size and the size of individual pages.)\n\n"

I think the bookbinders around 1800 were professional enough, to avoid this solution and find a better one.\n\nCan it be, this are remarks for footnotes, which are listed anywhere at the end of the book, explaining or analysing this text part?\n\nThere are to gramar mistakes \"...auf diesen kanapee\". It should be \"...auf dieseM Kanapee\" (on this Canapée). But alright, N is Akkusativ, but it must be M = Dativ.

      "content": "As Ulrich Stiehl rightly pointed out, these are instructions for the binding, very common in German books from the late 17th –&nbsp;early 19th century. Not only are these extremely common, sometimes they are set even in bigger type than the example.\n\nBy the way, the sample text is from the beginning of Christoph Martin Wieland’s verse epic »Oberon« (1780), and the edition is most certainly from about 1800. The grammar (accusative) is sound –&nbsp;not only for 18th century standards.\n\n"
