It's billed as \"exchange for the rest of us.\" With the new service came this logo:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211300im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mmlogo098234098_4170.jpg)\n  \nGawker says that this logo belongs on a package of Japanese soap; Paul Thurrott notes the similarity between it and the Windows ME logo.\n\nSo what do you think? Is this the worst logo in the history of Apple? Do you enjoy its airiness and accessibility? Has Apple taken the iPhone interface too far in its branding? Do you appreciate the motif of a \"cloud\" where all of your data goes? Sound off, typophiles!\n\n",
