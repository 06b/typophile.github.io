  "content": "It's been a few years since we last refreshed our website, and with the growth of our own Exclusives library, some sections had become burgeoning with information, but unjustifaibly hidden away.\n\nOur fresh new design, with revised site structure and navigation, allows us to bring key tools, such as an opportunity to try out our fonts with TypoGFX, and key resources, such as our Exclusives library and project portfolio, to the fore.\n\nOur library is now the primary reason that many of you visit our site, so we're proud to show it off to the full. It's a vital resource for many modifications and customizations, so please do contact us if you would like to discuss the possibilities for something off-the-shelf, something modified, or even a brand new custom commission.\n\nAlso check out our latest font releases: Lexia Ad, Plume Ad and Verveine.\n\nBruno Maag  \nDalton Maag\n\n",
