  "content": "Independent foundries:\n\nI am interested in seeing aproximately what percentage of income comes from each retail outlet.\n\nMost serious foundries would be signed up with two or three, I assume.\n\nExample:\n\nMyfonts.com: 40%  \nfonts.com (monotype): 30%  \nfonthaus.com: 10%  \nfoundry website: 10%  \nveer: 10%  \netc.\n\nAny information would be appreciated and useful as well. Currently I am only signed up with myfonts.com, but I would like to do some revenue projections. This could be useful information for other smaller foundries to tweak thier marketing.\n\nThank you,\n\nJDooley\n\n",

      "content": "James,\n\nThanks for your comments:\n\n\"As to your revenue projections, I can’t see how one foundry’s revenue breakdown can be of any help to another foundry. Unless you are selling the same designs!\"\n\nYes, we probably would cater to different markets, but it is still handy to see what other firms are used by small foundries to see if it would be worthwhile to contact them with the possibility of distribution. I don't think that offering fonts in different venues competes - it just gets the word out that much better.\n\n\"Also, how much are you willing to give up in royalties to these different venues, and what do you get for your money? A secure e-commerce web site and payment gateway are not that expensive to set up. Will these venues really earn their take in the marketing of your types?\"\n\nUnfortunately, most small foundries don't have name recognition. Nobody is going to go to \"smallfoundrywebsite.com\" to get typefaces for a project. They are going to go to a larger site, with more selection to find exactly what they are looking for.\n\n\"A few fonts floating in a sea of other fonts. They are already doing that on the internet, do you want to bury them again in the excessive libraries of some of these mega-resellers?\"\n\nI disagree that releases are \"buried\" on myfonts.com, in particular, and I dont think that typefaces really compete with each other. If a designer sees something he/she likes, they buy it. Myfonts.com does a great job of assisting small foundries with promotion. I would also agree with Nick: obviously, I can't see traffic information for myfonts.com in general, but my growth on myfonts is exponential. Each font that I add brings in more interest to the foundry. My sales on myfonts.com generally come from freelance designers.\n\nIn summary, offering fonts through other firms is a multiplier, helping get your offerings out in front of the public. All I want to know is what other foundries feel is the most effective.\n\nThanks for your comments James,\n\nJDooley\n\n"
