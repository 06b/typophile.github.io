  "content": "We’ve been listening. And we’ve been working hard.  \nTo celebrate our fifth anniversary, we’ve rebuilt Typophile from the ground up. We’re excited to unveil a new system that incorporates a wealth of your input and feedback.\n\nAllow me to point out a few of our new features:\n\n1. Rock solid hosting provided by MediaTemple: MediaTemple has generously provided an amazing hosting package for Typophile, and we’re thrilled with it. We can’t say enough good things about (mt). Next time you’re looking for a host for the site you’re working on, we recommend MediaTemple without hesitation. Read more about our hosting [here](http://web.archive.org/mediatemple).\n\n2. New and improved Forums: We’ve ported over all the content from the old site, and cut out any bad tags (ahem). On the new forums, you can see what threads are hot, and sort messages based on a number of criteria. If there’s an author you favor, you can track their activity simply by clicking on their name. We’ve enabled HTML support. The Forums page keeps an automatic leaderboard of the prolific posters from the last 30 days. Just think, you can actually keep up with Hrant. Or can you?\n\n3. TypoWiki: We’re excited to announce our newest content space, the TypoWiki. If you’ve heard of wikis but still haven’t used one, think of it as a community-written encyclopedia. In our case, it revolves around everything typographic. Jump in and get involved; share your knowledge with the community. Best of all, you can reference any wiki entry from within Typophile simply by wrapping the text in double brackets like this: [typography](http://web.archive.org/wiki/typography).\n\n4. See Who’s Online: Check the bottom of your page to see who’s online in real-time. Send and receive Instant Messages with any other logged-in user!\n\n5. Type News: We’re very excited about this one. The new Typophile News page aggregates typographic news feeds from 17 other sites around the web, including Typographica, Microsoft Typography, ATypI, Veer, and many more.\n\n6. RSS: Fire up your favorite RSS Newsreader (OS X Tiger users, read as: Safari) and subscribe to any of a number of RSS feeds that we make available based on your favorite topic of interest. Subscribe to the whole collective community stream-of-conciousness or focus your attention on a specific area of the critique. Or Type-ID.\n\n7. Uppercase Blog: To thank the people who have kept us afloat these five years, we’re giving all Uppercase members their own blog. All blogs are folded together on the [Uppercase blog](http://web.archive.org/blog) page, or read any author individually. We really appreciate the support you’ve given us, and we hope you enjoy (and use!) the new perk.\n\n8. Watch lists: Add your favorite authors to your personal watch list and it will surface their latest post activity.\n\n9. My Typophile: Flag your favorite content areas for your own customized start page. Sift the signal from the noise.\n\n10. New Home Page: Our new home page keeps your finger on the pulse of what’s happening on Typophile. Dive into content based on What’s Hot, What’s New, or based on moderator recommendations. Just about everything on this page is dynamically driven.\n\n11. Thinking about advertising on Typophile?: Our new ad engine rocks. Track your banners in real-time; see what kind of impressions and clickthroughs you’re getting. Recieve daily or weekly updates on progress via email. All this at a fraction of the cost of other sites, and best of all, your ad revenue enables Typophile to make itself even better. Talk to our resident adman Joe Pemberton to get yourself started.\n\nFor what it’s worth, we probably shouldn’t launch Typophile yet. This is very much a Beta release, so you’re bound to see design problems and technical glitches. In the spirit of community, we hope you’ll help us identify and squash these bugs during the Beta period.\n\nWe also want to take this opportunity to thank Punchcut’s own Christian Robertson and Dan Harrison for countless sleepless nights and typing their fingers to the bone to get Typophile to where it is today. You guys are truly the best.\n\nThanks for your support, and enjoy-\n\nEveryone at [Punchcut](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116083046/http:/www.punchcut.com/)\n\n",
