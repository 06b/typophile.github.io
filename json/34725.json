  "content": "Hi,\n\nI don't have an image of my requested font; please let me explain:\n\nThe font I am looking for is very similar to Cooper Black. It's kind of a variation of it done by a famous font designer (whose name I also can't remember). It was so close that a non-designer probably couldn't tell it from Cooper Black.\n\nI read about this font 2 or three years ago when it was introduced, and it is available online somewhere. I don't think the name is anything similar to Cooper...\n\nCan you name the font?\n\nWould be just great ;-)\n\nTIA  \nHuggy\n\n",
