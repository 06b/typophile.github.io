  "content": "G'day guys,\n\nJust wondered if anyone could recommend a good OCR software package for mac OSX. It seems that there a few that only work with PC. We need to scan some back issues of our journal for an anthology, but as the layouts vary greatly the OCR would need to be reasonably smart. I've experimented with the one that comes with the penultimate Acrobat Professional 7 but it seems to require a lot of fine-tooth checking and changing which kind of defeats the purpose of saving time.  \ncheers\n\n--N\n\n",
