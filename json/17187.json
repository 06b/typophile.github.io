  "content": "I have been working for a year in this design agency and we have never bougth a single font. We only use the old (I assume stolen) fonts on the company server. So, these old fonts are classics and still very good, but now and again a particular job comes along where you would like to splash out on a comtemporary design. This has been impossible so far since my boss refuses to buy fonts. Today I tricked him and used a screen shot of Neo Tech —which I talked on this [thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20110603043005/http:/typophile.com/node/17149)— for the Identity of a new trade fair. He liked the font but he became very deffensive when I mentioned that he would have to buy the font if he wanted to use it for his client. We looked at the price on different font stores and I tried to ease out the pain by telling him that he should think of it as a long term investment. He keeps fighting back —no! it's too expensive— I tell him —it takes months somtimes years to make a good typefaces— I was gaining no ground. He says with renewed vigour —no! it's too expensive, who buys these fonts anyway?— I tell him —this job needs new fonts, something different, modern, you are the one who always wants to make ground-breaking design!— I was using the oldest tricks to convince him. Then he said —this family of fonts costs €429 and it took the designer months to make, but a novelist might take even longer and he sells his book for only €20— I was silenced. What could I say to refute that? I had to agree with him and get along with my immense frustration. So please don't shoot me for asking you the exact same question because I am on your side.\n\nWhy does a family of fonts costs €429 when a novel only costs €20\n\n",

His resistance to spending money on useful tools is a symptom of a bigger problem. Someone who is a business advisor should be talking to him about how he runs the business. Design isn't some kind of dollars/kilos proposition; the work and the ideas give value to the product. I'm surprised he is so frightened of budgeting even modest amounts to support his business.\n\nThe novel is an end product that can't be repurposed infinitely for use in a million other ways. The type family is a TOOL that can be used for many, many purposes including logos, magazines, etc. A little like a laser printer. If your office gets a new laser printer or a new digital camera, who pays for it? Does your boss then have to reduce your pay because profit is lower? I think not. That's not business anymore. Tools, especially the proper ones, are part of running a business. If your boss really wants you to do \"cutting edge\" work, then he should have the clients pay for new fonts, or at least partial costs. Since you will use the fonts a lot over the years, each client can pay a small amount of the cost, like how large equipment gets expensed over several years.\n\nWhere does this person think Garamond, Helvetica, Caslon and Gill Sans came from?\n\n"

So I reproached him with basic logic and upheld the values of intellectual property, other creatives who make money for what the do, etc.\n\nBut as Carl mentioned above, at a certain point it's not worth the effort. If these people pay sh\\*t for effort, then they can eat sh\\*t as well. Deep down, some people enjoy being thieves.\n\n_Excerpted from DesignTalkBoard.com, a small design forum I haunt to understand different segments of our \"type buying\" public_:\n\n**Re: free fonts**  \n« Reply to this topic #21 on: 9 Jan 06 » by JianSabu  \nQuote from: jchrome on 8 Jan 06  \n_I think all fonts should be free, but that's just my .02 - I don't expect many to agree with that._\n\nIn that case, why shouldn't a logo design using only type, or producing prepress files for a newsletter be offered free to a client as well?\n\nDo you really think your time and creativity is any more valuable than a type designer's? How about using photography or calligraphy in your graphic design project... should you be able to use the photographer's or calligrapher's work in your project for free?\n\nThe problem concerning the \"value\" of fonts (a software file or mechanical object that can be used to produce type output) is that since the advent of \"desktop publishing\" and personal computers that are used for creating graphical files, fonts have been made readily available (bundled with the computer or bundled with software packages such as Adobe's \"InDesign\").\n\nAlso, the software tools to produce usable font files are also readily available and much easier to use than when the first PostScript fonts were produced for the Macintosh. Novice and amatuer \"type designers\" generally distribute their type fonts for free or on a shareware basis while improving the quality of the outline data, spacing and kerning tables, so eventually they can meet the quality standards of font distributors like \"MyFonts.com\".\n\nAnother MAJOR problem is that a very well designed typeface by a well know type designer (like Matthew Carter or Ed Benguiat) can be easily copied nowadays (as with the music industry where song writers and performers work are constantly being ripped off). Just because fonts are easy to duplicate, slightly modified and re-issued doesn't make the original LESS VALUABLE, just like music or movies.\n\nThere really isn't any argument or justification for thinking ALL FONTS should be free, anymore than ALL MUSIC or MOVIES should be available for free just because you can download it (from an illegal source). I agree that it is very hard for most people to recognize if a typeface is from an original or licensed source as opposed to a non-licensed rip-off. That's why some of us try to be helpful by suggesting reputable sources for Free and Shareware fonts listed earlier in this thread.\n\nFreeware and shareware are fine and OK, so if you don't want to pay for fonts stick to the reputable distributors PLEASE. Thank you.\n\nNorbert\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Re: free fonts**  \n« Reply to this topic #22 on: 10 Jan 06 » by jchrome  \n_Quote from: JianSabu on 9 Jan 06  \nWaaaaa!

If an organisation's software audit excludes fonts then it may not be fully compliant and if that is the case that organisation faces legal liability.\n\nEven if an audit does include fonts then on-going compliance cannot be guaranteed: the ease with which fonts can be downloaded or copied means regular auditing is essential.\n\nJohn Lovelock, Director General of The Federation, said: \"What companies forget is that fonts are supplied under terms (of the software application licence) For instance, most fonts are licensed for installation on five workstations, but like application software some are only allowed to be installed on one workstation. If companies are not considering the number of users that need the font when purchasing they are likely to be underlicensed.  \nAlso, many companies do not realise that permitted use can vary from font to font, even in major operating systems. Choosing a font with restricted usage terms can spell trouble.\n\nìThis is a huge issue, but most corporates are unaware that it even exists. Corporate end users must understand the gravity of font software theft,î he added.\n\n\"Corporate directors be warned ñ to achieve software compliance the issue of fonts cannot be ignored. In our experience most organisations are not even aware that fonts have to be audited in exactly the same way as other software.\"\n\n"

But the RIAA is not the analogous organization; it is ASCAP, which does work in getting songwriters paid royalties, so far as I know. (There is another similar organization, I believe, BMI). RIAA's questionable effectiveness is going after those who file share without making money from it, whereas ASCAP deals exclusively with businesses. It's a different model. What I am suggesting would not be going after scrapbookers who use pirated fonts, but rather businesses who make money from using them.

I suppose that is because both have royalties to split from the same broadcast event. In this respect it seems to me type designers and foundries are in a similar situation.\n\nMicrosoft doesn't sell fonts, so they wouldn't be a logical part of such an organization. Adobe does bundle, but they sell a lot of other fonts, so I don't see why their interest would be at all opposed to a monitor of publications to see that font rights are being observed.\n\nOf course, the big difference from ASCAP is that neither foundries nor designers are paid for each public use of their work, so the monitoring will be to catch piracy rather than insure correct payment for each use.\n\nA real conflict might arise if the foundries were also magazine publishers or ad agencies or such, but this is not the case.\n\nSo it still seems to me so far a viable idea, if the finances of it seem good to those with the most money and most to gain, namely the larger foundries.\n\nI heard Bruno Steinhardt of Linotype at Typotechnica saying piracy was a major issue facing the industry, and above we see Erik Spiekermann of Fontfont and Fontshop also passionate about the issue. So do they think it is worth 'putting their money where their mouth is?' Small foundries could join for less and have use of their fonts also monitored.\n\n"
