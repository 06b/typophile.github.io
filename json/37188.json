  "content": "Why do you enjoy working with type?\n\nI'll answer first:  \nI love the craft, the small discoveries, the satisfaction of making a layout work, finding the right typeface for the job, the history, the strict limitations of the 29 characters (I'm å nørwegiæn), wanting to use a typeface for years and then suddely finding the right ocassion. Among other things.\n\n",

During those years, I spent vast amounts of time editing bitmaps of Helvetica and Clarendon, simulating kerning (for a graphics display system that wasn't anywhere near true kerning), and reveling in the actual typeface choices that my office neighbors in the art department could select at will.\n\nI left the job when 3M bought out the company (I feared there was no stable future in computer graphics), but the experience of type design, umm, left an imprint on me.\n\n"
