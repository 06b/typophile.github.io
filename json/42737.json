In those cases where I edit for content, I always indicate that I have done so.\n\nMy suggestion would be to allow the edit feature as before, where the comment remains in its proper order in the thread, but for there to be a way for readers to know that the comment has been edited.\n\n"

That’s not the issue here. The issue is that people can fundamentally change an entire conversation unfairly. I’ve seen it done, MANY times, here on Typophile.\n\nBeing able to edit spelling and grammar errors is one thing, materially changing the intent and content of a post is another. A time element sounds like the best idea to me. You have 24 hours to edit your post. After that? You go down in cache as the stupidest jerk face ever.\n\n"

Imposing a time limit (24 hours works quite well on most board I’ve frequented that have time limits) is a good compromise. If you haven’t caught your typo within 24 hours, chances are no one else has, either; and your options for attempting to alter the outlook of the thread for posterity are limited.\n\nAnd naturally all edits should be visible. The most efficient way I’ve seen of doing this is the Wikipedia-style way of displaying edits. In it, a string of text will be automatically inserted into the post, along the lines of, “Last edited on Wed 23 July 2007 by Poster. Edited 5 times in total. [View post history.](http://web.archive.org/#)”\n\nWith this system, not only can all viewers see when the post was last edited and by whom, but if they so wish, they can also view an entire threaded display of previous versions of the post, with typos, vitriol, broken HTML, and whatever gems may be lurking in the hidden shadows quite intact. It makes it impossible to completely alter the way a thread looks for posterity, since the original remarks will always be visible. It also forces the poster to consider that previous actions are visible when editing, so turning, “You are such a moron” into, “I’ve always really liked you” doesn’t work. Instead, one would have to find other workarounds, such as, “Heat-of-the-moment personal attack removed with apologies”.\n\n"
