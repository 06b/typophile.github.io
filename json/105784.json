      "content": "The font used in the samples is Linotype's hot metal Old Style No. 1 with Ronaldson conversion. I measured the type and think it is 10 pt.\n\nFYI, the Ronaldson conversion characters are /C /E /F /G /L /S /T /AE /OE and /ct in the Roman, Small Caps and Italic. In addition, in the Roman are these: /3 /5 /6 /7 /9 and /. /:\n\nWhoever typeset it was pretty sloppy with their use of the Ronaldson conversion characters, mixing the normal characters and Ronaldson conversion characters, sometimes in the same word. This probably happened because the conversion characters got mixed into the font's magazine by mistake.\n\n"

      "content": "George, interesting, thanks.\n\nBy “Ronaldson conversion characters” you obviously refer to the occasional capitals that have the little tick marks on the line ends for the characters & numbers you list.  \nAs for, “Whoever typeset it was pretty sloppy with their use of the Ronaldson conversion characters …”, Yes: jilting to read – over and above the fact that whole paragraphs are set in all caps.\n\nBut, I believe you may have solved the mystery of: Why did the publishing organization revert back to the first edition’s typeface (Century Schoolbook) for the Third Edition? They would have wanted to put the mish-mash that came out in this Second Edition behind them as soon as possible. I believe this also accounts for the Second Edition’s rarity – no desire for second or more imprints.\n\nAs for “Ronaldson conversion”, Google of “Linotype Ronaldson conversion Old Style” returned a link to:\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/19769](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163152/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19769 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/19769\")\n\nWhich pointed to a bit of a history lesson here:\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163152/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/\")\n\nThanks again,  \nPaul\n\n"
