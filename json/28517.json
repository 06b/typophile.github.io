      "content": "In CS for Mac, it works in InDesign, but not Illustrator or Photoshop -- in those the right-hand negative sidebearing is ignored, so the denominator doesn't tuck under.  \nIt doesn't work in Quark 7, as that app ignores the OT feature code for fractions, making fractions on the fly from the numerator, fraction-slash, and denominator characters.\n\nI think it's OK to ignore the present non-functionality of my nut-fraction feature in Illustrator and Photoshop, as I don't consider those to be situations where people use fractions (although there may be exceptions). And for Quark, users still get proper fractions, only they're \"slash\" fractions, not \"nut\".\n\nNonetheless, I may abandon this feature when the typeface is released, with the nut fractions (quarters, eigths, thirds and sixteenths) only being available as composite characters from the glyph palette.\n\nAs with many OpenType features, I think documentation is extremely important, and what may really be needed for a multi-featured OT typeface family is a hard-bound user manual, as well as a similar online resource at the foundry.\n\n"

Fractions in dimmensions or technical illustrations are certainly possible. I just wish that OpenType features were supported completely by at least all publishing applications.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
