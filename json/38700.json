Have I chosen a good base font to play with?  \n2. Are the two s's legible????  \n3. What can I do to make them more like s's without losing the simple elegance of the design?  \n4. Have I treated the shapes correctly? I mean I see that the horizontal strokes are a tiny bit narrower than the verticals? Have I kept this consistent enough in the two s's?  \n5. Is the second s joined appropriately? or is there a better way to make it flow/read correctly?\n\nI know I've asked a lot, but I'm a real novice and would appreciate any tips that come my way.\n\nThanks very much\n\n",

Until unless you are using that typeface itself as a logo.\n\n_2. Are the two s’s legible????_  \nNot at all. They looks oo to me.  \nAlso these two oo's looking smaller than the m.\n\n"

      "content": "satya,\n\nThanks for your quick reply. I agree, they look like oo, actually they are based on the letter o, and then adjusted to look like ss, but something is missing, can you help?\n\nI tried to put a little peak on top of the o shape to imply an s, but it loses its simplicity. Also I have noticed that if you get the shape wrong you can easily imply a rude picture... ie. a woman's chest area! not good.\n\n"

I'm not sure it still has it's simple elegance, but maybe you could give me pointers on how to refine it back to being elegant again, but legible this time!\n\nThanks guys\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109014340im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gen-3-Brand-1-4_04_6134.png)\n\np.s. Just a thought, anyone, do I even need the & symbol in there? I put it in because of the visual attactiveness of it, but I'd prefer people to call it \"MSS\", not \"M and SS\", so could the logo be made even smoother without it? or is it quite sexy?\n\n"

If you need another reason not to include it, that may be it.\n\n(If you decide to keep it, maybe play with color to help kick it away from the \"mess\" message?)\n\n"

      "content": "I don't think you need the &. Try some variations without it.\n\nYour second version has the right idea, but needs some clean up. Try the upward stroke on the left of the s as a straight diagonal line as opposed to the bit of curvature it has now. Then, I'd have the right, downward stroke curve outward right away, instead of the little hook.\n\nAlso, try an 'm' without the top left vertical section, just a straight curve. It might match the sensibility of the 's's better.\n\nAnd not that we're focused on the other parts of the logo yet, but you should play around with other typefaces for the formal name, as well as lockups. The two styles aren't meshing well.\n\n"
