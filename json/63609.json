All weights show up in the menu.  \n(Don't have CorelDraw 12 for testing though.)\n\nCould you sent me, per font, screenshots of the first two FontInfo pages that contain the font names?\n\n"

It is Corel 12 (and I assume previous versions) the one that has problems with them.\n\nDo you think it would do any harm to have the checkbox 'Font is Bold' marked just to gain better compatibility with old programs?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nR.\n\n"
