As the GNOME site says, \"happy font hacking\"...   \n   \n [http://www.gnome.org/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010202524/http:/www.gnome.org/fonts/)   \n   \n(Oh, and incidentally, Vera Sans Mono has become my default monospaced font. It's quite readable, and I like it even better than Andale.)\n\n",
