I had someone ID a font for me as Bradley about November-ish and i can't seem to find it when i do a search (someone had posted an image i wanted to reference). I looked for the corresponding date in the archive section and it seems a whole chunk of months from Dec 2003 to Jun 2004 are missing.   \n   \nor have i just lost my marbles? that's a perfectly plausible situation. at any rate if anyone could point me to where to find the missing archives or reassure me that i haven't lost it completely i would appreciate it. thnx!\n\n",
