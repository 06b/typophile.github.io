  "content": "Respected Sir,  \nI am developing a Quranic Font. Here in the Quranic Script there are two shapes of Dammatan, two of Fathatan and two of kasratan. But in unicode there are only one position for these shapes.  \nI need two shapes for fathatan, dammatan and kasratan.  \nI try to achieve the second option, I make three shapes for them and put them in seperate glyph.  \nI tried to achieve this glyph or shape using ccmp feature, NOT WORKED, I tried to use this by mkmk, NOT WORKED, I tried through Cursive attachment, NOT WORKED, I tried some more logics but failed.  \nSome Aeraab's (diacritics) are working on each other but I need when I press fatha fatha it replaces my required glyph.\n\nCan I achieve this. I am trying to do this in MS Word now.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

However...\n\nIn the case of the different kinds of dammatan, fathatan and kasratan in Quranic typesetting, these have been proposed for distinct encoding in Unicode and are likely to be approved.\n\n"
