We're trying to use it on a website as an alternative to Univers Light Condensed.\n\nDoes anyone know how available it is? Is it a standard on most computers and browsers? Any information would help.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

You can see sIFR in use here on typophile – the headlines are dynamically rendered in the \"featured face\".\n\nI would ask me, is it worth the money i have to pay for a proper technical solution. Or isn't it better to avoid \"Arial Narrow\" with another design concept.\n\nGood luck\n\n"
