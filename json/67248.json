It's a whole bunch of different faces.\n\nThe Michael Winter book looks like a font since the distress on all repeated letters is the same. It looks like there might be two different 'E's; one thick, one thin; so it might be OpenType enabled or even have uppercase letters in the lowercase set.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
