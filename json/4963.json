Since it's aimed at young people, it allso need to be a bit modern.   \n   \nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated...   \n   \nSv.\n\n",

If I had that assignment I would collect all the graphics available for the first issue and samples of ads (if applicable) along with scripts of articles to run. Then I would sift and sort that hard copy along with the general tone of the book and the demographics of the readers. Once you have a feeling for the book, you might begin setting some paragraphs and display copy. Perhaps you might want to use different typefaces for each article. Look at the publications that appeal to you and see what they have done. I don't think you need to commit yourself to a specific face. More important is the layout of the book and how to keep the ads from getting in the way of readership. The short answer would be KISS -- Keep it Simple Sveinbjorn.\n\n"
