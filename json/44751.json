I LOVE Lubalin Graph but it's not wide enough and Hellenic Wide is too 'country.' Any alternate ideas? Is there a super wide Futura or something equally mod/scifi/60s?\n\nthanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Keep in mind that much of Lubalin Graph's character comes from the fact that it's a geometric (the rounds are \"perfect\" circles). Once you go wide, you get ovals. You might want something more square like [Dispatch Extended](http://web.archive.org/web/20110506142514/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/dispatch_extended/), which is less country than Hellenic.\n\nAs for sans serifs, there's nothing more mod/scifi/60s than [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20110506142514/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/eurostile_std_ot_virtual/).
