  "content": "Hello Typophiles:\n\nI need some help to get my German on!\n\nI’m setting a book in StormType’s Walbaum Text with Optima all-caps titling, but there are several places where I’d like to use Walbaum at titling sizes.\n\nI like Storm’s cut because they softened the face with slightly rounded edges of the serifs. The serifs also have slightly “scupped” top and bottom faces. I think this gentle flaring of the characters works nicely with Optima’s bell-bottom-wearing profiles. But, Storm’s cut is meant for use at 11-point and below - these rounded shapes look too chunky when enlarged.\n\nDoes anyone know of a cut of Walbaum that has thinner and perfectly square serifs like H&FJ’s gorgeous Didot for use at display sizes?\n\nI suppose I could sneak a little Didot in where needed (purists gasp here), but it’s got that Frenchy look.....and this is a book about German philosophy no less (Kant, Schopenhauer!)\n\nI may just have to settle for using tiny tracked-out Walbaum small caps subtitles under Optima titles...\n\nThanks - DiSH\n\n [‹ trends for 2018](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121160831/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49987 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Body and Header Font Combos (recommendations) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121160831/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49973 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
