I have fiddled with the 'Generate Font' options, but to no avail. Are there any tricks to this? Maybe some other setting that I could have overlooked.\n\n",

      "content": "1. The topic title is misleading: I am almost sure your lookups are exported, but for some reasons aren't working in ID.\n\n2. You haven't provided enough information on settings you used for TTF/OTF output. In particular, important options are \"OpenType\", \"Apple\" and \"Old style 'kern'\".\n\n3. Have you registered your kerning lookup for proper language systems (i. e. at least latn{dflt})?\n\n4. I am not an InDesign expert, but as I recall from some older Internet discussions there are several bugs/features related with kerning support in ID. These problems may vary from version to version. In particular you should check the following:\n\n-- does you font support the Windows 1250 (Central European) codepage (i. e. not just Windows 1252)?\n\n-- does your font include any GSUB features except your GPOS kerning lookup?\n\n"
