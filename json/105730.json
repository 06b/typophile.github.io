  "content": "[Chefscript Typeface - Buy licenses at MyFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118/http:/myfonts.us/6jqbgN)  \nChef Script is an experimental font designed by Carlos Fabian Camargo G. Its fantasy design contains 1463 glyphs to compose words, phrases and short messages on small and large sizes. The idea was born in a sketchbook that was perfected again by hand and achieving \"non-neutral drawings\" on tracing paper. With bezier digitization the empty and full parts of letters appeared with soft and eloquent curves as calligraphic result produces optimal readability.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_6383.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_6380.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_5851.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_5559.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/5_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_3732.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/6_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_5894.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021118im_/http:/typophile.com/files/7_chefscript_andinistasdotnet_6594.png)\n\n",
