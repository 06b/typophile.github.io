This is indeed an exact match.  \nAccording to the note for the OPTI font it was \"Originally a phototype by Filmotype.\"  \nUnless there was a version with the same digital outlines by another fontmaker before OPTI produced OPTI Racer, this is presumably an original digital creation by OPTI.  \nDoes anyone know of a matching digital font before the OPTI font?  \nI only ask because of of the notorious reputation of OPTI/Castcraft as a forger of unauthorized clones of digital fonts. A relatively small proportion of its fonts were original digital creations.  \nDon\n\n"

And the 69 fonts digitized thus far make it clear that nobody is racing to produce the more generic sans or serifs.\n\nI was just wanting to clarify for anyone accessing this thread in the future and wanting to use a font like this commercially that Filmotype isn't defunct; the legitimate rights belong to Stuart Sandler.\n\nBy the way, I appreciate the fact that Sandler and colleagues are including the batch of alternates that most Filmotype fonts had.\n\n"

I don't know whether OUP used the OPTI digital or a Filmotype analog source.\n\nI find the Racer typeface design superior to Fashion Didot for this purpose.\n\nAnyone trying something similar for a commercial project today would be stuck in the bind of using a digital font from OPTI -- an orphan foundry where there is no way of obtaining appropriate intellectual property permissions -- or making the font from scratch.\n\nI do hope that Stuart Sandler's digitization plan has Racer in the next batch.\n\nCheers.\n\nDon\n\n"
