I am considering Tartine Script bold and Village’s Galaxie Cassiopeia Bold (not Basic Bold). If anyone has these, can they type out the word “son” in all lowercase at 72pt and email me the Illustrator outlines to david dot nix at dfs dot com?

As you can imagine, I’m not too excited by any request for outlines of a specific letter combination of Galaxie Cassiopeia. I didn’t work on the face for 18+ months to just give it away, in whole, or a letter at a time.\n\nThanks for your interest in the face.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015194547im_/http:/typophile.com/files/son_5537.png)\n\n"
