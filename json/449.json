  "content": "Hi, folks. I don't know if you guys have had this problem, but I found a solution so I thought I would share it.   \n   \nProblem: When repeatedly testing my new family of fonts, one weight was consistently scrambled in Suitcase and Word. When I typed \"ABC\" I got \"ZAB\" or nothing at all. (In Adobe apps it worked fine.)   \n   \nSolution: Reset the OSX font caches   \n   \nHow to (gleaned from [http://www.extensis.com/support/5d.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111212442/http:/www.extensis.com/support/5d.html)):   \n1) Reboot in OS 9   \n2) Use Find to locate the following files:   \ncom.apple.FCacheLocalDomain   \ncom.apple.FCacheUserDomain   \ncom.apple.FCacheClassicDomain   \n.FODB\\_User   \n.FODB\\_Classic   \n3) Trash those files and empty the trash   \n4) Reboot in OSX and test the fonts   \n   \n   \nIf they still don't work:   \n   \n1) Reboot in OS 9   \n2) Empty the following folders (put the contents in the trash):   \nOSX HD/System/Library/Caches   \nOSX HD/Library/Caches   \nOSX HD/users/yourusername/Library/Caches   \n3) Empty the trash   \n4) Reboot in OSX and test the fonts\n\n",
