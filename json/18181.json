      "content": "I actually think it's sufficiently distant from Frutiger,  \ncertainly more distant than some other fonts out there.  \nFor one thing, it has a nice warmth, due probably to the  \nsoft finish, but also the variances in the terminals, etc.\n\nIn fact the main \"problem\" that jumps out -the pervasive  \nwobbly outlines\\*- might actually be something to keep in  \nthe end! It might add just the fauve feeling that a sans  \nlike this needs so badly to be: attractive; and different.\n\n\\* Like see the right side of the counter of the \"b\".  \nBut really almost everywhere. :-/\n\nA macro thing: I would make the descenders a bit shorter.\n\nAnd lc micro stuff:  \n- \"c\": a bit too narrow.  \n- The eye of the \"e\" is a hair too big.  \n- The \"f\" and \"t\" are imbalanced - but again here this might be a good thing!  \n- \"k\": maybe a bit too conservative.  \n- \"r\": beak terminal a bit too out-of-character; try it like in the \"s\".  \n- \"v\": too wide.  \n- \"z\": too sharp.\n\nI might look at the UC and nums later.\n\n--\n\nI think you should think about what this needs to be, and I  \nhave a feeling you'll actually uncover something very useful.\n\nhhp\n\n"
