Just Si?\n\nI’d prefer to picture Steve Jobs in Starbucks with a straight-off the factory floor Macbook Air. He’s sipping his quad espresso, enjoying a slice of Banana loaf while Sarah McLachlan, or some other iTunes favorite plays unobtrusively over the PA. He decides to check out the extremely clever ad he’s had placed on the online version of the Wall Street Times, so using a single gesture the WSJ page comes up. His smug expressions immediately turns to one of shock, the espresso goes flying landing on his shiny new toy. He whips out his iPhone and within minutes an army of Flash devs quickly start to fix the ad, fearing for their very lives.\n\n"
