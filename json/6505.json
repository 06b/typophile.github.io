As long as they are agree with me then they are right too.   \n   \nLucky them.   \n   \nIn other words what appears to be the worst may actually be the best. I am sure of John Downer would have some comments worthy of this discussion.   \n   \nUnknown is the intended point size or for that matter \"the \"source\"? Also, since this face is a revival one must consider philosophy. It is a curational process. A process greatly misunderstood by the digital type community.   \n   \nInterpretation, or \"smoothing\" is not curation, sorry.   \n   \nAlso there is this very strange habit by all to show illustrations at a greatly enlarged pt. size the biggest curational mistake made by other font developers when making comparisons to historical typefaces. Also you have not shown any comparison to even a printed example from \"the original hot metal Centaur\". Would that not seem important to you? Well, if not, revivals are not the business for you. They should be shown at the intended type size. In other words if it is based on 6 point you should pick 6 point in your menu to make \"fair\" comparison. Did any of you ever think about that?

It would be best to compare output from page layout software in high resolution rather than these TV sets which are more appropriate to Gerry Springer episodes, or sometimes, these forum discussions.   \n   \nBut whatever you are showing could be compared with Lanston's Metropolitan shown here.

      "content": "Gerald,   \n   \nTo answer some of your questions: the GIF images I posted were rendered using Ghostscript to bitmap, then downsampled by a factor of 8, and a gamma of 1.8 applied. The final gamma step is to minimize the subtle jaggie-like effects that remain even when doing an anti-aliased rendering.   \n   \nI believe the font technology is quite modern in all cases; the Agfa sample is in OpenType, while yours is from the PDF file posted on your website.   \n   \nIn any case, I seriously doubt that font technology has a significant effect. Yes, converting from one spline format to another can result in some loss, but among high-quality formats such as TT (quadratic Beziers), PS (cubic Beziers), and Ikarus (I've seen this described as a Hermite spline, but unfortunately no longer have my Karow book to check) the loss should be minimal. In particular, the most noticeable effect of quantizing to a 1000-unit grid should be slight deviations from tangent continuity at knot points.   \n   \nBTW, I know my spline math pretty well. Lately I've been experimenting with Cornu spirals as a potentially better primitive for font design than Bezier splines, and have been cranking through quite a bit of math involving first- and second-order continuity, error metrics for fitting splines to complex analytical curves such as the Cornu spline, and so on. Just a warning in case you were thinking of getting into a mathematical pissing match with me **:** )   \n   \nI _absolutely_ believe in optical scaling, and absolutely agree that it's a mistake to trace patterns designed for large sizes and expect them to work when mathematically scaled down. In fact, I've been doing a rather careful study of the ATF books to attempt to reverse engineer the techniques the Bentons used to achieve optical scaling, and intend to write up my findings soon.   \n   \nThat said, I do not believe your methodology of digitizing pattern plates, even those designed for text sizes, is sound. I believe, if one is aiming for accuracy, the goal should be to make the _end product_ match the original as closely as possible. The intermediate steps may shed light, but ultimately what matters is the patterns made by pigment particles on a piece of paper.   \n   \nIn particular, your beloved pattern plate goes through two important steps before becoming a printed page. First, it is engraved into a matrix. The cutting tool used in this process has a non-zero radius, so the resulting matrix does not have exactly the same shape as the pattern plate. The Bentons were absolute masters at controlling these parameters to achieve good scaling, rather than just treating the engraving process as a degradation of the Platonic ideal represented in the pattern plate.   \n   \nThe second important step, of course, is transferring ink from the type surface to the paper. Understanding this process down to the micron level is hugely complex, involving as it does the physics of the viscosity of the ink base, capillary action of the fibers of the paper, and so on. Then, the appearance is further affected by issues such as light scattering below the surface of the paper. These more subtle effects are a large part of the reason why offset printing, no matter how fine, cannot reproduce exactly the look and feel of letterpress, and why letterpress still has a niche in book arts. Again, I've studied these effects fairly carefully as part of my research into halftone screening, just in case you were wanting to get into a pissing match about _that_.   \n   \nThat said, it's not that hard to make an approximate model of letterpress printing. The main effect is gain, and beyond that there's a subtle softening effect, as well as of course an edge roughening as the ink interacts with the texture of the paper at the roughly 100-micron level.   \n   \nMetal type designers know all this and take it into account. If gain were the enemy, they'd cut matrices with thinner and thinner strokes as the size went down, to compensate.   \n   \nTo turn your questions back at you: is it historically accurate to print text using a modern, extremely high resolution offset press or laser printer, using outlines digitized from pattern plates? To me, the answer is clearly no.   \n   \nLastly, I believe you have poor quality digitizations of these masters. One of my main metrics for evaluating this quality is the variation in curvature; high curvature variations are characterstic of \"bad splines\", especially generated from autotracing. A particularly striking example is the terminal of the middle stroke; while the lower half is relatively smooth, the upper half has a long flat section bracketed by two tight turns. I see no evidence that this is intended by the original designer, borne out in any printed samples of metal Centaur, or that it's an aesthetically defensible improvement over the original design.   \n   \nTo return to the issue of scaling, we now live in an era of postmodern typography. In the days of metal, the scaling adjustments were locked into the metal when the matrix of a particular size was cut. These days, while sophisticated designers choose digital fonts with optical scaling appropriate to the size, it's far more common for one size to fit all. Even when optical sizes are available, I'm sure it's not unheard of to use a \"text\" scale in a larger size to create a softening effect, or vice versa. When you use an outline in a large size, the curves must be smooth. Considering that the original metal rendition of Centaur was for the Metropolitan Museum for use in titling, I'm sure you can appreciate this.   \n   \nWhen reproducing in small scales, the details of curves are less important. What becomes more important is the robustness of the thin/thick ratio, openness of counters, etc. In your \"Metropolitan\", I see little or no evidence of such adjustments; in particular, your stroke contrast and serif design appear no more robust to me than either the Agfa version or my tracing based on 60 point metal originals.   \n   \nYes, I believe in adjustable parameters for fonts, including gain and sharpness in emulation of letterpress printing. I'm not convinced that Adobe's multiple master technology is the best way to accomplish this parameterization, for detailed technical reasons. And no, I do not work for Adobe.   \n   \nLastly, your pretending that the name \"Metropolitan\" is the true name for Centaur bugs me. Show me evidence that Bruce Rogers ever referred to the font under this name. Otherwise, explain to me how your choice to release your font under this name differs from macXware's release of a Hobo knockoff under the name \"Bobo\".\n\n"

But optical scaling means making strokes thicker (relative to em, and thus lower thick/thin contrast) in smaller sizes.

Ikarus is only as good as the operator, both in terms of fidelity to the original artwork and, crucially, in producing outlines that can be cleanly converted to other outline formats.   \n   \n2. While Ikarus itself was an excellent archival format for very high resolution outline digitisation and storage, the ability to generate from that data good quality outlines in other formats depended on the quality of the conversion and, and as noted above, the way in which the Ikarus digitisation was done. A good Ikarus operator know how to use the tool to produce results that could be cleanly converted to bezier outlines for PS fonts, even taking into account limitations of specific conversion routines.   \n   \nOver the years, I've been given source bezier outlines for various projects, from large and respected foundries and, in many cases, converted from Ikarus data made by URW themselves. Very often the outline quality is very bad, and much work needs to be done to clean up the outlines. It is often difficult to tell how much of the problems are due to human sloppiness and how much to bad outline conversion. Even if the original Ikarus data accurately represented the analogue artwork, that is only part of the process of getting from that artwork to a clean font in another format.   \n   \nBelow is an example of the kind of thing I saw quite often. I can assure you that Adrian Frutiger's drawings didn't look like that.   \n ![Poor Ikarus to PS conversion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075250im_/http:/www.typophile.com/legacy/messages/30/48171.gif)\n\n"

It's not my intent to get into a big flamewar with you; with luck we can keep this conversation civil and hopefully learn a little something from each other.   \n   \nIs that good enough?   \n   \n_\"Considering that the original metal rendition of Centaur was for the Metropolitan Museum for use in titling, I'm sure you can appreciate this.\"_    \n   \n_Can you say that again. I am missing the punch line. What is your point?_    \n   \nAccording to Herbert Johnson's article in American Proprietary Typefaces, the font known as Centaur was first cast for production by Western Type Foundry in Chicago, in 12- through 60-point sizes. These fonts were titling capitals only, and licensed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for their exclusive use. The Museum printed a number of posters using this font, but copies seem to be rather rare today.   \n   \nThe punchline is that the original font _was_ designed to work well in sizes up to at least 60 points. At text sizes, subtle variations in curvature are not visible, but at display sizes they are. I am sorry to criticize your work (and perhaps I do not have the bragging rights to do so), but I believe that your digitization is inferior, for the purpose of display text, to the design that BR designed and seems to be faithfully reproduced in my printed sample.   \n   \n_What would you call a private face for the \"Metropolitan Museum of Art\"._   \n   \nAccording to Johnson's article, the name given at the time was \"Museum Caps.\" Johnson also quotes a letter from BR musing on the choice of name, and noting that William Morris often named his fonts after the books they were designed for.   \n   \nI'm still very curious to know exactly where the name \"Metropolitan\" came from. When was it first used? You seem to be in a unique position to shed more light on these questions.   \n   \nMy scans are of the book \"American Proprietary Typefaces\", set in Monotype Centaur and printed in 1998 by the Stinehour Press in Chicago. The text is letterpress, as is obvious from the bite into the paper. It is not a digital source.   \n   \nI want to be very, very clear about my sources and processes, and absolutely do not want to step on anyone's property. My main purpose is to learn the art of type design, not to make money. Of course I have looked at the Agfa version and yours. That is the best way type designers learn - by looking carefully and critically at the works of others.   \n   \nThe outlines I have drawn are traced solely from the printed sample cited above. All knots and control points have been placed by my own hand. In the first version I posted, the corners were drawn round to carefully match the original scan. In the \"sharpened\" version, I relied on my eye to square the corners.   \n   \nI'm sorry we have this confusion about 60pt vs text sizes. Since I'm tracing from a 60pt source, I obviously make no claim about its suitability in text. You seem to be saying that your Metropolitan is based on a 12-point pattern, and may not be suitable for display use. I am most emphatically _not_ trying to say that reproducing the 60pt outlines in text sizes is a good idea (even though that's what most people actually do with \"revival\" fonts). It's entirely possible that there's no dispute here at all, despite all the voice-raising.   \n   \nSince you seem so intent on dueling, may I propose a challenge? Choose a letter or fleuron from a source which has not yet been digitized, ideally from the ATF 1912 or 1923 books (since I have both and because of the masterful printing), and then let's both post our outlines. The Typophile community can then judge the respective quality of our work, based on faithfulness to the original, smoothness of curve, and sharpness of detail. I'd consider it especially fun to draw an optically scaled series - I'd be happy to produce that in Multiple Master format. If you win, I promise to acknowledge Metropolitan as the definitive digitization of Centaur, and not to release any version of Centaur for the next 10 years. If I win, you have to buy me a beer.   \n   \nDeal?\n\n"

But there is also a problem with having too many off-curve points on a short quadratic curve in a TT font _that one then wants to delta hint._ The multiple points frequently cause spikes during hinting, and one ends up having to fiddle about delta'ing lots of points or trying to apply middle-deltas in situations where a final-delta is appropriate.   \n   \nIf we're hinting for ClearType, this tends to be less of an issue. But when we were doing more black and white hinting we used to spend many, many hours manually cleaning up converted outlines. And, of course, the number of points affects the file size.\n\n"

It's certainly _possible_ to convert it into high quality Type1, but unfortunately if done in the most straightforward way, you'll see problems like Figure 19 in the Digital Punch Cutting paper.   \n   \nI think I understand the issues in generating good quality Type1 from high resolution curves. It's not hard to detect when you're introducing tangent continuity problems by quantizing control points to the unit grid. To fix these problems, there are two basic choices. First, you can use the Type1 \"div\" operator to specify the control points at higher resolution than the em grid (in fact, by representing the coordinates as rational numbers, it's possible to guarantee exact tangent continuity). Second, you can start taking knots out. Roughly speaking, if you double the number of knots used to represent a high resolution curve, you're also doubling the tangent continuity errors. But how do you know which knots you can take out without distorting the curve itself? It's a tricky numerical problem. Unfortunately, it's one you have to deal with if you want the fonts to be compactly encoded - the div trick certainly has the potential to bloat up the font file sizes.   \n   \nEarlier I wrote:   \n   \n_\"That said, I do not believe your methodology of digitizing pattern plates, even those designed for text sizes, is sound. I believe, if one is aiming for accuracy, the goal should be to make the end product match the original as closely as possible.\"_    \n   \nI'd like to clarify this statement a bit. One of the most important things that must be done when optically scaling to small sizes is adding gain. So what I question is the idea that it's a good idea to reproduce the original pattern plates without adding gain _somewhere_ in the process. Unfortunately, that's probably what most users of the font are going to do.   \n   \nThat said, I'm sure that if you were to, say, make a photopolymer plate from text in 12pt Metropolitan, then print it on nice soft paper, the results would be absolutely gorgeous, probably directly comparable to letterpress set from Monotype Centaur. But how many people are really going to do that?   \n   \nAdobe's philosophy of optical scaling, by contrast, builds the gain into the outlines of the fonts. That way, when you print the text on a low-gain, high resolution device, you do at least get the gain. I think, for the majority of users, that's preferable.   \n   \nSo I think that digitizing the pattern plates is an excellent idea, as long as you have the gain built in somewhere in the process.\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant: are you confusing inner and outer corners? By 1912, ATF was using the Benton matrix engraver to cut matrices directly (previous incarnations of the pantographic engraver were used to cut punches). Thus, the larger the engraving tool, the more area cut out, which means more area at type height when the type is cast.   \n   \nSo if the engraver drills a single perfectly round hole, the resulting cast type will be a round dot. If the path of the tool is a perfect right angle, the resulting outer edge will be a rounded corner, with the radius of curvature on the rounded part equal to half the diameter of the cutting tool.   \n   \nBut if the engraving tool traces a plus shape, the raised shape should have perfect sharpness at the intersection. You might get some softening, of course, when you ink it and apply it to paper, but in any case you expect inner corners to be sharper than outer corners. If you were engraving the punch rather than the matrix, you'd expect it to be the other way around.   \n   \nThat's the theory, anyway. Let's see how it looks for real:   \n   \n ![4800 dpi scan detail, p75, atf 1912](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075250im_/http:/www.typophile.com/legacy/messages/30/48216.jpg)   \n   \nThat's a 4800 dpi scan from page 75 of the ATF 1912 book, showing a detail of the \"M\" from 18 point Bodoni Book. I am awestruck at the sharpness of the inner corner here - by eyeball, I'd estimate that the effective radius of curvature is around 5 microns (about a quarter mil).   \n   \nApplying negtive gain is equivalent to drawing the _white_ areas with a circular pen. Thus, you expect outer corners of the white areas to gain rounding. Indeed, that's what you see in the first E I posted above.   \n   \nI agree that a big difference of sharpness between inside and outside corners is a design flaw. My study of the Benton optical scaling strongly suggests that they added a tiny amount of deliberate softening to minimize this effect. In all cases I've analyzed so far, the pattern plate was designed for half the maximum size intended to be cut, which is theoretically very near the optimum compromise point. If you scale up much beyond twice the pattern plate's design size (as was done to some extent in later specimen books), then you get an inner roundness not matched by the outer sharpness.   \n   \nI'm using a circular pen here, but it's possible to apply \"miter joins\" (in PostScript lingo) to corners that are identified as such in the outline. That results in both sharp inner and outer corners. The main tradeoff is the extra care needed to correctly classify corners - if a sharp corner is mistakenly drawn as a very tight curve instead, the inner corner would be soft instead of sharp. I'm not much of a fan of hyper-sharp scaling, though, and am perfectly happy to accept some softening, especially if it buys me stability with respect to subtle variations in the outline. Of course, that's a matter of taste too.\n\n"

That's because it's working \"negatively\" - it's cutting from inside the black, so to speak. If you cut from inside the white instead (by cutting a punch and not a matrix for example), the polarity of the quality will be flipped. Considering that gain builds up more on the inside corners, I'd say that cutting inside the black is less bad. But the point is you can't have _both_ with the pantograph. That's why quality-minded people hand-sharpened the output from the pantograph. I once posted a scan of a photo of a bank of people doing just this at the Tetterode foundry.

In fact, what really excites me is computer displays in the 200dpi and above range. At that resolution, you finally have enough pixels to properly reproduce serifs and the like, but of course it's all very different than printing. With LCD and OLED technology, gain is exactly zero.   \n   \nI'm not saying that my goal is to fool people into thinking that they're looking at a letterpress printed page, but at the same time I think it's possible to capture some of that quality. If you just take digitized pattern plates and reproduce those with zero gain, text will look extremely thin and spidery compared to real printing made from the same designs.   \n   \nThe issues between 200 dpi displays and offset printing are similar but of course not identical; in particular, high resolution offset has very little gain. On the other hand, offset probably is much more sensitive to things like rounded corners.   \n   \n_But yes, I guess it is a matter of taste - I'm hoping though that sludge went out with the 70s._  \n   \nI am _not_ talking about bringing back the days of American Typewriter or Benguiat Gothic. The ATF sample I posted above has an outer rounding radius of around 1 mil. It only looks like \"crap\" because I posted a 4800 dpi scan; depending on your monitor, that's something like a 50x blowup. Trust me, it looks plenty sharp at actual size.   \n   \nJohn: I definitely appreciate what you're saying about variations in printing style, paper, and so on. The ATF 1923 book helpfully includes bound-in signatures printed on various luscious papers, in addition to the rather hard enamel surface of the main text. In many cases, it's actually possible to do a direct head-to-head comparison with the same printer, same font, just different paper.   \n   \nThat said, there's something else notable about the ATF 1912 specimen book: the gain from the letterpress printing process is quite small, astonishingly so considering the modern conceptions of printing from that era. There's a specimen of a hairline font (Light Litho Gothic, if memory serves) which definitively establishes that the press gain was less than three quarters of a mil, and almost certainly less than that.   \n   \nThus a rather startling conclusion: most of the weight adjustment for optical scaling was cut into the metal. Only a fraction of it was a consequence of press gain. To me, it doesn't really matter how much the relative contribution of each is. It's the final printed result that matters.   \n   \nEven so, under the assumption that the printing in the ATF books was an amazingly faithful reproduction of the metal type, it makes sense to trace outlines from high-quality scans made from the books. Indeed, based on my experiments so far, it seems quite satisfactory.   \n   \nOf course, for Centaur, it may well be that none of the samples available have the technical near-perfection of the ATF 1912 book, and that going back to the metal type or the original pattern plates would reveal qualities not immediately visible on the printed surface. I've got a couple more definitive sources on Centaur on order through abebooks, so I should be able to get a better handle on these questions.   \n   \nOh, and if the American Proprietary Typefaces book _is_ based on digital sources, how would one explain the stylistic differences between the 60pt and text samples? Maybe Stinehour Press has access to a secret digital version with optical scaling, while the rest of us have only the single-scale version. Hmmmm...\n\n"

There is no information there about Thomas, optical size variants.   \n   \nAlso, I am rather surprised to see Lanston claiming trademarks on a lot of old ATF typeface names, such as Globe Gothic, Wedding Text, and Cloister Black. How is it that you would own these names?\"_   \n      \n   \nI think the size of the list may indicate I have better things to do with my time. Maybe some of you don't.   \n   \nOn the other matter of your concern, _read the fine print._\n\n"

I advise that you draft an air tight contract with Adobe before you waste your time on software that will not be \"application friendly\", or made redundant at a whim.   \n   \nFirst of all, if it is a good idea, which means in Adobes terms, a market for it, they don't need you, they really don't need you. Mind you that never deterred you before. In fact with the remarks you have made to our good friend Thomas, they really don't need you. Ever heard of manners?   \n   \nThen, and only then will I help you. Otherwise it is just a waste of my time.

There very clearly is such a thing as underinked type, and such a thing as overinked type, that most people in the trade will recognise as such. What there is not is agreement about what constitutes perfectly inked type.   \n   \nRegarding depth of impression, particularly, much seems to depend on the paper. If the paper is thick with a deeply textured surface, you'd better have a deep impression because otherwise you run the risk of letters breaking up on the surface. That's just common sense. Of course, selecting paper is also a matter of preference and fashion. [Unless, of course, the client comes along with giant sheets of recycled grey blotting paper with bits of used bandaids and broken staples in it. Remember that stuff Gerald?]\n\n"
