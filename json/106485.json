  "content": "Hi,  \nThere is tables that explains which applications support different opentype features like this link:  \n [https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype\\_feature\\_support](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415230229/https:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support \"https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype\\_feature\\_support\")  \nIn this table we see that all of the mentioned apps support the \"standard ligatures\" opentype feature.  \nbut how would I know if I implement an GSUB LookupType 5 or 6 (Contextual substitution) in a standard ligatures it will be executed in those apps. I need a GSUB LookupType 5 or 6 to be executed by default so I think it's safe to put it in this feature and it will be executed in all of those apps, right?\n\nThanks\n\n",
