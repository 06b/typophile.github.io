  "content": "I have 2 questions\n\nFIRST  \nI am interest to purchase a Times New Roman-alike font which is used in many books such as published by Prentice Hall, McGraw-Hill, John-Wiley, etc.  \nI try to get some information about the font by reading through the book.  \nMostly, they said that the name of the font is Times Roman and 10/12 point.  \nI assume that the font is made by Monotype.  \nSo, I contact them.  \nThey do give me clear information.  \nThen, I feel confidence to purchase a single Regular (or Book) style in TrueType format for PC and spent 26 GBP worth for it.  \nHowever, this thing makes me so confuse after saw that the font name in the font dropdown list toolbar of MS Office Word 2003 is TimesNRMT!!!  \nWhat is actually the difference between “TimesNRMT” and “Times-Roman” font?  \nOr, does font foundry of Times-Roman font is Monotype?  \nIf yes, what the foundry name would be?  \nLinotype?  \nIf anyone here has them worked for GGS Information Service, Inc, do you mind if I purchase the font directly from you for sure?\n\nSECOND  \nDoes anyone recognize this font (image is attached)?  \nSimilar / closest font would be OK.\n\nThanks\n\nTom\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210195350im_/http:/typophile.com/files/untitled_4184.GIF)\n\n [‹ Looks like an easy one...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210195350/http:/typophile.com/node/39880 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Here's One ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210195350/http:/typophile.com/node/39874 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There are minor differences, like you’d find in different cuts of any typeface, but they are essentially the same to my eyes.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
