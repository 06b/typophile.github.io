Will DRM make a significant difference? From looking at how other IP is treated on the internet, it is unlikely.\n\nPeople who professionally make web sites (either inhouse or freelance), or care about their brand/image, will make sure their font usage is properly licensed. The ones that don't, or individuals just making one-off pages, are less likely to use web-based fonts because it costs more to host/deliver their web site, and even if that doesn't affect them, then they still wouldn't pay the licensing fee, even if asked (at best, they would simply stop using the font).\n\nThe foundries with complicated licensing agreements will find that they simply are impeding their fonts from being used legitimately, rather than \"protecting\" their font.

I know that's how groups like the BSA like to calculate so-called software industry losses, but that doesn't make it a reasonable argument.\n\nYou seem to be equating font designers getting paid with DRM. Other industries have shown that DRM winds up hindering, not helping those industries.\n\nThe more obstacles you put between yourself and your customer (wacky licensing agreements, drm, etc...), the more likely your customer will be to find another solution (that may or may not include pirating your font).\n\nThere are lots and lots of web designers and companies that make web sites and make sure all the elements on their pages are properly licensed (graphics, photographs, text) without needing browsers to have DRM embedded in them. If using a specific font for a web site is perceived to have enough value (ie, the same or more value than it's licensing fee), a designer will license and use it.\n\nIf there are enough designers who value the fonts you provide enough to use them (as in, the value they add to the site meets or exceeds the amount you charge), you have a viable business. If there aren't, you don't.

Another option: you can start selling cheaper, hoping to make more sales (but no guarantee).\n\nNow, if at some point those two remaining designers stop paying (“Why should I, if I get the same stuff by free and no one else is taking the right way?”, “Why should I pay 50 bucks for this, if it should be costing only 10?”), you need to find another job and the world won’t see more fonts by you (or anyone else who takes this job seriously, given the effort it implies).

If they want to use it on their web site, they'll do it, and it'll probably be easier for them than for your paying customers because they won't have to worry about making sure the DRM works right when somebody visits their web site.\n\nHowever, other countries, with perhaps a lower piracy rate, where lots of companies spend a lot of time and money on branding and image, they do take IP seriously. And they have the money and are willing to spend it to get IP they want.\n\nAnd IMHO, piracy for web fonts could easily be less than it is for computer fonts, just because they will be public. These fonts are not aimed at being used on internal wikis. They are for creating a more compelling public web site for customers to see. Foundries can readily find out if a web site is using one of their fonts. With computer fonts, it's much harder (or impossible) for a foundry to tell that a given company is using their fonts for all their correspondence, because where they are being used is internal-only, or just to clients (or even in printed matter).\n\nLots of companies (in the US at least) will do the right thing (either stop using the font or pay to license it) if notified they shouldn't be using it.\n\nSimply put, for a business that sells IP of any kind, a strategy of aiming your sales strategy at people who have money and are willing to part with it in exchange for the IP works much better than trying to shoot arrows into everybody that will never in a million years pay for your IP.\n\n"

It simply isn't on the table because unlike, say, iTunes music, a web font format needs to be supportable directly within browsers, not in special web font 'players' or via plug-ins, and most of the browser makers will not implement a format that contains technical measures to protect software that require enforcement on the part of the browser. What some of us are advocating is a format that a) is appropriate to the web medium (which means a format including compression) and b) contains bulkhead protections against casual and unintentional unlicensed use. The difference between the bulkheads and the kind of technical measure that would enable DRM -- the kind of measure that automatically invokes DCMA law in the US -- is that the bulkheads simply sit between the web font and casual breaking of license agreements, requiring no special action on the part of the browser.\n\n"

There are more options than either trying to make it impossible to steal a font, or to make it free. Two things can I think and hope create a sustainable market for web fonts: 1. Making it not easy and obvious to download the font for non-browser use without piracy software; and 2. Enforcing large, public violations of EULAs.\n\nBecause fonts are tools for publishing either on the web or print, and because publishing is by definition public--and the web especially public--the situation is significantly different from the story with music. Font vendors are not going to even attempt to go after the individual consumer, which was the issue with downloading music. But they will go after publishers.\n\nAnd I think large foundries such as Monotype, Adobe, will be willing to sue owners of web sites who do considerable business for violating EULAs for web fonts. And once the principle is established, my guess is that web businesses will be extremely reluctant to do stuff in public that makes them subject to a hefty law suit, when there is a relatively low cost to getting the font.\n\nSo I think that while significant control of piracy among say scrap-bookers may be impossible, it does seem possible to have enough enforcement leverage on web publishers to create a remunerative market for web fonts.\n\n"

But what if text is replacing a graphic of text, like everybody says they are trying to with @f-f? Can web developers write code to, \"Either display this font, or if you can't, tell me, and I'll tell you to display this graphic instead?\" It might be trivial, but then it is the web we're talking about so my guess is that there are going to be at least some size differences to cope with, getting from a bunch of scaleable letters back to a block of pixels of text...

The persistent use of the simplistic and inflammatory term \"DRM\" is really not helpful to the discussion. EOT Lite offers enough protection for many foundries and has nothing even vaguely resembling DRM in it.\n\nOne other thing to consider: The DVD format offers relatively mild copy protection, and it did rather well. You could say that there was a small but vocal opposition to it being there, but by and large the average customer didn't even notice. It worked, and the format was one of the most successful new technologies in history. You might call that apples and oranges, but it's an example of an industry having enough protection to be comfortable putting its digital content out in the world without causing any particular inconvenience to customers.\n\nAdobe does have reason to expect that recent and future versions of IE would support CFF fonts in EOT. Possibly older versions as well, with a little help from Microsoft. With the compression inherent in CFF, the compression issue becomes less urgent.\n\nAnd yes, subsetting can be pretty handy.\n\n"

Compression built into the file can be created by anyone even if they don't know a .htaccess file from a hole in the wall. Compression at the file level, is just simpler. And I believe, as a rule, that the closer web development stays to a do-it-yourself proposition, the more inclusive and democratic it will be. I don't think JD or anybody will argue differently.\n\n@tim brown  \nAs to the original question: as with any grant of copyright, granting the monopoly only makes sense if it helps to promote the \"useful art\" (as the US Constitution phrases it). In other words, if it helps keep the work product we need coming at a reasonable price. In the case of fonts, which are both labor and knowledge intensive, I believe it does. Others disagree.\n\n@bb  \nYou entertain me, as\\_always.\n\n"
