      "content": "I agree with you kris, there is something overtly delicate about the 1 pixel stems. I would definitely keep going with both weights.   \n   \nmy suggestion would be to keep the width between left and right stems a little more consistent - at 2 px instead of 1 - especially with e,n,u,v,y... they seem too thin when it's looked at as a whole   \n   \nalso specifically I would work on the \"c\" more... I like the last variation you have, just in terms of legibility. I would also work on the \"s\" more as it seems to sit uncomfortably above the baseline.   \n   \nbut many of the letters I find to be exquisite... the \"i\", the 5th and 6th \"g\" sketches, the first four \"h\" sketches on the second row. in all very fine work you are doing, can't wait to see more\n\n"
