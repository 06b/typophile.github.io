I think I'm finding the \"E\", but that's only because I'm looking for it as a design critic. Tanya's direction isn't a bad one to explore, although the \"A\" and \"E\" shapes aren't exactly the same. As she has illustrated it, the \"l\" and \"E\" would need to be pulled much closer together.   \n   \nHave you looked into any other designs/concepts that you'd be willing to share?   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"
