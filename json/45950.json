Classic is safe. The book introduces the reader to the Vedanta philosophy in clear, straightforward language. It is not heavy reading. Your suggestions appreciated.\n\nAny tips on composing a German text for someone who has experience only with English would also be helpful.\n\nThanks.\n\nD.\n\n [‹ logo using a \"v\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46023 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Underlines - can we get gaps? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45154 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Well, at least the name is German.)  \n [Sabon](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=sabon) (Not a German name – but designed by [Jan Tschichold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jan%252BTschichold). Plus the typeface is very common in Germany.)\n\nAlso, some fresh ones:  \n [Toshna](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.germantype.com/cms/front_content.php?idart=99&changelang=2)  \n [Marat](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.ludwiguebele.de/index.php/Type%20Design/Text/)\n\n<cite>Any tips on composing a German text</cite>\n\nDo you have something special in mind? Some random thoughts: German language can have quite a lot of [long compound words](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21117). That may affect your decisions on line length and H&J. The fact that all nouns start with capital letters – plus some umlauts here and there – will give you a slightly different colour on the page.\n\nHave a look at the treatment of quotes: [Anführungszeichen explained at typografie.info](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Anf%C3%BChrungszeichen). The standard is „quotes“. You can also use »quotes«, which might be nicer, depending on the typeface. «Quotes» are allowed, too, but those are rather rare.\n\nThere are certainly a lot more details to consider. I don’t know how deep you wanna dive into it. There’s a book that covers all of the German typographic rules, and even more: [Detailtypographie](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Detailtypografie_(Buch)) by [Friedrich Forssman](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Friedrich%252BForssman) and [Ralf de Jong](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110921/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Ralf%252Bde%252BJong). Purchasing this ‘bible’ might be overkill, though.\n\nF\n\n"
