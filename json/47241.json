      "content": "I've got one of those! For anyone not up on vintage music technology this is a Japanese made drum machine from the very early '80s, which might help with the font ID. I need to check mine when I get home but I believe it has very slight serifs doesn't it? Off the top of my head I'd say it is a bit like [ITC Serif Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215164359/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-serif-gothic/), although when checking that I see it is a little too ornate & certainly doesn't have the angled crossbar on the e.\n\n"

It's got a very Ed Benguiat look to it. Sort of Benguiat Gothic mixed with a little Bauhaus. Maybe it was custom font.\n\n"

      "content": "The 808 was a classic, especially in terms of how it revolutionised Electro music (we're talking early 80's NYC, btw) from diverse artists like Afrika Bambaata to early Depeche Mode and UK jazz funk band Freeeze (the track I.O.U. specifically). The 808 Kick and clap were killer in the clubs! I always dreamed of owning one of those when I was a teenager, only being able to afford it's poor cousin the Roland Drumatix. Nowadays, all the sounds it can do are available everywhere, especially complete sequencer packages like Propellerheads Reason.\n\nI think the 808 still carries a lot of kudos though and as such may well still command a respectable price.\n\nAnd where do you think 808 State got their name from...\n\nJH\n\n"

However it looks as if they've taken the bold weight & lightened it slightly, so it doesn't have the separation in letters like R & B that the lighter weights have. d, a & p have that slightly awkward \"elbow\". The e & that lovely z could be unique features of the customisation. Something doesn't look quite right about Serif Gothic's e.\n\nThere is something similar used by the ibuprofen brand Nurofen, although this uses a different capital E to the Serif Gothic one.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215164359im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NurofenLiquidCaps30_4148.jpg)\n\n<cite>PS..

I've just dug out a 1989 Letraset catalogue & indeed it has both a rectangular & round \"E\". Not only that, it also has the slanted \"e\" used by Roland and that swashy \"z\"!!!\n\nAlso two versions of \"a\", \"f\", \"k\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\" & \"L\".\n\nWhat a shame they aren't in the digital versions!\n\n"
