  "content": "_Ommwriter is a humble attempt to recapture what technology has snatched away from us today: our capacity to concentrate._\n\nOmmwriter is a simple text processor that firmly believes in making writing a pleasure once again, vindicating the close relationship between writer and paper. The more intimate the relation, the smoother the flow of inspiration.\n\nInteresting concept, presentation and execution. Really well designed website too, with cufon'ed Quicksand for headers :)\n\n[http://www.ommwriter.com/en](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131044037/http:/www.ommwriter.com/en \"http://www.ommwriter.com/en\")\n\n",
