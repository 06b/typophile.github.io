  "content": "Hello all. I’m new to this site and I’ve read through lots of posts and couldn’t find anything specific to my question, so here it is.\n\nI want to create a new font that is very similar to and existing font. I can base it off of a font that I do own a lisence to or start from scratch. When I’m finished it will closely resemble a font that is just too expensive to purchase. And I don’t really want to change fonts. So basically I want to copy a font, make some minor changes so it’s not exact, then use this new font in the old one’s place. Please refrain from belting me with rotten tomatoes and cabbage, I’m really just looking for the legalities involved with this type of thing. Like for instance, can one build a font that looks almost exactly like trade gothic, maybe not even using the original, then call it their own?\n\nOr, say I create a new font from scratch and it’s exactly like garamond, but i’ve never seen garamond, are their legal issues?\n\nThanks for all your help, you all seem like a very intelligent and resourceful group.\n\nMario\n\n [‹ unicode for alternates](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203120330/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41070 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What may be the problem? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203120330/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41024 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Many people start their fonts from old specimens they find and make changes and or add more characters.\n\nWhat you can’t and shouldn’t do is start by using someone else’s font and make your own. Ethically speaking, whether you start from the actually font file or if you print it out, either way, you are on shaky ground.\n\nJust because a font is too expensive is not a good reason to do it. Consider the time you will spend to create the font. How much is your time worth? Add to that any legal woes you might have should you step on someone’s toes. Now is it less expensive to actually license the font?\n\n"

      "content": "Legally, there are (at least) two points to consider:\n\n1) Font/Typeface NAMES can be (and are) protected by copyrights. Many names you see over and over again are older, and may be in the public domain, but most are owned/licensed by existing foundries.\n\n2) Font/Typeface DIGITAL data (or, in legal parlance, the “font program”) CAN be (and is) protected by copyright. This means you can’t take an existing font file, rename it, and then distribute or sell it (without permission).\n\nThe rest is murky... most font designs are “based on” some existing design(s)... after all, there are only 26 basic letterforms, and they have to look somewhat alike or no one would ever be able to read them. And designers have been “copying” fonts since before Guttenberg... it’s just the technology that’s changed. I think the current “legal” rule of thumb would be: if you create (draw from scratch) a font, even if it visually references an existing font, WITHOUT directly “copying” it, and give it a unique/unlicensed name, you’re o.k.\n\n"

Just a person who has spent too much time reading font EULAs.\n\nIf you create a font from scratch and it resembles another font and it is for personal use only (and you aren’t using their font in any way, shape, or form; and you don’t intend to sell it) you are probably OK. But, if you plan to sell the font in any way I’d suggest getting a lawyer first.\n\n"

      "content": "Scott - there’s usually always a line in the EULA that says reverse engineering is not permitted. That basically means you are not allowed to modify the data without permission.  \nYour best bet is to contact the owner of the software and explain what you want to do. Most foundries will allow custom modifications if they get paid to make the modification (they may just give you permission) and you are covered in terms of licensing the original software. Of course the modified font must be for your own use only and can not be resold.\n\nIf you’re drawing from scratch it doesn’t matter what it looks like (although there is the issue of moral rights), you must avoid using names that are trademarked if you intend to resale.\n\nDon’t quote me on any of this. Always use a lawyer.\n\n"
