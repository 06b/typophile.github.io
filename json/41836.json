  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m currently working on a design for a Danish magazine on running. I’m using Berthold City bold set in caps for some various headings and [Benton Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024010/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans) as my main grotesque. For the feature stories (body copy) and for some headings I need a serif to work along with Benton Sans. I have tried various classics from my collection - Adobe Caslon, Baskerville etc – but It doesn’t seem right. Somehow they clash.\n\nCan anyone suggest a serif to work along with Bentons Sans and Berthold City?\n\nI’ve included the cover to give you an idea of the look.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024010im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/loebemagasinet_01_cover_5070.jpg)\n\n",
