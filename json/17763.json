  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI’m working on a logotype for a new restaurant in Portola Valley called Amigos Grill. It will be a high-end taqueria with a modern, warm atmosphere that feels Mexican but doesn’t overdo it on the Mexican kitsch. I have a basic idea of what I want for the logotype, but can’t find a face that fits. I’ve scoured FontShop, but can’t find the right face. I’m thinking of a bold display font, that feels a bit like a script font (meaning it has some subtle cursive elements, but also has a blocky Western feel. It should feel modern with a hint of retro. I’m thinking of adding a hard drop shadow for dimension and perhaps some ornamentation, kinda like Mexican papel picado. Here’s a sketch of what I had in mind. Does anyone out there have any suggestions of what face might be appropriate? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. Juan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/amigos.gif)\n\n",
