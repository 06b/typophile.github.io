Overall, the Morisawa prize was more presitigious for the winner -- and licrative --, but it wasn't annual and has now been cancelled. The most prestigious competition of recent years was probably ATypI's bukva:raz!, but that was a one-off.\n\n"

      "content": "{Hey, you knew it was coming...}   \n   \nPrestige? The number of entries to the TDC2 keeps falling year after year. So I'm sorry to say that I'm being proven right: it has major flaws. In fact three of them:   \n1) The cost to enter is simply too high for too much of the world. As a result, proven hotbeds of type design talent (like South America - just check out the Morisawa results) get shut out, making the results of the competition less valid. The TDC needs to implement a variable fee based on country of origin, exactly like ATypI membership has now become. The way the TDC uses the word \"international\" is the way baseball uses \"world series\"...   \n2) The judging is too rushed (one weekend!), and this results in the ever-present bad choices among the winners, discouraging entries. Every year there's at least one winner that the bulk of people agree was totally misguided. It's tempting to think that every competition has this problem, but really, in the case of the TDC it consistently seems to go too far.   \n3) The judging is too \"clubby\". The TDC insists on flying the judges to and lodging the judges in friggin' NYC. Total waste of money.   \n   \nThe solution to #2 and #3 is exactly what Critique magazine did for their wonderful (and free!) competitions in the late 90s: screen the entries, weeding out the really bad stuff (optional, actually); send the remaining entries to the judges, instead of the other way around; give the judges plenty of time, like a month. Since fonts are adequately shown in one color, on a flexible and flat surface, you would save a lot of money (hence reduce fees) by simply rolling up the 11x17 sheets and cascading them from one judge to the other. Or you could ask people to send five copies to speed things up. Or you could send groups of entries to each judge and get them rotating. And hey, do conference calls if you think interaction among judges is important. ANYTHING is better than donating money to the airlines and hotels.   \n   \nThere are in fact other problems with the TDC competition, but they're not as bad as the three above.   \n   \n--   \n   \nMorisawa was super prestigious, and deservedly so - and it even allowed submission by emailed PDF! But yeah, it's over. Bukvaraz was wonderful, and another one would be even better (it could allow itself to start looking forward rather than back). Then there's the Linotype contest, which is now giving out cash prizes (although there are some strings attached). Note that all of them except the TDC are/were free.   \n   \n--   \n   \nThe ideal competition would have modest (and country-sensitive) entry fees, be held every 2-3 years, and give a choice to each winner of prize+strings or just glory.   \n   \n\\> what's up in France?   \n   \nMaybe there's a surcharge for entries from those damn anti-war frogs... ;-/   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Selling it to a Linotype competitor however would be illegal (and unethical, as far as I'm concerned, because of the prize money).   \n   \nSo in practice the bit about having to give your winning font to Linotype is more a tactic to convince, rather than coerce.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Anyway, that's just a terminological issue. What we should try to figure out is what most type designers want in a contest: fame, no strings, money, licensing, etc. Let's do a survey, eh? BTW, I've been trying to get the TypeCon people to do a panel discussion on contests for years - it's strange that they don't want to - it seems right up the conference's alley. I can picture Carter, Kegler, Montalbano and so many others being superb elements in such a discussion.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It is even more expensive if you win, because you then have to pay a hanging fee and provide six copies of your work for the travelling exhibitions. One of the great things about the bukva:raz! competition is that it was free to enter and there were no hanging fees.

Dunno.   \n   \nAnd sure, someone always pays (by cash, or by giving up licensing decisions, or whatever), but the point should be:   \n1) How to make the entry fees so they don't reduce the validity of the results (think South America).   \n2) How to allocate the funds efficiently (ie: not donate to Delta Airlines).   \n   \n\\> More uninformed opinion concealed as fact from Hrant.   \n   \nWasn't it you who once pointed out on Typo-L that the hanging fees are optional?

Why because I don't agree with you. I have been listening to your suggestions on how to run a competition for 6 or 7 years now, and for the TDC, with our publishing deadline, the idea of sending work around the world to a set of judges so they can have as much time as they need, does not work.   \n   \nI've run your idea past judges of the competition, and all have had the same reaction... \"no way would I want all this stuff coming to my studio.\"   \n   \nYou seem to think that a weekend is too short a time to judge. After every competition that I have been around, I have asked the judges if they felt they were rushed or needed more time. Every one that I have spoke to has answered the same way. They all felt they had plenty of time.   \n   \nOf the total number of entries, about half are dismissed by the judges in the first hour. So if you have 120 entries, 60 are gone. Of that next 60 half of those go in the next two hours. It doesn't take four people a month to decide on the remainder.   \n   \nAll the judges have very clear ideas of what is good and what is not. The discussions are very lively, and I wish everyone could eavesdrop because it is a valuable experience. I remember Matthew Carter saying that if he was in town the year following his judging would it be alright if he came by to watch, because he felt it was such an enjoyable experience.   \n   \nRight there is another reason why it is important to have judges in the same place. They get something out of it as well. I think that bringing someone to NYC and putting up in a hotel for a couple of days is a small honorarium to pay in exchange for their expertise, and commitment.   \n   \nAs to Kyle's question about Hanging Fees. No one has ever refused to pay them. Since the hanging fee requirement is spelled out in the competition rules, they come as no surprise. People whose work wins seem generally happy to abide by the rules they have accepted. Considering the cost of other avenues of advertising and marketing, I consider the hanging fee that covers the cost of being in the annual and the shows to be a bargain, considering the reach they give the work.   \n   \nIf someone did refuse to pay I think it would be up to the circumstances. IF there were special circumstances involved then I think the club and the winner could come to some understanding. But if the person just refused to pay and offered no reason then I would take it in the same way as someone who tries to welch on a debt and they, most likely, would not be included at all.   \n   \nEvery year when someone brings up the TDC Type Design Competition Hrant begins his litany of complaints. I have tried to explain the reason the competition is run the way it is. I have grown weary of doing this every year for the last 6 or 7 years. This is the last I will speak of it. If Hrant thinks he has the answers, I encourage him to start his own competition. It would lovely to see him actually act on his complaints.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the full reply.   \n   \n\\> I've run your idea past judges of the competition   \n   \nThat's good to hear. To me, trying is the most important thing.   \n   \nThat said, I still think the TDC competition clearly has a good deal of room for improvement, and the declining participation -among a BOOM in the actual practice of designing type- seems to support that opinion. Another reason to think there's room for improvement is that other competitions have found better ways to do some aspects of the job.   \n   \nThe idea about shipping the entries does have its drawbacks, I admit. But as for the fees, I think the least you can do is make it cheaper for people from non-affluent countries. Otherwise, \"For type designers around the world, the TDC2 is the premier annual event to honor the achievement of type designers everywhere\" is simply untrue.   \n   \n\\> I consider the hanging fee that covers the cost of   \n\\> being in the annual and the shows to be a bargain   \n   \nThat's fine, and I probably agree with you! But we shouldn't try to decide on behalf of other people. For one thing, somebody -possibly a talented designer- from South America for example (it's clear they have many down there) might already be overstretched with the entry fee. As I've pointed out before, I'm not complaining on my behalf: I can afford the entry pretty easily. What makes me complain is a desire to see the results of the competition become more relevant, and become more of a reward-system for everybody with talent and dedication, not just rich people.   \n   \nSo if somebody only wants to have won, and doesn't want to pay extra for shows or being in the annual, I think you should try to accomodate that, instead of putting designers on the spot with an agreement they might find too commital.   \n   \n--   \n   \nBTW, these days I only complain about the TDC competition when somebody else brings it up. And I complain because it makes me sad to see wasted potential, that's all.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

In both type design competitions I have judged (TDC and Linotype) there was the sense that the judges _as a body_ were coming to a decision, not that individual judges were making decisions and the majority ruling. This process is worthwhile, and is only possible when people are together to discuss the work before them.\n\n"

But:   \n1) It's just another factor that has to be balanced. If the cost of getting the judges together is preventing meaningful competition results, then maybe it should be tossed? Or here's an idea: don't use one of the world's most expensive cities to host the thing! And here's another: do the judging where type people are going to congregate anyway, like at TypeCon.   \n2) It doesn't preclude doing part of the judging remotely/individually. There might even be an advantage to having a hybrid method, so judges can think both individually and with the benefit of the others - different people think better in different circumstances. So you could send copies of the entries to the judges, give them a week or two to build some preferences and pro/con arguments, then get everybody together to nail down the winners. In this way you have the communication, the shmoozing, and the better results too, without spending more (like you could make the final stage one day instead of two).   \n   \nThere's so much room for some nimble, intelligent improvement, instead of this seemingly monolithic and exclusionary thing we have now, I'm just surprised that the TDC competition doesn't seem to be adapting, even though the drop in participation is the strongest possible warning signal.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
