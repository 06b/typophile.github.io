Away with Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, GillSans...   \n   \nWhich font would you advice me?   \n(I tried Officina Sans, but I found that one too narrow for example).   \n   \nThanks a lot ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090841im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \nVery interested in hearing the professionals opinion.   \n   \nDave\n\n",

As a bonus, at large sizes it contains a lot of visual interest, maintaining stylistic consistency with the small text.   \n   \n----   \n   \nIf you need to make very small legible text, Rotis (specifically the darkest weight of the Sans - which you might actually try to add a fake bold to as well) is in a class of its own (maybe surprisingly so), not least thanks to its economical narrowness.
