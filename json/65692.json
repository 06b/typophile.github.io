Some other text on the [Gestair website](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103064107/http:/www.gestair.com/) is set in [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103064107/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100008). The logo very likely started out as Gotham aswell: the G bar has been cut off, the R got roughhoused, and the whole thing looks a bit stretched.  \nF\n\n"
