There are a lot of interpretations that I overlooked.   \nI am also told that the actual font used by the magazine (maybe   \nnot for the masthead itself but when they are doing illustrations   \nwith similar type) was commissioned to Monotype and is called   \n\"Irvin\". It matches perfectly but is assumedly not for retail.\n\n"

The main difference between the fonts like FF New Yorker, Manhattan and Upper West Side, which are all Irvin look-alikes, is the Q. See the following sample scanned from McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\"   \n ![Irvin Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20141004120221im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/29037.gif)   \n   \nThe next two samples are Manhattan from Franklin Type Founders (at Precision Type) and Upper West Side from Intecsas (also at Precision Type). You'll notice that only the Intecsas font tried to get the lettering right.   \n ![Franklin Manhattan](http://web.archive.org/web/20141004120221im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/29038.gif)   \n ![Intecsas Upper West Side](http://web.archive.org/web/20141004120221im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/29039.gif)\n\n"
