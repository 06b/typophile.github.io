  "content": "F O R I M E D I A T E R E L E A S E   \n   \nTypeco has releases it's first font family -- Glyphic Neue.   \n   \nGlyphic Neue is a display family that was inspired by the Op Art style of   \nlettering in the United States that ran rampant in many photo type houses in   \nthe 1960's and 1970's. The Glyphic Series from the Franklin Photolettering   \ngroup was an influence and spring board for this family of fonts, hence   \nit's name.   \n   \nBut Glyphic Neue departs from its unicase Franklin influence in several   \nways. Firstly the designer created both upper and lower case forms. The   \nlowercase has been designed with barley protruding ascenders and descenders   \nand with an x-height equivalent to the cap height, so that upper and lower   \ncan be exchanged indiscriminately for a quirky effect. Some of the letters   \ntake a cue from the original Glyphic series but many have been redesigned   \nentirely to fit the designers vision. The italic forms differ enough from   \nthe upright version making it almost an entirely different display alphabet.   \n   \nGlyphic Neue is a versatile display family of 6 fonts -- 3 widths, each with   \nan accompanying italic that look equally at home when used on a party flier   \nor a sports team visual identity.   \n   \nTypeco is an electronic type foundry for the designs of principal, James   \nGrieshaber, as well as a provider of typographic services and solutions.   \nServices offered by Typeco include font identification, signature fonts,   \nlogo fonts and handwriting fonts.

He has now struck   \nout on his own to offer his services to those in typographic need and   \nshowcase his typographic vision.   \n   \nContact info:   \nTypeco   \nPO Box 10661   \nRochester, NY 14610   \nPhone: 585.230.1674   \nEmail: [contact@typeco.com](mailto:contact@typeco.com)   \nWeb: [http://www.typeco.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142655/http:/www.typeco.com/)\n\n",
