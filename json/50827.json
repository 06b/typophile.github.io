This is my own fault, but I also think I am just really rusty at writing papers.\n\nThe paper is on typography and tattoos.\n\nDoes anyone have any good resources? Or any tips on beginning/finishing a research paper?\n\nI am pretty desperate so if anyone could help right away, that would be amazing!\n\nThanks,  \nMatt\n\n [‹ A wonderful pop-up typo book from France](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135805/http:/typophile.com/node/50735 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Aperture Symbol and other photo symbols ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135805/http:/typophile.com/node/50649 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
