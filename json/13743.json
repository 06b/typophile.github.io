And I wouldn't make a chirographic Roman. :-)\n\nWhen I use the term \"true Italic\" (in the way it's generally used in the craft) I always make sure to put the \"true\" in quotes; sometimes I even slap on \"so-called\". :-)\n\nThe main true thing about an Italic (in a contemporary text face) is that it needs to stand out enough to make the reader snap out of immersion (from the previous fixation only, not before) but affect the \"mood\" of the overall (i.e. Roman) as little as possible. So-called \"true\" italics fail at the second part, because you can't assume the emphasized snippet is associated with a more organic, informal tone; you can only assume that it's a snippet that needs extra focus. The one thing Morison was right about (in spite of himself, but certainly helped by his plagiaristic tendencies) is that cursiveness is not integral to an Italic; slant is. The persistent cursiveness of the mainstream Italic is nothing more than a circumstantial legacy, from back when type founders decided to fall back on a shotgun wedding between two separate styles.\n\nYou're young, you're just starting - do the right thing.\n\nhhp\n\n"

This is why I think \"upright Italic\" is a misnomer; \"cursive Roman\" is much better.\n\nThat said, I think there are other ways to mark emphasis than an Italic; personally, I [generally] prefer a Demi weight. It's just that for cursiveness to be sufficient to make a reader snap out of immersion, it has to be so pronounced that it skews the voice of the whole composition strongly, and in an arbitrary direction.\n\nhhp\n\n"

There isn’t anything about technique, but there’s a nice example of the optical corrections that might give you some direction._\n\nI basically used the technique Briem describes (which William mentioned above) for Proxima Nova. I used a similar method that I worked out myself years ago when I did Proxima Sans, but I found Briem's technique to be more straightforward and reliable. I don't mean it's a no-brainer. There are always cases where you need to use your judgement. Also, because Proxima Nova was set up in FontLab as a multi-axis MM font during development, it was considerably more complicated to do the corrections. FontLab's facility for adding and deleting points has some unfortunate limitations when working with a MM font.\n\nIt should be noted, this kind of optical correction is necessary when slanting characters so they don't look distorted, but it's a completely separate issue from the _design_ of a set of italics. In the case of Proxima Nova's design, the italics are minimally different from the roman, essentially a slanted version of the roman, except the lowercase \"a\" which changes to a one-story form.\n\n"

      "content": "\"does anyone have any tips or tricks\"\n\nAside from the argument of terms, and what is Italic, if you are making a sloping style to compliment a non-sloping style, here is the general start to a sans. All ascents and descents, x-heights, cap heights and figure heights stay the same. (that's the good news). The widths are between 92% and 96% of the non-sloping style, the main stems are 94% to 98% of the non-sloping style. The actual percentages you choose are ball-parked by the overall width and weight of the source, but depend ultimately on the eyes in your head. The reason for this is that the sloping of a style makes it wider, and heavier to the eye, and you need to fix that first, before you even slope. After you do, (8-11 degrees according to taste, size of use, and speed of traffic, you have lots of curves and diagonals to correct: curves between 4 and 5 o'clock and 10 and 11, you need to push out, between 1 and 2 o'clock, and 7 and 8 o'clock. pull in. The diagonals fall into two disturbed groups as well. The ones that, in house framing, would have stopped the slope from happening, need to be thinned, those that helped push it over need to be thickened. Then, you have to choose whether you're going to put all the points on extrema, and if so, you have to re-digitize, or if you use the green gem in FL to fix it up for ya, you'll want to make a copy to the mask beforehand, so you can see where that tool fails. Spacing should be about the same as the non-sloping style and you should be ready to proof...\n\n"

Also I don’t know about the pentagon, at least in that orientation. Maybe a hexagon…\"\n\nBelieve it or not those elements are actually pretty well thought out. The leading is set to the minimum signage standards based on viewing distance specified in the book \"Wayfinding: People, Signs, and Architecture\" by Paul Arthur and Romedi Passini. This is not to say that there isn't room for improvement. It should also be taken into account that these signs were made to be viewed on a small platform with the viewer being usually no more than 25 ft from the sign. For Norbert's placement (which is actually a \\*damn\\* good idea for sign placement) would mean that I would have to both increase the point size of the type and the leading.\n\nAs for the shape...it wasn't an arbitrary decision. What makes New York unique? It consists of 5 boroughs. The MTA operates in all 5 boroughs. Thus a 5 sided shape (pentagon) and not a circle. Since it was my thesis project, I could get a little more theoretical with the approach. I also changed the shape to solidify a firm identity within the system. There is a constant repetition of the pentagon shape in my plans. I also have a borough/station identification system that makes use of the shape. It was an attempt to tie symbols with the type for quick, clear understanding. Alas, I'm sure a lot of people are going to think that's a load of hooey, so I'm flexible in the shape eventually changing.\n\n"

In Patria I've reduced the x-height a hair (admittedly prompting Luc[as] de Groot to critically ask me \"Why?\" in Rome) but that was actually just to make it more \"delicate\" than the Roman, to pull it away (especially needed I think considering my Italic's Roman structures and slight slant).\n\nhhp\n\n"
