  "content": "Hi, I just bought a box of old leady type from a small print shop. It's a display sized Black Letter family. There seem to be mixed pieces of 72 and 60 pt in the box.\n\n¿Any idea on how to clean this? Most of the dirtiness is dust but there are also some rusted pieces.\n\nTIA\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014103841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_9543_4689.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014103841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_9544_6371.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014103841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_9547_4227.JPG)\n\n",

This are \"Gussmarken\" - I don't know the english word.
