  "content": "I am working on a brand for a summer-long church event. The brand theme is as follows (in order of importance):\n\n1. Compliment an Old World themed room (Think Tuscany)  \n2. Contain Palm Trees in the imagery  \n3. Have a luau feel to it  \n4. Fun, family, summertime\n\nDon't know if that helps paint a picture in your mind, but my issue is finding a typeface to anchor this brand design. Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nBrent\n\n",

Maybe just a nice clean semi-serif (not Rotis, but something like it) that looks travel-ish. Put it with the imagery and that might fit the bill?\n\n"
