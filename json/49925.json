  "content": "Hi!\n\nI am designing a Powerpoint presentation on a luxury hotel and resorts brand. I would like to add small icons to suggest aspects of travel, ie.\n\nfood and drink, plane, bed (accommodation), shopping, business meeting, spa etc.\n\nI was going to draw them straight into Illustrator, but does anyone know any fonts that would be good for this? They must be a font and not 3D icons etc as I need to customise the colours.\n\nI am looking for clear and simple travel signage similar to Swiss style or some quirky icons would be good.\n\nThank you!\n\n",
