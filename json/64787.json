The site also lists the \"The font-subsetting source code.\"\n\nI was wondering if this type of function is available in any software usable on a Mac or is available as a web op that could do the same for a user with a particular font he is in posession of?\n\nHopefully I've made myself clear enough.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nPatrick Chuprina\n\n",
