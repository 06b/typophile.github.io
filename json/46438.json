Let’s hope they turn ligatures back off until they can fix them for 3.1.\n\nAs for the kerning, I haven’t noticed it making anything less legible so far, but the web is still mostly limited to type carefully considered for onscreen use. Maybe it will be a lot worse for all the fonts out there that weren’t.\n\n"
