I've gone through some of the biggest font databases I can find, and I cannot find this font anywhere. I really need your help and expertise on this subject.\n\nWhat I need to know is, the exact name of the font, and what family of font does it derived from, and the name of the company where I can buy this from. The fonts in particular I'm trying to identify are \"old memories\".\n\nI've included a JPG photo of the plaque for you to look at. I really hope you can help me out here, because I keep running into dead ends, and run out of places to look.\n\nThank you very much for your help.\n\nMichael G.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014045413im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OldMemoriesCarClub_4832.jpg)\n\n"
