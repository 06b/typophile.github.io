  "content": "I’m editing an existing ttf using fontographer 4.1.4 (Mac OS 9) - I’m a new user — trying to copy a character from, say, decimal char # 195 into char # 15. The fog file saves the change, but when I generate font (either ttf or PS type 1), the change is not generated. I need to be able to use some from ASCII chars 0 to 32 as I have a printing system that only supports up to ASCII 127. Need help badly.

      "content": "TrueType fonts cannot have characters in those slots. PostScript fonts can, but access is very limited in older Mac systems, and not supported in later systems. In Mac PostScript fonts, for instance, low ASCII slots are sometimes used by font developers to store Windows-only characters for convenience sake. But there is normally no way to access them on the Mac, and definitely no way to type them.\n\nWhat kind of strange printing system do you have which only supports 7-bit ASCII? An Epson MX-80?\n\n"

I have the font as postscript, too. Maybe I should try editing that and re-generate a new postscript font(?).\n\n"

The lower ASCII range is not meant as a place to put “normal” characters. This is where special codes like the carriage return, line feed, delete, and tab are found. Using them for normal characters will probably not work, even if you are able to make such a font.\n\n"
