(The other one too, but I knew that one already :-)\n\nDunno, I'm partial to samples that have a large showing of the base alphabet (at least as long as it's being intensely worked on – later on in the process, a smaller one showing the entire character set should be more useful); and I strongly agree that text fonts should include actual sample text at actual target sizes. When evaluating alternatives, both/all should be shown in context.\n\nFor the text setting: Maybe the best idea would actually be to show both the target language of the font and English\\*; while the former can show the desired texture, and how the font deals with language-specific peculiarities like diacritics, the latter can give most people in here an impression of how it reads.  \n(\\* Assuming it is a Latin font.)\n\n"
