  "content": "I am working on a typeface and not looking forward to the idea of redesigning each glyph for every single [weight](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/weight), so I'm very interested in generating some of the weights using [multiple masters](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/multiple%20master) in FontLab.\n\nHow does this generally work? I read the chapter in the FL manual and it seems that the best way to do it is:\n\n1) Create a regular weight  \n2) Create \"extremes\", for instance, \"Ultra Thin\" and \"Ultra Black\".  \n3) Interpolate the intermediate forms, like Thin, Light, Bold, Black, etc.\n\nIs this how it's generally done? Are most typeface families created from these three weights? Also, are the results acceptable if you're interpolating something across a wide range, such as an interpolation between a regular weight and an \"Ultra Black\" weight? Or should the extremes be closer together?\n\nLastly, I want at least three weights-- light, regular and bold. I'd imagine that in this case, MM can't help me, as I would need at least these three weights before I could do any interpolation anyway. The only other way would be using extrapolation, but I don't trust the results of that particular technique for my font weights.\n\n",

You don't need a whole font, just make a few letters and see what happens.  \nIf you want three weights, it makes sense to have Hairline and Ultra as the extremes, rather than Light and Bold, because you will then be able to make those anyway, and interpolation is far better than extrapolation. And for a sans, Hairline is quite easy--just draw a path (using your Regular in the mask layer as a guide) and give it a stroke value of 20.\n\n"

However, the horizontal bar is too heavy for this weight since it is (almost) proportional in both the source weights.  \nIn the XB the bar is tweaked very much, which finds its way into the interpolated SB, as seen on the right: the horizontal is too heavy, and also the overall weight.  \nWhat we want is something in between: part extrapolation and part interpolation. This can be achieved by adjusting the weights in our cocktail that gives the semibold. I typically put the three weights into an MM font (which means, unfortunately, that two masters are identical) and then calculate the required MM positions to give the desired resulting weight, and amount of extra- vs interpolation. Note that in the above example the fact that there is exactly 100% REG is random, it could be more or less than that.\n\nThis may all seem complicated and the improvements are not drastic. However, it amost does not cause any additional work – all you have to do is to combine your weights a bit differently when you generate the weights you do not design manually. It is my experience that the time you save for correcting the semibold outweighs (ha ha) the effort to set up the MM font.\n\n"

This means that the width of the medium stem is the geometric mean of the widths of the smallest and largest stems. This is equivalent to saying that the logarithm of b is exactly the arithmetic mean of the logarithm of a and that of c. This is logarithmic interpolation and this looks interesting. My feeling is that Tim's interpolation uses a quadratic fit (whence the parabola). Am I wrong? Tim, would it make any sense to mix the two approaches (i.e. take a log, use a quadratic fit, and then exponentiate)?\n\nMichel\n\n[edit 1] Maybe the method should rather be called \"exponential interpolation\". I can find no reference for the moment.  \n[edit 2] Yes, it should be called exponential interpolation as can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222039/http:/music.nuim.ie/musictec/docs/progr/interpolation.pdf).\n\n"

For example, if you have three successively heavy weights, A,B,C, then algebraically A/B = B/C. Rearranging you get Lucas's formula: AC = B^2 .

My approach does not say anything about the weight of the individual instances, it considers only the interpolation.

A pure interpolation with a kink is a special case in my approach.\n\n<cite>Yes, it should be called exponential interpolation</cite>\n\nNo, it should be called geometric sequence or progression (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric\\_sequence](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317222039/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_sequence \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric\\_sequence\")).

However, if the smallest stem is a, the largest is c, and if you have 5 weights between a and c, then according to Lucas the stem of weights k=1 to 5 is a\\*(c/a)\\*\\*(k/6.0) using Python code. The explanation in terms of geometric progression is nice but does not give Python code.\n\n[edit] I meant according to the formula y(x) = y0\\*(y1/y0)\\*\\*x; here y0 = a, y1 = c; x is k/6 where k=0 for stem a and k=6 for stem c and k from 1 to 5 gives those in between.\n\n"
