I've had a look at it and if that's what this is made from it's been changed a lot... maybe it was skewed and the serif on the p was customized?\n\nCheers,\n\nDom\n\n"

Part of my thinking is also that American Typewriter is way more well-known and has been around for a long time, while Lacrima is found only at a small Swiss web site. P22 Remington doesn't seem to match very well, judging from the 'c' and 'a' shapes in the italic. I'm putting my money on the ITC font (with distortion).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
