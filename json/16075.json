  "content": "Provided the EULAs of certain fonts in my collection allow me to do this (some of which are horribly written), I'd like to convert a few Type 1 and TrueType fonts of mine to OpenType.\n\nThere are several tools that can do this (for Windows):\n\n- Fontlab Studio  \n- TransType Pro  \n- Crossfont 4.0\n\nAnother one I've read about is \"Adobe OpenType Converter\", but I'm not sure if it is available for the average consumer. I'm still curious about this one, however. Is it Adobe's exclusive tool? Does it work well?\n\nWhich program should I use? All I want to do is simply take a Postscript file (.pfm,.afm, etc.) and convert it. Same for TrueType. I don't intend to include any special features. But are there any kerning perculiarities or other issues I should consider?\n\n",

As this adds no functionaility and is not currently validated by any known software this would be a waste of time.\n\nSo although there are benefits to converting the Type 1 fonts to OT, there's no benefit or reason to 'convert' TrueTypes.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"
