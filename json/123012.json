Kelmscott is based on William Morris' classic Troy type design. Joyeuse is based on an English font of the same period which was clearly influenced by Morris. Rousseau is derived from a slightly later French design which shows many of the same influences.  \n---end quote---  \nRousseau is probably not the original name of the font, a heavier version of which would seem to be the original source of the lettering on your Columbia record titling.  \nNote that Rousseau is a lighter version of the letters than the ones in the Columbia record titling.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Solved more of the puzzle.  \nThe original name of the font seems to be Kloster-Gotisch and it is German rather than French. I believe that Scriptorium called it \"Rousseau\" because this name appears in the type specimen, as published by Ludwig Petzendorfer\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415044944im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KlosterGotisch2SM_6124.jpg)\n The specimen is for the \"magere\" or lighter weight.  \nI believe that your lettering is from the \"fette\" or bold weight of Kloster-Gotisch or from an extremely similar font.  \nDon\n\n"
