There's only a little bit in the site's descriptions about how they fit into museum signage, but it's something.\n\n"

      "content": "The type of museum might play a role in your design decisions. Legibility is probably first and foremost though. Consider that you will have people of all diferent heights (and eye strengths) trying to read at a fixed level. Larger than usual leading and point sizes over 16 help out in these areas. Museums are often surprisingly darker than you think of them to be also.\n\nThe Museum may have a style guide that they adhere to. The copy editor might be a good person to inquire about that with. Or inquire with the installation manager. They are often aware of what works and what doesn't in their particular galleries.\n\n"

Garamond No. 3.\n\nanother question i have is...What's the best way to determine point size  \non multi size information panels ranging from 2\"x3\" up to 8x16 feet.  \nshould there be a system when upscaling type to bigger panels?  \nOr should it be more intuitive, what feels right for each size pane.this would be for both copy size and headline.\n\nI would love to see more examples like this. and any more info. thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_5761.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/5_6318.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Confed-mem-hall-sign-IMG_41_4655.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DesignMuseumCafe_6160.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Holocaust-Hitler_6657.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/signage-wall_5033.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4_4401.jpg)\n\n"
