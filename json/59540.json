      "content": "Sim,\n\nThanks for pointing that out. I have refined the S and s so that the center stroke is smoother and the outside shape is \"blockier\" but I'm not sure if I've specifically addressed your issue. I will continue to analyze that.\n\nCerulean,\n\nI completely agree with you about the a variant, and had already made one with a stem. Good catch.\n\nI've attached a preview image and a larger .pdf that includes some Cyrillic copy I pulled from wikipedia. I hope there are some Russian natives that can look it over and offer feedback.\n\nThank you for the advice so far,\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225357/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n[http://www.insignedesign.com/files/SommetRTypoCYR.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225357/http:/www.insignedesign.com/files/SommetRTypoCYR.pdf)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Sommet-Page-Source2_5258.png)\n\n"

      "content": "The boldest weight works best. A lot more could be done to harmonize the shapes of the letters. Perhaps take a look at how [FF Sanuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225357/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_sanuk_1_ot/) balances verticals with subtle near-horizontal curves. The diagonals can be somewhat jarring in this scheme. W calls too much attention to itself, and I think M should be tamed as well.\n\nAs for the Cyrillic letters, у needs to descend, the 'legs' of д need to descend more, and the bowl of ь needs to be a touch taller and narrower and given a treatment similar to d. The side of б probably should be more vertical. The м stands out even more in the Cyrillic, and should really be given vertical sides.\n\n"

      "content": "Jongseong,\n\nThank you for your time and feedback.\n\nI'm studying FF Sanuk per your suggestion. I was wondering about the W, and your comment pushed me to rework it, but I kept the old as an alternate. I prefer the spread M form, but I created an alternate and used the vertical sided M and м for the Cyrillic.\n\nPer your comment, I've extended the д legs. Let me know if I need to go further. I changed the y to the English lowercase form as the other references agreed with you. I had already reworked the б prior to your comment.\n\nI've increased the counter size of the ь on the bolder weights and made it a bit taller. Could you clarify \"given a similar treatment to d?\" My refs all agree that is it appears like an upside down P smallcap.\n\nThank you,\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225357/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SommetPageSourceCYR_6630.png)\n\n"

      "content": "I like the improvements!\n\nThe д should still descend a bit more. Usually it descends as much as the ц.\n\nThe ascender of the б looks a bit cramped against the bowl. I would nudge the part that connects to the bowl up and to the left, so that the curve is a bit squarer.\n\nThe counter size and shape for the ь looks right. What I meant about the treatment similar to the d (I should have said b) is that the bottom of the bowl could be curved and skewed, which is a defining feature of this design for letters such as a, b, and d. You can refer to [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/oksana-text/|Oksana Text] to see how this letter can be treated in an informal Cyrillic design.\n\nMaybe the M doesn't have to be vertical. I thought a vertical M would be in keeping with your design where the vertical lines are the constant shared between many letters, but in the case of the M (and for м), I now think having the sides a touch inclined would flow better with the rest of the design. The original spread M is too much for the Cyrillic, I think, but maybe something in between would work.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
