A font like Zapfino Extra that isn’t used to typeset long texts but its purpose is rather to make “text collages”, is fine to use PUA. After all, the designer will most likely use some ornaments, calligraphic extensions and other non-text elements in it. It really doesn’t matter if the final result isn’t totally searchable, because in a typeface like Zapfino, it’s the GRAPHIC effect that counts.\n\nIn short: if form is more important, PUA is fine. If content is more important, avoid PUA.\n\nA.\n\n"
