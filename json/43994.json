  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am hoping someone here might be able to hep me identify my font. I’ve already used several online font identification sites, but I cannot seem to find the match. I used a font found on a free site to create the graphics on my blog, at [http://www.styleitonline.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705162353/http:/www.styleitonline.com/ \"http://www.styleitonline.com\"). Since that time (a year and a half ago) I have lost the font files and the original graphics, so I am unable to create more graphics with the same font.\n\nDoes anyone know which font I used to create the Style IT portion of my banner? I’m very grateful for your help!\n\nBest,\n\nSarah\n\n [‹ cardboard CD case sizing issues](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705162353/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43955 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typeface for Magazine Subheads ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705162353/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44021 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
