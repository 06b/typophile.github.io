The scan is from a predictably wonderful article by Ovink in an old issue of Quaerendo, which also happens to have a reference to that superb Deberny font that came up in the Javal thread. Apparently there was a reaction to all the Didone typography during the bulk of the 19th century, and this design was one of the seminal works in the resultant \"old-style\" revival, which was however superceded by Morris's Arts & Crafts revival soon afterwards. Shame, since I think the A&C stuff was somewhat provincial, or at least naive.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

This is the first time I'd ever even heard the guy's name.   \nBut although this was a reaction against the \"constructed\" Didone trend, and a revival of a more chirographic past, it still looks \"synthetic\" to me (maybe because they couldn't stray _too_ much from the spirit of that era), so I don't think they were \"digitizing\" any handwriting/calligraphy.   \n   \nBTW, the caps are supposed to be how mid-19th century Frenchies thought the Romans were supposed to have wanted to mahe them... Hard to explain - you'd really have to read the Ovink article(s).   \n   \nAnd yeah, I _love_ that hefty apostrophe!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

That is a face that needs to be made available.   \n   \nThis is not a criticism, but the entire face seems to be on the condensed side, with the exception of the fullish caps; at least the two shown.   \n   \nIf the proof you included was initially 9 point or thereabouts, it seems to me that the set would be more than tight enough.

I know that L Mandel thinks \"real\" French type must have a small x-height.   \n   \nAnyway, the showing is from G W Ovink's \"Nineteenth-century reactions against the didone type model - II\", the second in a three part treatise in Quaerendo (V1#2, V1#4 and V2#2). The section on Jannet is pp 287-290.   \n   \nLouis Perrin started the elzevir/old-style revival trend in the second quarter of the 19th century, then Jannet and another -Th�ophile Beaudoire- really gave it wings. Of the ones I've seen, Jannet is by far the best to me. BTW, his punchcutter was one Gouet. The article also mentions a Brit, Whittingham, who was a revivalist on the other side of the channel - I'd be interested to see samples of his work.   \n   \nBTW, I don't know how much of this is in Updike's venerable \"Printing Types\". I own a copy, but am almost too afraid to look - I might be fatally sucked in!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Just that part of history generally don't appear on standard Anglo-US typography books.   \n   \nFor Perrin its pretty clear, as described by Ponot in its 2 books. He wanted typefaces who by its forms reflect old text he want to publish. 19th typefaces don't fitted well, so he tried to find old typefaces, and used one existing old italic, and designed a Roman lc to fit with. Its caps are already done to do the titling for his HUGE book on Roman Lyon Inscriptions. I describe the Italic as a pure Garalde, when the Roman is more an Incised Garalde, perhaps the first text face of the category at this time?   \n   \nPerrin was one of the first typefaces revival done at the original ANCT (Imprimerie nationale), roughly 1987 by Jean Renaud Cuaz and Ronan Le Henaff under the direction of Mandel. Then, later later, the Imprimerie Nationale asked to Franck Jalleau, their in-house type designer to do a digital version who is used ONLY in the Ponot book you refer.   \n   \nAbout Jannet, there is less stuff about it. Gerard unger refered to it several time, as a French \"Gout Hollandois\"!   \nI have here a couple of Biblioth�que Elzevirienne books composed in \"Jannet\" they indeed are beautifully printed, nice paper, nice layout, etc for the period.\n\n"
