That's the last ATypI that I went to. The food was good, as I'm sure you heard. Actually, a lot of the content was good too. On the other hand after Leipzig's content anything would have seemed good... But the city made up for it in such a big way - I've never had such huge blisters from walking.\n\nhhp\n\n"
