  "content": "Hi all\n\nI am designing a display typeface in Fontlab. It has substitute ligatures for pretty much every letter combination (like A\\_A, A\\_B, A\\_C...etc). I want to put them all as discretionary ligatures. The code at the moment looks like this:\n\nfeature dlig {  \n sub A A by A\\_A;  \n sub A B by A\\_B;  \n sub A C by A\\_C;  \n sub A D by A\\_D;  \n sub A E by A\\_E;  \n sub A F by A\\_F;  \n sub A G by A\\_G;  \n sub A H by A\\_H;  \n sub A I by A\\_I;  \n sub A J by A\\_J;  \n sub A K by A\\_K;  \n sub A L by A\\_L;  \n sub A M by A\\_M;  \n sub A N by A\\_N;  \n sub A O by A\\_O;  \n sub A P by A\\_P;  \n sub A R by A\\_R;  \n sub A S by A\\_S;  \n sub A T E by A\\_T\\_I;  \n sub A T I by A\\_T\\_E;  \n sub A T by A\\_T;  \n sub A U by A\\_U;  \n sub A V by A\\_V;  \n sub A W by A\\_W;  \n sub A X by A\\_X;  \n sub A Y by A\\_Y;  \n sub A Z by A\\_Z;\n\n.......(and will eventually go all the way to Z\\_Z)....\n\n} dlig;\n\nI am afraid it may end up being huge and perhaps make the font slow, although it is a display font so most probably it won't be used for huge chunks of text.\n\nIs there any other way to do it? I am not good at scripting and I've searched around but I couldn't find if there is another way to use classes to do it.\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
