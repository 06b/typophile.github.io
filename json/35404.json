I’ve been using fonts that are close to what they use, but darn it, I’d like them to be exact if I can. Can anyone i.d. the fonts in this JPEG, or does anyone know offhand what fonts the OC Register uses? Thanks.\n\n(BTW - I \\_think\\_ that the main serif font is Century Schoolbook... it’s close, but not a perfect match)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203532im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/OCReg_5581.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [OCReg.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203532/http:/typophile.com/files/OCReg.jpg) | 173.06 KB |\n\n [‹ What about this one from Harper's ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203532/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35406 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Odometer font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024203532/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35403 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Looks like the fonts are:\n\nInterstate (thanks, bshaykin)\n\nBenton Modern One\n\nFrom MyFonts.com:\n\nMorris Fuller Benton of USA  \nBorn: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 1872  \nDied: Morristown, New Jersey, 1948\n\nLeading American type designer who designed typefaces and managed the typographic design program at ATF from 1892 until 1937; son of Linn Boyd Benton.\n\n...Benton designed (is credited for) Century Expanded and Century Schoolbook, which must be why it’s (CS) so close. I couldn’t find a listing for Benton Modern, does anyone know who carries it, or is it a custom job for the paper/publisher?\n\n"
