      "content": "The Eszett (»germandoubles«) is replaced by two »S« in uppercase texts. So you can simply make a glyph of two »S«, but you should not leave it blank.\n\nAbout the missing special characters:  \nIt's always a good idea to design complete codepages. Take a look at:  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416064329/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252 \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252\")  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac\\_Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416064329/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Roman \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac\\_Roman\")\n\nIf you use FontLab, it's very easy: Just select the codepage and fill all grey characters with your designs. So you will have support for all the languages mentioned on the Wiki pages above.\n\nRalf\n\n"
