If none of us recognized this as a commercial font, then your best bet would be to type this phrase into the sample window at [Dafont’s SciFi category](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423084307/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303) and see if a match shows up. I’m amazed at how often this works on this style of font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
