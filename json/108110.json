      "content": "This should help. Below are excerpts from the 'palt' and 'vpal' GPOS features in our KozGoPr6N-Medium OpenType font:\n\nfeature palt {  \n position \\634 \\<-20 0 -500 0\\>;  \n position \\638 \\<-250 0 -500 0\\>;  \n position \\674 \\<-480 0 -500 0\\>;  \n} palt;\n\nfeature vpal {  \n position \\638 \\<0 250 0 -500\\>;  \n position \\7887 \\<0 20 0 -500\\>;  \n position \\7899 \\<0 480 0 -500\\>;  \n} vpal;\n\nThe font is CID-keyed, so the glyph references are CIDs. CIDs 634, 638, and 674 correspond to U+3001, U+30FB, and U+FF08, respectively. These are good examples, because they represent a left-justified (U+3001), right-justified (U+FF08), and centered (U+30FB) glyph. The vertical form of CID+634 is CID+7887, and that of CID+674 is CID+7899. CID+638 is used for both horizontal and vertical writing, because it is centered in the em-box.\n\nAlthough the new advance widths are 500 units, meaning half-width, there is no requirement that this be the case. We simply decided to implement them that way for this particular font.\n\n"
