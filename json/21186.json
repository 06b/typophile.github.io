Perfect for simple branding with some personality.\n\nHow do you think this type of treatment will age?  \nIt seems to be increasingly popular, at least here in Australia.  \nI guess it depends on how well thought out the design is, and whether its executed nicely...\n\nthoughts?\n\n"

I try to avoid fonts which have been overused so as to avoid the negative associations which a reader may form in their mind. That is, if someone is bombarded with a font again and again eventually that font is something they notice rather than the work itself. As much as i love type - i always hope the viewers of my work see past the font to the message.\n\n"
