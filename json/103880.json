  "content": "Hello All,\n\nIn my job, I have to deal with folks who have very little attention span. Often I have to write elevator-pitch summaries for which Narrow / Condensed fonts work much better than Regular version of fonts. Also, earlier I had been using Garamond or Cambria for printed-out presentations, but after reading articles about Baskerville font, I tried out Baskerville Old Face. While the switched to Baskerville Old Face hasn't noticeably improved any success rates, I have received more positive comments about the presentations.\n\nAre there any font recommendations that are simultaneously BOTH  \n(a) Narrow / Condensed  \n(b) based on Baskerville (Old Face)\n\nFreely available font recommendations will be much appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nPrad\n\n",
