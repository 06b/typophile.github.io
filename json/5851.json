An updated version of Fontographer 3.5 welded on top of the Python programming language makes a scriptable typedesign tool. Designers can program the functionality they need themselves.   \n   \nDevelopment for RoboFog has stopped. The Fontographer code was too old to be ported to OSX. Also the requirements for a good font editor went up. In the mean time we've focussed our development effort into RoboFab, a toolkit for scripting and programming with fonts and glyphs, inside and outside of FontLab. \"   \n   \nThe 6th hit:   \n   \n [http://just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFog](http://web.archive.org/web/20100323040728/http:/just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/RoboFog)   \n   \n\"RoboFog   \nRoboFog is a version of Fontographer 3.5 that embeds a Python interpreter. RoboFog was developed by Just van Rossum, Petr van Blokland and Erik van Blokland. It is more or less discontinued, although we fix bugs for those still using it. It's based on very old source code, and while it has served its purpose well, we've reached the limits of what we can do with it. For example it can't properly support larger character sets, unicode or new font formats. It's a classic MacOS app and won't be ported to MacOSX. These days there is FontLab, and for all its quirks, it is much more powerful than RoboFog could ever be. Our RoboFab project should make Python scripting for FontLab more comfortable. \"   \n   \nFinally, the 4th hit delivers the resolution:   \n   \n [http://www.letterror.com/code/robofab/intro.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100323040728/http:/www.letterror.com/code/robofab/intro.html)   \n   \n\"RoboFab Intro   \nRoboFab is a library of Python code for manipulation and storage of font and glyph related data. RoboFab implements a new font file format, the Unified Font Objects or .ufo for short. UFO is a format for font sources (similar to something like .fog or .vfb) except that UFO is XML based (see Glyph Interchange Format), readable, well documented and easily extended to contain different kinds of data. (...)   \n   \nWhat RoboFab is not..   \nNot entirely RoboFog MkII   \nRoboFab is not a port of RoboFog to OSX, nor is it a complete font editor with interfaces, font and glyph windows etc. It is a toolkit that you can use to build your tools with. You can start by using RoboFab to make scripting in FontLab easier. But you can also use RoboFab to build elaborate tools (for instance MetricsMachine) that read and write UFO fonts and work on the data. Other RoboFab based tools are under construction. \"   \n   \nI hope this helps.   \n   \nBest,   \nAdam Twardoch\n\n"
