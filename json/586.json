  "content": "we are involved in the rebranding of romania's seventh IT company and we have analysed so far rebranding programmes for IT companies. almost all of them go for the logotype solution.   \n   \nso, we tried to develop a logotype based on the visual personality of the old logo, in an attempt to preserve some brand equity. I wanted to ask all the great type designers on this forums where they get theit inspiration from.   \n   \nhow do you start working on a logotype?   \n   \n ![comparison](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154337im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12809.gif)   \n   \nis the solution we came up with acceptable from the type pont of view? thank you all so much ....   \n   \nPS: there is another thing bothering me now: brand's verbal distinctiveness lies in its \"X\", but this letter evolved into a visual cliche. what's left to be done?\n\n",

It is not just that it is a visual cliche, that cliche is also a bit dated and could even cause difficulties with legal protection in many countries.   \n   \n\\> how do you start working on a logotype?   \n   \nMostly the same way you did. What you did could be one of the schetches, but maybe you have to look for more solutions and than choose the one with no obvious problems like 'visual cliche'.   \n   \nIn case you insist to present this logo, you will probably have to make vertical/horizontal optical correction. You should also consider the rythm of the logo which is broken (as Dmitry noticed) by the very wide and open D. It's counter is much larger than the ones in other letters.   \n   \nI hope that we will be able to follow the evolution of this logo soon.\n\n"
