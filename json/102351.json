  "content": "In trying to help out finding Gustavian typefaces [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140711002913/http:/typophile.com/node/102344), I ended up thrawling through old documents at Litteraturbanken.se, which is a good resource for swedish type from the time.\n\nOf course, my knowledge is somewhat limited in the area. [This anthology page](http://web.archive.org/web/20140711002913/http:/litteraturbanken.se/#!forfattare/AlfEP/titlar/StroddaSkaldestycken/sida/15/faksimil) (and the rest of the book, click through if you want, press the little \"5\" icon to zoom) is printed almost entirely in an unfamiliar Italic, which is clearly not Caslon but shares some similar properties. Still, that looped w, that squarish a, that oblique g, that rather extreme cursiveness... what is this? Also note the Roman capital G's supremely right-leaning barb.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140711002913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lb2428951_5_0036_6486.jpeg)\n\n",
