Maybe it’s because I can’t just find a good clasification name for this. I know its a modern or contemporary sans-serif. But I just can’t get it.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906191155/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%203_46.png) | 8.06 KB |\n\n [‹ Irish Hunger Memorial (NYC) typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906191155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46932 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [hugo & marie type id ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906191155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46927 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It is Edward Johnston’s Transport Alphabet digitized by Banks & Miles for London Transport (1988) and then probably snapped up by ITC. The design was commissioned by Frank Pick who was the commercial manager of the London Electric Railway Company in 1916 — exactly one hundred years after the first showing of a sans serif type by the London founder William Caslon IV. Johnston’s alphabet is the first sans (or ’gothic’ as the Americans say) that owes a design debt to humanistic script and roman epigraphic capitals. The model was greatly improved by Johnston’s friend and collaborator Eric Gill with his eponymous Gill sans which was produced by the English Monotype company in 1927.\n\n"
