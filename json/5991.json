I once witnessed a discussion between two of those trying to decide which typeface should go on a shopping bag. After half an hour(!) of uninterupted to and fro, one of them suddenly jumped up, a victorious smile on his face, and went: \"I've got it! Let's use Helvetica!\" Djeeez...   \n   \nJean-Fran\n\n"
