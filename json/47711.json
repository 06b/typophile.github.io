  "content": "So as a graphic artist, I know nothing about web design. I know A LITTLE (from what things like myspace teach you with adding templates, etc), but that’s about it. I’m trying to use WHAT I KNOW artistically to create my ideal website in illustrator, then saving for web and then linking them all somehow. I’m still working on that. Once I’ve got it figured out, I’m going to buy a domain and booyah! I will finally have an online website. Go me. Any help or critique would be appreciated.

That is perhaps the worst place to learn good web design. ;o)\n\nThe best advice I can give you is to remember that web design is more about suggestion than dictating. The best you can do is suggest a design, and the end-user may decide to over-ride your preferences. As such, work with the medium...don’t fight it. ;0)\n\nAs for your GIF...that is what they call a ’splash page’ and what most folks would call pointless and annoying. There’s no reason for it. Just take me directly to your home page.\n\n"
