  "content": "Hi all,  \nThis was quite a complex project for me, though short. I designed an obituary/memorial annoucement for a friend who died recently.\n\nSomeone sent me the piece she had designed in Word, which you see reproduced below (smaller than the original 8.5 X 11). She asked me for a better photo. I said: I think I better do the whole thing. She quickly agreed to that.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022064308im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cl-obit-original_5733.jpg)\n\nIt's all in Arial except for the odd brush-like title font.\n\nHere is my redesigned piece:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022064308im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cl-memorial-6i_5076.jpg)\n\nThe display font is \"Serena,\" which I bought a while ago, but never had the occasion to use. It seems to work. What do you think?\n\nI decided on colors to harmonize with the photo: green and brown.\n\nI struggled with the text font. It has to display well both onscreen and print, cause this is being sent out as an e-invitation to the wake/memorial.\n\nOf the sans text fonts, none had the dignified, elegant look I wanted, even Optima.\n\nOf the serif text fonts, of course I wanted something more elegant than Times or Georgia. I tried ACaslon, AGaramond, AJenson - none looked very clear onscreen. The slab serif fonts were more clear, but did not harmonize with Serena at all. I ended up using Warnock Pro. This comes with Adobe products, but I've never used it before. To my surprise it was clear onscreen (at full doc size), maybe because of the strong wedge-like serifs.\n\nI revised the copy as well.\n\nFeedback please?\n\n",
