      "content": "I don't know if this is a font or artwork. It's a mash-up of features from Helvetica -- the closed counter \\_S\\_, and Franklin Gothic -- the angled spur on G and the straight leg on R. The heavy weight letters are forced into the Procrustean bed of a perfect square and displayed in a monospace grid. Whether font or artwork the effect is to suggest that the Protestant milieu in Basel was regimented and oppressive. At least for this subset of letters, the design is effective for condemning authority. But when you place a heavy W or M into this format it disappears into a box of black.  \nDon\n\n"

That could give credit to the a bespoke type as well...

W and M are going to be very closed and almost solid black boxes, but if you edit to ensure at least narrow open wedges in the right places, they would still be recognizable.  \nDon\n\n"
