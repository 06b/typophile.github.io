Text figures feature numerals that come to the [x-height](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/typophile.com/wiki/x-height): 0,1,2; figures with [descenders](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/typophile.com/wiki/descender): 3,4,5,7,9; and [ascending](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ascender) figures: 6, 8. Some varations of text figures may not fit this same scheme, but this is the norm.\n\nSee also [Lining Figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lining%20Figures).\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [What Sans Serifs Have Old Style Figures?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/www.typophile.com/node/7718)  \n [Lower Case Numbers in San Serif, Anyone?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/typophile.com/node/36460)  \n [Old Style Figures (OSF) Height](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/typophile.com/node/54418)\n\nLinks:  \n [FYTI: Oldstyle Figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053103/http:/www.fonts.com/AboutFonts/Articles/fyti/OldstyleFigs.htm)\n\n",
