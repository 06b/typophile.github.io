  "content": "Hello All,   \n   \nThe following is a screen capture from the movie The Omega Man. It features a font I've seen many times being used in projects of the period (1960s-early 80s). Perhaps it's most notable use was as the typeface used for the Knight Rider television show. I've tried my usual sources. Does anyone know its name and whether it's been digitized?   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323000442im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23568.jpg)\n\n",

There is a \"freeware\" version of dubious origin under the name [Ruben](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323000442/http:/www.grimghosts.com/down/fonts/fonts.html).   \n   \nI worked on a new digitization of a condensed Rubens-style typeface, based on typography from Disney's Haunted Mansion attractions. It's called [Ravenscroft](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323000442/http:/www.grimghosts.com/down/fonts/fonts.html) and is freeware.   \n   \n [Treehouse](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323000442/http:/www.frontiernet.net/~treehous/Typefaces.html) also has a Haunted Mansion inspired font called [Victorian Mansion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323000442/http:/www.frontiernet.net/~treehous/Mansion.html).\n\n"
