  "content": "I'm designing a book containing a list of interviews, so the body text is made up from questions (in bold), followed by the answers (sometimes one word, sometimes several paragraphs).When I initially typeset a sample chapter, I used Georgia for the chapter titles, and Century Gothic for the body text - but am beginning to worry that this may be difficult to read in large chunks (I'm using 8pt text with 12pt leading; see sample below). I'm sure some readers are cringing at this choice, but many of the sans serif fonts (I've been asked to use sans serif for the body) I tried look quite dense on the page (futura, frutiger, helvetica, gill), and I like the roundness of Century Gothic with Georgia, but obviously what it looks like doesn't matter if nobody can read it!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SampleText_6435.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I would honestly stick to something a little easier to read for body text. One issue I could potentially see using Century Gothic would be the similarity between characters like the lowercase \"a\" and \"o\". My one concern with using a sans-serif font for body copy in print is readability- its usually easier to read serif set copy rather than sans-serif.\n\nOut of curiosity, which weight of Helvetica did you try? What happens if you play around with a lighter weight (45, maybe?) and track it a little loose, just to keep that open, free feel to the text?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your comments. I had a sneaking suspicion it was too hard to read... I only tried regular Helvetica, as this is the only one I have on my laptop, but the lighter weights will probably be available on campus, so I'll give it a go. I guess I was shying away from Helvetica because it seems to divide so many designers - it seems that people love it or hate it.\n\nI considered tracking a more dense font, but wasn't sure whether that was a good solution. Are there any pitfalls to watch out for when tracking fonts?\n\n"
