  "content": "Hello everyone\n\nWhat a great site and forum! This is my first post on this forum. MyFonts.com sent me here.\n\nI am looking for a nice modern font that is formal and professional looking for titles on a medical website. I feel like I'm resigned to Arial or Verdana for the text on the site, so I can use common fonts, but I'd like the titles to be much more interesting. I'd like to have some \"body\" to the font...if that is a good word. This is a high tech site.\n\nThank anyone for a reply\n\nDiane Sector\n\n",

According to the website, Stalemate \"was originally constructed as a proprietary font for a German IT-company.\" Moreover, it \"was designed to work both in print and on screen and experience shows that it performs well in both environments.\" It could be just what you're looking for.\n\nHere's a link to a [PDF sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232840/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/img/pdf/FTN_Stalemate.pdf) as well. Good luck!\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Diane,\n\nFirst off, I'm not quite a professional yet, I'm a student, so my suggestions may not be 100%, but here they are anyways :) If you're going to be using a sans for the body copy, I'd recommend a serif font, or a sans with some character for the display type. Here's just a few of my suggestions…\n\nDemocratica if a quirky font that is modern/hi-tech, and I don't know it seems kinda 'medical' to me  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/democratica/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232840/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/democratica/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/democratica/\")\n\nModern 735 is more conservative, but certainly is professional, and modern.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-735/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232840/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-735/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/modern-735/\")\n\nKingsbury Conensed is interesting.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/kingsbury-condensed-sg/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232840/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/kingsbury-condensed-sg/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/kingsbury-condensed-sg/\")\n\nUltra Bronzo is a sans, but has a good deal of character, fairly clean and high tech.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/ultra-bronzo/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232840/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/ultra-bronzo/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thirstype/ultra-bronzo/\")\n\nDitto with Copperplate Modern…  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/copperplate-modern/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232840/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/copperplate-modern/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/copperplate-modern/\")\n\n"
