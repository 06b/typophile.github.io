It's not pretty - but then Dave Smith, the designer, picked Novarese Stop for the logo of his earlier company, Sequential Circuits, and now uses Mistral for Dave Smith Instruments. Uurrghhh.  \nThis is from a photo of a Poly Evolver:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023929im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Poly%20Evolver%20Logo_3550.jpg)\n  \nAnd this is someone's copy:\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023929im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo%202_3876.png)\n\nThanks,  \nGeorge\n\n",
