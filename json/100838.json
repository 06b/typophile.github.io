  "content": "Hi everybody\n\nthis is my first spot and I am new to the forum. I am designing a typeface in Fontlab. I export the font and it looks great both in Fontlab and in Suitcase Fusion. But when I try and use it in Illustrator, when I zoom out the counters and bowls look weird, as if they are a bit offset upwards or downwards.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810031440im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Zoom33_4892.png)\n  \nthis image shows the screen in illustrator at 33% zoom. The top one is the written and the bottom one outlined.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810031440im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Zoom100_4344.png)\n  \nthis image shows the screen at 100%. Both look right.\n\nCan anyone help me on this?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Setting things to \"crisp\" tends to emulate print output in my eyes, and usually corrects those odd counter issues when zoomed out.\n\n"

I haven't got time at the moment to fix it, but I did alter something and reexported the font and it did look different. I will try tomorrow and fix it.\n\nNathaniel, are you sure there is such a dropdown selection in illustrators' character palette? There is one in photoshop.\n\nThank you all for your support.\n\n"

Setting it to crisp, however, makes it a lot more pleasant on the eyes.\n\n"

Indeed, there is a big difference when I set it to crisp - it all becomes normal. However, I think I will take the hard way and try and work on the hinting of the font, since I want other people to use it as well.\n\nI will keep you posted.\n\n"
