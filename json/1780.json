Berthold's Devinne look-alike.   \nNeither of these is available digitally that I know of, but   \nBitstream's [Romana](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141116/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/) is very close. No italic unfortunately.   \n   \nCouldn't find the script in any of my books. Troubador has   \nsome similarities (such as the uppercase M).\n\n",

      "content": "As Mark Simonson said, #3 it looks like Lateinisch from Berthold.   \n   \nI want to add that this font was digitized by a Russian foundry, ParaType ( [www.paratype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141116/http:/www.paratype.com/)). They named it Literaturnaya.   \n   \nThe font was donated to public domain, but only for use in TeX applications. It can be found in various russian TeX archives, both PFB and metrics, but the encoding is for TeX. Be sure to read the licence, cause it is not quite a free font.\n\n"
