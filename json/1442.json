  "content": "David,   \n   \nI've started a new thread on this subject so I can't be accused of hijacking someone else's.   \n   \nNow that I've thought about it for a whole day and looked over all the Heller texts I have hanging around at home, I can rationalise my feelings to a certain extent.   \n   \nIn a nutshell, then, I don't like it when a prolific and respected writer abuses his or her position and disseminates their own prejudices/political agenda disguised as critical writing.   \n   \nThis extract from Heller's _ **Designing Hate: Is There a Graphic Language of Vile Emotion** _ takes the biscuit as far as I'm concerned:   \n   \n_German Fraktur type (as opposed to other medieval gothics, such as Old English) still evokes iron-fisted authority. The words ULT!, VERBOTEN!, and JUDE! are frightening when spelled out in these letterforms. Actually, anything set in Fraktur, even the most harmless words and phrases, takes on a decidedly ominous look._   \n   \nI'm sorry, but this is pure propaganda. He should be ashamed of himself for publishing it. Or maybe the publisher should be ashamed.   \n   \nAnyway, this sort of thing coupled with the tripe in his Swastika book have most definitely turned me off his work.   \n   \nMatha\n\n",

And for very good reason: it's a superb graphic symbol of the Enemy, hence very useful to keep reminding people to be nice to the [erstwhile] Victim.   \n   \nI wish the Turks had such a symbol that we Armenians could use. It can even be argued (based on speeches Hitler made) that the Holocaust wouldn't have happened if we Armenians had such an enemy symbol available and had used it as effectively as the Jews use the Swastika. On the other hand, media wasn't nearly as good as brainwashing and manipulation as it is now.   \n   \nSo in a way I understand the Jewish desire to keep it Evil, but I can't stand the duplicity necessary in applying it (even though it's part and parcel of such propaganda), I guess because Jews aren't the underdogs any more. Now they have an underdog, who I guess are in turn lucky to have the Star of David as a symbol with as much potential as the Swastika! :-/   \n   \nBut what really riles me up the most isn't the Swastika treatment, it's the blackletter blacklisting. It is a violation of venerable typographic culture to subjugate blackletter to the Jewish cause (no matter if you think the cause is just or not) the way is done with the Swastika. Leave blackletter alone, so that it may flourish again.   \n   \n\\> To me it just takes big balls to tackle   \n\\> such a project and face the consequences.   \n   \nWhat the hell are the consequences when all you're doing is catering the existing power structure?!

I have never seen it in any Jewish literature, excepting that on the history of the Nazi period. Where you do see it is with those hate groups who like the Nazis, and in Arab political cartoons - where it is regularly pasted on Israeli leaders and the Israeli flag. I don't think they mean it as a compliment.   \n   \nThe infamy of the Nazi period tarred the swastika for at least a hundred years. Those who use it in the West offend Jews, and know it and don't care.   \n   \nFraktur is a different matter. I agree that it is not rational (though understandable) to identify it with the Nazis, and it should not be taboo.   \n   \nAs to brutal symbolism, I don't like it, but it is not an identifying mark of Naziism like the swastika.   \n   \nI dislike brutal symbolism for the same reason I dislike speech filled with anger. It undermines peace and love.\n\n"

I know that. You do, I see it in your writings.   \n   \nNaturally you are aware that many American blacks find Jews offensive because of their systematic participation in the slave trade? We have not stopped eating bagels though have we?   \n   \nFurther more what happened to the North American Indian? But we have not given them back their land, have we? Oh, land, but, but, that's much more than a symbol?   \n   \nFew people are aware of how many Indians lived in America when the white man came. Few know that the white man used biological warfare on them. And some democracy! I am not sure when the Indians were even allowed to vote. In Canada it was the fifties. Possibly the Canadian Indians got to vote earlier than the American Indians.   \n   \nAnyway, how many Indians do you figure there were? Lots! Far more than half of them were killed. So lets not talk so much of symbols. They are not evil. Mankind is evil. Lets get back to the Palestinians, or the Jewish \"state\". Heller seems to have much time on his hands. He should do something constructive such as identifying good from evil. The Palistinian question is a short study. But if he simply does not like Germans he should just come out and say so.   \n   \nMaybe he is a racist, anyone asked?   \n   \nFurthermore the Swastika has great meaning to other cultures. Also it has great meaning to the European cultures. I am not so sure that it should be \"swept under the table\". It is offensive to many and it should be. But symbols don't kill people, people kill people. So given Heller's logic we should get rid of people.   \n   \nThose are the issues that should be dealt with, as Henry Kissinger states, the \"National Psychiatric of Cultures\". The swastika should remain hanging in every household as a reminder of how terrible man is to each other. Frankly, I do not think things should be forgotten in 100 years, if ever.   \n   \nFurthermore, most of those illustrations, particularly the first set that Matha exhibited are indeed just plain ugly. They are offensive just because they are. Ugly!   \n   \nBut I could design a swastika that is beautiful and meant as such. Not only that but I would have spiritual justification for doing so. I could also print a beautiful book in Fraktur.   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nGerald Giampa\n\n"
