  "content": "Ok so here's my dilema. I have to write a ten page research paper for my advanced typography class. Mine is on Garamond. The paper is so we will have text to use for a book near the end of the semester. The problem with this paper is that it is due NEXT WEEK. So yea, I have about 3 days worth of research and then I get one day to write it.\n\nI am having trouble finding stuff on Garamond. (Not Adobe Garamond, the font created by Claude Garamond, the French printer.) I spent 2 days in our library at school, which is rather large. I only found at most a small paragraph in any book. They all said the same things.\n\nThe topic is not set in stone, so if anyone has a font in mind with a rich history, please share! No Helvetica... :D\n\n",
