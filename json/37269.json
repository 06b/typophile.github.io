  "content": "Hi.\n\nI'm hoping for a bit of help in finding some nice fat (rounded) fonts. As an example Fat Love [here](http://web.archive.org/) is of the type I am looking for, but when I follow the link I cannot locate it. Also I'm not mad about the slanty v's and a's.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120419202310im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fatlove_4269.gif)\n\n(if poss. free as well!).\n\nMany thanks.\n\nJim.\n\n",

It took hours for him to find out the problem, and then expunge said font (he had loaded hundreds at once).\n\nI don't know what he considers his time to be worth, but to me that was a very expensive free font.\n\n"

Well maybe before XP; anything could happen back then with Windows. The boogey-man was always just around the corner.\n\nThe real frustration with free fonts for me is suddenly realizing you need some characters that aren't there. Or odd behavior when put on vector curves. Or real bad spacing that requires some time spent adjusting. Or something is just 'off' when you are finished, and you can't seem to make it fly.\n\nSometimes I actually enjoy the challenge of making a quality-challenged font look its best, but then I realize it is a kind of false advertising, so I won't go too far with this.\n\nGiven the choice, and the ability to charge it to someone, I'd go with pay fonts most of the time. Just less surprises, on the whole.\n\nI imagine, if a font is well made, you might never realize the quality. It is lack of quality that is easy to focus in on, as a rule. And I get to see plenty of that. But for free, I can't complain (too much, anyway).\n\nAnd occasionally I have worked with a font that made me ooh and aah when using it. Now that is worth money.\n\n"

It was a gratifying experience. I just wish I could choose over, since my tastes have changed away from gimmicky display fonts since then.\n\n"
