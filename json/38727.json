Can you simplify it? What other symbols or emblems suggest this object without requiring specific details like the beacon’s cap?\n\n"

      "content": "The thin lines are to indicate the rail work on the lighthouse. I realize they do feel out of harmony with everything else having so much mass. I couldn’t seem to say lighthouse without putting the light on top. I did try a version with just a black circle above the diagonal lines taking away the thin lines and the black square, but was talked out of it.\n\nSomething beautiful and something ugly almost always works.\n\n"

      "content": "I think what throws me is that the beacon portion of the lighthouse is rounded to suggest dimension, while the bottom striped section isn’t. If you rounded the stripes a bit, that might make the contrast with the “B” better. I read a “B” right away, as the name Beacon is right below it. Nice concept, just needs a bit more tweaking.\n\n"
