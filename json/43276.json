  "content": "Hi everybody\n\nI´m designing a logo for a friend of mine, a human resources consultant . I came up with these 4 ideas, but somehow they all seem familiar to me; i did it all from scratch and tried to be as original as possible, but at the end i wonder if they are very similar to some others already existing. The copy reads \"human connection\" in spanish. I´ll appreciate your help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425025945im_/http:/typophile.com/files/conexion%20humana_4059.gif)\n  \nThanks, and best regards. \n",

      "content": "Yes, the two on the right hand side definitely look like the Ubuntu Linux logo (especially the bottom right).\n\nThe bottom left has the most potential, although right now it looks a little silly (too much like a smiley). But I think that one communicates a human connection better than the top left. That one reminds me of the Enron logo, and I don't think you're going for that.\n\n"

I just finished another design, this is pretty much my style (when illustrating personal projects) i tried to make it more personal to set it apart, i think it may work... critique accepted... thank you...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425025945im_/http:/typophile.com/files/prueba%202_5770.gif)\n\n"

The first one obviusly stands for the teamwork and the \"4 colour insights method\" applied during the consultancy... I´ll appreciate more feedback since im almost on time to show this first round and i know many of you typophiles are great critiques ;) thanks!!!\n\n"
