      "content": "Picture 1 is the weakest, IMHO.\n\nRegarding the other variations:  \nI don’t think that the open bottom on the stroked wordmark works.\n\nThe “fi” are begging to be connected.I would connect the top of the “f” to the dot in the “i”. You will have to raise the “i” and the “l” to accommodate for this. It is ok to have them all level, being that this is for a wordmark.\n\nI would separate the “o” and the “f” a little. In doing so, I would elongate the arm of the “f” to the left a bit. It would be nice to see an interaction between the overlap that is similar to the “r” and the “o”. I’m referring to the width of the space created by the overlap. Also, be widening the space between the “o” and the “f” you may be able to open up that top counter a little bit. That counter will become problematic at smaller sizes. Right now it draws your eyes away from the rest of the character interactions.\n\nLastly, I would separate the “1”. It doesn’t read 1 extremely well when connected. When you separate it, I would put a base on it. a sort of slab serif, like seen in a monospaced “1”. You may also play with slanted and enlargening the top of the “1”.\n\nYou may also wish to thicken the stroke, just a tad. That may help give a little more stability at smaller sizes.\n\nHildebrant.\n\n"
