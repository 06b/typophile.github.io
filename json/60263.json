Unfortunately for both of us, storyboarding animation has very little to do with the kind of typographic problems he's wrestling with. I don't I was hoping one of the experts here might have some font suggestions.\n\nThe only guidelines I have is that he prefers the 'modern' look of sans-serif fonts, and (though it strikes me as a bit overused these days) he's very attached to the thick/thin concept. This is something of a problem, since very few fonts I've been able to dig up offer a thick version heavy enough to balances the thin, but not so heavy that it completely dominates it.\n\nAny ideas would be very welcome!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108222331im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fonts_4943.png)\n\n",
