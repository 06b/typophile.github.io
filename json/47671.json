  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm working on an album cover for a band, and I'm looking for a display face to experiment with. Specifically, I'm looking for something something rough, raw; the sort of typeface that would beat you up in an alleyway. Part brute, part showman. The album has lots of connotations to religion and an underlying spaghetti western/military feel here and there. The band's point of reference was—half jokingly—the Wu Tang logo, at least in terms of its over-the-top brutish qualities. Apologies if this is all terrifically vague!\n\nAs far as the project goes, it's for a folk/drone record with a ton of distortion and odd experimental sounds, and it'll be a digital print with a colour palette of two or three.\n\nAny more information that would be useful, let me know! But anything you could suggest would be hugely appreciated.\n\nBest,  \nJez\n\n",
