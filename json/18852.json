  "content": "Hi There. First time post.\n\nI'm looking for the variant of Futura that IKEA is currently using. The closest one I have found is Elsner+Flake Futura New (which I can't even find for purchase anywhere, but did find on Identifont).\n\nIt's similar to that, and EF Futura 6 Heavy, with some differences. In general, the differences that I have noted between most versions of Futura and the IKEA 2005 catalog version (Heavy/Bold weight) are:\n\nIn the IKEA version...\n\n$ has line through entire glyph  \nS and $ shaped more like S from Avenir  \nj curved \\*unlike\\* E+F New, but \\*like\\* most editions of Futura  \n1 has angled serif  \nM and W have flat spurs  \n, \" are rounded  \ne has angled tail even in Bold weight  \nm and n are slightly less \"symmetrical\"\n\nAny thoughts would be most appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",
