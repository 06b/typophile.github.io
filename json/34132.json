I thought it was cool, and so decided to take a picture of it for using in the cover slide. I'm glad you like it :^)\n\n\\> _It kind of says, “Hey, we’ve been doing this for awhile.”_\n\nYep, Type at Adobe goes as far back as when the company debuted, which was about 25 years ago. And there are still people around from those early ages, like [David Lemon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016090758/http:/typophile.com/wiki/David%20Lemon) and [Robert Slimbach](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016090758/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Robert%20Slimbach), who have been working in the Type Department for more that 20 years each.\n\nBTW, [Thomas](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016090758/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Thomas%20Phinney) is celebrating his 10th anniversary at Adobe. So please join me in a big round of applause. Congratulations Thomas, wish you stay 10 more year, at least!!\n\n"
