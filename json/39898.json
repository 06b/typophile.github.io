  "content": "I'm actually a little afraid to ask this question because there's so much riding on it, but I've been planning [read: counting] on using scripts to automate the process of creating classes for metrics and kerning.\n\nPart of the reason is that I find the process painfully gruntwork-ish and would like to automate it for all future font projects, and second, because I've had bad experiences with FontLab thus far and on more than one occasion, have seen my metrics classes magically vanish without explanation and would like the ability to rebuild all classes the next time this happens.\n\nUnfortunately, between the Unofficial FontLab Python API and the admittedly shallow official documentation, I can't find any real mention of metrics or kerning classes.\n\nSo, dare I ask? Is there any way to create/modify classes from a Python script in FontLab, or is the workflow I'm building doomed?\n\n",
