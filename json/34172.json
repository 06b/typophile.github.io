Perhaps you can tell how good/popular a thread/topic was by counting the total number of responses it got. Within that you might want to get the number of different users that were involved in the discussion. (You know, there are threads that look like ping-pong matches...)\n\n"

For a while we've been thinking about ways to let some of the better threads float to the top. There is always the option of adding voting systems, etc, but it seems like queries that use intrinsic data that demonstrate interest are going to be better than prompting users for votes.\n\nThere may also be ways to look at number of reads, and how often a diversity of people return to a certain thread.\n\n"

There are people here I'd like to hear from more, others I'd like to hear from a lot less.\n\nAlso there's a real difference between a type ID thread and a thread that turns into a discussion. Number of comments is not a barometer, the recent enfant terrible thread runs to 5 pages and most of it is bickering among 3 people.
