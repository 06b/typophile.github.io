It nestles neatly in a place between the geometric, grotesque, and gothic. Its generous x-height, thoughtfully balanced color, and expert typographic features (small caps, text figures, lining figures, etc.) position it as a prime candidate for extended textual setting. This is definitely Mr. Simonson’s tour de force. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Proxima Nova pop-up in the next major magazine redesign. — Kyle Hildebrant</cite>\n\nand what about [avenir next](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423051003/http:/www.linotype.com/2090/avenirnext.html)?\n\n"

      "content": "My thoughts for using an extended face is to provide a little variety to the template...mainly used on “headline” copy. The wider letterforms can provide a unique, progressive feel that will create a modern edge that the publisher wants.\n\nI found [Relay](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423051003/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay) which is by far my favorite... a little pricey. But worth the cash!\n\nThanks so much for the suggestions!\n\n"
