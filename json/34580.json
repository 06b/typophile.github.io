It looked like this.

That's how we get it in Alaska in 2007. ;-)\n\nI expect it was the URW/FF digital that was used based on the way the titles looked- Digital texture in the font...\n\nI actually thought it might have been one of Nick Shinn's faces when I saw it in the theatre.\n\nMight Fontesque owe some of it's whimsy to this face...?\n\nAlso the proportions feel very Nick to me somehow.\n\n"

      "content": "Okay, I had a quick look at my specimens and this thing is a little more mysterious than it seemed at first glance. It will take a little more research, which I don't have time for right now.\n\nHere's what I've encountered so far. Artcraft is shown in both my BB&S specimen (c. 1925) and my 1923 ATF catalog. I can't remember if BB&S had joined ATF by 1923, but it would seem so; and yet there's the independent catalog, which I tentatively dated based on some Cooper Black evidence. No matter.\n\nThe BB&S samples do have mixed 'g's in the 10 point size. But there is no alternate 'g' shown among the displayed auxiliary forms. The Bold has one in the 8 pt showing. Not all sizes show examples of a 'g'.\n\nOffhand, right now I'm guessing that one of the 'g's is _wrong font,_ and probably comes from the related Pencraft series.\n\nThe ATF samples also show a wrong 'g' in the 18 pt size (and no alternate in the character set). The Bold also has a wrong 'g' in the 8 pt. \\*But\\* the thing is: ATF doesn't have Pencraft listed among their offerings. So where do the _wrong font_ 'g's come from?\n\nI'll need to spend a little more time sleuthing when I get a chance. And I'll get some scans up.\n\nBut don't hold your breath.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
