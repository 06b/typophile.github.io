  "content": "COLD CASE FILES: JULY 2009\n\nSqueaking in before the stroke of midnight, this one will be the last in our series, for now. It’s not really cold unless it’s at least 6 months old...\n\nDo you have what it takes to track down some fonts from our cold case files? The ID requests below were all posted during July 2009, but never got a response.\n\nIf you can resolve one, post your answer on the respective thread and let us know back here so we can track the results.\n\nHow many can you identify? We’ll (re)start the clock at the date/time of this posting.\n\nReady.. Set.. Go!\n\nAlso see: [January 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/nodewd.,x/65293) | [February 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/65359) | [March 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/65382) | [April 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/65413) | [May 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/65518) | [June 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/65790)\n\n// SANS\n\n[NBA West: Help identifying this font style.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59851)\n\n[Team Challenge: Please help ID the font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59886)\n\n[Sanserif font used on football jersey](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59889)\n\n[WOQOD - No idea about this font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59904)\n\n[compagnon: please identify the font used in this logo!](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60122)\n\n[Penn Brick/PBG: Help to ID this font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60310)\n\n[breeam: Does anybody know what this font is?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60349)\n\n[This is too easy.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60360)\n\n[Please Help, ID Font.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60403)\n\n// SERIF\n\n[Amstel One Dam Good Bier font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59612)\n\n[Lyndeborough New Hampshire: Need Help with Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59801)\n\n[Flaunt Magazine: What font is this?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60515)\n\n// SCRIPT\n\n[Miss Lebanon ’09 Calligraphic Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59558)\n\n[Ferrara Pan Candy: Please help ID font from Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59987)\n\n[Handwritten small simple font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60004)\n\n[Handwritten ID please](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60086)\n\n[The resort at the lakes logo font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60114)\n\n[Ariel Cycles & Motors vintage sign font ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60358)\n\n// DISPLAY\n\n[Please ID this font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59645)\n\n[AIW LOGO Help](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59663)\n\n[Name of this font??](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59696)\n\n[astronomica](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59782)\n\n[font from a shirt / hollister co](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59820)\n\n[Distressed Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59954)\n\n[Fontname](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60193)\n\n[elvis font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60343)\n\n[PEEPS logo font](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/60403)\n\n// DINGBAT\n\n[What Dingbats?](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103075716/http:/typophile.com/node/59800)\n\n",
