I’ve attached two file with a few variations I’ve done. I wanted to keep things simple, hence them all being text only, but if anyone has a striking idea I’d love to hear it. I’m kind of stumped. My initials aren’t the easiest letterforms to combine.\n\nThanks for any input!\n\nOh, and the Feel Script one was just for fun, but I thought I would include it anyway.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032600/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_16.jpg) | 39.84 KB |\n| [Picture 1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032600/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_53.jpg) | 23.18 KB |\n\n [‹ Boom logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032600/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44759 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Identity Logo Design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905032600/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45336 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Does it not really reflect you? If it doesn’t, then kill it. If you’re into doing a monogram, then it should generally reflect the style of your work. Can you give us any more direction on why you tried these things?\n\n"

It does reflect me in some way (though not entirely), but I don’t know if I’ll ever feel completely at one with what I come up with because I am all over the place with what I do.\n\nGenerally I decided that I’d like to keep the monogram lowercase and keep it simple. As for the font choice, I really just went through my installed fonts looking for letterforms that I saw could combine nicely with a little bit of work. I spent a long time redrawing a Bodoni lowercase a and f together thinking it would look great, but in the end it just didn’t look balanced or make much sense.\n\n"
