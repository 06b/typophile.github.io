The new family is called Precious Sans Two, available from [www.g-type.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322023850/http:/www.g-type.com/ \"www.g-type.com\") with a 50% discount until the end of January, then with 25% off the standard price until Feb 28th 2014.\n\nOver a decade after it’s first appearance G-Type’s Nick Cooke decided the time was right to re-appraise the typeface, scrutinise the old letterforms and make some important enhancements.\n\nMake no mistake though, [Precious Sans Two](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322023850/http:/www.g-type.com/precious-sans-two-font) is no rudimentary re-release; nearly every character has been redrawn, re-proportioned, respaced and generally improved.\n\n**Improvements:**\n\nThe original Precious Sans was well received at the time but certain quirkier characteristics, the extended lower case ‘f’ for instance, or the binocular ‘g’, were perhaps too prominent and a little distracting. Short terminals on the ‘a’ and ‘s’ also made the first Precious incarnation less appealing when used as body text. Second time around the major overhaul has not only addressed the shortcomings of the original but made huge improvements right across the board:\n\n• enhanced legibility and suitability for text use  \n• more streamlined range of 6 weights; Thin to Black plus matching italics  \n• cross platform compatible OpenType OTF format  \n• proportional and tabular figures  \n• extended language support  \n• small caps, accented small caps & related case sensitive forms  \n• extra stylistic set containing the original quirkier I, f & g alternate glyphs  \n• extensive suite of discretionary ligatures  \n• 20 directional single and double arrows in each of the six weights\n\n[Precious Sans Two](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322023850/http:/www.g-type.com/precious-sans-two-font) is a crisp and distinctively modern typeface, well equipped for advanced typographic use in print, web and digital publishing environments.\n\nVisit [www.g-type.com/precious-sans-two-font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322023850/http:/www.g-type.com/precious-sans-two-font \"www.g-type.com/precious-sans-two-font\") to test drive & buy the fonts, or email [info@g-type.com](mailto:info@g-type.com) to discuss specific licensing terms.\n\n",
