That's when I saw Font Garden [Matilda](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818104339/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontgarden/fg-matilda/) and some bells went off, but it was only 'close but no cigar'. I could almost see the same person doing our 'mystery font'. (However, this was the closest of the fonts by this designer (Ellinor Maria Rapp) shown at MyFonts, though several others showed this odd kind of 'R'.)\n\nI am sure I have tried finding this one before, and thought I got an answer, but now I am not sure if I only came up with a similar alternative, like 'Divine'. You know our FAQ statement about hand-printed fonts still applies. Maybe this ad designer had a custom font made. The approach is perfect for a 'signature' style. Maybe it was used in more than one ad, and that's where I saw it before? There comes a time when it seems pointless to keep hunting. Are we there Brett?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
