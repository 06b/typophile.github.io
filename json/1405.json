  "content": "Hello, I had been trying to make some print's on Mac OS 9.2 and the kerning of the letters are always lost. I always generate a postscript type 1, bitmaps and the AFM files but nothing is appear. But in same time everything works on other computer (Mac OS 8.5.1) which all kening tables are visible and activate on screen and print. I use Fontographer 4.1.5 and Suitcase 8.2 on (Mac 9.2) but I don't know if this software version are adapted to this recent Mac OS versions. I would like to understand better where and why that this problem starts. I hope my questions are simple to understand. Thank's.   \n   \nRicardo\n\n",
