Many details look weird: /R top left corner (serif removed?), /R leg (which looks to have been added to a a /P actually), weird /s and /r among the orthers...  \nSome alternatives but far from being even loosely similar: [Terital United](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414064026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterbox/terital-united), [Deftone Stylus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414064026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/deftone-stylus), [Wisdom Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414064026/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=wisdom_script), [Duvall](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414064026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/john-moore/duvall)\n\n"
