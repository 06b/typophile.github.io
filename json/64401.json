  "content": "Hello all,\n\nhave read around various places online and this seemed to be the most informed on all typeface matters.\n\nI'm trying to find a font to write in that will be a match for the ff fortissimo symbol  \n [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Music-fortissimo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150304203612/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Music-fortissimo.png)\n\nI found this discussion elsewhere in the forum [http://typophile.com/node/58526](http://web.archive.org/web/20150304203612/http:/typophile.com/node/58526)  \nbut those suggestions weren't quite right as a match for the fortissimo lettering\n\nThe closest looked to be the Berthold Bodoni Old Style BQ Italic but it's not quite right and i can't afford to buy fonts and not have them be the correct one.\n\nAny help or suggestions would be gratefully received. Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Music-fortissimo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150304203612/http:/typophile.com/files/Music-fortissimo.png) | 2.62 KB |\n\n",
