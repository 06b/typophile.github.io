I am using Fontlab Studio and I have tried so many things to get it working correctly, but nothing works.\n\nAs you can see it looks ’clumpy’\n\nI am thinking this is a common problem but i have not seen anything about it... so maybe it is not common. Please help :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828112840im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/picture_6740.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [picture\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828112840/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_15.jpg) | 53.53 KB |\n\n [‹ Postscript?True Type?Open Type?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828112840/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43852 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Randomized Comic Lettering Font - Code help needed ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828112840/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43634 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
