The two a’s are quite different & although the t’s look similar at this scale a larger size might show subtle differences. Also the wider spacing & slightly larger size on the left compared to the right makes me think if this is a digital font it has been very carefully tweaked by someone with a good knowledge of hand lettering.\n\n"
