  "content": "Hello everybody,  \nI just registered to your forum. To introduce myself I could say that I'm a french graphic designer who love typography.  \nI probably don't have the skills to draw one of my own but I'm working on it.\n\nReally sorry if my english is not perfect, I'll try to explain my issue of the day.  \nWith a friend of mine we are fixing some bikes and we are trying to get the logos, which are stuck on it, right.  \nHere is the image of the aerospace contour logo. It looks like a bauhaus but not entirely... a mix between Bauhaus and ITC Avant Garde...\n\nTanks in advance if you can help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Capture d’écran 2013-04-22 à 12.06.19.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130515215220/http:/typophile.com/files/Capture%20d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran%202013-04-22%20%C3%A0%2012.06.19.png) | 237.33 KB |\n\n",

Many freebies (an endless list actually) share the same backbone ( [Vomzom](http://web.archive.org/web/20130515215220/http:/www.dafont.com/vomzom.font) is one of them). Having a look to [Techno \\> Sci-fi](http://web.archive.org/web/20130515215220/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303), [Techno \\> Various](http://web.archive.org/web/20130515215220/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304) and [Basic \\> Sans serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130515215220/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501) sections at DaFont could be helpful to spot either an alternative or a match. Good luck!\n\n"

Un peu d'AvantGarde et de Chalet (de House ind.), et un peu de bidouillage sur Illustrator devraient faire l'affaire.\n\n"
