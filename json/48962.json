I actually tried to do shots of me spelling out S2 so I could use that as a reference but I couldn’t get it how I wanted. I see how it could use more stroke weight. I’ll work on those 2 things. Thanks.\n\n@TDF:  \nOh well, there are a lot of logos out there that look alike. Although, stroke-1 doesn’t look like the K2 logo.

You could refine it a bit more by making the loop to the 2 from the bottom of the s a tad rounder and the body of the 2 seems a bit fat. But having said that I don’t really think its necessary for it to be read as a perfect S and 2 - its kinda interesting as a symbol without the immediate character recognition.\n\nThe shadow is unnecessary in my opinion and i’m not a great fan of the lime green - i get web 2.0 rather than arty and professional from that. The colouring of 3 is interesting. looks kinda like crayons rather than light trails though.\n\nComing along nicely.\n\n"

I’ve tried the s to the power of 2 concept a couple of times. I still keep coming back to the current idea b/c I think it looks slick and more creative. He wants that “indie” feel with a professional punch that the illustrator versions were supposed to serve.\n\nAlso, I think if the 2 was any bigger in the light picture it would look more like “82”. But, I agree the s can be modified more.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nI just sent him a couple of these as mockups. I have a feeling he’s going to choose the illustrator version or say I want to see another idea.

But as everyone else seems to agree (including you) S will need a change.\n\n@tiffany: Any image (even this one) can be converted to black & white. And since we are in the age way over 60s’ there are lots of logos these days that are used in full colour in 95% of applications. They do have a BW version too but most of the time it’s not used. So in this particular case I’d focus on this soft-light-smear effect and then focus on vectorising it to also create a BW version.\n\nI’d still rather have a nice original logo like this than something not as distinctive.\n\nAnd as Cody said: you will “maybe” have to think of a negative logo. In your case it will be some colour on white background. Yes. But. If going for any colour I’d make both version in the same one, only different hue to create enought contrast with the background. In this case I’d push colours ot yellow-orange(ish) for black background (which would make it even more light related) and a bit darker orange version for white background. Regular people probably won’t notice the difference created by the change of hue. And it will still work as a uniform logo in both versions.\n\nGREAT CHANGE. May I also say that apart from playing with light I also like the non-closed elliptical shape around it. Makes it very stable and even more perfect. You must have great motorics in your arm to create such a nice and smooth shape. Just curious: how many attempts did it take to get it right? :)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
