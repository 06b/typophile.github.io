  "content": "When I set type in Akkurat using Indesign, it looks incredibly odd on screen. Glyphs  \nsuch as o, d, e, c, u appear to drop strangely far beneath the baseline, and the copy in  \ngeneral looks quite pixelated and 'bitty'. When I zoom in both these effects dissapear.\n\nWhen I print type below 13 point on a high quality inkjet printer, the strange baseline  \nand bitty appearance are still apparent, but significantly less so than on screen.\n\nIs this the same for other people who use Akkurat, or can anyone think of any reason  \nwhy this would be?\n\nThanks,\n\nPhil\n\n",

The font will do fine in offset or laser printing, but there's not much you can do about the onscreen appearance short of emailing Lineto and urging them to up da hint factor.\n\n"
