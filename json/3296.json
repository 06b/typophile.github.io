  "content": "Typophile Announces: The Smaller Picture by Kevan Davis   \n   \n_The network is the brain._   \n   \nSmaller Picture is a truly collaborative experiment where users participate in the real-time growth of a bitmap alphabet. The system, developed by UK programmer Kevan Davis with inputs from Typophile's Jared Benson, presents a 20 x 20 pixel grid which begins as a random pattern of black and white pixels. Users determine whether a randomly highlighted pixel should be black or white. After thousands of interactions, the characters take shape.   \n   \nWhen Typophile proposed using Kevan's engine for a collaborative alphabet, he was intrigued, and enhanced his code to accommodate a full alphanumeric set. We're delighted to present it here.   \n   \n [http://www.typophile.com/smallerpicture](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033442/http:/www.typophile.com/smallerpicture)\n\n",
