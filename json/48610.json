How would one classify the style? Is it art nouveau? Have any of you seen fonts like this?\n\nAny info would be useful!\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Travel + Country Dingbat recommendations?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122122757/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48568 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [quotations ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122122757/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48622 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
