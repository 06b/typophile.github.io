I would recommend reading my article \"Latinization: Prevention and Cure\"\\* published in issue #4 of the Austrian magazine Spatium (as well as the 5th issue of the Greek journal Hyphen) and studying my \"multilateral\" solution for Armenian and Latin, a typesystem called Nour&Patria\\*\\*. You could say it took me two decades to arrive at what I did; I think it works, and I hope it can inform the development of almost any multi-script type family.\n\n\\* A preview here: [http://themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153402/http:/themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html \"http://themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome1.html\")\n\n\\*\\* From the Creative Review awards:  \n [http://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153402/http:/themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf \"http://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf\")\n\nThe first thing I would decide: Is the Latin meant for parallel setting, or subordinate setting?

      "content": "\\> How should this effect the design of the Latin characters?\n\nThe way I see it a subordinate font can sacrifice quite a bit of cultural authenticity - but only with the purpose of better serving the master design. So for example Patria's Armenian subordinate has full serifs (which the Armenian script really doesn't like). Another example is the Latin \"g\" below from a grot Cyrillic-dominant typeface I was commissioned to design last year. It's made to echo the form of the Cyrillic \"б\".\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153402im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cyrlat_g_4412.gif)\n\nFor serving a traditional Hebrew type I might recommend a subordinate Latin where the stroke contrast is flipped (thicker horizontals than verticals\\*) but Mike Hebrew is monoline (which you could say makes things easier). Another central parameter is vertical proportions: Latin likes to have an x-height within a certain range, but to avoid a subordinate that looks too large/small in comparison to the master script you can move quite a distance away from that range; in the case of Hebrew that probably means a Latin with quite a large x-height (which you seem to be shooting for already).\n\n\\* See the work of Excoffon and Bloemsma.\n\n--\n\nWilliam, depreciating the baseline is quite a fascinating idea.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "\\>depreciating the baseline\n\nAda Yardeni in Hebrew Script points out that traditionally Hebrew is \"hung\" from the top, with the baseline not so strong. The baseline was made stronger in Ashkenazi scripts, perhaps under the influence of Latin scripts.\n\nMike Hebrew takes advantage of the fact you can play with the baseline in Hebrew without penalty--except for making nikud more difficult to place.\n\nPlayful designs like [Peanut](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153402/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/peanut.html) (that link should work, the above does not) are able to get away with an irregular baseline in latin. I don't understand how exactly they are able to pull it off, but you might ask typophiler Michael Clark, who designed Peanut, about the challenge.\n\nBecause of the informal mono-line, I think potentially the latin can be very strong also, and still harmonize. This would be a real achievement, I think--to have a latin and hebrew that really work together seamlessly. If it were me, I'd start by mirroring your kaf and using that as a c, and building the look on that. As it is, the very round sans you have doesn't work at all, IMHO.\n\n"

There are a lot of very successful squared off sans--my favorite is Klavika--and my feeling it that something like that would have a shot at more harmony.\n\nI don't know about the squashing.
