  "content": "Hello again-\n\nThis is Telltale, a study of low contrast in serif style. Once again it is fairly narrow to work in Finnish language (ääliö älä lyö, ööliä läikkyy, senkin sikaniskainen kaupunkiinmuuttajapaskiainen). I tried to make it low in contrast without making it look fat.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418090758im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Telltale_3604.png)\n  \nItalics are under production, so samples in pdf are somewhat random.\n\nAny comments?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Telltale.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418090758/http:/typophile.com/files/Telltale.pdf) | 170.05 KB |\n| [Telltale2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418090758/http:/typophile.com/files/Telltale2.pdf) | 182.56 KB |\n\n",

Having seen your other fonts I'm guessing that the /g/ is untouchable? :-) /M/ looks very good.\n\nFigures look good though both /2/s bug me with that serif, and both /4/s look too slight.\n\nThe name is quite good; I get a storybook vibe from this.\n\n"

I can see the pointed angle is not a bug, it's a feature ;-) but maybe it looks better when it's a bit shorter (like with the Euro [lining figures]).  \nThe right arm of the r looks too thick (and perhaps too short) to me, in particular where it connects to the stem.  \nThe axis of the g is out of tune with, say, e or s.  \nAh, and the opening single quote is (mirrored) upside down.\n\nAndreas\n\n"

      "content": "I realize I should have been more clear - when I said the /4/s look slight, I meant that they look small (especially, narrow), not light. \"Slight\" in proportions, not in stroke weight.  \nI also forgot to mention I'm not persuaded by that @, which looks /d/-like and flat on the right.\n\nItalic /p/ is defintely too wide. Italic /e/ probably, too. Italic /u/ might be too narrow?\n\nDid you consider other structures for italic /x/? And a single-story /g/ might be nice for the italic (though perhaps that's in the works as an alternate already).\n\n"

Like copying and pasting instead of design. Mine is too narrow right now, though.\n\nItalic p is too wide. And x in work in progress, and I do have a single-storey g. I think two-storey should be there as an alternate.\n\n"
