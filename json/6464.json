Hull (letters moved around to protect the innocent.) I was thinking that under the name, in a different font, I would place the word \"Advertising\" formated to stretch from the \"J\" to the \"l\".   \n   \nI'm sure everyone can relate, I've created many, many printed pieces for others making fearless decisions. As soon as I have to make a decision for myself...Brick Wall!   \n   \nAny advice?\n\n",

They need a logo but do you? Paul Cutler has an idea -- let your subconscious do the work. Who knows? Just don't sweat it.   \n   \nPG   \n   \n [http://giambarba.com/bizimage.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111082927/http:/giambarba.com/bizimage.html)\n\n"

I feel for you. I've hit some walls recently too, but now I'm over them and the view is great.\n\n"
