      "content": "Fantastic, thanks!   \n   \nInterestingly, I'm sure I can see what seems an excessive amount of round overshoot in Ad Sancs. This is particularly noticeable on larger sizes (seen here on the u, d and c, but not the o, although that is the same size). And that's not present on the AudioMulch logo.   \n   \nTo me, it's unquestionably the same typeface though, and I can't believe the AudioMulch author would have tweaked his logo, so what would account for it? Two separately digitised versions?   \n   \nAnd oh yes, the c is quite different on the small text, I hadn't really looked as I was expecting it to be the same !   \n   \nI took your advice and registered, btw ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123535im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nCheers, Robin\n\n"
