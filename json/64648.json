  "content": "I've seen Buccardi recommended a few times here and it is \\*exactly\\* the look that I wanted for a fun children's early chapter book (ages 6-10) written from a dog's point of view. However, my only concern is that it might be slightly too funky to be readable for a short chapter book. A very non-scientific study of a handful of first-graders showed that they can read it just fine, so maybe it's just my resistance to the tried-and-true Garamonds.\n\nI was also considering, as runner-ups, both Magellan and Adobe Caslon, though Buccardi is still hands-down my favorite for this project. Also, I'm thinking that with Buccardi, I could use it as well for the title, headings, etc., whereas the other two wouldn't cut it for a title font.\n\nI need a second (third, fourth...) opinion from folks who are even more experienced at this than I am. What do you think?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

And some funkiness in the letterforms might actually _help_ readability!
