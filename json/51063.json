It might seem too heavy if you move the waist up.\n\nThe squared-off ’a’ is kinda cool, but it doesn’t seem to mesh/match 100 percent with the r-b-n.  \nmaybe for this zine, that’s a good thing.\n\nthe spacing needs some slight work.\n\nmaybe the a-r and the a-b might need ever-so-slight widening and the b-i slight reduction. (just a hair)\n\nthe r-a pair feels okay small, but larger feels like it needs more air.\n\ngood luck.\n\n"

I hoped to do some of that angled vs. curved thing with it, but couldn’t find a good solution. I’m quite happy with it as it is, but I’m open (and looking) for suggestions.  \nThank you for the response. Just what I’m looking for.\n\n"
