  "content": "CheapProFonts offers a wide selection of mainly display-fonts with a large character set supporting 65 languages requiring more that the basic A-Z.  \n(Check out the long list of supported languages here: [http://www.cheapprofonts.com/Languages](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122736/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/Languages \"http://www.cheapprofonts.com/Languages\") )\n\nWhat I have done is to team up with several well-known freefont designers (like Ray Larabie, Nick Curtis, Brian Kent and Derek Vogelpohl), and use their fonts as a starting point to make updated professional quality multilingual Unicode fonts - and then offer them at a very low price and with very generous licensing terms.  \n(Check out the license here: [http://www.cheapprofonts.com/License](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122736/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/License \"http://www.cheapprofonts.com/License\") )\n\nI started building the library one year ago, and have managed to rework and release one new font almost every week through 2008! The library is continually expanded with new releases, and new designers. All the reworking is done under agreement with the original designers, and they receive royalties from the sales.  \n(Check out a complete overview of the fonts here: [http://www.cheapprofonts.com/ALL\\_Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122736/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/ALL_Fonts \"http://www.cheapprofonts.com/ALL\\_Fonts\") )\n\nI hope many \"foreign language\" users find CheapProFonts a valuable resource for cheap and cheerful display fonts supporting their specific language needs.  \nWelcome! :)\n\nKind regards\n\nRoger S. Nelsson  \n--  \n [http://www.CheapProFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122736/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/ \"http://www.CheapProFonts.com\")  \nHigh quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122736im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CheapProFonts-1-year_3650.jpg)\n\n",
