You’d think that with Frank Miller directing it and with its dark themes they could have at least used a real comic font.\n\nYou can see the packaging [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20060213111905/http:/www.dvdanswers.com/index.php?r=0&s=1&c=6614&n=1&burl=)\n\n",

I’d blame that on Buena Vista’s design department, though — I kind of doubt Miller and Robert Rodriguez have much oversight over the DVD packaging.\n\n"

And that’s just the “comic book” fonts.\n\nI have no idea why. It’s a disheartening mess.\n\nI couldn’t find an official online source for the full cover art, but if anyone wants to see it, it’s available [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20060213111905/http:/www.cdcovers.cc/dvd_a.php).\n\n"

I’ve been doing some production work for a comic company recently, and really good contemporary digital letterers use a pretty dizzying array of typefaces, and then modify them heavily as needed (especially for sound effects). It’s a totally different world than traditional typography or sign lettering. The problem with the American Splendor covers is that they get caught halfway between typography and comic lettering, and the results are pretty ungainly. They get a B for effort, though!\n\n"

Given a little while, from what I’ve gathered on typophile, the new UPS logo is appropriate and NEEDED. Comic Sans does look like comic lettering …\n\nJust a thought.\n\n"

I kinda think a shipping service makes more sense being all conservative and frumpy. Conservative and frumpy means they’re getting me my latest Amazon or Powell’s fix on time, and I don’t know what the hell their new identity is supposed to mean.\n\nComic Sans has no real relationship to “real” comic lettering, which is almost never as childlike and irregular as Comic Sans. I really don’t think it’s a terrible typeface (read the Typowiki entry, which I wrote), but it is misnamed.\n\n"
