  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nI just released my first font in MyFonts. It's a text sans. If it makes success, I'll make a Cyrilic. Hope you like it! Here is a description:\n\nInspired by Italian Renaissance fonts like Poliphilus, Blado, Centaur and Arrighi, Lucca presents a simple charm and a powerful classic feel. It is cute, friendly, clear and superbly readable.\n\nIts low contrast provides Lucca a firm yet flexible substance, making it sensual and enticing. There’s a certain degree of abstraction in the precise endings, and the whole design was made to survive even in the harshest conditions, conserving its readability and beauty.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414123826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lucca%20poster%201_5783.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414123826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lucca%20poster%202_5227.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414123826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lucca%20poster%204_3766.png)\n\n",
