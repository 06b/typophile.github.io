      "content": "I don’t think that expecting potential clients to download a twelve megabyte PDF from a slow server is a good idea; in the time it took me to download that PDF I could have perused the entire online portfolios of several other design firms. And keep in mind that in some large corporations employees are sitting behind a firewall that won’t let them download a PDF. You should put a phone number and address in the contact section—there are plenty of people out there who don’t want to hire someone via email. And fix the text on the THANKYOU page, you used “your” instead of “you’re”\n\n"
