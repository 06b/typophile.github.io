It seems that it really is a modified face after all, as the letters in other logos look +/- the same, but small differences (presence/absence of round corners and such) give away that they’ve been made by different people at various times to match the logo of the mother company more or less. So I decided to modify the funny Futura to match the letters.\n\nAs for Dan’s comment on the stroking of the Pol part of the logo - this is what usually happens when you just hit “stroke” in the Illustrator without other tinkerings with the result. The person who did it probably was on a hurry or didn’t give it any thought at all.. I wonder how Czechs have managed to have their beautiful Storm foundry, when Eastern Europe overall is a huge territory of typographical ignorance... (usual rant, but I’m not very educated myself, so I’m really not the one to throw the first stone)\n\nI am “designing” a logo for a company this Krono group has acquired recently (ie. my task is to make just another one based on the sample) and have some questions about it too, but I will upload it to the Design section.\n\n"
