  "content": "I'm looking for the font most often used in the 70’s style high fashion magazines (such as harpers bazaar) where numbers were a focal point and small text accompanied the numbers, underneath them, and below a rule. (It might be Herb Lubalin?) This is the closest I could find, and I'm having the worst trouble identifying it. Can you help?

I think we're looking at Pistilli Roman, which matches the time frame.\n\nDon't know about that other ampersand. Cabernet Swash is a digitisation of Caslon Sawsh, which also matches the time frame. There are minor discrepancies, but do we really care? ;-)\n\n"
