  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI need some help. I am no expert in the field of typography and would be greatful if anyone of you big guns can help me out.\n\nFirst What makes a CE version of a font different from the regular ones? If I am not mistaken then CE stands for Central European right? Is the kerning different? Cos i cant make out any difference.\n\nSecond can someone tell me how to select a good pair of Sans and serif font? Would be fantastic if you can suggest a few so that I can start working on a project which involves making a brochure (4 page). Text is very important and should be easily readable and hopefully cast a impression. Money is of no problem. So doesnt matter even if it is one the costliest fonts.\n\nAnd lastly your personal favorites!\n\nThanks\n\nLordKV\n\n",

And the only reason there's money in Central/Eastern European diacritics is that the EU requires documents to be created in all the union's official languages. This in fact seems to be the main reason for the contemporary surge in Greek fonts. Fortunately, there is however still craft, decency and graciousness in making extended fonts!\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "LordKV, I can think of no more exciting contemporary superfamily of type, combining sans and serif fonts than Joshua Darden's \"Freight\". You can see the fonts on his site: [http://www.joshuadarden.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110548/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/ \"http://www.joshuadarden.com/\") , and follow his link to garagefonts/Phil's to make your purchase.\n\nAs for accents... I personally like 'em, and like makin' em, even though I have heard people deriding the \"glyph arms race\". I was put on to this site - [http://www.eki.ee/letter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110548/http:/www.eki.ee/letter/ \"http://www.eki.ee/letter/\") - and use it to learn which accented letters are necessary for which languages. Referring to this site is a good way of adding accents intelligently. If you're a schwa away from your font working in Azerbaijani, then you can design those glyphs and add them to your font. And when someone asks, \"Does your font support Azerbaijani?\" You can reply, \"Yes! And Tatar as well!\"\n\nBut as for the less esoteric accents which are used in Eastern Europe... They are pretty useful to anyone wanting to show respect to people whose names contain those accents. (The next step is to learn how to pronounce those accented letters.)\n\n"

I was including the Spanish, German, Italian, French, etc., characters as \"typical Latin characters\" because they typically appear in most text fonts. I was trying to avoid the English-centric issue and be more inclusive of other common Latin based characters and languages.  \nI should have said: \"It makes no difference to the user who does not require the CE glyphs because the rest of the glyphs space and behave just as they would in a font that does not contain the CE set of glyphs.\"  \nI was just trying to reassure him that buying a font that included CE would not render it useless for the rest of the Latin based languages.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Such fonts have completely redesigned diacritics - not only for CE characters, but for all accented ones. Many western designers don't care about the look of the diacritics and the original accents look very ugly. Unfortunately in languages such Czech or Slovak almost every word contains at least one accent. Therefore correct shape, size and position is very important. Even now, to successfully use new fonts, the change of diacritics in many commercially available CE font is a must.\n\n"
