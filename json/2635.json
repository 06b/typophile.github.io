      "content": "Type & Layout: How typography and design can get your message across - or get in the way   \nBy Colin Wheildon   \n   \nThis is a recent work, very practical for art directors who are interested in getting the text read, rather than just looking good.   \n   \nWheildon is an ad man, using direct marketing as his laboratory, just as the famous Claude Hopkins (1910s) and David Ogilvy (1950s) did before. What they would do is a split run, and vary one typographic feature between the two (say do one half in serif face, and the other sans) and see which got the better response.   \n   \nHowever Nikolaj, you seem to be interested in the emotional effects of typography.   \nUsually, pyschologists and researchers such as Wheildon look at the mental mechanics of reading, in particular legibility and readability.   \n   \nAnd there's a reason for that.   \nAny piece of typography has so many variables, that it would be impossible to isolate, in an experiment, the emotional effect of:   \n-typeface   \n-leading   \n-alignment   \n-measure   \n-size   \n-page layout   \nand of course there is the meaning of the text to consider.   \n   \nThis is the preserve of art and design, not science.   \n   \nI feel your need. It seems that most writing about typefaces discusses:   \n- historical reference   \n- description of features/classification   \n- technology   \n- politics of design   \n- cultural theory   \n- readability/legibility   \n- circumstance of its design process   \n   \nI've written a lot about typefaces, but it's very analytical (note my penchant for lists), and that seems to be the norm -- journalistic, commercial. So, which writers let the subject get under their skin?   \n   \nJon Coltz, for one, at daidala.com   \n   \nAny other suggestions?\n\n"

In the 90s we were all happy for better and more design, currently I'm not so sure anymore. Emotional design has become a manipulative tool in the wrong hands.   \n   \nErrr, political ranting apart... I also have some english texts on emotional design, but they're rather focussed on product design and stuff like that.

      "content": "It's not so much the bad company hing that iffs me, but that design -- rather than complementing a good product -- has turned out to be a false promise in itself. We buy things because OF their emotional design, despite the fact that technically they may not even work as good as a less-overdesigned product (take the Starck lemon-sueezwer or the Starck 1 wash-basin, take Ray Gun...). Also, I think that design has become THE most important marketing factor for products in an oversaturated market. Thus we have the 103rd detergent that is EXACTLY as good or bad as the other 102, yet it has a different design and thus feigns to be different. The same goes for any kind of product and many companies, generally. By this, we actively prolong a system, that in the end is anti-ecological and in many ways also economical nonsense. This, imo, is NOT what design is about. (Although, of course nonsense is always cool... so... )   \n   \nI think we need less emotion in our design, but rather a keen, maybe even intellectual, journalistic approach to what we do. Content first, seduction only as a means to promote positive content.\n\n"

      "content": "Si, that BBC article reads more like the stuff of horoscopes -- hard to take too seriously. (Then again, it's just the article and not the actual study.)   \n   \nI can't help thinking of color psychology as it may relate to the subjective area of type selection. Those color studies are interesting and have merit, but I rarely defer to them as 'truth.' I would have to consider any psychology of typography study in the same way (especially if it's as trite as the suggestion to \"use Courier for a resignation letter.\")   \n   \nFor example, we've been culturally trained to believe red is the color of love (valentines day, roses). But color psychology suggests that blue is the color of love (private, caring) and that red is the color of power (can't argue with that). We've been culturally trained to recognize blue as corporate (stable, trustworthy). We tend to think of yellow as bright or warm (fresh or sunny) while color psychology suggests yellow represents control or conflict.   \n   \nSo, these readily contradict each other. Both of them may be right in their own way, in their own context. For me, the selection of color (and type for that matter) are all about the context and the audience.\n\n"
