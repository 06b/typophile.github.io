  "content": "although this is a logo (attempt), it really represents my first foray into non-pixel based type design.\n\nthe result of this first effort is nothing spectacular, and yet i need some feedback to see if my instincts are good or bad.\n\nitem 1 is a direct adaptation of one of my pixel fonts.  \nitem 2 adds perfect circles into the mix  \nitem 3 airs everything out  \nitem 4 adds some flair to the interior shapes and trims the horizontal elements  \nitem 5 is a step in the wrong direction\n\ni'm going to continue working on this logo until i get it right: i'm not going to shop for a font that might fit the words. why? because i need to make the leap into bezier designs sooner or later, and i've been putting it off for a long time.\n\nthat said, if anyone has suggestions on creative directions i might take, i'm all ears. i'm looking for something modern, but not necessarily cold. i want panache, without being cute or clever, and i want a semi-bold look.\n\ntrust me when i say i do not mean to imply that this first step of mine embodies all the qualities i just listed. it is, as i mentioned, just my first stab at things.\n\nthe logo and tag will probably go something like this: set your image apart. the idea being, a uniquely edited photo catalog is available here.\n\nany help, as always, is considered a supreme act of friendship.\n\n:)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_02.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108182517/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_02.png) | 8.59 KB |\n| [logo\\_03.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108182517/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_03.png) | 2.14 KB |\n| [logo\\_04a.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108182517/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_04a.png) | 9.12 KB |\n| [logo\\_07.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108182517/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_07.png) | 15.64 KB |\n| [logo\\_13.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108182517/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_13.png) | 19.3 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Without knowing what the logo has to do, the nature of the company/product etc. I think item 7 is a good starting point, the change of case aids pronounciation. I am not keen on the tails of the 'lit' group they are too contrasted and uniform and I wonder if they are all necessary, if you amended them to a heavier stroke and more of a geometric shape to match the characteristics of the others, the 'l' tail should be shorter than that of the 't', you might even be able to lose it on the 'i' (which seems too tall and looks better with the round dot). The 'n' needs some work on the inside of its counter and I think you should look at the relation of vertical element and counter in the 'p' and 'a'. Finally, Photopolitan has some of the properties of the OHOHO kerning exercise, the kerning will have to be loosened a touch, especially for small use.  \nHope this of some use.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "dav,\n\nyou are the master of the style i'm shooting for here. your letterforms in many cases strike me as barren in their origin, mathematical. but by the time you are done sculpting them, they strike the perfect balance between algorithm and poem.\n\njust my opinion, of course, there are many here on these boards who are more in tune with our work than i, no doubt. regardless, i am glad to have your feedback.\n\n\\*\n\ni'm thinking that photopolitan might be both too long and perhaps a little to clever (or maybe not clever enough) to work as i'd like it to. so as of now, i'm changing the name to 'phoda'. two syllables, and a little better symmetry within the word.\n\nof the designs on the latest post, i think i like 1a the best. it's funky (the stems), impersonal (outer bowls), and yet, still curvaceous in the inner bowls.\n\ni'm looking for the suggestion of individuality through an otherwise faceless environment.\n\n"

      "content": "To me the h is too wide and the stroke contrast is too great. The top right quadrant of the a looks a bit light. The d seems to have a shorter ascender than the h. As Dav says, the stems are creating dark areas, which is making the o look lighter than the other characters. I think that overall you can reduce the stroke contrast and reduce the angle of the stems or adjust the counters to compensate for the weight and angle of the stems.  \nTim\n\n"
