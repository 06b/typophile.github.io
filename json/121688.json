  "content": "Hello everybody!\n\nI want to download the Microsoft VTT tool, but I can't figure out how is it possible!  \nRight here, on [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414022850/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx) it tells that I must _fax_ them a copy of a signed agreement. First of all, come on, _fax_ in 2014? And also the link to that agreement doesn't work.\n\nI've googled for it and couldn't find any solutions. I've seen some links to it on the FontLab forum, but they also do not work.\n\nDoes anybody know how to get Microsoft VTT?\n\n",
