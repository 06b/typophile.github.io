  "content": "Hello guys, Im looking for sugestions on a typeface that would reflect justice (law) and order (balance, equilibrium), but with a slightly modern feel to it.  \nIt'll prolly be working next to a crest.  \nMaybe an humanist face with a slight modern feel to it, maybe a serif, who knows.  \nI'd appreciate any suggestion : )\n\nThanks  \nDave\n\n",

All caps?\n\n<cite>It’ll prolly be working next to a crest.</cite>\n\nI’m afraid I don’t understand that. Like a heraldic emblem? How does that look like? I doubt Legato is appropriate for a coat of arms – unless you want to go really (post)modern.\n\n"

However I'm removing it from the inside and placing it next to the crest.  \nI want to give it a modern look. Not too modern tho.\n\nIts not for a coat of arms : )\n\nThanks\n\n"
