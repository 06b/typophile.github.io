Focusing their efforts on the documentation of geographic stylictic differences the type foundry was born out of collaboration with numerous accomplished graffiti artists.\n\n2006 saw the release of their first volume of collaborative fonts with Joker Straight Letter, Mene One Mexicali, Mesh One AOK, Meskyle Laid Back and Sabe Ghetto Gothic.\n\nURL: [http://www.handselecta.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230156/http:/www.handselecta.com/ \"http://www.handselecta.com\")\n\n",
