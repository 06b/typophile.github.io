  "content": "Hello.\n\nI'm a total newbie, so please forgive me if I sound very uneducated. Typography is far from my specialty, but I know enough about it to know how important it is in the branding of a product.\n\nMy name is Kristen and I am currently putting together a user experience web page. I work for a company who has traditionally been a market research company and is now starting up a user experience department. There is going to be a logo, headings and body text, and I'm not sure if they should be the same or different.\n\nHere is as much info about my page:\n\nAudience: Primarily, any company that has a product or service (e.g. cell phones, web portals, any company with a web page, etc.) and second, other user experience experts and interaction designers.\n\nI'm looking for a type face that is very open, easy to read, lots of white space, etc. Something that is clean but also gives the feeling of modernity and design excellence.\n\nAny ideas? Is there a standard I should be using and can I change fonts within a page or should they all remain consistent?\n\nAny advice would be GREATLY appreciated.\n\nThank you!!!\n\n",

      "content": "Kristen, the \"get a designer\" opinion above is doubly relevant because you say your target audience includes designers! They will pick apart any design that's not highly accomplished, and never trust you with anything. That said, from our end we can certainly recommend typefaces that will help you achieve your goals, while hoping that the suggestions will be used wisely - because for one thing it's not just what fonts you use, it's how you use them.\n\nOne thing we need to get out of the way first: will you be rendering the type as images? Because if not, you either have to use special font \"embedding\" technology or stick to fonts that are available on most systems (since the text will be rendered on the user's computer) which is highly restrictive.\n\nBTW, the size declaration of the logo image at the top-right of your web page ( [http://www.pmgintelligence.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201063012/http:/www.pmgintelligence.com/ \"http://www.pmgintelligence.com/\")) is wide by one pixel, causing the \"M\" to be broken like that.\n\nhhp\n\n"
