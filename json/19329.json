  "content": "So I’m at school and using ITC Tiffany for my current project. The family includes a Medium/Medium Italic, Light/Light Italic, Demi/Demi Italic and Heavy/Heavy Italic.\n\nI have my laptop in the labs and am trying to activate the font. I load it into Font Explorer X and activate it. Font Explorer activates it correctly but it comes up with an error about duplicate post script names, resulting in only being able to use the Medium and Heavy weights with Italics. I’m really looking to use the Demi weight...the lab workstations use FontBook and have no problem activating the whole family.\n\nHelp!\n\n [‹ Fonts in Illustrator CS2](http://web.archive.org/web/20080519014659/http:/typophile.com/node/17954 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Software for TrueType collections? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080519014659/http:/typophile.com/node/19341 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
