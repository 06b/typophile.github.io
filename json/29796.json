And a small case with some [Gill](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105041741/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gill) and [Monotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105041741/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Monotype) material.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105041741im_/http:/typophile.com/files/web009_4720.jpg)\n\nThe [Alan Fletcher](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105041741/http:/www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/alanfletcher) exhibition downstairs was (to my mind, and my wife agrees with me) much better. Some pictures later.\n\n",
