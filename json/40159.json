  "content": "Wedding Venue fonts suggestions:  \nI’d appreciate the names of fonts that will work well for WEDDING VENUE logo...the logo will be in typographic, classic,\n\nHowever, the wedding reception building is in the same stone and era as the main house and is currently being restored, however it is my understanding it will have some rawness to it, i.e. wooden ceiling beams and wooden floors etc. Therefore, I’m hoping the logo can accentuate a classic style but with some modern simplicity attached to it...is it possible for that particular font or a font that can be used for letter B in wooden effect and the rest of the the font in classic?\n\nBrand Attributes:  \nLuxury  \nStyle  \nDistinction  \nBeauty  \nHeritage  \nElegance  \nSimplicity\n\nThe logo needs to represent classic style, heritage, beauty and luxury. Just as importantly, it needs to remain simple for its uniqueness...it does not need an elaborate design for it is distinct in its heritage and tasteful blend of tradition and simplicity.\n\nI hope I’ve explained myself clearly...and thanks for taking your time reading.\n\n",
