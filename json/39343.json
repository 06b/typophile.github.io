[PDF here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414181528/http:/typefolio.com/Adriane_Text_Specimen.pdf)  \n-  \nAdriane Text was designed between 2006 and 2007, and with  \nits core objectives to become an adequate text composition  \nand characteristics, it can be classified as a transitional typeface.  \nHowever, details in its anatomy offer a certain personality that  \nwithout it, it becomes excessively visible, in addition to an  \nexcellent legibility in small sizes. The typeface has a medium  \ncontrast and the axis is predominately vertical. The size of  \nx-height counter forms gives an extreme legible effect applied  \non every typographical composition.\n\nAdriane Text acquires two styles: regular and bold; with its  \nrespective italic versions, small caps, tabular and proportional  \nfigures in old style and lining, an extensive set of ligatures for  \ndifferent combinations, as well as ornaments,  \ndingbats and several ampersands.\n\nIts italic version possesses fluidity that contrast with  \nthe severity of the roman special characteristics in its drawing.  \nThe degree of the italic inclination between the upper and  \nlowercase are only slightly different, but offering  \nmore rhythm to the text.\n\nFurthermore, the use of advanced typographical projects,  \nall font types are accessible throughout the OpenType features.\n\nMore about **Adriane Text** [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414181528/http:/www.typefolio.com/adriane.htm)\n\n",
