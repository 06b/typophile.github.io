Perfect for signage.   \n   \n3. Verdana   \nI need a good font for my browser -- and we were allowed to bring our G4, remember?   \n   \n4. Linotype Univers Condensed   \nI may be the sole inhabitant on the island, but sooner or later I will have the need to publish a catalogue or a list. Univers Condensed will come in handy.   \n   \n5. PMN Caecilia   \nAt the moment I can't stand the sight of it. But this typeface is \\*so good\\* that I simply must bring it.   \n   \n6. Lexicon   \nI have never used this font. I have never owned it. By choosing it to this forum I hope that some yuletime-spirited guy at Enschedé will \\*give\\* it to me. In return I shall study it closely.   \n   \n7. Tate Gallery Corporate Typeface (Wolff Olins)   \nGod, it's beautiful! Recently I asked about it in Typophile Forum Type Identification Board. One of you guys said it resembled both VAG and DIN.   \n   \n8. Minion   \nAs good a text face as any when treated right.   \n   \n9. ITC Bodoni   \nI guess I can't do without a good Bodoni.   \n   \n10. Parisine   \nI greatly admire the work of JFP!\n\n"
