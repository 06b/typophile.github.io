As we were leaving, I noticed a T-shirt that said “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.” in something like Bodoni Poster Italic. We had to go, but I noted that there were some other T-shirt designs next to it and that brand of these shirts was World Typographers. Some of them look cool.\n\n[http://ut.uniqlo.com/search#cat\\_id=0&key\\_id=35&key\\_label=WORLD%20TYPOGRA...](http://web.archive.org/web/20090726115427/http:/ut.uniqlo.com/search#cat_id=0&key_id=35&key_label=WORLD%20TYPOGRAPHERS&gender=1_1_1&num=30&order=date&page=0 \"http://ut.uniqlo.com/search#cat\\_id=0&key\\_id=35&key\\_label=WORLD%20TYPOGRAPHERS&gender=1\\_1\\_1&num=30&order=date&page=0\")  \n [http://www.hellogas.com/worldtypographers/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090726115427/http:/www.hellogas.com/worldtypographers/ \"http://www.hellogas.com/worldtypographers/\")\n\n",
