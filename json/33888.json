That's right - the beer that tastes like crap. Fortunately, good sense followed after everyone tasted it, and knew it was crap. (But working my way as a waitress in a Steak & Brew - all beer was crap to me!!! LOL) Comedians Bob & Ray (oh my, you are probably too young to even know about them!) were hired for spot announcements and commercials - in fact, I don't have to write about it - someone did that for on on Wikipedia -- over here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piels\\_Beer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022034605/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piels_Beer \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piels\\_Beer\") -- now that was strength in advertising...\n\nAs for campaigns that I've enjoyed  \n1. Chivas Regal - a photo of a photostudio table that was empty - and a notice that it was too good to waste.  \n2. Fred and Ginger in a dance pose - and the caption - remember when all you needed was talent.\n\nIn recent years - I'd say Budweiser. But I may be prejudice -- it was one of my neighbors who came up with that one.\n\nOr that EOS (?) car in Europe - those television spots are incredible. Though Bentley has been cute lately with the slogan \"For When Your Penis Is Just Too Small\" -- LOL\n\nIf you can get 10% of the population to try your product because of your campaign - then you have truly had a successful run.\n\n"

From what I’ve read that company is barely able to quantify the success or failure of individual ads or series of ads because there is literally too much Coke advertising to track it all anymore. As I pointed out in one of your other threads, Coke advertising is the only product campaign to ever near the level of placement that a true propaganda campaign requires, and that’s tough to do.\n\nAnother great series of campaigns are the ones that the (American) National Football League did in the 1960s and 1970s to sell advertising to businesses. Those turned the NFL from a scruffy underdog into an indomitable juggernaut, and many people are not aware that they even existed. I don’t know if you can get access to them in the UK, but NFL Films did some great films for the NFL that really broke a lot of new ground in terms of sounds an cinematography.\n\n"

While I agree that she can't base her entire research on people's resposes (and the reponses), her questions are legit and thought provoking. The point of a forum is to open discussion about a topic - and her topic is relevant to the audience.\n\nSince you've been poking around here for a while, you should know that most of the responses are from Typophile veterans who obviously have no problem answering the question at hand.\n\nIf this isn't the place for asking creative people a to think constructively, then what is?\n\nmissgiggles, my short answer is social media such as Myspace, Facebook, and YouTube. These companies don't do any advertising whatsoever yet have millions of hits every day all over the world. I don't think word-of-mouth advertising (or perhaps word-of-keyboard would be more appropriate) has ever been more effective.\n\nI'm not sure about the UK's Pop Idol, but in the US, more people vote for American Idol than in the US Presidential election - I'd say that would be a place to start researching persuasion too.\n\n-Scott\n\n"
