I designed Grafika many years ago to be typeset for title cards, and both opening and end credits for the Merchant/Ivory feature film “Savages”. After the film's run, the design languished in my archives until recently when I rediscoved it. I have digitally redrawn Grafika, completing it with all the altenates, ligatures, math, foreign accented characters and punctuation that weren’t required of the original design for film. For more info and perspective on Grafica, read my [BLOG](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819002855/http:/blog.alphabetsoupblog.com/?p=450) posting or download the [Grafica PDF Brochure](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819002855/http:/www.michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/Grafika_Brochure.pdf). \n",
