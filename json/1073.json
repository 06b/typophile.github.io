Although my guess is that either Huerta or Parkinson is the art director while the other actually drew the letters, some explanation from one of them might clear up any perceived confusion.\n\n"

If you compare the two they are slightly different. Gerard worked on the logo before he got involved with digital techniques, so he hired me to digitize the logo for him. I digitized it using an Aristo Tablet working in IKARUS, man you should have seen that data!   \n   \nBoth Jim Parkinson and I have similar SELF logos on our website. Who did what, when, is lost in the fog of time.\n\n"

In it, the caption to the RB&BB logo says: \"The design for the circus has lasted for over twenty years.\" I must have assumed (incorrectly) that it meant the design has remained \"unchanged\" for twenty years. My mistake. Again, thanks.\n\n"
