Can you give me some examples, Patricia?»</cite>\n\nI think she might possibly be mixing up one Celtic language with another (well, two others): in both Irish and Scottish, when initial consonants are eclipsed, only the original consonant is capitalised, not the eclipsing consonant.\n\nSo, for example, _bróg_ ‘shoe’, _dlí_ ‘law’, _grá_ ‘love’, _poll_ ‘hole’, _teach_ ‘house’, and _cill_ ‘church’, if eclipsed and capitalised, would be written thus:\n\n_a mBróga_ ‘their shoes’  \n_a nDlíthe_ ‘their laws’  \n_i nGrá_ ‘in love’  \n_i bPoll_ ‘in a hole’  \n_i dTigh_ ‘in(side) a house’  \n_i gCill_ ‘in a church’\n\nEven if written in all-caps, it should still be _A mBRÓGA_, _A nDLÍTHE_, &c.\n\nI can’t think of any instance in Welsh where a similar situation would arise, either. Eclipses (or soft lenitions, or whatever you call them in Welsh—Welsh initial mutations confuse me a bit) are, to my knowledge, capitalised normally in Welsh, on the rare occasion that they result in multiple letters. I have a song called _Yng Ngolau Ddydd_, for instance; not _Yng nGolau Ddydd_.\n\n"
