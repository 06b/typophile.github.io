  "content": "FONTWORKS NEWSLETTER // FEBRUARY 2006\n\nThis month's newsletter is a Rian Hughes special celebrating the 10th birthday of Device Fonts and the release of the stunning new \"Ten Year Itch\" reference book to celebrate this landmark, available from Fontworks.\n\nFeatured below:  \n- New Device Fonts Releases: check out the fonts which comprise Rian's \"Zephyrmen\" Collection 8  \n- \"Ten Year Itch\": details on this brand new 160 page must-have type reference book  \n- Special Offer: spend 99 GBP or more on Device Fonts at type.co.uk and receive the book absolutely free  \n- Competition: win a signed and numbered limited edition hardback version of Ten Year Itch  \n- Archive Device PDFs and interview with Rian Hughes on type.co.uk\n\n================================\n\n- NEW DEVICE FONTS COLLECTION 8: \"ZEPHYRMEN\"  \nHot on the heels of Collection 7 (\"Pagodaland\") comes another 15 Device families released under the code name \"Zephyrmen\". As we've come to expect from Rian it's an extremely varied and versatile collection of type, ranging from distressed (Roadkill, Zond Diktat) to playful (Catseye, Custard), historical (Mulgrave is based on cast-iron Victorian street signs) to futuristic (Gentry, Gridlocker). The 7 weight \"Ministry\" typeface is a notable revival, created after viewing the Ministry of Transport signage designs in the National Archives in Kew. All new releases are magnificently detailed in the new Device book \"Ten Year Itch\" (see below).\n\nView and buy the Device 8 Collection:  \n [http://www.fontworks2.type.co.uk/fw/doc?d=public/displaycase/device8](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015070954/http:/www.fontworks2.type.co.uk/fw/doc?d=public/displaycase/device8 \"http://www.fontworks2.type.co.uk/fw/doc?d=public/displaycase/device8\")\n\n- TEN YEAR ITCH: The definitive Device Fonts resource  \nWorkaholic type designer and illustrator supreme, Rian Hughes celebrates ten years of font releases the only way he knows how, by sweating blood on a mammoth 160 page type specimen documenting the entire Device collection. Stuffed to the brim with samples, text settings, background info on each font and with a foreword by Erik Spiekermann this book is a visual feast for type fans. If you've admired Rian's work over the years the book will be indispensable. The softback version has fold out flaps featuring a cross section of logos designed for various clients and if you're really quick you may be able to purchase the extremely limited edition (only 150 exist) hardback volume with full colour dustjacket and a lime green embossed hard cover, signed and numbered by Rian.
