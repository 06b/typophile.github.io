  "content": "I'm currently working on a font and I've found an issue which baffles me, shown here: [http://members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy\\_glitch.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011150553/http:/members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy_glitch.png). As you can see there are these out of place lines over the \"u\" and \"y\" glyphs, and they're not the only affected glyphs. The issue crops up in Photoshop when the font is displayed at small sizes or has anti-aliasing off. What's weird is that the lines don't actually exist on the vectors, FontLab renders them appropriately and there's nothing suspect on the offending glyphs which sets them appart from the others that render properly.\n\nHelp would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nDomenico.\n\n",

FontAudit was unable to find any problems.\n\n@ Thomas: The paths are a little awkward but nothing like this has cropped up in my past experiences with more complicated paths.\n\nI found that saving the font as OT TrueType solves the problem, irregardless of whether auto hinting was set on or off [http://members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy\\_glitch\\_2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011150553/http:/members.optusnet.com.au/d-esign/misc/brushy_glitch_2.png).

I don't know if there is a maximum OTF-fontsize, but in CS applications there seems to be a maximum fontsize when you use subroutines to compress the outlines (with FontLab). The problem described above didn't occur in Quark and also didn't happen when I made the font into an OpenType TT.\n\n"

I'll keep the $100 to buy a pretty badge for my Typophile avatar.  \nOK jokes aside, I'm reluctant to remove nodes because I don't want to sacrifice detail and because the font as is, shows no artefacts when saved in TrueType. Because you insist, I'll pick at the glyphs and see how much needs to be changed to get it rendering properly, if there's too much detail lost I'll move on or stick with the (as Andreas put it) \"quick and dirty\" TrueType solution.\n\n@ Thomas: Subroutinisation isn't the problem as the lines still crop up irregardless of whether the outlines are non-compressed or compressed as shown in the screenshots. I'll be on a particular lookout for sharp angles.\n\n@ All: Thanks for the help, it's much appreciated.\n\n"
