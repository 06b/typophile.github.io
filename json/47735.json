First edition 1919, last one  \nanywhere in the 30ies. (And some more after Germanys surrender ’45).\n\nI know all his books and hang me, but I am sure:  \nThis title shown in the picture, is a fake.  \nThe german word “Untergang” is written with an U at the beginning.  \nYes, sometimes they tried to give a title a kind of latin touch,  \nbut I do not believe to the V instead of the U in the 1920ies.  \nAnother thing are the different capital R at the end of the lines.  \nI do not believe its a standard lead letter font with three versions  \nin it.\n\nI guess its changed later electronically.  \nThe copyright of UDA was (or better: is) at Beck’sche Verlagsbuchhaltung, Munich. The shown title does not fit to them.\n\nGeorg  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n„Ich bin ein Preuße, kennt Ihr meine Farben...“\n\n"
