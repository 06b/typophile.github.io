      "content": "Using the ae ligature is considered somewhat archaic in U.S. English -- in fact, American usage has dropped the leading a in most instances. (For example: encyclopaedia vs. encyclopedia.)   \n   \nAlthough British style retains both letters in most instances, I do not know whether they commonly use the ligature or not. I suspect it is not necessarily improper to use it, but it may look quaint/mannered/overly formal.\n\n"

Using &ldquo;ae&rdquo; as a substitute for &ldquo;aelig;&rdquo; in Norwegian and Danish would be akin to using &ldquo;vv&rdquo; as a substitute for &ldquo;w&rdquo; in English&mdash;comprehensible, but jarring.   \n   \nRegarding &ldquo;et cetera&rdquo; vs &ldquo;et caetera&rdquo;: either is acceptable, but the former is found more frequently than the latter, at least in English language contexts.   \n   \nI believe that &ldquo;&aelig;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&oelig;&rdquo; usage in (post-Anglo-Saxon) English had been preferred for words ultimately of Greek origin that were spelled with alpha-iota and omicron-iota respectively. As the Latin word &ldquo;c(a)eterus&rdquo; [for which &ldquo;c(a)etera&rdquo; is likely the feminine ablative] is not of Greek origin, it probably shouldn&lsquo;t be spelled with &aelig;.\n\n"
