It’s now eight weeks since the launch of Village, and we’re happy to present three new releases, all debuts of one kind or another.\n\n/  \nFirst up is “Local Gothic” from Orange Italic. This is Christian Schwartz’s first ever release on his own label. (You probably know Christian for his many typefaces published with the world’s best large foundries: “Amplitude”, “Los Feliz”, “Neutraface”, and “Unit” to name a few.) “Local Gothic” was used extensively in materials for TypeCon 2005, which took place in the city in July. The face includes some brilliant OpenType randomization programming by Tal Leming of Type Supply. We’re very excited to present “Local Gothic”.  \n [http://vllg.com/OrangeItalic/LocalGothic/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329211919/http:/vllg.com/OrangeItalic/LocalGothic/mudTyper+Weights/)\n\n//  \nOur second debut is Thirstype’s “Kaas” typeface, the first face published by Hugo d’Alte. Hugo was born in Portugal, educated in the Netherlands, and lives in Finland, making him Village’s hands-down pan-European champion. “Kaas” is a modern geometric/constructed blackletter with a historically-accurate set of titling capitals, a huge collection of accents, and Cyrillic and Hebrew alphabets.  \n [http://vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329211919/http:/vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/)\n\n///  \nNumber three on our list is Joshua Darden’s debut face on his own label: “Omnes”. (You might be aware of Joshua’s super-family “Freight” or his Headline version of “Meta”.) “Omnes” is an exquisite contemporary mostly-rounded sans serif whose details become more apparent as the weight increases. The face is unique and versatile, friendly and clean. We’re extremely proud to bring you “Omnes”.  \n [http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329211919/http:/vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/)\n\nAll three typefaces are reasonably priced: You can pick up all three new releases for less than $200.\n\nThanks for reading.  \nVillage\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n[http://vllg.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329211919/http:/vllg.com/)\n\n1.646.654.1506 / phone + fax  \n1.917.547.3826 / alternate phone\n\n168 Second Ave #253 / New York NY 10003 USA\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n",
