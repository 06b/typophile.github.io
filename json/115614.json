  "content": "HI.  \nhopefully some one can help, would like to understand the very basics of hinting. im using font lab.\n\nI assume that when you click autohint you get the green guides that show the letter stokes on the vertical and horizontal axis and a small number which again im assuming it the width of that stroke, for a letterform that has no stroke contrast should these be all the same?\n\ne.g, a letter \"b\" the vertical ascender on left is 28 the vertical of the bowl on right is 27 the top of bowl is 27 and bottom is 28. would i convert these to be all equal?\n\nand a sub question, can you, (and if s how can you) get the green hint guides for the diagonals like on a cap \"A\"\n\nwould appreciate any help in 'laymans' terms. :-)\n\n",
