The t-shirts are aimed primarily at 30-/40-somethings and are not ’comedy’ but will probably raise a wry smile from those who get the reference, which is to a pop song from the eighties.\n\nI can’t reveal the text yet (sorry), but it’s along the lines of “Like a Yo-Yo” - i.e. lyrics from part of a song. If there is to be a whiff of retro about it, then it should be subtle.\n\nI would be very grateful for your suggestions!  \nThank you,  \nKate\n\n [‹ Check mark symbol?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121165316/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41082 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [mixed-type logotype ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080121165316/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40985 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
