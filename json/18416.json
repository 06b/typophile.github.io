Peter Matthias Noordzij apparently felt that TheSerif is an unethical clone of his PMN Caecilia and accused Luc(as) de Groot of plagiarism. De Groot defended himself claiming that both typefaces came were inspired by the teachings of their professor (and Peter Matthias' father) Gerrit Noordzij but that they were conceived and created independently.\n\nA.\n\n"

Although initially Peter Matthias didn't appear to have any qualms about TheSerif, he kinda got swept along by this whole ruckus which blew completely out of proportion.\n\nWhen in doubt, trust the Type Identification Board people. And I can guarantee you that we never have the slightest trouble distinguishing the one from the other. Are they similar? Yup, as is to be expected from two students of the same influential teacher investigating similar avenues. Is one a clone of the other? Nope.\n\n"
