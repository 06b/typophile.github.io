  "content": "Some time between Mac OS7 and OS9, Type 3 fonts stopped working, or rather Type 3 FF Beowolf stopped working! I have a need to use it again after briefly played with it in 1994. Would anyone have any info as to how to make it work? I can select the fonts in OS9, but the print out from a postscript printer get substituted with some other fonts. I have also printed to PS but Distiller refuses to process it...\n\nThanks in advance\n\n [‹ Is God Dead? Is Type Dead?

      "content": "I think the point when Type 3 fonts stopped working was when ATM was added to the mix. ATM only supports Type 1 fonts. Perhaps if you disabled or uninstalled ATM and put the fonts directly in the Fonts folder (in the System Folder), they might work. You do have to print to a PostScript printer, of course. Whether it needs to be a true PostScript printer as opposed to a clone, I don’t know. And it is not possible to see the results on screen (it never was).\n\nYou might also try contacting [Letterror](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119154918/http:/www.letterror.com/) and ask for advice.\n\n"

I specifically mentioned Type 3 version of Beowolf, I am feeling more and more like a dinosaur...\n\n"
