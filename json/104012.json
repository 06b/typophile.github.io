  "content": "Been doing a bit of research on Univers and its different adaptations, found out on wikipedia that:\n\n_Ordnance Survey also adapted Univers for use on their maps (added tails on the lowercase l and t, and other small changes to help distinguish the type from the map details) of which they own all rights to._\n\nI found this very interesting but couldn't find any image / examples of that typeface. Has Ordnance Survey stopped using it? Anyone got pictures of that typeface?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n",
