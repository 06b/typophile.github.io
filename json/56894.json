Check in particular to make sure your tallest letter above the baseline is the same, or ideally less tall than the value in Font Info/Metrics and Dimensions/Key Dimensions/Ascender.\n\nIncrease that Ascender value to cover the tallest letter, or scale the whole font so the tallest letter fits inside the Ascender value.\n\nIt could be something else, but this is usually checked first.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
