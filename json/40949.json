But if you have a wedge shape and need to make it look even smaller than it already is, softer lines are better. You could also poke someone’s eye out with a computer as thin as 4mm if it didn’t have smooth bevels. Braun went to wedges in the late 70s and they were fashionable, horribly so, and didn’t last long.  \nI’ve ordered my MacBook Air despite of its stupid name. I ride a bicycle to work and my Powerbook 15” is very heavy to take along, as it is on flights. I’m on an airplane a few times a week, so schlepping only half the weight around will make a huge difference. I use a big monitor both at home and at work with all the peripherals attached, so i don’t need anything else. I do miss a Firewire connection, but then most small drives these days have USB 2.0 anyways. And when was the last time i put a DVD into my laptop? When i loaded Leopard. And how often does that happen? If one wanted to watch videos (which i don’t), get them from a hard drive or use an ipod as external drive.\n\ne\n\nPS: disclaimer: i have a large collection of Braun equipment, like almost all their Hifi stuff from 1959 until the end, so i did quite enjoy having all that aluminum on my desk. Looks great with all that 60s stuff. And we still have the Braun calculator on the iPhone.\n\n"

Take a look at this article recently published by Gizmodo on the Braun/Apple connection:\n\n[http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apple...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015202427/http:/gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future \"http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future\")\n\nMy two cents on MacWorld08:  \n-MacBook Air is cool looking, but it lacks so much (ports, replaceable battery, etc…) that I can’t imagine it being a very popular product for Apple.  \n-iPhone update was significant enough for me to delete all my jailbreak work, although I still greatly look forward to the SDK. Love the addition of group SMS and the mock-GPS feature works very well.  \n-Time Capsule looks very interesting. Too bad I JUST BOUGHT a new Extreme.\n\nNothing else really caught my eye, I thought Steve really disappointed us this year. I guess since last year’s iPhone extravaganza, they are going to have to work extra hard to keep us interested. :)\n\nThe best thing about MacWorld is being in San Francisco and seeing the magic that is Apple marketing. I have yet to actually see the street teams in action (with the exception of coming out of BART this morning during the keynote and seeing all blank walls), but sometime during the keynote (every year, right on cue) every single available ad space along Market Street and in the Bart stations seem to automagically produce all the new Apple ads in a matter of minutes. You can go outside the moment the keynote is over and the city is just blanketed in fresh Apple material. I think it is brilliant.\n\n"

I guess since last year’s iPhone extravaganza, they are going to have to work extra hard to keep us interested. :)</cite>\n\nApparently you aren’t the only one who felt that way - Apple’s stock fell significantly today.\n\nI realize we’re all going wireless and this machine is probably forward thinking in that regard, but I need a machine that serves my purposes RIGHT NOW and that includes a disk drive and more than one USB port. I often plug a mouse into my laptop (I know, I can get a wireless mouse) and use my USB flash drive a lot. I just wouldn’t want to have to lug around a lot of peripherals in order to use my supposedly portable device. And I get a lot of materials from clients on CD or DVD so without a way to put them in... not so useful. It’s all moot (for me) anyway since a 13.3” screen is way too small.\n\nErik, I think we’ll all be interested when you get yours to hear what you think!\n\nZara - I just read your post again - no replaceable battery??? Like the iPhone. Really, what are they thinking. We can’t be sending our machines away to get new batteries. Of course the battery on my powerbook has been dead for years and I only use it plugged in. Which is one reason I need a new machine.\n\n"
