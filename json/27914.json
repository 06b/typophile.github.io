      "content": "In general, I like what you have here, but I have a thing for fonts that are constrained by a geometric rule. Indeed, I do most of my own desigining with one. Casual and Club intentionally, flow from one character to the next and, in most cases, make a word to appear as a single undulating form. Which, in itself, is not a bad plan, but it does hinder legibility.  \nAlso, the ascenders in Club look like penises.\n\n"
