It's used throughout [http://loveshackfancy.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194255/http:/loveshackfancy.com/ \"http://loveshackfancy.com\") (although they appear to use a variety of fonts, the only ones I can identify are Callie Hand and Ginette). These images might not all be the same font either (where it says \"Halter Mini Dress\" it appears to be different for the first two words... whereas the word DRESS exactly matches the images above it).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194255im_/http:/typophile.com/files/collection_banner_dresses_4001.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194255im_/http:/typophile.com/files/collection_banner_bottoms_4230.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194255im_/http:/typophile.com/files/p_fancy-dress-4_5128.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194255im_/http:/typophile.com/files/p_love-halter-dress-2_4482.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194255im_/http:/typophile.com/files/p_halter-mini-dress-5_4054.png)\n\nCan anyone help me?
