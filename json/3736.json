  "content": "Hello Everyone,   \n   \nI have a font which is slightly too light for laser printer use and I'm trying to darken it just a tad using FontLab's Transform Bold/Outline feature. Is it best to keep the same values for both horizontal weight and vertical weight or should I just do 1 or 2 units of horizontal and keep the vertical at 0? I'd like to preserve the original proportions as much as possible. Thanks for any help.\n\n",
