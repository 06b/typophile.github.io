In the site we have a lot of text, because the site publishes tales, so I’d like some help and advice in my choices.\n\nA text example is here: [http://vitoregia.googlepages.com/cap2.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071110004600/http:/vitoregia.googlepages.com/cap2.html \"http://vitoregia.googlepages.com/cap2.html\") (it’s all in Portuguese, but I think it won’t be a problem).\n\nIn the site, i used Trebuchet MS, a line-height (or leading) of 1.7 em, a less than 50% of width column for the principal text and a dark gray color for the text (#696969).\n\nTahnk for the attention, folks!\n\n [‹ Tax logo from 1968 needs revamp](http://web.archive.org/web/20071110004600/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30649 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Adobe Illustrator gradient question... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071110004600/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31009 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
