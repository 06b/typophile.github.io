  "content": "I saw this interesting new hybrid-esque face in use on the doors at a Dunkin' Donuts in Rhode Island. I didn't see it anywhere else in the store and haven't seen it since. I'm presuming it's a proprietary Dunkin' Donuts face, but was curious if anyone else knows any more details about it (who designed it, when, etc):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pull_3842.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/push_3601.jpg)\n\n",
