  "content": "Well, I am my own boss now and I finally have a budget to build my font library. My current collection has a decent smattering of this and that, but I feel I'm lacking a complete sans family. While I anticipate Mark Simonson's [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.marksimonson.com/article/118/proxima-sans-going-nova) family will provide an excellent choice for a geometric sans, I haven't settled on a humanist sans.\n\nI know there is a great variety out there, but I'd really like something in OpenType -- not just because of the features, but because I frequently switch back and forth between Mac and PC. Here are a few I'm considering:\n\n- [Vista Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.emigre.com/EFoIVisOT.php)\n- [Sebastian](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.stormtype.com/sebastian.html)\n- [Nexus Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11482.0.0)\n\n[FTF Stella](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.secretonix.pt/ftf/catalogue/FTFstella.htm) and [FF Legato](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.evertbloemsma.nl/legato/legato_family/legato_regular.htm) are two that I especially admire -- I only wish they were availble in OpenType.\n\nI'd appreciate any advice from those that have used any of these or can recommend other options.\n\nThanks,  \nAddison\n\n",

I am a big fan of Sebastian, but it definitely has a lot of features and has a smaller x-height than many other humanist faces.\n\nIf versatility is what you're after, I'd say go for Nexus.\n\n"

It's got a strong flavor of Meta to it, which I think might make it more readily accepted by people used to Meta's structure and character. Plus the alternate sets that Dupré designed allow Vista to do some fun, interesting stuff that's unique to the family.\n\nLegato's got the high legibility thing going for it, but its design makes me think of [the font used in the BBC series _The Prisoner_](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.eff.co.uk/M/P/PrsLR.htm) too much. I know, I'm weird like that. But I can't get past it, for some reason.\n\nIt's a tough choice between some great fonts that, as tbiddy said, is a matter of specfic desires.\n\n"

A few years ago, when I was first just an exchange student in Germany, Linotype and the school I was studying at collaborated on a project. Students in this project created advertising & brochure proposals for the Vialog typeface (Werner Scheider, Vialog's designer, was the school's retired typography professor). So the fonts were given to the school for our use.\n\nSince working at Linotype, I have designed a few small ads and marketing materials (posters for conferences, etc) for Vialog.\n\nI don't think that Vialog is directly based off of any traffic signs. In the 1980s, Werner Schneider created a proposal for a European Highway signage face that was not put into use. During the 1990s, he reworked this face into Vialog, which became the house face of the Munich transit system before it became available for licensing. Since 2001–2, everything related to public transportation in Munich is set in this face (from signs down to the fold-up maps that fit in your pocket). This completed face, already tested and optimized for Munich, is available from Linotype as part of its Platinum Collection.  \n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20120624051932/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"
