Looks like they started from Helvetica Neue Bold and customized /a to make a single storey /a (original /a spur looks to have been kept, better look [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022072717/http:/www.camdenartscentre.org/assets/layout/logo.png)). A better way would probably be to switch for [Helvetica Textbook Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022072717/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/helveticatextbook-bold) to get such a single storey /a.\n\n"
