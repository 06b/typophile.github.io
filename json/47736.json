They are going to be double pg spreads and the right margin will be the one nearer the centre of the pg of a double pg spread. Approximately how many mm is the average to work with when it comes to margins for an annual?\n\n",

The [Wikipedia page on page construction canons](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019193747/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canons_of_page_construction) might be helpful for you.\n\nIn general, when you are working with page spreads, making the outer margins wider then the inner margins is practical, as it lets the reader hold the pages at the sides while making the content of the facing pages appear as a cohesive unit.\n\n[Xerox Publishing Standards](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019193747/http:/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0823059642) may be interesting for you.\n\n"
