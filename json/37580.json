  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI will try to be sample (my english is not perfect)\n\nWhit ID (CS1) you can go to windos/workspace and register the way you place all your panels. It creates a icon XML, and after that if you want to go work to a custumer, you took you XML icon and you put it in the library/preference/adobe/workspace and your workspace are going to be like when you work at home.\n\nNow it's possible to do that whit Illustrator, did someone know ?\n\nThank you  \nMarc C\n\n",
