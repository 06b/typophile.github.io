And which already excisting promotions do you think are good?\n\nI'm trying to make one for myself (more like a catalog but well designed), containing my font collection.\n\n",

I wanted the specimens to reference the plainspoken nature of late 19th century and early 20th century metal type specimens but with a very clean and modern edge. The specimens differ wildly in what they show for each typeface (compare [Giorgio](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014034849/http:/commercialtype.com/typeface_images/giorgio/giorgio/Giorgio-family.pdf) with [Guardian Agate Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014034849/http:/commercialtype.com/typeface_images/guardian/guardian_agate_sans/Guardian_Agate_Sans-family.pdf) for instance).\n\nBut I see you are doing this for personal use, so it need not be as (overly?) extensive as the CT ones.\n\n"
