      "content": "I guess I'll be the one to say it. I don't think this is a font. Notice that the two l's are not identical. So next I ask myself, what if I had to try to re-create it? I looked for a font that had similar joining and looping characteristics, and hopefully a similar S (Helinda Rook was the first one I found, and not necessarily the best). Then I played a bit with it in Illustrator. I compressed and rotated the S and I pulled some outline points on the t, added a leading tail to it, as well as some shear and stretch on the lower case letters to produce a somewhat similar look with about 20 minutes of inexpert manipulation. ![Stelling-Helinda](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051305im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16004.gif)\n\n"
