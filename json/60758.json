Personally I see books mainly with serif fonts and magazines in san-serif, but why?\n\nAre serif/sans-serif fonts more \"comfortable\" to read? How they affect reading speed? etc.\n\nSo please, let's discuss.\n\n",

For example here are some simple questions which I'll try to answer myself later (after an experiment), but I'm also interested in your opinion, that's why I'm here. To share my experience and listen to yours.\n\nSo the first park of my questions:  \n1. Which font type reads faster? Sans-serif or serif? (I'll read a A4 paper in English in both font types and write down time here)  \n2. Which font type is more comfortable to read? (reading long peaces of text without getting tired)\n\nPlease join me if you are interested.\n\nThanks.\n\n"

      "content": "I don't think it's a question of personal preference at all but a question of inherent legibility. Sans serif is good for short bits--a couple of lines of caption material, a few words on signs. It has 3 inherent problems that militate against legibility. 1, It has no serifs, therefore nothing to 'sacrifice' against the erosive effect of high contrast (as in black type against a white page). Hold your index finger up against a strong light source and you will see that the light erodes the outline of the finger, 2, Its lines have no 'finish,' no fixed terminal point, so that they bleed off into nothingness on the page while serifs provide a definite ending to each stroke, so that each letter is 'closed' and self-contained. 3, There is little or no variation in line weight (thickness), therefore none of the 'rhythm' that seems to somehow naturally lead from one letter to the next. All of these failings make sans serif less comfortable to read than Roman.\n\nSan serif is frequently found in museum and art-show catalogues, usually set at extremely wide meansures and always hard or even exhausting to read.\n\nI have spent 40 years in magazine publishing and have found little use for sans serif in body type except when the type is very small and the layout cramped. Also, when paper-quality is low, like the rubbish we used for the listings of TV Guide magazine when I worked there too many years ago (the type was Bell Gothic, developed, I think for Bell Tel's phone directories).\n\nSans serif has been around for a long time yet, for long passages, has found few admirers save for art directors. They like it because it is relatively unasserttive compared to Roman and therefore more easily integrated into the design of the page as a whole.\n\nIf you are setting long stretches of type and want people to read to the end of them, choose Roman and don't look back. It will also help to provide compelling prose.\n\n"

Using actual prose pieces would be interesting indeed, but prohibitively expensive and complicated, requiring identical texts in two settings divided between two pretty large groups of people who read often for entertainment and information to read them for say three hours.\n\nThe results are perfectly predictable. The Roman readers will begin by immediately congratulating themselves on their good fortune, finish their texts quickly and conclude by devoting their remaining time to amicable and rewarding contextual discussion. Not so the san serif readers, oh no! They will begin by cursing the day they were born. end of Hour One: mass eye-rubbing, painful headaches. Hour Two: bitter recriminations lead to mutiny. Hour Three: fisticuffs and hair-tearing culminate in hostage-taking incidents.\n\n"
