I did check the digital outlines of Smart against those of Mr. Black and found that the bold weight is fairly close to the unknown pre-digital font used to make Mr. Black.  \nStill searching. Perhaps it has not been digitized. Have no information as to the source of the dry transfer sheet used for Mr. Black other than it was used in Poland. Photolettering? Filmotype? European company? The mystery persists.  \nDon\n\n"

Oh hum - just an observation. Variants of Akzindens may be worth looking at, as Helvetica, Univers and Folio are all part of the Swiss \"International Typographic Style\".  \nGood hunting!\n\n"
