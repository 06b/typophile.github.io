There's no reason why it needs to be there – in fact to my eyes it seems out of place both visually and historically; it feels like a non-choice, and next to the fresh & typographic mark that's sort of a letdown. Something a bit more fresh, angular and less compromising might be great as secondary font. Sans or maybe slab.\n\nBTW, be sure not to go too Marlboro on the front label. Although I think the way it is now should be fine.\n\nEdit: The type on the back label is tiny indeed – can you test if it's actually still legible once you take it to the silver foil paper?\n\n"

I would rather not introduce a third typeface.\n\nI hadn't considered the Marlboro similarity. I'm disappointed in myself for not spotting that.\n\nThe back label type is small but should be OK. Will see for sure when the proofs are done.\n\nAll the back label text is align left ragged right. Any justification is pretty much just by chance.\n\nThe mark before 'organically grown' is an asterisk to link to those after 'barley' and 'hops'. I'm happy that it creates a small indent in this context.\n\nThe decision not to adopt traditional beer styling was a considered one, which was decided upon partly to distinguish the product from alcoholic beers.\n\n"

I can hear Max Bill telling me now, <cite>This is not a book, it is a beer label.</cite>\n\n<cite>'*organically grown'</cite>\n\nOK, so you are referencing the ingredients on the next line. Careful – because this looks like a continuous string because of the short measure (line width). Consider what designers of the Bauhaus would have done, would they have accepted what the machine automatically did for them? - well actually... [humor]\n\n**[TIP]** Small Caps for Post code?  \nI used to make heavier weight either using a bolder weight or outline and made the type smaller so as to be optically the same as the rest of the address. This technique has been useful for stationary until now where Small caps are becoming more frequent feature.\n\n/mh\n\n"

What would the designers of the Bauhaus have done? I've received none of their schooling. Well, maybe a little, subconsciously.\n\nI think I will leave the post code in this instance, partly so that its text block remains mostly justified.\n\nCan any of the campaigners against using Helvetica or a grotesque suggest some alternatives?\n\n"

So, how about something geometric but round – in the overall direction of the ultimate Bauhaus font, Futura? But possibly a bit more current and smooth; dunno, Avenir or maybe even Gotham might be worth trying.

      "content": "Many thanks to everyone for all the feedback and alternate typeface suggestions, offers and mockups. I'll give them serious consideration.\n\nI agree that the diagonal neck label compromises the overall geometry but it was something I had no say about. It's not too bad and maybe even adds a little dynamism.\n\nThe wording _\"total organic\"_ was chosen instead of _\"totally organic\"_ for syllabic and visual symmetry.\n\nI think the forward slash within _'Zero Alcohol / Total Organic'_ is probably the most suitable option. I thought dots would not be as complimentary and anything more complex would be un-Bauhaus. I also think there's a popular sense of modernity with the forward slash through its use on the internet.\n\nI didn't mean to suggest anyone was a campaigner. It was just a lapse in vocabulary :)\n\nLove that graphic, Ratbaggy. Maybe do the whole alphabet and release them as a poster/postcard series.\n\n.  \nHere are some of the reasons, which may well be misguided or narrow minded, why I considered Helvetica as _\"the natural choice\"_ for this job ...\n\n- A sans serif was needed for a modernist design.\n\n- An angular constructivist sans serif would clash with the logotype.\n\n- A rounded constructivist sans serif would be too close to the lettering on the Bauhaus building and conflict with the logotype and brand identity.\n\n- It works well for an _'information graphics'_ aesthetic which connects with a Bauhaus/brutalist _'form follows function'_ and _'ornament is crime'_ ethos.\n\n- It can be used for all the text other than the logotype and still be legible at very small sizes on the back label and therefore the undesirable introduction of a third typeface is avoided.\n\n- It has a wide choice of weights which makes it very workable for the labels and the many other contexts in which it will be needed.\n\n- It has a relatively large x-height which minimizes the lowercase text's ragged horizontal rivers of space that would compromise the overall geometric design.\n\n- The dates of release for Akzidenz-Grotesk (1896) and Helvetica (1957) bracket the Bauhaus era fairly closely (1919-1933).\n\n"

This beer does not share that heritage and it would be misleading to the consumer to suggest that it did. Hopefully the market will assess this product with as little prejudice as possible.\n\nYou're quite right about the silver foil. It is wholly _\"a unnecessary device to enhance a some what bland label\"._ Worth a shot though, don't you think?\n\nIt's funny, I pictured the bottles' shelf presence in exactly the way you describe. I hope it works. Drawing attention to itself is its primary objective. The rest is for the shopper to decide.\n\nGlad to hear that _\"As a consumer i defiantly wouldn't associate this style of design with a beer label\"_. It was another one of the aims for the design to avoid beer label cliches. The bottle itself and the context in which it will be encountered, as well as some cognition on the part of the shopper, should be enough to overcome any confusion.\n\nAnd an association to _'energy'_ drinks, and their kind, is better than an association to the_'follow this with 6 shots, a kebab, unsatisfactory sex, projectile vomiting and a hangover'_ kind of drinks.\n\n_@ eliason_  \nThanks for those positive adjectives ... _\"Clean, modern, sober, progressive, cool.\"_ They're exactly the sort I would put on the Bauhaus beer mood board if I had one.\n\n"
