I think there was a dodgy off-brand film font of Bembo going around back in the seventies.\n\nIf you look up Bembo in the Solotype catalog, you can see the same hiccoughing u’s in it. Too bad it doesn’t show the g. It may have been in one of the other Dover type books. Anybody have the “Classic Roman Alphabets” volume? I don’t have that one handy and I’m pretty sure it’s in there.\n\n"

How it got there is a mystery, but one possible explanation is that it was put there deliberately by a reputable film font maker to sniff out pirates, in other words, type houses (or employees of type houses) who were copying and reselling the fonts. (Phil Martin confirmed the existence of this practice when I interviewed him for Typographica.) You see this occasionally in old film font catalogs. I remember noticing quite a few in the notorious Type Films of Chicago catalog we had at a magazine I worked for around 1980. I believe some of these “mistakes” have even made it into digital fonts by people who are making fonts by scanning specimens from old film font catalogs.\n\n"
