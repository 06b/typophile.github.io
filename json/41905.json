Most others look so awkward and defying a sense of proportion for the cyrillic (then again, whom to blame for a non-existing (as in current usage) glyph?). Which designer, but one aiming at old or classical (church slavonic) text would care?\n\nOh, and this yat looks exactly as the yat in the pocket dictionary my great-grandfather brought back from Russia after being released POWWI. No wonder, as Aleksey also states the source/inspiration/... of his type \"late 19th early 20th century\".\n\n"
