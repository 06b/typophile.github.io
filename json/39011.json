The ‘Pro’ description says: <cite><strong>In addition</strong> to the characters supported in the “Std” version</cite>.  \nYou’re right; it’s a little bit confusing that they listed all the languages contained for ‘Std’ and ‘Com’ but chose a abbreviated notation for ‘Pro’.\n\n"

Of course it is a choice of the manufacturerers, but for the average customer I think it will be somwhat confusing with three different formats.

Some foundries/distributors only sell fonts in family packages, others sell them individually.\n\nThe upshot is that there’s no use complaining about a lack of standardization — these days, it pays to be an informed purchaser, and for the producer/seller, the variety of formats on the market expands the market, by offering purchase opportunities at many points on the demand curve.\n\n"
