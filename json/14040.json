  "content": "(No, not ligatures for FF Meta...)\n\nOne of my fascinations in the field of \"visible language\" are shapes  \nthat stand for more than one letter. It's interesting to consider how  \nthey combine, what parts are \"important\", and how the recognition of  \nthe components is weighted (intentionally or not), when alone or even  \nmore interestingly in the contexts of words. I can't stop thinking of  \nthis topic, even in banal places like Dairy Queen, where I daydream  \nweather a logo that's a \"D\" with a tail would work (or maybe it would  \ndrive their loyal customer base back to the mountains.)\n\nBelow is something I did when working on Trajic notRoman, years ago.  \nBut more than show what I've done (not much anyway, really) I'd like  \nto collect and compile examples you guys might have seen. Please let  \nme know of any metaligatures that you think are worth thinking about!\n\n(Oh, and as always I'm open to terminological  \nsuggestions as to what to call these things.)\n\nhhp\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [knnight.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105175229/http:/typophile.com/files/knnight.gif) | 2.58 KB |\n\n",

In a logo, this provides a point of visual interest.\n\nThere is a similar idea in the \"fi\" ligature, where the ball of the f serves as the dot on the \"i\", but the purpose is different: it could be considered as the removal of visual stutter.\n\nAnother category of compressions: as in the Avant Garde ligatures, where the purpose is to enable justification of tight-set headlines.\n\n"
