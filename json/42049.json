I’ve never heard of ‘QT’ as a foundry/manufacturer code, so I assume that’s some rip-off.  \nF\n\n"

To answer the question Aszszelp raised, no I didn't expect quality, which, if you took the time to actually read what I wrote, I put high quality in quotes, which in my language usually denotes a tad of sarcasm.\n\nThanks anyway.\n\nNeil\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Neill,\n\nMy guess is that QT Old Goudy is Zymmetricals 'adaptation' or 'version' of one of Frederic Goudy’s classic typefaces, for instance the aforementioned Goudy Old Style. But of course it could be any other of his dozens of typefaces.  \nIf you could provide us with an image, we will be able to point you to a legal, high-quality (in the sense of well behaving on a computer and more similar to the original) version.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
