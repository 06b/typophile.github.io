  "content": "I work for a fashion and lifestyle magazine, we are currently using Linotype Didot as the main headline/display font. We are looking at revamping the magazine in the next few months and I would really like to change the font to something that still has the essence of Didot (clean, elegant) but is fresher, more modern, funkier ... more 'now'! and hopefully with a larger family of weights to work with.\n\nWould appreciate your sage advice ...!\n\n",

Could maybe be seen as Didot's distant kissing cousin. (Ok. Maybe that's a stretch. It is a cute typeface and I'd kiss it too.)  \n- [Chronicle](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232912/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100031). Scotch is all the rage. Great range of weights and widths too.\n\nAnother thought. Don't go drastic, just go better. [HTF Didot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232912/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100004). A few other fashion magazine are trying to use them right now. But failing miserably. It deserves to be used in a grand way.\n\n"

I don't know if it will strike you as a suitable alternative. It's found a happy place in some bridal magazines.\n\nThere is a PDF sample of the Display fonts at [http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay\\_Sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232912/http:/www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf \"http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay\\_Sample.pdf\")\n\nThe Display fonts aren't available via Font Bureau's Retail library yet, but you can contact them directly if you want to explore these for your publication. Also, I recently created Titling versions with even more contrast for <cite>Fortune</cite> magazine, which might be of value to fashion/lifestyle. The more the contrast, the more Bodoni-esque the design becomes. You can talk to FB about these as well.\n\n\\</Self Promotion\\>\n\n-- K.\n\n"

The didones have been inextricably linked to fashion for decades and it's hard to get away from them unless you're trying to do something edgy or undergound. I ended up going with Didot Elder for display as it really stands out from the competition and is beautifully drawn (esp. the 's' with ball terminals), but it has a polarizing effect on people and receives raves and criticism in equal measure.\n\n"
