I'm a sucker for black/rich black, but last time I did it on a CD booklet, the printing was done on germany without my \"supervision\" and they used a papper that simply ate the 2 blacks as one ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121546im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif). What is the rich black you'll be using on this?   \n   \nThe only feeling I have is that the box for the type could be moved a bit to the right... At least I'm tempted to move it a bit.   \n   \nWill you put a plastic matte on this book cover?\n\n"

Why not a box without the lines -- lines without a box? Is a box necessary? Flush right type? Why? I see only blue and black, why this color combo? Personally, I think typography alone could carry the day for you. Of course it would have to be just the right face, impeccably set. Hope this helps.\n\n"

One take on Tiffany's idea is make the silhouette aqueas coating and then hit the background with a mat white varnish. The effect is the silhouette is glossy on matte. So basicly you could make it a PMS match, Aqueas Coating and a Matte Tinted Varnish and you have another slot for a 4th color.\n\n"
