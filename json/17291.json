At least it doesn't look like a simple photoshop filter, a la UPS.\n\nPlus, that old typeface wasn't really working, and seems dated.\n\nI know, I know. This new treatment looks dated, too.

Despite your dislike of trademark rebrands of today (swooshes, gradients, cuddly aesthetics), it is certainly a contemporary corporate badge. As designers at the point where this bullshit is spun, it is all very transparent to us. No doubt this was consumer-tested to the hilt, and I'm sure regular folk (not us higher people) would have given it their thumbs up. I think it's a clever, but nonetheless frighteningly successful rebrand.\n\n"

It's depressing because it means we're that much closer to being replaced by monkies. Monkies who happen to be marginally trained in Photoshop, but monkies nonetheless. Maybe we lost some sort of vote and the computer kids won. So here's my personal rebrand slogan: graphic design = computers.  \nThat type is pretty lame. Not just by itself, but in the context of being on every other street corner in North America. What are they afraid of? Why does it have to be so wimpy and non-descript?

      "content": "From what Oskar wrote, (in the post linked in the original post here), I'd say that Chevron went with the simplest, safest design change. They're clearly trying to soften their image and that visual link with ribbons is a single-move way to turn the militaristic echelons into softer friendly forms. They're succumbing to every new trendy logo rework technique, which is a shame, but they're actually sticking very close to their original image, which is rare.\n\nI've seen some other companies ignore their brand's heritage in ways I believe hurt their image. However, in this case, I think Chevron would've benefitted from a BP-style (Oh, I'm sorry. 'bp-style') redesign/rebrand. I think they should break more of the fetters to their old look if their old image is so problematic and static. BP did this very boldly and very successfully. They really do seem much more committed to the shift of 'oil company to energy company' than most (they _seem_ much more committed). Though, I have yet to see Chevron's new campaign, which may help reinforce the message of change.\n\nI don't really like the type Chevron chose, as it's kind of a say-nothing face in today's context, but I have no doubt it's what they wanted. All-in-all I'd say it's a safe and logical move, even if it's not a stellar logo. I don't think the logo is really going to be their biggest issue in trying to alter their image in the minds of their customers, but that's partially their own fault. Again, bp did a great job of designing a flagship logo to spearhead their philosophical image shift.\n\n"

He was their signage consultant for a while as well.\n\nI can see that the new Chevron logo is softer, but if the goal was to move away from military-like ribbons, I think they didn't quite make it.
