      "content": "You’re starting to push things to the edge at random locations and it’s creating awkward tension by design. You’ve approached the edge at some points but design wise you’re still straddling the line and it gives your attempts a lack of confidence I’m not sure you want.\n\nOut of your three type choices for the title the third, Avant Garde?, seems to be the best. The modern aspect of the second doesn’t work well with the big, blocky simple style you’re going for. The first face is too funky and ‘fun’ if you will.\n\nBTW if you upgrade to Flash Player 8 you can now Insert Images into your post, thus you would be able to add this into your old thread.\n\n-Dave\n\n"

What i’m trying to do is to come up with an abstract K shape to use as an icon -sometimes without the title.\n\ni agree that the balance is lost in my latest attemts. when i try to go on, i stray from my original idea. so i’ll go back to the beginning, i guess.\n\nbtw, wadim, i like what you’re doing with DS Nova, but the face is a bit too ornamental for me.\n\nthanks  \nea\n\n"

      "content": "It seems that your k’s are being read as 7, you could try the k shape that Eben suggested from the P22 constructivist set (the simple rectangle with a triangle removed from the righthand side). When I think of Russian propaganda art I see the heros (worker and soldier) gazing, off right, to a new future. If you divided the width of your logo into three unequal parts and used that k shape overlapped in red, white and black (or whatever colour order you want) and have as the right hand area a simple rectangle, you could create a stong legible image that would work on its own and with the strapline.  \nTim\n\n"

A quick look at your site gave me your solution to the same problem: I didn’t understand that your blue avatar/icon was in fact the letter K (for Kahlkopf most probably) until i saw you used the same K for the headlines text on your site.\n\nso, here comes another direction i’m working on:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/kk6b.gif)\n\n"
