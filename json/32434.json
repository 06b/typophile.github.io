Today was such a case: they didn't process my request so the book (which is stored at an off-library archive) was not there for me to pick up. It will be there from tomorrow, but I'm not sure how soon I'll get back there. Eventually (maybe even as soon as the end of this month) I will get it though.\n\nBut in the meantime if you plan on picking up that copy on auction let me know.\n\nhhp\n\n"
