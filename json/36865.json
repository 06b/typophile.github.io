  "content": "Adobe Font Folio 11 has been released yesterday, and it supposedly contains over one hundred new fonts. Unfortunately, there is no list of them -- there is just a complete list of all fonts it contains, where the new one aren't marked as such.\n\nDoes anyone know any \"highlight\" among the new fonts in Font Folio 11? I guess it'd include fonts that have been released individually (like Adobe Garamond Premiere), but it there any fonts in there that haven't previously been released at all?\n\n",

      "content": "\\> _The Adobe Hebrew and Arabic were designed to match Minion_\n\nThat's what some people think, but that's not correct. About a year ago John Hudson wrote to the OpenType mailinglist how it happened:\n\n<cite>The Arabic, Hebrew and Thai designs were initiated without reference to the Latin companions. We knew there would be a Latin companion from the Adobe library, and I thought this would probably be one of the families with an MM source because they offered the most flexibility in terms of being able to match the weight and proportions of the non-Latins, but we didn't design the non-Latins to enable the instance of the Latin. When we started the non-Latin designs, we didn't even know for sure that Minion would be the companion.<br>\nOnce the relative regular and bold weights of the non-Latins were designed, we looked first at the style, and determined that Minion was a reasonable match. Then I made custom versions of a few Minion letters — H b i —, made measurements of these (stem weights, letter widths, x-height) and delivered these values to Christopher Slye at Adobe. Christopher had the job of generating from the Minion MM sources as close a match as he could to the values I had provided. I don't think any of the instances were a perfect match to the values I provided, but they were all quite close. A couple of the Latin bolds are a touch lighter than ideal because within the Minion MM matrix we couldn't get the heavier weight without throwing the widths off too much or reducing counter sizes unacceptably.<br>\nI'm very impressed by just how versatile Minion has proven itself to be in this kind of project, though, and the pleasing combinations are a result of that versatility, not of designing the non-Latins within a specific range of weights and proportions determined by Minion.</cite>\n\n\\> _And aren’t Bickham Script Pro and Arno Pro included with the CS’?_\n\nYes, these two families are bundled with the CS3 suites.\n\n"

The only Type 1 fonts in FF11 are Pi/Ornament fonts, but all these have their OpenType counterparts.\n\n"
