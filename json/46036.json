  "content": "Hi!\n\nDo any of you fine folks know of software that allows you to group stray fonts into families at will? For instance, my office has a mangled list of about 33 Times New Roman versions strewn throughout our font list. I would like to somehow wrangle them together so that my design team is not searching all day for the condensed version etc.\n\nWe use both Mac and PC. I am hoping for a solution that suits both systems (hahaha) but I will of course settle for either.\n\nThanks! Let me know what you know!\n\n",

But are you saying there is a function that will group the fonts together for use in other programs?\n\nBasically, I want to be able to scroll down my font list in illustrator/Indesign, and only have: \"Helvetica\" with all the different helvetica related typefaces contained therein. Does this make sense?\n\nIf FontExplorer X can do that, can you tell me how?\n\n"
