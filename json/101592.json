Originally designed by Veronika Burian and José Scaglione as a titling typeface, [Tablet Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033309/http:/www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic) is quickly becoming a news designer's favourite. The font delivers the sturdy, straightforward and clean appearance expected from a grotesque combined with a good measure of personality. Now with the obliques making it a total of 84 fonts with six grades of condensation, [Tablet Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033309/http:/www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic) can deliver consistent impact even better, whatever the publication format.\n\n**Please [contact us](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033309/http:/www.typetogether-news.com/lists/lt.php?id=LBgDUA8IUQpSSAcGXBgCAgQC) if you wish to upgrade your copy of Tablet Gothic to include obliques.**\n\nmore information at: [http://www.type-together.com/Tablet Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033309/http:/www.type-together.com/Tablet%20Gothic)\n\n",
