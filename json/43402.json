Was thinking of a classic typeface that could stand the test of time. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nG\n\n [‹ Public Speaker identity](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408050000/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43416 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Request for critical eyes ... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408050000/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43358 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It comes from Satires X, a Latin poem by Juvenal critiquing the Roman people after they acceded to an imperial rule in place of their (somewhat democratic) senatorial republic. Juvenal commented that people were willing to give up their political freedom in exchange for “bread and circuses.”\n\nI suggest something that creates the image of Roman type etched in marble, such as [RTF Albertan Inline](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408050000/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/rimmer/rtf_albertan_inline/).\n\n"
