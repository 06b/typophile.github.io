  "content": "I have typeset Borges' wonderful short (and I mean _short_) story \"Borges and I\" as a supplement to an article in the online academic journal I'm working on. I was hoping the experts here could take a look at what I've done and give me any suggestions that come to mind. The single page must be 8 1/2 x 11. Other than that, I have no real restrictions.\n\nA couple of things to consider:\n\n1. I chose Baskerville MT due to the reference to 18th-century typography in the story. Any suggestions for something more appropriate? (I have a limited set of fonts to work with, but I might be able to purchase something new if it is not too expensive.)\n\n2. Is the initial capital too dark? Is the kerning of the characters around it OK?\n\nThanks in advance for any comments and suggestions.\n\nMatty\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Borges and I - Column.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019053402/http:/typophile.com/files/Borges%20and%20I%20-%20Column.pdf) | 30.86 KB |\n| [Borges and I - Test.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019053402/http:/typophile.com/files/Borges%20and%20I%20-%20Test.pdf) | 30.59 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Actually, my main quibble with what you've got there is, the text measure is too wide for optimum reading comfort, even with the generous leading you've given it. Aim for a maximum of around 60 characters per line. With the constraint of a single 8.5x 11 page, you might consider making the column narrower, pushed to the right, with the title and author top left in the resulting wide left margin, and the footnote bottom left. You can reduce the leading a bit if necessary to fit the text on.\n\nI like Baskerville and can't complain about that. I think the initial cap is fine.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the suggestion, Gary. I'll give something like that a try. The person for whom I'm working may balk at such a \"radical\" approach, but I'll see if I can convince him. (I tried narrowing the measure and keeping it centered on the page, but there was just too much white space on either side. Your proposal will at least solve that problem.)\n\nNormally, when I'm stuck working with 8.5 x 11 paper, I work with a landscape-oriented page and use two columns. But I didn't think I could make that work with such a small block of text.\n\nNick, unfortunately I have no idea what aspect of 18th-century typography the narrator in Borges' story likes. I think that the long-s's and quaint ligatures would be a bit over the top for an academic journal, though. (And so I think I'll just continue to assume that he likes the neoclassical orderliness of Baskerville!)\n\n"

The publication information in the sidenote. Should it be full justified?\n\n3. The vertical placement on the page. Should everything be shifted down?\n\n"

      "content": "I like the version better where the beginning of the story is below the title and author. I would left justify the title/author sequence as you have with the footnote (don't justify that--it's too narrow). In this case I don't see the initial cap conflicting with the title. You might pull the title and the text up higher on the page, so that the footnote is below the text. This would set the text block off better.\n\nWith the title in roman and the author in italics, I think you can dispense with the \"by\", as it's clear this is the title and the author. That would elimnate the awkward whitespace created by having \"by\" on its own line. Or you could put the \"by\" directly in front of the author's name.\n\nYou could reduce the leading a couple of points in the footnote.\n\n"
