  "content": "How does one calculate appropriate licensing fees for broadcast? Specifically a network television sitcom using freeware fonts for opening credits?   \n   \nBoth MTV's The Osbournes and CBS's Still Standing are using my freeware fonts primarily in the main title sequences of both shows.   \n   \nIn the case of The Osbournes, the font usage has spilled out into licensed merchandise and continues to grow the brand based upon my work.   \n   \nI'm usually not a stickler about licensing nor am I trying to be greedy and take money out of the franchise. I do however feel that if a major network is going to use a typeface as the basis of the brand of the show that they would attempt to compensate the typeface creator by acquiring the appropriate licensing for the font.   \n   \nWhile it is truly flattering and I'm excited to see the fonts in use so notibly, no attempts to contact me have been made by either network.   \n   \nI open it up to the group to offer any advice, opions, or suggestions as to what would be fair compensation for the usage.   \n   \nThanks for the ear,   \nStuart :D\n\n",

      "content": "I had contacted MTV but they were not at all responsive and frankly I don't have the $$$ to sick a lawyer on them.   \n   \nYou are correct, there are no specific terms in my freeware licensing that would protect the fonts from use without some commercial license in place.   \n   \nOther thoughts that I had entertained were to revised the license on my freeware faces to include something to the effect of if it's used for broadcast the Font Diner must be credited or a commercial license must be purchased.   \n   \nIf I tell people they must purchase a commercial license for commercial use, I'll get a ton of e-mail from individuals wanting to use it on their business cards and websites. Those aren't the folks I am concenred with as much as I am a major network or company.   \n   \nAnother great suggestion I received was to create a \"pro\" version of the fonts and release them as commercial quality at either my site or My Fonts. Right now, the fonts were done very early in my font making career and are quite techincally poor quality.   \n   \nPerhaps it would encourage people to pay up for the better versions. Not becuase I intended it that way by releasing a lower quality first font, but becuase the older version is really quite horrid.   \n   \nStuart\n\n"

It wasn't until this discussion I transitioned my Silverware library to TT only and the end user needed to buy the commercial license of the face to get the PS version and the license.   \n   \nBy the way Joe, I took your suggestion but sent 'em an invoice and it eventually was paid. Not by MTV or the production company who did the titling, but by the artist who designed the credits because font licensing was his responsibility to MTV.   \n   \nOh well, the license expires each season, so if I see the faces used come fall, you can bet another invoice will be showing up in MTV's mailbox.   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

You have to make it absolutely clear   \nthey're dealing with the Font Diner 'legal' or   \n'licensing department' and not with Stuart   \nSandler, the small-beans, nice guy, type   \ndesigner.   \n   \nHere's an approach:   \n   \nWrite a letter (from your Font Diner licensing   \ndept.) saying you're aware they're using the   \nfonts in violation of the licensing agreement.   \nAttach an invoice to the letter. No confrontation   \nor name-calling necessary. It gives them the   \nbenefit of the doubt and doesn't paint you as a   \npushover.   \n   \nThen if they don't pay it, you'll have more   \nground to call a lawyer or seek legal action.   \n   \nGood luck with it. (And geez, don't apologize   \nfor having a successful font!)   \n   \nPS -- I'd love to see the work...   \n   \nPPS -- Please don't misconstrue this as bona   \nfide legal advice.
