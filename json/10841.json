If you're trying to match this sample exactly, however, beware that versions from different foundries may not all be quite the same.   \n   \nCompare for yourself:   \n   \n ![News Gothic Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20110927092306im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8086.gif)   \nLinotype   \n   \n ![News Gothic Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20110927092306im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8087.gif)   \nAdobe   \n   \n ![News Gothic Agfa Monotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20110927092306im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8088.gif)   \nAgfa Monotype   \n   \n ![News Gothic Bitstream](http://web.archive.org/web/20110927092306im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8089.gif)   \nBitstream   \n   \n ![News Gothic URW](http://web.archive.org/web/20110927092306im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/8090.gif)   \nURW   \n   \nAdobe's and Monotype's are probably interchangeable. Linotype's has basically the same letterforms, but is fitted differently. Bitstream's is a little more open in the counters and seems closest to Benton's original design to my eye. URW's is clearly different on the body.   \n   \nI tend to prefer the Bitstream, but that's probably because I first fell in love with News Gothic through Pentagram's use of it in Potlatch materials and this is the version they use.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
