I'm aware of the slews of classic books with centered horizontal text on the spine, but I'm looking for more current examples.\n\nIs this more popular with nonfiction than fiction? If so why?\n\nAlso, any good reasons against doing this sort of thing (assuming of course that it works without making the text too small and/or causing uncomfortable breaks)?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

A used paperback book, one that was actually read, tend to develop vertical cracks along the spine. Vertical text would appear somewhat stenciled, but still legible until a certain point. The risk with horizontal text would be the cracks deleting single letters.\n\n"

It seems that we've become quite used to tilting our heads (or our brains) to be able to read vertical text on a spine, especially when it reads from top to bottom (in North America). But on websites, magazines, or other collateral, it's not recommended nor is there a convention established.\n\nDoes anyone know when vertically displayed text became a standard in book publishing or is it just a matter of longer titles and shorter books requiring it?\n\n"
