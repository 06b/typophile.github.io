For the rest, at this size, the 2 /A look different to me so I'd say \"not-a-font/hand-done\". Even if that sounds cliché, I'd probably have a look to some fonts tagged at MyFonts ' [graffiti](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/tags/graffiti)', ' [tag](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/tags/tag)' or ' [hip hop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/tags/hip+hop)'. DaFont [Graffiti section](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=606) is also worth a look. This lettering has also a ' [comic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/comic)' feeling so maybe having a look to [Blambot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Blambot), [Comicraft](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Comicraft), [Canada Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Canada_Type) and (My)Fonts tagged ' [comic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Acomic)' would be useful too. Finally, I would also browse [Typodermic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typodermic) and [Pizzadude](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/PizzaDude.dk) collections.  \nFollowing these tracks and without too much effort, I've found [Show No Shame](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/show-no-shame), a Pizzadude font which looks not so far with its arced /A \"à-la- [Hobo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054951/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/hobo)\".\n\n"
