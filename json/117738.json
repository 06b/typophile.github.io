We should point out that the outline has been removed from the examples submitted to identify. And I join Don in saying good find since the outline removal makes it all the more tricky.\n\n"

If I wanted to make it I would do a high res scan of the letters in the Letraset catalog, delete the outlines and refine the letters. I would then recreate the outlines using a parallel lines feature.  \nI suppose that the letters could be classified as neo-Lombardic or neo-Uncial.  \nDon\n\n"
