  "content": "AMIRA   \n   \nThe Font Bureau, Inc. announces the retail release of   \nAmira, an original sanserif family by Cyrus Highsmith.   \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/Amira/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819081900/http:/www.fontbureau.com/Amira/)   \n   \nAmira was a personal challenge for Highsmith who had   \nnever attempted a calligraphic sanserif. Amidst the   \nmany low contrast monoline sans that have been   \ndominating recently, Amira's personality is refreshing.   \n   \nAmira flexes and bends in such ways that publication   \ndesigners Roger Black and Christian Schwartz believed   \nit the only choice for Natural Health's recent redesign.   \nThe magazine's new streamlined layout required an active   \ntypeface that would work both in headlines as well as   \nin text. The sans family is built around the tension   \nbetween gothic and calligraphic forms, resulting in what   \nSchwartz calls \"The best thing Cyrus has ever drawn.   \nOrganic but controlled. Very subtle.\" Black says,   \n\"It's the new Lydian!\". The Type Directors Club recently   \nawarded Amira a Judge's Choice Certificate of   \nTypographic Excellence.   \n   \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/Amira/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819081900/http:/www.fontbureau.com/Amira/)   \n   \nFor more information or to request a press kit,   \nplease email [info@fontbureau.com](mailto:info@fontbureau.com) or call Harry Parker   \nor Robb Ogle at 617 423 8770.   \n   \nBest Regards,   \n   \nHarry, Samantha & Robb   \n [typesales@fontbureau.com](mailto:typesales@fontbureau.com)   \nThe Font Bureau, Inc.   \n326 A St., Suite #6C   \nBoston, MA 02210   \n   \n617 423 8770 (voice)   \n617 423 8771 (fax)   \n   \n [http://www.fontbureau.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819081900/http:/www.fontbureau.com/)\n\n",
