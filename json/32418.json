You can do a search by Theme (style, really) on Dafont from the link to Flowerchild above to see if something free there is acceptably close.\n\nI’d suggest [Postino](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603035521/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/postino/) (actually a backslanted Postino Italic would be even closer) as a cheaper commercial alternative.\n\n"

It has the kind of ’retro’ vibe that many of his fonts also have.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
