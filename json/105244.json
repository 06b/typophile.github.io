Since I outlined the text on the logo, I need to find what's the font I used. Any idea?\n\nI already tried WhatTheFont and WhatFontis without success. So don't waste your time there.\n\nThanks!!!!!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n No \n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Bed & Breakfast.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415144506/http:/typophile.com/files/Bed%20&%20Breakfast.png) | 14.72 KB |\n| [Bed &.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415144506/http:/typophile.com/files/Bed%20&.png) | 11.54 KB |\n\n",
