Influenced by classic Dutch typefaces of Rosart and Fleischmann, Newzald’s large x-height and slightly condensed forms allow many words to the column. Newzald ships in four weights, Book to Black, providing a wide palette for the user. Its extensive character set includes extended language support, seven numeral sets and small caps across all styles.\n\nThe Newzald family of 8 OpenType fonts is available exclusively from Village for US$250.  \n [http://vllg.com/KLIM/Newzald/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/vllg.com/KLIM/Newzald/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/KLIM/Newzald/mudTyper+Weights/\")  \n [http://www.klim.co.nz/newzald\\_samples.php/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/www.klim.co.nz/newzald_samples.php/ \"http://www.klim.co.nz/newzald\\_samples.php/\")  \n [Download PDF Specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/www.klim.co.nz/pdf/KLIM-Newzald.pdf)\n\n/ / / / /\n\nSpeaking of Kris Sowersby...\n\nThe results of the Type Directors Club TDC2 competition for type design have been announced, and Kris was recognised as a Judge’s Choice for his National type family.  \n [http://tdc.org/news/2008Results/National.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/tdc.org/news/2008Results/National.html \"http://tdc.org/news/2008Results/National.html\")\n\nCongratulations to Kris, who joins fellow Villagers Mario Feliciano, Karsten Luecke, Christian Schwartz, Underware, and Joshua Darden, who have all been recognised by TDC2 in the past.\n\nThe National family of six weights in roman and italic, with small caps, several numeral sets, and extended language support, is available exclusively from Village for US$250.  \n [http://vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/\")  \n [http://www.klim.co.nz/national\\_samples.php/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/www.klim.co.nz/national_samples.php/ \"http://www.klim.co.nz/national\\_samples.php/\")\n\n/ / / / /\n\nMoney matters\n\nThe good news: The US$ has hit a record low against the Euro, meaning that licensing type at Village has never been cheaper for our friends overseas. For example, the Newzald or National families, at US$250, convert to Û165. Remember... Our dollar is weak but our types are strong!\n\nThe bad news: To cover the increased costs of silkscreen printing and shipping supplies, we are raising the prices of our posters by US$5, effective March 1. We hate to do this, but feel that the posters are still a pretty great deal.\n\n/ / / / /\n\nThanks for everything.\n\nChester & Tracy Jenkins  \nVillage  \n206 Front Street #4A  \nBrooklyn, NY 11201\n\ntelephone ++1 718 852 1005  \nfax ++1 718 852 1006\n\n[http://vllg.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302001928/http:/vllg.com/ \"http://vllg.com/\") / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n",
