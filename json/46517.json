Usual time [6:00 p.m.] and place [Jupiter Lounge, 124 - 10th Street NW, in Kensington].\n\nNo set agenda, so I think it'll just be an informal get-together to share a few pints and maybe discuss what's happening in the summertime. Topics might include the upcoming Calgary Stampede, The Hockey Night in Canada theme, Calgary without rain, etc. We'll also probably talk about type.\n\n",
