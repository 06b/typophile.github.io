  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm designing a poster for a concert taking place in Sydney, Australia and wonder if there is a typeface or font that feels representative of the city or whole country. Something whose shape could work with those of the Sydney Opera House (egg shapes, with curves) would be ideal. So far I've tried Sydney 2ooo and Merrivale, which was based on a late Victorian shopsign in Melbourne. However, I'm not in love with either of them.\n\nSuggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Thanks for the recommendation of Lisboa, but think I need something that's display and decorative. Something that looks hand-lettered would be great, along the lines of what Methane Studios does:\n\n[http://methanestudios.com/category/dave-matthews?item=6141](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025423/http:/methanestudios.com/category/dave-matthews?item=6141 \"http://methanestudios.com/category/dave-matthews?item=6141\")\n\nThanks very much for your reply. It's also helping me to hone in on what I'm really going for!\n\n"
