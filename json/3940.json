  "content": "Hi All,   \n   \nI'm developing a logo for a Marketing Community website called marketshare. The logo will be mainly for website use, but may appear on the back of textbooks. Type is set in Horatio EF, ITC Avante Garde Gothic and the exclamation point is set in Albers-ArchiType.   \n   \nI'm worried that the Avante Garde (logos on the left & bottom) is a little too business and not enough fun. I also find the \"s\" to be a little condenced compared to the rest of the letters.   \n   \nI like the logos using Horatio (logos on the right) but I'm wondering if they look a little too mid 70's retro.   \n   \nAny comments would be appreciated.   \n   \nThanks!   \n ![marketshare logos](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524130005im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3153.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "ymmy. I like the horatio. Simply because it gives your mark more of it's own look, makes it more unique. This grl likes the flat color as opposed to the blends. I like the top left one the best, but with the horatio instead of avant garde. (or) I like the middle one, sans blend, sans white stroke, but \"share\" in gray. I'd flop the shape so the speak balloon point (thingy, sheesh!) is more of an entry point as opposed to an exit point. ((what a muck of a crit!)) Nice\n\n"

I think that grey colour looks great with the green, but I don't know if you can work it into those two or not.   \n   \nI like both fonts...I don't know if one is any better than the other, but they do have slightly different feels, and you'll have to evaluate them along those lines.   \n   \nPaul D\n\n"

      "content": "I like any of the ones with the name inside the speech balloon. I am concerned, though, about what might happen to readability if this were printed much smaller or sloppier, as usually happens in a phone book or newspaper ad; or if it's embroidered on a t-shirt or ball cap, as marketing people love to do. The e in both Avant Garde and Horatio could easily close up. I looked at some possible substitutes � Agenda, Avenir, Cronos, Eagle, Futura, and Myriad � but only Eagle and Futura have the simpler one-story a, which works well in your design. Hmmm... guess it all depends on how it will be used.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the feedback guys.   \nThe client has gone for the safe choice and picked Avante Garde. They also went for the logo within the large word bubble.   \n   \nUnfortunately they weren't big fans of the color scheme, so I have to do some exploring in that direction. The l/c \"s\" in Avante Garde is still really bothering me so I think I will play with it a little. Does anyone else agree that the \"s\" looks a little on the thin side?   \n   \nI don't think the logo will be reproduced at exceedingly small sizes so I'm not too worried about the \"e\" closing up, but thats a great point Christopher.\n\n"

So maybe don't let it bother you - chances are it only bothers type geeks anyway... And maybe it's crying out to be morphed into a dollar sign in some future application?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
