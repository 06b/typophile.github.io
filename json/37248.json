I realise there are significant restrictions on segment shape etc in order to maintain readability.. just wondering if anyone had dealt with anything similar in the past?\n\nAny ideas, leads etc are most welcome...\n\nCheers.\n\n",

Here's an [example](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021021109/http:/au.nixonnow.com/watches/mens/the-connect-A069.html) that's heavy on the segments..\n\n"
