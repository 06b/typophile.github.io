  "content": "howdy y'all!!!   \nI was looking at Reader's Digest Merry Christmas Songbook this holiday season and became riveted on the letterforms in question. I'm wanting to make a digital version of this font, but I can't find the full character set. I bought the Solotype Catalog and they're all in there, but I'm afraid they're not good enuff for me to just scan and use, unless I want to spend a lot of time on each letter. I guess that Hermann Ihlenburg created this type and and this design belonged to American Type Founders (I mighta got that name wrong) for a while. If anyone can suggest how to go about finding more printed samples or even acquiring an original set of the metal type, I would appreciate it.

But that's also a facsimile, so it won't be the best quality.   \n   \nAnother way would be to track down an actual ATF specimen book, but an early one: I suspect the famous 1923 edition doesn't have this font. FYI, the Lawson book is based [mostly] on the specimen of 1896.   \n   \nA third approach is to see if this was ever made available as a phototype face (shudder), although procuring specimens of such would probably cost you something.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I don't know the situation in Phoenix (I guess your closest \"college town\", unless Flagstaff has something), but if you can tap the help of a college friend he can do what's called an \"inter-library loan\" for you on virtually anything. Purchasing: if you get lucky like Nathan, great - keep your eyes open, but don't expect something to just fall in your lap.   \n   \nContacting Dan Solo: it shouldn't be too hard to track him down. But I have a feeling he won't be much help sans cash. BTW, how lousy is the repro in the solo book? Do you have a hi-res scan handy? Just a few glyphs will be enough to tell. And one other thing: the sample would have to be _extremely_ high quality for you to avoid \"spending a lot of time on each letter\". And the fact that this was a metal face means that _no_ sample is going to be extremely good anyway... One thing you could do though is go for the \"rough look\".   \n   \nInfo about ATF: You might start by reading the restrospective in issue 43/44 of the American Printing History Association journal: [http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/current.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830001118/http:/www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/current.html)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "You're so right! I had thought of pointing out some of the things that were missing but reckoned you'd work 'em all out for yourself. Boy, what you've got so far on that PDF file is miles ahead in precision. The serifs on uprights are completely different and it's rather difficult to work out from the example of the original which of you is right. One thing I know is that I can't wait for you to get your version finished. I've tried out Secesja on projects and it's much too unstable to trust. I want yours (and soon!)   \n   \nI've just been looking at sBob's Nymph, by the way - an extremely free variation which takes its beginning from Nymphic. I'd always wondered how it got that name but assumed it was because of the rash of fairy fonts that were appearing back in the 1990s - WSI's Fairy Scroll Display, for instance. It looks like you're set to be the Prospero (and to hell with bloody old boring Gandalph) of the new Millennium.   \n   \nThe other near approach is Dave Nalle's Acadian, which he made for Scriptorium in 1994. The letter forms are close in certain instances but his source is different from yours. The note reads _Source material from the type collection of Steve Saxe. Original design by H.H.Thorpe (1883)_. Now that raises a bit of interesting history, doesn't it? Even in those days folk were copying from and improving on one another's work. Is there a history of this aspect of fo(u)nt evolution, do you know?   \n   \nMb\n\n"

The ball on the falling swash of the C is just one case in point... I'll post some scan comparisons tomorrow so you can see what i mean. anyhow, the short answer to your question is yes, the ball serifs should be standardized (as much as possible) but i don't believe all of them were the same even in the original font... like i said i'm just trying to stay true to Hermann. for now this project is just more of a learning experience for me as i'm not eally an \"xpert,\" just a novice here. This is actually my first attempt at trying to put a font together. (this weekend i was trying to teach my self how to add open type features and was moderately sucessful!) maybe someday if i ever get the polish just right on this one i'll try to realease it for marketing or something. i'd love to hear your other questions though! i've got a question for you, since you're a perfectionist (like i try to be) what do you think of the mismatched spurs (take a look at the C, G & S) Some i've rounded off and some are still sharp on the ends. do you think that detracts from the design? anyhow, thanks for your input.   \n   \nAnyhow, I was looking at some information that somebody originaly gave me that tipped me off on the designer of this font and it says that this face originaly belonged to a foundry named MacKellar.
