  "content": "In FL5 (Mac Version for me), one of the fonts I am working on has developed a strange habit. A light blue line ghost suddenly appears when I move a line segment. I find it annoying. I assume it is a \"feature\" that some people like. I have never purposely turned it on and would like to know how to turn it of before it drives me crazy. I tried preferences but can't seem to find it or figure out what it might be called--perhaps \"The Blue Shadow of Christmas Past\"?\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nChrisL\n\n",
