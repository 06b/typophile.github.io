  "content": "Hello:\n\nI am looking to get some help with identifying the typeface in the attached image. The image is a screen grab from Jean-Pierre Melville’s _Un Flic_ and appears around the 17 minute mark (if anyone is interested in seeing the sign in context).\n\nMy gut tells me that the sign is hand drawn and that there isn’t a typeface of such design. I’ll be happy with getting something similar as a foundation for basing my own hand drawn version on.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n- jacob\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [french\\_type.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503184932/http:/typophile.com/files/french_type.jpg) | 37.72 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) \"There Will Be Blood\" distressed blackletter - Kraut-type-a-fuck {Andrew J Sipe}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503184932/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42493 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) 'plain text' font in TextEdit - Monaco {Florian} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503184932/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42696 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
