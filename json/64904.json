(It didn't stick around much in later editions of their specimen book, however, although one other one had a light weight of that typeface. The different weights had different names.)\n\nI finally found this page\n\n[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=634](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131013925/http:/kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=634 \"http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=634\")\n\nwhich discusses the different names under which this font was kept alive: a digital version now exists under the name Mephisto.\n\nApparently, the version Ace Books used for their small-format pocket book editions of the Venus and Pellucidar books by Burroughs (as well as other related books) was called Alexandra, and provided by a small company called Photo-Lettering, according to that article.\n\n",
