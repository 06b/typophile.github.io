  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nI'm kind of stumped on a technical issue here, and was wodering if anybody could help.\n\nI'm trying to wrap up my first font, and it has some alternates, like so:\n\nfeature calt {  \n sub [fshort lshort] l' [b f h k l] by l;  \n sub [fshort lshort] f' [b f h k l] by f;\n\nsub l' [b f h k l] by lshort;  \n sub f' [b f h k l] by fshort;\n\n} calt;\n\nIt also has some oldstyle numerals:\n\nfeature onum {  \n sub zero by zero.onum;  \n sub one by one.onum;  \n sub two by two.onum;  \n sub three by three.onum;  \n sub four by four.onum;  \n sub five by five.onum;  \n sub six by six.onum;  \n sub seven by seven.onum;  \n sub eight by eight.onum;  \n sub nine by nine.onum;  \n} onum;\n\nWhen I test my font in Illustrator CS3 at home, it works file; I can use the OpenType panel to use my alternates, and when I select Proportional Oldstyle I get my oldstyle numerals.\n\nBut, in Illustrator CS at work, the alternates button is disabled and selecting different figure options doesn't do anything.\n\nI'm using FontLab Studio 5.0.2 for Windows, if that's important.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n",

Without those first two lines, it's short-short-short-normal in FontLab, which looked kind of funny to me.\n\nThough... I just tested that in Illustrator CS3, and it's doing the short-short-short-normal thing. I'll have to fix that...\n\n"

      "content": "AFAIK, Illustrator CS and CS3 have essentially the same OpenType support. Mind you, there will have been some bugs fixed in there somewhere.\n\nI understand the net effect of the code, but the first two lines of substitutions take l and f and replace them with themselves. In any case, the latter two lines are completely adequate to achieve the desired effect if you just want the letter styles to alternate. If you wanted to get the shortened form to repeat, then you would need to chain the letters or write the code differently.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

I should probably read more about how this stuff works.\n\nBut, I finally requested the 5.0.4 patch, so maybe that will make FontLab and Illustrator behave consistently, at least.\n\n"
