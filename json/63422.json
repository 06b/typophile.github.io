      "content": "The blockage has nothing to do with the font source -- well, almost nothing. It's a default warning for any \"downloaded content\".\n\nIt seems to me this font doesn't really comply to accepted font standards -- the Windows Font Property Viewer can't find any of character/unicode info, version, creation date/time, font face and family name, copyright, or anything. However, checking with more advanced (cough) software reveals at least _some_ of this information, as I noticed its default name consists of Chinese characters. Its \"PostScript Name\" is shown as \"By JOSSQ-DMF in BeiJing\", which is definitely a 'what-the-h\\*!?' (PostScript names do not allow spaces).\n\nAll of this may, or may not, be the problem.\n\n"
