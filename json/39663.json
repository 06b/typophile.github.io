  "content": "Hi all,\n\nDon’t know if this is the right board to be posting this – it isn’t strictly a ’Type ID’ question, but others seem to have started similar topics here so I guess I’m in the clear.\n\nI’m working on a book cover which takes (adapts, really) its title from an old, pulpy/poorly printed boys adventure book called “Tom in the Andamans”.\n\nI’m looking to set the title for the book in a similar face, but it looks to be a hand-lettered job.\n\nSo could anyone suggest equivalents or near-matches for the type in the attached sample? I’m more concerned with the parts of the title in caps, less so the italics. The off-centre O and swash on the S are of particular interest.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015160704im_/http:/typophile.com/files/andamans-typesample_4704.jpg)\n\nA little worried that not much like this will have been digitised to be honest, but it’s worth a try...\n\nCheers,  \npat\n\n [‹ font ID plz. the word 'Financial' in this logo pic.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015160704/http:/typophile.com/node/39676 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Round letter E - safety and software ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015160704/http:/typophile.com/node/39667 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
