Most of them only offer Examples of typefaces, but very few are giving background informations.   \nMaybe you know more. :-)\n\n",

      "content": "Hey Tiffany and everybody else, thanks for replying. :-)   \n   \n\\>Does Wim Crouwel's book have a bibliography?   \nNo, he doesn't. He mentioned though some names that i will look after. But there are not many that are so consequent like Wim Crouwel.   \n   \n\\> What other typefaces do you consider modular?   \nLIke H�ctor Mu�oz Huerta and Nick Shinn indicated, there are many different grids for modular typefaces, technical or graphical. If you have a look at Albrecht Dürer's \"Konstruktion der gotischen Minuskel\", you will see that he used grid and modulars to explain or reconstruct a written typeface.   \nFrank Blokland explained in his classes for calligraphy the construction of the \"humanistische Kursive\" and the \"karolingische Minuskel\" and if you want to see it this way, the single stroke of a pen can be seen as a modul.   \nWhat i am trying to say is, that only the grids changed over the years, but the idea of modular typefaces exists for a long time.   \n   \n\\>Do the designer's of these typefaces have books which they have written?   \nIs there a source in the net that can be used for this kind of research? Google drives me crazy with all the informations that i did not ask for.   \n   \n\\>Have you looked through magazine indexes?   \nJust through the one of Eye, but the search function did not found anything about this theme.   \n   \n\\>Does modularity in typeface design belong strictly to modernism? Or does it flow into post-modernism as well?   \nI think modularity and grids are inspired or based on technical inventions. The grids of our time are based on horizontal and vertical measurements, but the grid of the \"karolingische minuskel\" was based on handwriting, means the biological conditions of our hands and on the possibilities of a ink pen.   \n   \nSo, i am looking for modular typefaces of all times and their backgrounds. I am also very interested on the further use of this typefaces. Were they used aswell for ornaments or illustrations?   \n   \nI just know one person that did this. Juan Trochut Blanchard, a catalan typographer.\n\n"

Like you, I don't think it's a good idea to have a very strict formal-structural benchmark.
