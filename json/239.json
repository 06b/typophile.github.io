Now that I've had the   \nchance to double-check the Vintage Type samples,   \nit dawned on me that my previous post proved to   \nbe pretty pointless _(howzat for an alliteration? ;) )_.   \n   \nI hoped you would find a match amongst them, but   \nalas, no such luck. There must be more worn-out   \ntypewriter fonts, but once we get off the beaten   \npath and enter the realm of free/shareware, it gets   \na lot tougher to locate the goods.   \n   \nLet's hope somebody else recognizes your sample...\n\n"
