This usually involves taking an idea that is in a rough form and working it up into something that looks professional - or A designer gives me a sow’s ear and I make a silk purse out of it if I can :^), as was the case with the Reliance logo. Although it didn’t quite work in this case - I think it looks a bit weak, and dare I say a bit tacky.\n\nI didn’t make Precious Sans for Reliance, in fact I didn’t know they were using it until this morning. And no, I haven’t been asked to produce a Devangari style of it. I think it would be beyond my capabilities anyway.\n\nIs Reliance the Indian equivalent of British Telecom? (or whatever) - If so, I haven’t noticed any increased licence royalties that one might expect for a company of that size. :^(\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
