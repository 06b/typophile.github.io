But Q is always followed by a U except in Qatar.\n\nJust a thought... If you shortened the left serif on the capital J, or the right serif on the capital L is shortened, or if you randomized the lengths of the serifs on the capital I then anarchy would ensue. As minute as they are they provide major clues to the “divining (reading)” process. This is lost in SANS. God forbid we should play with the height of the cross bar of the H. Hi would become III. Well, sort of.\n\nCan you imagine if we equalized the height of the X and Y. Pure bedlam!  \nThe sky is falling!\n\nLong live the serif!\n\nMichael\n\n [‹ Pennsylvania Primaries - Vote Today](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907015231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44523 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Letterhead Fonts and their battle ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907015231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44314 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
