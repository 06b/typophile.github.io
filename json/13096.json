(search broken?)\n\nI'm contracting for Autodesk and as insane as this may sound, NO-ONE I talk to in the marketing \\_or\\_ graphics dept knows what font is used in Autodesk's new logo [seen here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219143827/http:/www.autodesk.com/) in the top left corner of the page.\n\nAny help in determining the font's name is GREATLY appreciated.\n\n",
