  "content": "Any cheap alternatives to Gotham? I only need a few bold capital letters, so I am not gonna pay all that for the few letters i need.  \nI found a lot, such as Sackers Gothic, but most don't have that 3 with that flat head, so to speak.  \nColin Samuels has though: [as you can see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150313163307/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/samuelstype/colin-samuels/).\n\nAnd free alternatives are even better! It's just a small gig, but i need the Gotham look, not for the trend sake of it, but because it fits  \nthe image of the company (traditional painter's company) so well in this case.\n\nThanks for all your help.\n\n",

So that's a big difference in price there.  \nSure I could charge this client for this font, but he doesn't even understand (like most people out there btw) that fonts need to be paid for as well. I only need to slightly adjust the logo a bit and choose this as the secondary typeface in that logo, next to the main typeface from the old one.. and it's only a small paint company.\n\n"
