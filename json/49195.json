Then I started sewing from the central signature in that way (red dashed lines are when the thread is _inside_ the signatures)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/retch_1_4007.gif)\n\nThen when I reached one side I made returned toward the central signature and continue sewing until I reached the back of the book\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/retch_2_5498.gif)\n\nAnd I returned back to the central signature where i stopped making a knot\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/retch_3_6479.gif)\n\nWhen I finished with the upper part of the book, I made the same thing, with another thread, for the lower part. When I reached the end in the center of the book, I close the thread, like the other, with a knot and then with another pair of knots I joined the upper and lower threads (I don’t know if you _really_ need to do that.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/retch_4_6118.gif)\n\nI show you the resulting book (not so nice, I’m not very careful when I do that kind of things):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/typ_spine_5225.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/typ_center_6394.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201080611im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/typ_open_5092.jpg)\n\n",
