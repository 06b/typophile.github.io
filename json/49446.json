Stop Photoshopping every damned thing you can into a silhouette. Just because you know how to create a mask with the pen tool and tweak it with your Wacom tablet doesnâ€™t mean you should. Tell the client to stop being a cheapass and hire a Photographer to shoot against something interesting.\n\n",
