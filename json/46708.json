  "content": "Hey everyone,  \nI’m looking for some new or interesting display serif fonts for editorial (mens magazine). I have been using Freight display and looking to try out something new. I love the simplicity of freight and cheltenham, and perhaps there are some new ones people have in the works or could suggest? Many thanks! Also, one with a lovely italic set would be fantastic!\n\nthanks,  \nnick\n\n [‹ Contact info for Judith Sutcliffe?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204120620/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46754 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Research for Hamilton Mfg.
