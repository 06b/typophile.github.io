Calligraphic (pen) scripts would be in Part 4. You might find something that fits what you are after in those pages. Fonts from [Art & Sign (Signfonts.com)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231133608/http:/artandsignstudio.com/fonts.html) and [Sign DNA](http://web.archive.org/web/20071231133608/http:/www.signdna.com/v2/index.php) are often overlooked, and they are good sources of hand-lettered script font styles. (Use the Script Font Reference List to look up the suppliers.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "The earliest group of the SignDNA fonts do look like digitizations of some photo-lettering scripts, but there are many others too. In some cases the reason they look familiar is that the lettering was done by men who did lettering for the photo type companies, or who have done lettering commercially for years. I also think it is fair to say that there is/was a certain ’commercial sign script style’ that was widely used, in which legibility was more important than individual style, and where stroke thickness and slant were the main parameters for variation. Look through the Solotype Catalog pp.88 - 106, if you want to see what I mean.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
