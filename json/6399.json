Here is another face I've been playing around with. I am experimenting a little bit with process here. I think to be good one has to master the medium (or at least learn to work with it). For ex. while the stone has a lot to do with what the letters on the trajan column look like, the masons were in control of what was going on. My medium, in this case the bezier curve, often masters me. (how many clunky s's do we need to do before we can get it right?) That being the case, I decided to do a face without using any geometric crutches (circles, squares, etc.) or duplicating any parts of letters. It's still a sketch right now, and is just a lineale (sp?).   \n   \nSome of the letters are still pretty lumpy. I'm trying to decide where the roughness is working and where I need to apply a little more polish. I'm torn on the Q. It could be really cool or completely off. (it could be a bit less lop sided for sure, but is the tounge working or not?).!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",

The replication of   \nglyph parts has been done. Adding a human,   \norganic, hand drawn touch to a text font isn't   \noften done - and when it is done, it rarely works.   \nWhen it works, it's usually a design based in   \ncalligraphy (Zapf) or brush forms.   \n   \nBeezer is something new. It reveals clearly the use   \nof computer-based tools, but the human touch is still   \nevident. I'm interested to see how the quirks affect   \nthe font at small sizes (Flash doesn't exactly allow a   \ngood view of tiny type). I'd also love to see more of   \nthe Brush style.   \n   \nMy favorite glyphs: \"a\",\"g\",\"l\"   \nGlyphs that make me extra glad: \"a\",\"g\" of Bold Study   \nThe glyph that makes me sad (and might benefit   \nfrom a more conservative approach): \"G\"   \n   \nI think those letters with more gradual curves work   \nbest. The sudden kinks of the \"G\", \"K\" \"R\" and \"Q\"   \n(oops, was I supposed to ignore that?) are   \ndistracting and mar an otherwise clean design.   \n   \nFocusing on gentle curves still leaves room for your   \nhand-massaged expirimentation and I think it works   \ngreat on those glyphs I mentioned.   \n   \nNoting the method and the preview sample, I predict   \nthe Bold style will be the star of this family.   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

Many many others have tried to introduce/adopt such iconoclasm in type design, but 99% have failed.   \n   \nChristian, I think you're really onto something here. Those sporadic but tempered quirks in an otherwise docile   \ndesign really work, to my surprise. Maybe put a spin on the UC \"Y\" as well? But it would have to be non-calligraphic.   \n   \nIt seems to me that the biggest difficulty in such an unorthodox design is to avoid over-rationalization, and trust your instincts. But at the same time don't fall into the \"artiste\" trap that renders a font unusable.   \n   \nAnyway, go all the way with this!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It all started with the lc f, who's shoulder ended up a straight line (a happy accident). I wanted to apply that same feeling to some other characters, hence the lc a, the uc G and even the Q (which has grown on me over the past few hours, though it will definitely be refined).   \n   \nOh, I thought I'd explain the name. I had a high school teacher who (while she explained Aldus Freehand) thought bezier curves were called \"beezers\".\n\n"
