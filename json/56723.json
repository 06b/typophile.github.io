  "content": "Hi all-\n\nCan't help but feel I'm just having a mental block, but after much searching nothing has surfaced for this type, found on all boxart for New Wave Films' DVD releases in the UK: it shares characteristics with Gotham (Hoefler) and Akzidenz Grotesk (Berthold), but it's distinguished by unusual characters such as the cap-Q in this image. Anyone care to shed a little light?\n\nCheers,  \nNick\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055404im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quietchaos_4418.jpg)\n\n",
