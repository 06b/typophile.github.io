      "content": "Hi Thierry,\n\nI take it that you are specifying from a cmyk breakdown to a solid (screenprinter, for instance) colour. You will not get a very accurate pms colour by this route (note to designers, specify PMS colours that are fairly similar in cmyk breakdown, this also means that you have to invest in a cmyk book).\n\nFor future reference, get a proof of the 4-colour solid for matching in future (just tell the printer to match the colour - you know about type - you can’t know about everything).\n\nNext time you print some stationery for this client, print yourself an inch square of the colour for matching. The reason is that Pantone® colours can actually be reverse matched closer by eye than by formula.\n\nHaving said that, have a look at pms 7468. Not a bus ride out, and I’ve been cheating colours all my life. Maybe even consider changing the corporate colour to 7468 (a rather sophisticated “French Blue”) to obviate future chit-chat.\n\n"
