I'm seeking typefaces related to the past 100 years of history for the Accounting profession and CPAs. Any fonts used in historical ledgers, bank statements, checks, currency or any related topic will be much appreciated. Please don’t let the specifics listed limit your response.\n\nThank you,  \nMOCPA\n\n",
