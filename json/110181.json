The Victorians loved to make Tuscan fonts like Lu's example with amazing amounts of ornament and encrustation. Michael Hagemann's digitizations are well engineered and have a clean look not found in most other digital versions, which are usually autoscans with little editing. It is possible to prune some of the ornamentation to make something more streamlined. Kills the authenticity, but might be suitable.  \nDon\n\n"

Seems to me that maker of the old font in the image and Monogram Fonts Co. designer Brian Bonislawsky may have both based their typeface designs on the “Pearl” letterset of 1854 by George J. Becker, cited by Monogram as their source.  \nBecker's Pearl:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140405043544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BeckerPeal1854SM_6437.jpg)\n  \nA digital version of Becker's Book is available at archive.org  \n [https://archive.org/details/ahn2554.0001.001.umich.edu](http://web.archive.org/web/20140405043544/https:/archive.org/details/ahn2554.0001.001.umich.edu \"https://archive.org/details/ahn2554.0001.001.umich.edu\")  \nA final word. Tuscan designs like this were a dime a dozen circa 1850. Other designers could have independently created something virtually identical using one of the various Tuscan design formulas then in use. But the Monogram digital is probably the closest we will find to a digital version of the image.  \nDon \n"
