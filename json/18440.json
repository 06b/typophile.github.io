  "content": "I need to find a condensed sans that works reasonably well with Adobe Garamond. The sans face will be used in small size (about 6 to 7 points) inside a CD cover booklet so legibility and line length is an issue.\n\nI like Storm's Sebastian, but it's too wide.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",

      "content": "I haven't studied the music too deeply because I have quite strict guidelines how to lay out the booklet; it has to look like a previously published song book - same graphics and all. So, almost no real creativity is allowed.\n\nThe song book featured Adobe Garamond for both titles and lyrics, but now I have to cram the same texts in a cd booklet and need a suitable sans typeface to that.\n\nMy staple choice News Gothic just didn't feel right for the job.\n\nStephen, FF Quadraat Condensed looks definitely interesting, the shapes and proportions have a \"garamond feel\". What worries me is that the regular weight looks a bit dark on the screen, considering it's going to be printed in a very tiny size (The booklet is propably printed on a coated stock, that of course helps a bit)\n\nTiffany, I don't know how I forgot DynaGrotesk, I have it even installed on my computer... I have to run some tests.\n\n"
