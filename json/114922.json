Note for example the median spurs -- found in many wild west fonts --and the foxtail terminals There are some fonts that catch some of the flavor of the lettering. For example, Exocet by Jonathan Barnbrook [http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=95](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=95 \"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=95\") and the Dogma movie font, a fan effort as Avqest [http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest \"http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest\"). Also some other fonts by Jonathan Barnbrook, including Mason [http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=104](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=104 \"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=104\") and Jeremy Dooley's Newcomen  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/newcomen/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/newcomen/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/newcomen/\")  \nDon\n\n"

Definitely custom (and by [St Bernardine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.stbernadine.com/clients/evil-spirits-distillery)).  \nReminds me also on construction this [previous discussion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/typophile.com/node/114413) too: initials /E and /S from one side, /V, /I, /L, /P, /R and /T (cross-shaped) from the other.  \nFor initials and rather using a /3 instead of a /E: I like [Billhead LHF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-billhead-1890) and [Letterhead](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead); Adding also [Appleton DTF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/decadetypefoundry.bigcartel.com/product/appleton-font), **[Midnight Show](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/creativemarket.com/Aditsaputra/15306-Midnight-Show-typeface)** (possibly my best \"out-of-the-box\" solution), [Stanley](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/creativemarket.com/twicolabs/21073-TM-Stanley), [Countryroad](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/countryroad.php) and [Sly](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/creativemarket.com/twicolabs/15341-Sly)  \nFor the rest: [Long March](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/creativemarket.com/Aditsaputra/13450-LongMarch), [Midnight Show](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fcreativemarket.com/Aditsaputra/15306-Midnight-Show-typeface) (again), [Ambrosia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ambrosia.php), [Cavalero](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/cavalero.php), [Dickinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/dickinson.php), [Euphoria](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/euphoria2.php) (good candidate cleaning up all flourishes), [Firehouse](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/firehouse.php) and [Iron Horse](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415001414/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ironhorse.php) (good option too mainly because of glyph x-height)\n\n"

In addition to EVIL SPIRITS It shows a full uppercase alphabet. This is simply a set of Tuscan Roman letters. In the context of the label I expect that these are Ouija board letters.
