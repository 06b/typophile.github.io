It's kinda like busorama\n\n[http://www.lendaproducts.com/graphics/letstyle/busor.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043836/http:/www.lendaproducts.com/graphics/letstyle/busor.htm \"http://www.lendaproducts.com/graphics/letstyle/busor.htm\")\n\nyep.  \ncheers (anyone?)\n\n",

He was one of that crowd of early 1990's freeware/shareware typeface digitizers (Rakowski, Rick Mueller, Mike Allard, etc.). You'd send him the shareware fee and he'd send you Marbold. I, too, am unaware of any other digitization of Marvin.\n\nIndeed, the quality is not the greatest - but surely the font making tools at that time were rather primitive.\n\n"
