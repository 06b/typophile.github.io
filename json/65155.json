      "content": "Hello, Paul-\n\nIt's \"Close, but no Cigar\", because in small point sizes you might confuse it with American Typewriter, but at closer look you'll see it's totally different.\n\nThat was the idea behind Suomi Slab; to have those Clarendon features, so prominent on (in?) American Typewriter, but to go as far away as possible from the round, polished and slacking forms of American Typewriter.\n\nAnd thank you for your comment. I'm pretty proud of this one.\n\n"
