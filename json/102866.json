  "content": "After almost seven years of putting it off the time has finally come to assemble a portfolio and stationary etc. Over the last few months I've been looking at a number of typefaces to use for 'branding' myself so to speak and have almost certainly settled on Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed Light and Regular.\n\nThe things I love –\n\n- The vertical sides to the C, D, G, O and Q characters.\n- It's subtly square–ish appearance (for example the bowl on the P and R characters).\n- The straight diagonal leg of the R character.\n- It's history and heritage.\n- I love condensed fonts.\n- It is very utilitarian and simple.\n\nThe things I do not love –\n\n  - The inconsistencies between weights – between light/regular and medium upwards, some of the characters change completely (B, J, K, Q, R at first glance)\n  - For a personal project it's pretty expensive (You can't buy individual weights).\n\nWith this in mind, I just want to make sure I'm not overlooking any alternatives. I've looked at Tungsten and Knockout from H+FJ, Univers Condensed, DIN, Trump Gothic by Canada Type – all of which have some aspects that I love, but there is usually something I really don't like also.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015233im_/http:/typophile.com/files/akzidenz_6225.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [akzidenz.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015233/http:/typophile.com/files/akzidenz.png) | 98.71 KB |\n\n",
