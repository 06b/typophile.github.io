If you mean that the fish is sharper / more detailed / more clearly defined, then yes, but to my eyes that doesn't make them mismatched (not in execution; not any more than a fish with anatomical details would have to be different from semi-dissolved floating junk).  \nAnd funny that you see the cross in the \"a\": It's in the font, and I was going to remove it because I thought it was too obtrusive/visible, but the client liked it as a semi-hidden mini-reference to the fact that this blog is written from a specifically Swiss perspective. :)\n\n"

I do however appreciate the discussion; I'm aware that I'm breaking some conventions with this.\n\nThe fish is not: «a logo»; and it's also not a piece of punctuation that happens to be shaped like a fish, sort-of matching the style of the rest. That's primarily a fish looking at that crap and wondering. He's also shaped like a question mark, because he's wondering. (The fish could maybe be described as a «mascot» for the blog, if a word is needed.)\n\nPiecing the fish together from junk would be wrong conceptually. The fish is inherently something else than the junk. They still inhabit the same design space, at least to my eye. The friction between them is the friction that _must_ exist between fish and junk, which by the way isn't always clear-cut: For instance, fish eat this micro-plastic trash (when it's red or orange) because they think it's shrimps.  \nSo I don't think the 2 elements can really co-exist quite «harmoniously» – not even contrasting enough to be nicely harmonious again! This entire thing is meant to be slightly off-harmonious at second glance. There is micro-friction, and there are little contradictions, and that is deliberate. It's part of the message.\n\nTo me it does work, just not exactly the same way as such logos/graphics often do. And if it were more conventional, more clear, more balanced and comfortable (not that I honestly believe it's _that_ jarring!), I believe that might well make it prettier, but likely also worse at conveying the message I need it to convey.\n\n"
