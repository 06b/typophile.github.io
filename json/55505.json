In this case you could easily set up a very simple naming how-to or chart by yourself, and you would not even need to mention the Preferred Family/Style name fields since these could be left empty.\n\nGood to see the FLS5 Font Family Naming document back online! I hope the others too will be available soon.  \n(Adam, I notice the new terminology including \"Typo Family Name\" and wonder why you don't stick to FLS5's and AFDKO MakeOTF manual's \"Preferred Family Name\". This better expresses what you mean.)\n\n"

AFDKO does so since a long time. This is not a matter of words but of conception.  \nThe only thing that I do not like is the term \"typographic\" -- everything we do is \"typographic\" somehow, so the term doesn't say anything, like \"black\" does not help to distinguish one kind of liquorice from another.\n\nKarsten\n\n"
