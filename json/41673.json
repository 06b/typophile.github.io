It was printed by Giovanni Capella, and the publisher Einaudi has a Turino address. It was printed in 1945.\n\nthanks Eluard.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317205523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Quasimodo005_6212.jpg)\n\n",

I tried using it after doing it the hard way, and Estienne was one of 59 possible choices, just using 7 characteristics from your sample. Most of them are obviously not good matches, which you can see at a glance. The only trick is that there is no short sample of Estienne, because there was no digital version for me to use to make one, so you have to open the full sample to look at it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

That's my case: I've got the MacOS and the Win Type 1 and TT version of the Einaudi Garamond font which includes also CE set and SC (known as Garamond-100) but obviously I can't distribute it.
