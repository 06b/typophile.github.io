I was wondering if anyone knows of a free font out there that has all the math symbols you'd typically find in an equation editor like MathType.\n\nIf no one knows of anything I can get for free, is there a low-cost option out there that might do? I don't want to spend a ton of money on this, simply because I don't think I'd use the font all that much other than for the design for this particular course.\n\nThanks for any information you can provide,\n\nStevie\n\n",

It becomes all the more important if you use matrices or large integral symbols and so on.\n\n"
