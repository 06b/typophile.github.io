  "content": "Hello type wizards!\n\nDoes anyone recognize the attached sample’s name. It appeared in Julia.uk.com’s project for the Arika film festival. I’ve often admired it from afar, and decided to have a closer look at it. I know they’ve produced custom faces in the past, so I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this was custom too. I feel like I’ve seen it elsewhere though… or something very similar. If you have any suggestions, I would be most grateful.\n\nThanks in advance.  \nGordon\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828224642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Arika_5458.png)\n\n",

Already familiar with a few of them, but a few newbies to add to the wishlist if the chance arises. I’m convinced I’m gonna invest in Brandon Grotesque one of these days, and get my money’s worth within weeks for it.\n\nThank you!  \nGordon\n\n"
