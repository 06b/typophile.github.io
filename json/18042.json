The Glasgow fonts were reworked by Schäfer and extended to include three widths each of six variations plus dingbats. The strength of the family lies in the innovative manner in which the three widths, two ascender heights, two descender lengths and dingbats can be combined. The results are striking and offer a unique way to create emphasis in a sentence or even within a single word. The expert sets also include a large selection of ligatures that represent the most common letter combinations in English, German and French. With FF Govan type setting becomes type sculpting.\n\n"
