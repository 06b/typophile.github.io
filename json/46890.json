The codebase is antiquated and it’d be a dumb business move on Adobe’s part.\n\nCuttle...I agree, though I imagine they’ll keep that for themselves as a ’force the hand’ way to cross-grade companies to illustrator.\n\nFor a real open source alternative, there’s inkscape:\n\n[http://www.inkscape.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821122113/http:/www.inkscape.org/ \"http://www.inkscape.org/\")\n\nHas a long way to go, but is an impressive app.\n\n(And thanks for the link to MNteractive!)\n\n"
