  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have just finished building out a website, based on a wordpress theme. I am quite happy with it but when I have asked for comments from people, a number of people have said that I should change the font in the top menus as the current font doesn't stand out well enough against the bright backgrounds. I was hoping somebody here could give me some advice on what type of fonts would look good in this situation.\n\n[This is the site](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720003302/http:/newthaihotels.com/)\n\nThank you\n\n",

      "content": "Hi -  \nYes the thin white font is not very legible, but it is still possible to read. I do not know how much control you can have over the colors and font, but if you do you can try making the fonts **BOLD**. The html tag may be 'strong'. If that does not solve the problem, try to play with the colors:  \nEITHER make the menus background a shade darker, OR use a very dark red (instead of white) for the font.\n\nIn the black and white menus under the title \"Hot Hotel Openings\".  \nAlso make the fonts **BOLD** , and try to use a larger font size. Try using a light yellow for the font instead of white.\n\nGood luck\n\n"

      "content": "I can read the ones with the colored backgrounds okay; the ones with the gray backgrounds (further down the page) are a little harder for me. But if you're getting negative feedback you obviously need to consider that. You might try upper & lower case heads (rather than all caps) and then bump up the size a bit.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you. I went with Monserrat and cabin as a fallback. I also increased the font size slightly and changed from all caps to lower case except for the first letter of each item. I also changed the long menu item name \"announcements\" to \"news\" to give the whole menu more breathing room.  \nI think it looks a lot better. For the drop downs I maintained the uppercase and increased the size a bit.  \nAlso, I changed the color and increased the font size of the city names on the grey tabs in the \"Latest hotel openings\" section in the middle of the page. I think it looks a lot easier to read.  \nThank you for your suggestions..\n\n"
