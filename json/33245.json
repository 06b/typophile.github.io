I was just reading a thread in the design forum a few minutes ago, and had to give up because one the the frequent poster has an animated icon under his/her name. Interestingly it was a thread about art vs. design. The Art side may say he is entitled to use animation, but the design side says doing such a thing makes it impossible to read threads where he has posted. The animation is continually pulling my eyes away from the thread, ten times a second (or so).\n\nWhat do others think?\n\n",
