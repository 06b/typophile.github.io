Since the file's PDF was exported from Adobe Illustrator, the font's information is not available in the properties...\n\nIf there needs to be more information regarding this then I will be more than happy to add it. I suppose the next resource I could turn to is to contact the card designer him/herself (...though the card was made over a year ago).\n\nThank you!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n No \n\n",
