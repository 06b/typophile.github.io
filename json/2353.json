They also do international events and release cd compilations.   \n   \nYou can have some info here : [http://www.mutek.ca/](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126075538/http:/www.mutek.ca/)   \n   \nRegarding this logo, I believe that it's not made from a font. It was originaly created a couple years ago by a local designer and has been very slightly modified every year using a special grid.   \n   \nIt may be inspired form a font, but I can't say which one.   \n   \nI'm not 100% sure about this answer. I hope someone will be able do confirm what I say.   \n   \nGood luck,   \n   \njf\n\n"

I attend Mutek shows every year but I didn't have the chance to see you performing.   \n   \nNow, about the logo...   \n   \nTo answer your original question, I contacted a friend of mine that is working on the graphic design for Mutek 2004 (probably not the whole thing, but a part of it). He then asked his boss who said that he slightly changed the logo himself last year... not using a font but using a grid. I agree with you that the logo always looked like that, but I believe that there have been some minor changes.   \n   \nBut again, I don't know who is the original designer. He/She might have been inspired by a font.\n\n"
