  "content": "Hello to all members.   \nMy first post here. Discovered this forum just a week ago and I'm already hooked to it.   \n   \nI've been asked to design a magazine for a local newspaper. The content of this special issue will be about companies that have succeeded in business through the added value of design in their products. (Mainly industrial design, but also graphic, packaging, etc)   \nMy intention is to show also that the use of good typography can improve a lot the readability and the user experience.   \nI need a good combination of fonts for body text and headlines. Till now I've been using Rotis Semiserif for headlines and Univers Condensed for body text (I know is a bit weird but they give me always a LOT of text to fit in every page, and is the only way to deal with that)   \nI don't want to do like other \"design\" magazines that put unreadable microtext in futuristic fonts. I want to use some modern looking fonts but they must be readable... and affordable for a small studio too :-) so please don't say the one that I'd love to try but I cannot afford.   \nIf I find a nice combination that reflects this, it's even possible that we can write an article explaining that to illustrate the whole process.   \n   \nThanks in advance for your kind answers,   \nVicente\n\n",

      "content": "Nice icon.   \n   \nIt's great that you're concerned a lot with readability, but remember that this special issue is specifically about Design - so I think your display font at least should be \"self-conscious\" in this respect. The trick will be finding a text font that has \"attitude\" but remains very readable.   \n   \nI'm partial to wedge-serif fonts, and the other day I saw a magazine cover using Alias's Key really well. For a text companion to that you could choose a bunch of things, like Swift or FF Olson. Whitman might be nice too although I think it's a bit too \"soft-spoken\" for this, I think.   \n   \nBTW, narrowness isn't always more economical, because a wider font can be set smaller while looking the same size as a larger narrow font. It depends a lot on your column width and frequency of linebreaks.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the info Hrant!   \n   \nFinally found Key in Veers webpage. Seems a nice choice, only concern would be about its width. Do you think it can be a problem?   \n   \nSwift it's a nice font. But too expensive for this project and maybe I'd never take real benefit of it (Hey, I'm sure that it deserves its price).   \n   \nFollowing the style you suggested, I discovered Corel's Humanist 712 Slabserif BT in my vault. Do you think that can substitute Olsen? Or maybe it loses the \"swifted\" serifs that make Olsen better for this application?   \n   \nAll the best   \nVicente   \n   \n   \nPS Any chance you send me a scan of this cover magazine, so we can get inspired for using Key typeface?\n\n"

      "content": "\\> only concern would be about its width.   \n   \nI guess it can be a problem sometimes - but I have virtually no experience _using_ fonts so I'm not sure. Maybe James (Montalbano) can help.   \n   \n\\> Humanist 712   \n   \nThat might be a good compromise, although it's kind of a \"hybrid\" slab. Some people might feel its retro vibe, but that can be good too these days. But anyway, don't choose a slab/wedge font because _ **I** _ like it. If you decide to go with Key however it does make sense.   \n   \n\\> send me a scan   \n   \nHey, I try to limit my purchase of magazines that I'm _interested_ in, much less something that just has a nice cover! :-) But I'll try to find what magazine it was so you can track it down. I do remember that Key was used to set the name of the magazine, and it was a short name, with a \"k\" in it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
