My wife and kids and I love to go to a town called Leavenworth in our home state of Washington. It is a Bavarian (German not Swedish) town that is up high in the mountains. It is about as close to the Alps as I will get anytime soon. This font just reminds me of the fun vacations we have had up there.\n\n[http://www.leavenworth.org/modules/pages/index.php?pageid=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123033729/http:/www.leavenworth.org/modules/pages/index.php?pageid=1 \"http://www.leavenworth.org/modules/pages/index.php?pageid=1\")\n\n-Charles\n\n"
