Doing whatever those people do.   \n   \nIf anyone uses stock photo - or works for a company who uses stock - feel free to get in touch with her. Her name's Karen Mendlik & she can be contacted on her cell: 773.454.2280.   \n   \n[Disclaimer: The views of the company promoted above are not necessarily those of Nathan Matteson. Nor should it be implied that he likes their photos.]\n\n",
