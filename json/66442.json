I confess that I was unclear whether that was meant as an endorsement of the new approach (which includes a weight between Regular and Bold), or whether your use of the plural ‘weight_s_’ was a criticism of the new scheme (because it does not include \\*multiple\\* weights between the two).\n\nDB seems to have understood the comment in the second way, asking you how many you think there should be. Your response seems to imply that his interpretation was right — although, I’m further uncertain whether your use of the term Demibold means that you think there should be another intermediate weight different from the Semibold, or whether you’re using that term interchangeably, or whether maybe you mean a Demibold should fall between the Bold and the Black weights.\n\nSo, I offer the waterfall to see if you do indeed think an extra weight should be added between the Regular and the Bold (in addition the Semibold).\n\nJust to be clear, the Bold in the Pro development is the same as the original Bold.\n\n"

A couple of months before that I had bought a single weight of a particular font from Type Culture. He told me that it piqued his curiosity because it was unusual. The usual thing was for somebody to buy a complete family.  \nNow, I'm basically interested in using fonts within browsers, so what the heck am I going to do with all those weights? Hell, with some fonts, I even like the browser-synthesized italic better than I do the created one.  \nAnyway, as time goes on, expect to sell more singles and less albums.

That will only lower the value of the product, that's a golden rule in retail :D\n\nI think it makes perfect sense to be expanding the Classic Internet Headline Typefaces now that services like Typekit are about to take off.  \nAbout to! A big problem is still the fact that most computers connected to the internet don't have an effective anti-aliasing engine (i.e. Windows XP: Although ClearType (Microsoft's Anti-Aliasing) can be voluntarily turned on and will make Headline typography look considerably nicer, you get things like radio buttons malfunctioning and other bugs) but I think that under the rough condition of aliased type, Verdana Condensed is likely to look less ugly than FF Dax or other 'print typefaces'.
