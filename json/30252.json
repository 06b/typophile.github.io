      "content": "Hi Dan,\n\nIf you are near a good library (can't remember where you are in school) see if you can get a copy of Richard Zakia's book about Gestalt theory and visual perception. It's been many years (uh . . . like maybe twenty!) since I read it but I LOVED it at the time! A couple of years later I even sent Prof. Zakia a photo that I'd found, which I thought perfectly illustrated one of his points. Although much of what he discusses has to do with photography, the book's scope is wider than that. Just a suggestion. (As if you didn't have enough to read already!)\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Perception-Imaging-Second-Richard-Zakia/dp/024080466X](http://web.archive.org/web/20121018071549/http:/www.amazon.com/Perception-Imaging-Second-Richard-Zakia/dp/024080466X \"http://www.amazon.com/Perception-Imaging-Second-Richard-Zakia/dp/024080466X\")\n\n"

I was playing at a friend's house, and at some point I noticed his mother had a small wood block placed on her TV as a decoration of some sort. The block had flat geometric sections removed from it- just like in that same image above, but with a low profile wooden base that kept the remaining pieces connected together, if I recall correctly.\n\nI stood there silent for quite a while, just gazing away at this curiosity- it was so abstract compared to the other decorations in the house. I was pretty fascinated with it, it reminded me of something out of an Escher book.\n\nMy friend, who is wondering why I'm just standing there staring at a wood block, realizes I don't see it for what it really is, and fills me in: the negative space of the block spelled out \"J-E-S-U-S\". It suddenly became clear as day, and I was so mad at myself for not being able to see that :P\n\n"

When short viewing time/motion is involved you have to make sure it can be read.\n\nFor printed/web media: maybe use it as an attention getter for a header/intro to a layout of text, but I still wouldn't use it for a logo, not to that extreme at least. It gives an optical illusion/psychedelic vibe that I don't think many companies would want in their logo- which is their identity.\n\nThere might be better examples of the theory than this one.\n\n"
