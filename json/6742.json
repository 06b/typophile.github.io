I have put a bunch of LEDs under the glass bricks and have started doing trcks with them.. but the grid of blocks is 4 high (by 16) so fonts are really tough..   \nDoes anyone know of a resource where i can see the most efficient way of making fonts with only four pixels high...? I supose I could turn the thing around and do 16 high (by 4) but you would have to turn your head... Someone told me Wim Krause made one up at the beginning of computer time.. Any help would be greatfully received..   \nP.S Check out the giant 3d sculpture I just made if youre interested..
