  "content": "Can anyone recommend a shop that makes plates for photopolymer letterpress in Europe (the closer to Switzerland the better)? The two shops I keep reading about are both in the US. There must be something like that on this side of the Pond too, right?  \nIf possible (and if I get to be picky), I'd likely prefer a place that makes the plates and also offers the printing itself, to reduce overhead / shipping costs / time.  \nThanks for any pointers!\n\n",

(I've only really heard about photopolymer letterpress in English, so I'm actually not sure what the proper German term is.)\n\nPS. Good luck next week-end!\n\n"
