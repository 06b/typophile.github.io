  "content": "Hey guys,\n\nsorry if this has been asked in the past, but i wasn’t really sure what to look for.\n\nIn an attempt to clean up my font library, i have come across a problem i have never been able to figure out. I have a handful of fonts that are all displayed as different typefaces, when they could all potentially be under the same list.\n\nAs an example...\n\nMy Akzidenz-Grotesk shows up in FontBook and my apps in a big list of separate typefaces. So it shows up as Akzidenz-Grotesk, Akzidenz-Grotesk Extra, Akzidenz-Grotesk Light, etc....\n\nIs there any way to combine these together so they just show up as a single Akzidenz-Grotesk, and then in the menu next to it i can pick bold, light, medium, or whatever. Here is a screen shot if that is confusing...\n\nThanks a bunch!\n\nJosh\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 10.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162908/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2010_3.png) | 210.66 KB |\n\n [‹ Font Manager Recommendations for OSX Leopard?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162908/http:/typophile.com/node/49975 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Adobe FDK autohint -a \"Assertion Error\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162908/http:/typophile.com/node/50431 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
