A separate font is a bit of a hassle in everyday use, but I’m not too keen on trying to improve on Slimbach.\n\nIt has been suggested I should use open source fonts for just the IPA characters, but — as you rightly remark in your other thread — these IPA characters appear in otherwise regular phrases. Admittedly, an alternative would be to set the entire text in the same (open source) font. (Not that I have that option, realistically.)\n\n"
