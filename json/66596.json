  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI'm rather new here and have to say that I an so thrilled to have found this community. It's fabulous to have someone to talk to about type. Most of my friends eyes glaze over if I even say the word :-b.\n\nI'm working on a logo for a client that supplies the jewelers trade. I fell hard for Priori Acute and have them in love with it now as well. I am now in the process of determining the font pairings and thought someone might have an opinion.\n\nI'll be setting a tagline as well as their name spelled out in full. Can't use Priori Acute for the full name as it will often appear small, for invoices and the like, and the sculptural beauty and playullness of it disappears at smaller point sizes.\n\nThe Eras Medium in the tagline is merely a style placeholder. I want something that supports the type above, but does not compete with it. something perhaps a bit approachable... any thoughts?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014233923im_/http:/typophile.com/files/8_sfjs_logo_dev_3704.jpg)\n\n",

Priori Acute was designed by Jonathan Barnbrook, you can read his comments about the ideas behind the design here:\n\n[http://www.webstandardistas.com/2010/01/priori-acute.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014233923/http:/www.webstandardistas.com/2010/01/priori-acute.php \"http://www.webstandardistas.com/2010/01/priori-acute.php\")\n\nStephen - I tried it and didn't care for them together. Too period. I'd like a lighter, complimentary effect.\n\nHrant - I thought to stay away from serifs, though that was what I tried initially, because though I tried several it seemed a bit over the top. The Logotype is such a strong persoality, that I am thinking perhaps to compliment it with a sans.... I'm looking at Advert Light [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff\\_advert\\_light/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014233923/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_advert_light/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff\\_advert\\_light/\")\n\n"
