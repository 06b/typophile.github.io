      "content": "Overall, I'm fond of it Phil and enjoy the Hatch/Rural Concert Poster look to it. I would say one of the fonts you've selected really doesn't work as well as others in the poster.   \n   \n\"DON'T MISS OUT!\", \"See Samples . . .\", \"Call Today w/ number\", and \"Phil Foss\" are all in a Gill face or something similar and make the poster look like you didn't follow through to get the look consistant.   \n   \nI'd recommend replacing that face with the one used for \"DESIGNER\" or a Clarendon of sorts.   \n   \nYou may also consider further distressing the elements in the poster as well as printing it on really heavy uncoated paper and sending it flat. I've had success with this technique for some mock Font Diner Airlines Luggage Tags I send out with one of my sets.   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

      "content": "While I'm fond of the genre that you're drawing upon for inspiration for this poster, I would comment that it seems a bit much. Why not reduce the number of typographic elements (for example, removing \"pro designer\" and/or \"performing live every sunday\") and focus instead on really tightening the overall composition with less typefaces.   \n   \nYou also might consider more overprinting, which can really add to the aesthetic.   \n   \nIf you're planning to actually print these, I've had some success actually separating the plates and printing them separately. For example, if the poster is red and black, print all the red first, then load the paper back into the printer and print the black.   \n   \njb\n\n"

      "content": "I keep waiting for a design brief that lends itself to just sending off the copy to Hatch Show Print in Nashville, and get them to post me back the finished job, reading for scanning.   \n   \nI did a bunch of research into ephemeral woodtype poster printing here in Ireland (just as it was dying out), and was delighted to stumble across HSP in 1990. It's become something of a little industry since.\n\n"

      "content": "Go down to a shipping or stationary store and buy yourself a roll of brown package wrapping paper. They come in rolls about 3 feet wide, and make for a great cheap solution, although you'll need to flatten the paper before running it through a printer.   \n   \nAnother alternate cheap paper source is printers masking paper, available by the roll at most hardware or paint stores.   \n   \nHere's a few samples, run through a black&white laser printer.   \n   \n ![tori](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071135im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/881.gif)   \n   \n ![paper](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071135im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/882.gif)   \n   \njb\n\n"
