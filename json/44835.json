There's a copy [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005958/http:/www.freeflightdesign.com/pdf/TO_1-1-4.pdf) (5 MB PDF). For Navy and Marine Corps, it's MIL-STD-2161(AS).\n\nHowever, USAAF (US Army Air Force) specs would date back to WWII or earlier and might be hard to find. There are probably WWII enthusiast web sites or news groups that could help with those.\n\n"

      "content": "You're welcome, Elliott. I did some more research this morning (anything is better than working), and found an earlier manual that was on the street in 1941, although the available copies are from the 1949 revision. The manual number is TO 07-1-1, \"Aircraft Camouflage, Markings, and Insignia,\" and copies (US$15-$20) can be bought at:\n\n[http://www.eflightmanuals.com/detail/itemList.asp?cID=4528](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005958/http:/www.eflightmanuals.com/detail/itemList.asp?cID=4528 \"http://www.eflightmanuals.com/detail/itemList.asp?cID=4528\")\n\n[http://www.esscoaircraft.com/product\\_p/16427.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005958/http:/www.esscoaircraft.com/product_p/16427.htm \"http://www.esscoaircraft.com/product\\_p/16427.htm\")\n\nThere's a book titled \"Usaaf Aircraft Markings and Camouflage 1941-1947\" that's on [Amazon](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005958/http:/www.amazon.com/Usaaf-Aircraft-Markings-Camouflage-1941-1947/dp/0764302469), but it's US$58.\n\nWikipedia has [an interesting article on WWII aircraft markings](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005958/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_identification_aircraft_markings) (the color bands and unit insignia), but it doesn't cover the lettering.\n\n[This site](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103005958/http:/www.tlai.com/med_des/modeling.html) has a number of geometric aircraft fonts that look pretty authentic.\n\n"
