  "content": "Attached is a screenshot of the recent Quark 7 Beta which display of type leaves Adobe in the dust. Quarks interface however remained in the late 1980’s though. The only ray of light of it’s interface is the multi pane window allowing for viewing master pages and their impact on the actual document pages, or multiple levels of zoom for your current page.\n\nLike Adobe, Quark failed with the font picker, engineer’s laziness or dumb oversight call it what you want. In any sane application I just hit CMD + T and get the system font picker with all categories I set up. For example I create a folder in FontBook for each current job containing all the fonts for the job in question. In Adobe apps and Quark XPress I just get a mile long list, duh - how stupid can one be?! I just don’t see the point in deactivating fonts - WAKE UP ADOBE, it’s 2006!\n\nThat said, my layout application in the last few months was almost exclusively Apple Pages, to which I had to add a baseline grid “feature” to make it work for me. Only used InDesign for one deal where the template was in InDesign format already.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Quark Font 3 pane.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905055720/http:/typophile.com/files/Quark%20Font%203%20pane.png) | 206.82 KB |\n\n [‹ Steelers Headed to the Superbowl Type :-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905055720/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17465 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Design Books ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905055720/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17709 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The outlines are much more crisp, but the edge of, say, the large lowercase e looks very oddly angular and not as round as I know Warnock Pro is.

We want to be able to get the same results on both major platforms.” Certainly that would be my initial thought if somebody brought up the question internally. (BTW, why are you only angry at Adobe and not Quark on this point? Are your expectaions inherently lower for Quark or something?)\n\n<cite>The only ray of light of it’s interface is the multi pane window allowing for viewing master pages and their impact on the actual document pages, or multiple levels of zoom for your current page.</cite>\n\nThat’s a fine feature.

Why they don’t join forces in this is beyond me. Probably a pissing contest.\n\nThing is that it’s not easy to do that for ALL fonts and currently the only ’global’ anti aliasing method that really works is ATSUI and even that I’d consider as the lesser evil, we’re not there yet. I should add that I read about 98% of my content on-screen. PDFs with Preview.app because Acrobat hurts my eyes.\n\n"

It’s just generic grayscale rendering, 1/4 pixel quantization on subpixel positioning, baseline integer aligned, no hinting, no gamma.\n\nSo at the small text sizes, you have some crisp and some fuzzy vertical stems, more or less randomly distributed. Most so-called advanced rendering techniques try pretty hard to at least get the vertical stems consistently sharp.\n\nOf course, plain and simple isn’t always bad. The fancier techniques can indeed introduce visually displeasing effects. Could you post a comparable screenshot from CS2?

      "content": "I analyzed these, and here are my results.\n\nThe Quark and Pages renderings are technically identical. The histogram of grayscales matches the native Quartz renderer, but I’m not knowledgeable enough to tell the difference between, say, ATSUI and CGContextShowText.\n\nCS2 looks like an updated version of the same renderer used for Type1 fonts in Acrobat 5 for Linux (you can see samples of that, as well as some others, [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905055720/http:/levien.com/artofcode/fontfocus/compare.html)). The histogram shows 16 peaks, suggesting a bitmap rendering at 4x the screen resolution, followed by a downsampling and a gamma of approximately 1.25. Since the rendering is darker than that of the Quartz renderer, I suspect that there is some thickening going on, either by using the any-part-of-pixel rule when drawing the 4x bitmap, or when hints are applied. Most characters have two instances, and you’ll notice that typically either the left or right edge of a vertical stroke is aligned with the pixel grid. The result is slightly more consistent contrast on vertical strokes, but with only two subpixel instances to choose from, spacing is going to be a bit uneven.\n\nCS1 is a botch of some kind. It looks like running TrueType hinter and then applying subpixel offsets to try to even out the spacing. Why CS1 looks like TrueType and CS2 looks like Type1 is something of a mystery. Maybe there’s some font substitution going on (the CS1 rendering is so distorted it’s not easy to rule that out), or perhaps Adobe has ported their core rendering engine across both formats since the last time I looked at it carefully.\n\nIn any case, although Quark 7 kicks CS1’s butt in the font rendering, I think it’s only fair to compare it to CS2, in which case the difference is more a matter of personal taste. CS2’s is a little more contrasty, but Quark/Pages definitely has smoother spacing.\n\n"

But is there is one thing on which legibility experts agree — and it may be the only thing —, it is that high contrast is the key to sustained readability. Put quite simply, there is a reason why books are printed in black ink not mid-grey ink, and a good reason why every single literate culture in the world has developed black pigments for use as the standard colour for text.\n\nPersonally, I don’t think any of the rendering examples shown in this thread are even close to good enough for continuous onscreen reading. But then they’re not really supposed to be (with the exception of Raph’s FontFocus example?): they’re preview text for page layout applications, and their purpose is to provide an _image_ of the text in the context of layout. Given this goal, the best way to judge the type rendering is set beside the same applications’ handling of image previews. When you look at a page of mixed text and image in a layout app, what matters most is that you have an accurate relative relationship, so you can make judgements about the whole design.\n\n"
