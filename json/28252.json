I’m just wondering if this is a non-issue in terms of licensing, copyright and so on. What are my obligations if any? What do other people do in this situation? what do i need to know? any help would be greatly appreciated,  \ncheers\n\nNick\n\n [‹ Looking for typeface with Gaelic feel](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200053/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28260 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Appropriate use of small caps ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200053/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12543 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
