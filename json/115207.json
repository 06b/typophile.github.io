  "content": "ReType Foundry proudly introduces Laski Slab, a comprehensive suite of 20 fonts conceived for editorial purposes. The type family was designed by Paula Mastrangelo, an Art Director with extensive experience in editorial design specialized in corporate communication. Originally developed for an online children’s magazine, Laski was expanded into a multipurpose type family with the technical assistance of Ramiro Espinoza.\n\nBelying the intrinsic robustness of the slab serif genre, Laski’s humanistic construction and subtle calligraphic details lend it a friendly appearance. Round, open letter forms and generous horizontal proportions make it easy to read. The regular weights perform impeccably in text sizes, while the bolder versions produce expressive and very effective subheadings and headlines. Two idiosyncratic stencil variants considerably expand Laski’s creative potential.\n\nLaski Slab is a suite of feature-rich OpenType fonts fully equipped to tackle complex, professional typography. The character set includes 5 sets of numerals, small caps, fractions, alternate characters and case-sensitive forms. Besides standard Latin its extensive character set supports Central European, Baltic and Turkish languages.\n\nLaski Slab received a “Certificate of Excellence” at the 2014 Tipos Latinos Biennale.\n\n[Visit Laski Slab at ReType](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230331/http:/www.re-type.com/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230331im_/http:/typophile.com/files/laski-newsletter-news_4224.png)\n\n",
