  "content": "Hello, colleagues. We, at Intellecta, are proud to announce Invitation Script, a modern and clean revival of the classic work of the Portuguese master penman Manuel de Andrade de Figueiredo, whose work can be seen in “Nova Escola para aprender a ler, escrever, e contar (...)'' (1722)(see footnote). Invitation Script is the third script superfamily published by Intellecta Design, after Penabico and Van den Velde Script.\n\nInvitation Script has original letters designed by Iza W. Creative direction and core programming were provided by Paulo W. Chyrllene K assisted with some work on unusual and archaic styles, resulting in a special font - Invitation Script Archaic (soon available).\n\nInvitation started out from Andrade’s script style and evolved into a voluptuous script font family. The result is a typeface ideal for beautiful headings, signatures, art work typography, titles and short\n\npieces of hand-lettered text. Invitation family includes two multi-table Opentype fonts, three supplementary fonts for ornaments and fleurons, and the Archaic font with some of the Andrade’s original characters.\n\nEmbedded in the regular fonts are additional sets of letters. Over 40 variations are available for certain letters via the Special Sets Opentype table.\n\nThe two regular versions of Invitation Script contains the following:\n\n(i) An extensive set of ligatures providing letterform variations that make eye-popping designs or simulate real handwriting. These are accessible via contextual alternates and other open-type features.\n\n(ii) Many stylistic alternates for each letter (upper and lowercase, accessed via the glyph palette, encoded in the ranges of the Special Set Opentype feature).\n\nSince there are over 1100 glyphs in each font, we suggest using the glyph palette.\n\n(iii) A set of ornaments and fleurons accessed with the glyph palette or using the Ornaments feature. Additional ornaments can be found in the two Invitation Script Ornaments fonts.\n\n(iv) Initial and final letters with artistic variations accessible using the initial and final form open-type features.\n\n(v) Major kerning work: over 6000 kerning pairs, hand-set to avoid collisions and to create intricate combinations of letters, using swashes and other resources.\n\nThese powerful features are all accessible in InDesign, Illustrator, QuarkXpress and similar software. We recommend exploring the magic of this font using the glyph palette.\n\nOur sample illustrations and PDF brochures showcase the power and pizzazz of this calligraphic script. Let your imagination go wild and use Invitation Script in ways that Andrade could not have foreseen.\n\nIn non-OpenType-savvy applications, Invitation Script is still an exceptionally beautiful calligraphic typeface that stands up to the competition.\n\nThe regular fonts contains the complete Latin alphabet, including Central European, Vietnamese, Baltic and Turkish, with a full set of diacritics and punctuation marks.\n\nSEE THE ENTIRE FONT AND ITS FAMILY AT MYFONTS - [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/invitation-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025713/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/invitation-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/invitation-script/\")  \n---  \nfootnote  \nFIGUEIREDO, Manuel de Andrade de, 1670-1735 Nova Escola para aprender a ler, escrever, e contar. Offerecida á Augusta Magestade do Senhor Dom Joaõ V. Rey de Portugal. Primeira parte / por Manoel de Andrade de Figueiredo, Mestre desta Arte nas cidades de Lisboa Occidental, e Oriental. - Lisboa Occidental: na Officina de Bernardo da Costa de Carvalho, Impressor do Serenissimo Senhor Infante, 1722. - [18], 156 p., 44 f. grav. a buril : il., ; 2º (31 cm)Engraved royal coat of arms supported by angels over the city of Lisbon, engraved portrait of the author (both of the foregoing by Bernard Picart), (12)ff., 156pp., engraved calligraphic section title, 44 engraved plates. Wood-engraved culs-de-lampe and lettrines. Sm. folio. “Andrade de Figueiredo was born in Espirito Santo, where his father was Governor of the ‘Capitania.’ The fine portrait is dated 1721 and is showing Figueiredo at the age of 48. He was an eminent calligrapher and a creator of the Portuguese handwriting until the reign of Don José I (ca. 1755). His work follows the style of the great Italian masters in its use of clubbed ascenders and descenders, and of Diaz Morante, the famous Spanish writing master, in its very elaborate show of command of hand. By his contemporaries, he was known as the ‘Morante portugues’” (Ekström). “Ce livre est un manuel, composé de quatre parties, destiné à apprendre à lire, à écrire, à conter ainsi que l’orthographe. Les planches comportent des examples d’écritures, d’alphabets et de textes ornés de remarquables traits de plume exécutés d’une main sûre et enjouée” (Jammes).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Invitation Script.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025713/http:/typophile.com/files/Invitation%20Script.pdf) | 1.37 MB |\n| [InvitationScript Two.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025713/http:/typophile.com/files/InvitationScript%20Two.pdf) | 1.94 MB |\n| [Invitation sCRIPT -OFICIAL BANNER.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025713/http:/typophile.com/files/Invitation%20sCRIPT%20-OFICIAL%20BANNER.png) | 207.01 KB |\n\n",
