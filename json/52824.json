  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm commissioning a font design for a Finnish higher education facility of 10k students that will be launched in 2010. Things are still in an early phase but progressing quite rapidly next year.\n\nI'm looking for a skilled font designer / font foundry to design a custom type face. Possibly two, sans & serif. Work should be done between February and May 2009. Although we're looking for quality, price plays a role as well (surprisingly).\n\nIf you are interested or want more information contact me at: jussijokinen at iki dot fi\n\n",
