  "content": "Has anyone heard of a term _other_ than \"dot\" for the dot that occurs above the lower case i and j?\n\nI've been asked if there was an \"official\" term and I know of none.\n\nPerhaps we can invent a new \"official\" term. Then we can claim special knowledge of it.\n\nAnd to make this even more open-ended, I want to pass along the fact that here at Megacorporation, the registration mark is commonly referred to as an \"R-ball\". For some reason, however, a copyright symbol is not referred to as a \"C-ball.\"\n\nKristin\n\n",

For another thing, \"tittlelessi\" looks like the name of a Greek or Bulgarian cheese I could buy at Spiro's up there on University Avenue.\n\nI had not bothered to see who made that first post until I saw Ricardo refer to \"Megacorporation.\" Then I knew it was you.
