  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm redesigning my personal webpage which consists mainly of a blog on energy policy issues. I'm an academic by day so the content is fairly serious but I try to keep it readable and `fun' (as fun as energy policy can be). The redesign is also part of a wider project to design a standard look for all my professional stationary (letterhead, reports, and so on).\n\nFor the body text of these documents, I've decided on Adobe's Chaparral Pro. It's got a nice reliable look to it but it's not as serious as more traditional academic publishing fonts (e.g. Palatino). However for the web page I'm a bit stuck.\n\nObviously Chaparral isn't a commonly installed [browser-safe font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219021816/http:/www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html) and I can think of a reason for using almost any of the three alternatives:\n\n1. A serif: serious, academic, reliable, all that good stuff\n2. A sans: well-set it can look trustworthy and perhaps it's good to be a bit more relaxed on the web\n3. A monospace: Lucida Console or Courier echoes the shape of Chaparral to some extent, but probably inappropriate for longer posts.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n",
