  "content": "I am currently putting together an exhibition for a gallery in the UK of poster design from around the world. Though the posters for the exhibition are all contemporary, I've been fasinated by many older posters too.   \n   \nThe posters of Bachs (see picture below) are fantastic, and his work was something I was never aware of.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110041921im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/41240.jpg)   \n   \nAlso Wes Wilson, I had never come across his name before but now Iam rapidly building up a collection of his posters via ebay...   \n   \nAnyway, I wondered who your poster hero's are...\n\n",
