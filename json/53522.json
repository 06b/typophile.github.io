Though the posters clearly communicate what I chose, I will tell that sex education was my topic.\n\nThe two sides are abstinence only education and comprehensive education. Both posters are directed at the middle school-high school kids, the age groups that are most effect by decisions made on sex education. I created the type for my abstinence only poster by setting it first in Illustrator, printing it, and - using my handy dandy light box and pencil - drew out the type to give it the hand-drawn effect. The looseleaf is real, as well. For the safe sex poster, I wanted to really appeal to what those ages groups think is 'cool.' So I drew from the faux-silkscreening, tattoo imagery style that's so prevalent in current fashion, as well at the purse icon styling in the background. The type was also created using the aforementioned technique, but I used a darker color to allude more to graffiti styling. 18 x 24 dimensions each.\n\n",
