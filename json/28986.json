I have chosen to create/predict the future of fonts ; by which I mean which fonts will be popular for what purposes : serif or sans serif ? multiple weights of single fonts ? limited fonts ? decorative scripts and typefaces ?\n\nAlso looking at the transformation of fonts into visuals in billboards and advertisements and the changed use of fonts due to the reduction of viewing time people are willing to spare to read written material.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the future you foresee...\n\nThank You !\n\n [‹ large vs small type sizes for body copy- legibility](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213729/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28764 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Letters Carved in Stone ( Photos ) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213729/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28953 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

For example OpenType-like technology making organic, hand-rendered-like-quality, multi-colour/texture typography more accessible. Also look beyond flat rendering to what you can do on with a 3D printer. Also see where e-ink, and other low power, refreshable, large format, paper-like displays may take us.\n\n"
