To my eyes, and I’m only up to the Mm’s in the sans serif section, it looks like they sort of pseudo mono-space it and cross breed it with Courier.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n [‹ Lead type as luggage?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122101523/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48274 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [... recommendations for monospaced block sans-serif typefaces with full cyrillic alphabet...? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122101523/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48341 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "When I produced a typeface for a private client a couple of years ago, I supplied them with an ’office’ and ’book’ weight. As cuttlefish suggests, the office weight was designed to be used on office reproduction systems, while the book weight was intended for offset printing. The intention of providing two weights was to try to counteract the darkening effect of lower resolution printers to achieve a balance of blackness between office reproduction systems and offset printing (the low-res ’darkening effect’ is a result of the ’rounding-up’ of the printers rasterizing software). I also sold the client with the suggestion that the office weight would (somewhat negligibly) use less ink/toner and therefore would save them money etc..\n\nAnyway, I think you grasp the idea, but what I wanted to add to this post was that a few months after I had signed-off the work to the client I was showing the design to a fellow designer who asked whether I had based the character widths and spacing for the office weight on Times New Roman. I thought this a bit strange at the time, but maybe this could explain the ’pseudo mono-spacing’ and condensed forms?\n\nmike\n\n"
