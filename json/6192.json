I would suggest   \nusing an IRC client rather than going through   \nthe web/java door at   \n [http://www.freewebz.com/typesmith/chat.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803091113/http:/www.freewebz.com/typesmith/chat.html).   \n(It's a bit buggy and slow.)   \n   \nThere are many free IRC clients for Mac and PC.   \nHave a look at   \nhttp://www.versiontracker.com   \nor   \n [http://www.windowstracker.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803091113/http:/www.windowstracker.com/)   \nor   \n [http://www.download.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803091113/http:/www.download.com/)   \n   \nStephen\n\n"
