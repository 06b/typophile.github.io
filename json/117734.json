It looks familiar, but doesn't match any of the common sans serifs with multiple weights.\n\nInternational is too small to make an accurate ID.\n\n"

In case of \"INTERNATIONAL\" you have to expand them i.e. increase the letter's width.\n\nAs Bob said, I'm the software engineer behind **[Find my Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112540/http:/www.findmyfont.com/)** application. Find my Font identifies the fonts of an image, either fonts you have on your PC or fonts included in our Online Database.  \nOPTI/Castcraft is not yet in our online database but we'll add it at approximately 15 days (on our next major font-database update).\n\n"
