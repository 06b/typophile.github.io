It’s the smaller “dotted” one I’m after –&nbsp;”CALL FOR APPLICATIONS / JAN VAN EYCK POST-ACADEMIC INSTITUTE” etc. Spacing/fitting of the dots looks too good to be done with dotted lines in Illustrator.\n\nThe scan is from p86 of Phaidon’s _AREA 2: 100 Graphic Designers, 10 Curators, 10 Design Classics_, and it is the work of Dutch designers Cobbenhagen & Hendriksen.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n( [Here’s a link to the attached sample, just in case –&nbsp;not sure how attachments show up here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042418/http:/typophile.com/files/typeID_2.jpg)).\n\nCheers,  \nPat\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [typeID.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042418/http:/typophile.com/files/typeID_2.jpg) | 199.32 KB |\n\n [‹ hey, anyone know what this font is?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042418/http:/typophile.com/node/47912 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Curly script monogram font found on embroidery sites - custom {Mike Y} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042418/http:/typophile.com/node/47879 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
