I think the top bar of the F needs to be closer to the vertical bar to help visually join the two. I've attached a couple of suggestions of what I mean and how I would improve it. Apologies in advance for the very crude butchery method i've employed to illustrate my ideas!\n\nHope this helps?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201114433im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FS_ambigram_6166.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201114433im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FS_ambigram_1_5669.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201114433im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FS_ambigram_2_6606.jpg)\n\n"

The choice of type - soft and smooth - is spot on for a momentous event.\n\nI am agreeing with WhitePepper about the F. The 'im' could be tweaked to a different form of 'a'. Below is an example (tried to show only the 'im' solution but got caught up with the design itself, pardon me.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201114433im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fiona&simon_6144.jpg)\n\nnagfa\n\n"
