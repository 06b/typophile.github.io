At the moment I'm only sure about St Brides but lighter suggestions are very much welcome too.  \nThank you,  \nAkos\n\n",

You can't access the reading rooms without a pass, but the exhibition halls are well worth a visit (more focused on manuscripts than typography, but with some truly stunning and culturally important stuff on show), and the shop usually has a good collection of type-related stuff.\n\n"
