  "content": "Sorry if this topic has been discussed to death before.\n\nTypophile.com has a Type ID Board, which, I suppose, was designed to be the place to post Type ID Questions. Spam aside, that's largely what goes on there. There's also a General Discussion Forum and a Design Forum, where Type ID Questions appear rather frequently too. You can't blame the posters for that: the former Forum says 'Anything goes', and the latter deals with 'A to Z, and everything in between'. Still, to some – at least to me – Type ID Questions feel misplaced outside the Type ID Board.\n\nSo how about moving the Type ID Board to the topmost place in the Forum Menu? That might be just the way – and an easy way too, I'd figure – to have most Type ID Questions ending up in the Forum they really belong.\n\nBest,  \nBart\n\n",

So putting it at the top seems to make sense. However from watching the ID section intently for the past few weeks I can attest that: it's so busy that it makes the rest of Typophile look secondary; there are often quite shady font recommendations, which we are not even allowed to confront...\n\nSo I ask, what's worse: being mildly annoyed at seeing a misplaced ID request (and the ensuing awkward silence) which however a moderator -or other kind soul- can certainly help out with; or having IDs -and especially shady answers to them- take over Typophile (even more)?\n\nHere's my own \"solution chain\": if we can enforce a ban on ID requests across the board, let's do it. If we can't or don't want to: enforce higher ethical standards in the ID section\\* and/or annex it so that: people who have a high regard for type designer rights don't have to watch; and people looking don't think Typophile is for bottom-feeders.\n\n\\* Or at least allow people to have ethical discussions there.\n\nTo be fair, most people who use the ID section do have proper respect for type design.

One of them is a covert pirate, one of them is a \"your type IP is my type IP\" (AKA \"plagiarism is actually just inspiration\") sort of guy, the other one is just a retired troublemaker. The rest are mostly decent folk though; some of them have actually adjusted their approach, I hope because they realize that Typophile's existence is tied into the creation of the things they so enjoy IDing.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I'd delete the address and tell them that if they couldn't bother to check back then don't post questions.\n\nI think etiquette in general is in decline. I remember many years ago when one of my professors invited a well-known designer from New York to speak. That guy was a class act. Flew in from New York, arrived on time, suit and tie, a well-organized presentation that was obviously customized especially for us, friendly and polite to everyone, and the next day he FedEx'd a handwritten thank you letter to the professor. Unfortunately I can't recall the guy's name, but to this day I remember his style and manners.\n\n"

All are rooted in one psychological insight: If you simply ban trolls—kicking them off your board—you nurture their curdled sense of being an oppressed truth-speaker. Instead, the moderators rely on making the comments less prominent.\n> \n> Patient Zero here is Slashdot, the tech site that pioneered one elegant way to police trolls: crowdsourcing. Slashdot has an automated system that randomly picks a handful of readers and gives them, for a day or so, the power to describe others' comments with terms like \"funny\" or \"off topic.\" Those descriptions are translated into a score from -1 to 5. Readers can set their filters so they see only comments with high ratings—and trollery effectively vanishes.\n\nWould such a system technically be possible on Typophile?  \nThe article specifically discusses 'trolling'; for convenience I'm including 'Use The Type ID Forum!' in that as well.\n\n"

Moving the ID Board to the top position of the forum menu would be an attempt to fix the latter problem. Renaming the ID Board, like others proposed, might solve the former.  \nWhy not try both? Seems we already have some supporters of that idea.\n\n@Hrant:\n\n> Ax (or offload) the ID section. End of problem.\n\nAre we addressing the same issue? I started this thread because it bothers me to find so many ID requests outside the ID Board (not only in the General Discussion Forum or the Design Forum, but also in the Critique Section). How would 'axing' the ID Section solve that problem?  \nI think any type discussion board will always attract type ID questions – just like every city will attract tourists. Some people don't like tourists in their city. They will be happy if tourism is regulated, if the main sights are clearly signposted, so the tourists will easily find them. These paces will be crowded, but if you don't want to encounter tourists, you can just choose not to go there. Works better than enforcing bans, in my opinion.\n\n"

One big reason is there's no easy mechanism for a user to shun the ID section.\n\nTypophile should not harm itself to be useful to people who would never consider being useful to Typophile. In fact it's worse than not being useful in return: IDing too often comes from and leads to piracy and the promotion of plagiarism. Even if we're wise enough not to crusade against those, it harms Typophile's image -hence future value to type design- to play along.\n\nTo be fair, in the past few weeks things have gotten much better in the ID section, in terms of ethics. But it remains that the drawbacks of having an ID section outweigh the benefits, in my opinion. Based on my observations I have to conclude that the experiment (getting casual users to truly appreciate type via the ID \"gateway\") might have been worth a shot, but sadly it failed.\n\nTourists aren't evil, but -due to the nature of most tourism- too many can very much ruin a city. I remember when I went to Moscow and Novosibirsk a few years ago: the latter is where I felt like I was in Russia.\n\nhhp\n\n"
