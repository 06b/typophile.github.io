      "content": "i'm no pro, so take my advice with a grain or two of salt...   \n   \noverall i think it's very nice. One feature i really like is that the diagonals in the A, M, V, W, v, w, and y seem to flex or bow just a bit. However the X, Y, Z, x and z seem a bit rigid in contrast, perhaps the k as well.   \n   \nthe eye of the e seems a bit small, as do the eyes of the 6 and the 9. the r looks like an amputated n.   \n   \nkeep up the good work!\n\n"

      "content": "This is actually a semi-serif... Good for you - we need those!   \n   \nIt reminds me a little bit of Costa (my fav Porchez font, finally released for retail sale - yay!) but it's certainly original nonetheless. I'm actually liking it a lot - but it needs work. The even tone is nice - it's an honest, but sensitive design. And the stroke terminals are great.   \n   \nLowercase:   \n- The \"a\" is obnoxious, sorry. It has the worst of Gill Sans, and that Jannon imbalance to boot.   \n- I don't think there's a good reason to give the \"f\" a descender.   \n- The \"g\" is nice - maybe give the head more size versus the tail - the glyph looks way too small compared to the rest.   \n- I think the \"k\" needs some of the bowing.   \n- I'm unsure about the \"w\".   \n- The \"x\" needs some of the bowing too, and maybe the \"z\" as well.   \n   \nThe caps are really nice.   \n- The \"L\" and \"T\" seem too wide.   \n- Consider bowing in the \"K\", \"X\", \"Y\" and \"Z\".   \n- The \"S\" needs more balance and polish.   \n   \nOthers:   \n- Interesting numerals. The \"3\" is too much though.   \n- I like the 3rd ampersand. A lot.   \n- Superb \"at\" sign.   \n- Flatten the UC accents.   \n- The acute and grave seem a hair too strong.   \n   \nSpacing: it needs work, but with some tightening I think the wordspace you have is good here.   \n   \n--   \n   \nOne thing about the pairing with the serif version though - I don't see them as compatible designs at all - certainly not sister types.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The descender gives too much emphasis to the   \nwhite space between the f and the next letter.   \n   \nI think the figures are great, maybe except for 6 and 9; they   \nneed bigger counters.\n\n"
