We have a great sculpture by Ann Smith as the centerpiece, but I'd like some feedback on choosing a typeface and layout. Right now we have 115% horizontally stretched Futura for the title text.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044138im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OneCoverB_3820.png)\n\nI've posted **[four design mock-ups](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416044138/http:/www.computingforbiologists.org/images/CoverMockupsMar2010.png)** to give you an idea, in addition to the preview above.\n\nThanks for your thoughts.\n\n",

Could manually recreate some I suppose.\n\nI was somewhat convinced we wanted something on the plump side, but this face doesn't look austere at all.\n\nDo the basic layouts look viable?\n\n"
