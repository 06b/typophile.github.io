On what operating system?\n\nThe most likely explanation is that you have managed to generate a font with an unrecognised encoding. Probably you have not assigned correct Unicode values to the Greek glyphs and/or the 8-bit charset is not recognised by the software you are using.\n\n"

As a start, set FontLab's Font Window to Codepage mode, and select the Windows 1253 Greek codepage. This will give you a template for correctly encoding monotonic Greek.\n\n"
