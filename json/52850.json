  "content": "Hi,\n\nI see lots and lots of geometric sans faces in magazines and advertisements around the world. Gotham and all it's relatives like Avenir Next and Neutraface 2 seem to be quite popular among designers.\n\nAnd very often I see serif faces like Freight, Chronicle, and Farnham used with them.\n\nAnd new slab serifs seem to pop up here and there all the time.\n\nI imagine seeing a typeface trend. Am I wrong or right?\n\nBut even more I am wondering what will be the next big thing in typeface design. What kind of typefaces and combinations will we see in magazines in the future?\n\nI really look forward on hearing your thoughts on this.\n\nThank you,  \nSami\n\n",
