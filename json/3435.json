But I'm not comfortable recommending a \"weathered\" look. Maybe if you looked at Ancient Greek inscriptions, like in here:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/grklapid.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024003650/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/grklapid.gif)   \n(Top two.)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

However, my original intent was to convey a hand-painted feeling rather than carved. Hopefully you can see that a little bit better at a larger size?   \n ![H](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024003650im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27883.jpg)\n\n"
