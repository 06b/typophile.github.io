  "content": "I’ve recently started doing design work for financial advisors, on top of the ninetofive at a commercial signage shop/digital printer’s. I’ve done logo design at the day job in the past, but obviously the clientele there (mostly of the Mom & Pop’s Fish & Chips variety) isn’t half as concerned with protecting their marks as the financial advisors.\n\nI was wondering how to approach placing Trademark and Registered Trademark symbols tastefully on logos. Do I want them to ’nest’ with the letterforms and blend in, or seperate them and leave them hovering like an insect? What about the size relationship? Naturally a logo must be printed at different sizes, does the trademark remain a constant size or should it resize too?\n\nInsight appreciated.\n\n [‹ Sans Serif with Mrs. Eaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108234457/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14884 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Arial alternate - no laughing please ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108234457/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14837 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Our firm will occasionally develop several different optical variants of a mark, intended for different size applications. A feature of these variants normally incorporates different sizes of the TM or (R) to match the intended reproduction size of the mark.\n\nGo with a placement that works with the mark. Normally it follows the mark, and is most commonly located at the top (although recent trends have seen this changing).\n\n\\*I am assuming you will mostly be working with a TM, not a registered mark.\n\n"
