  "content": "I am working on a packaging project designing sleeves that slip over boxes of chocolate (sort of like a slipcase). I am looking for Art Deco-ish typefaces to go with the existing packaging, which although it strictly isn't Art Deco, has a very 1920s feel to it. I work for a retailer that carries the brand and we are splitting the cost of the sleeves 50/50.\n\nI've done a few searches, and I came across Goldenbook by Mark Simonson which I'll probably end up getting, but nothing else has really caught my eye. I want something that is elegant and feels luxurious, but isn't too avant garde.\n\n",

I actually checked out \"French Modern\" from the library and scanned some pages for reference.\n\nI bought Estilo through MyFonts earlier today and am playing with that.\n\nI actually purchase Coquette about a year ago on another chocolate related project. However, I don't think it will work for this project.\n\nI'm trying to avoid the high contrast Deco faces, which is why I was looking for a serif. I want my design to whisper Deco as opposed to shouting it.\n\n"
