  "content": "Hello,\n\nI draw this font last year. As I design it all alone, I need some new looks on it . So load your guns and start firing your critiques on it. I already think that I have some problems with the thick and thin in the lighter weights… I really used to like the way the connections are joining, at first. But now I have some doubts about it… Does it look legible and aesthetic to you ? Any remarks are welcome, thanks in advance ;)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [test\\_typophile.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420202950/http:/typophile.com/files/test_typophile_0.pdf) | 127.45 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "@stewf Ditto. Re-opening it helped.  \nEDIT Actually, I opened it in Acrobat. Sorry.\n\n@docunagi Interesting idea. Following through on that deep cut in the curves takes some guts.\n\nIt seems a little heavy handed in the light weight of the type though. It almost looks like a rendering error or printing error when looked at from normal reading distance, because the line almost drops off completely. It works a little more successfully in the regular to darker weights.\n\nYou need to make sure that all of your postscript outlines are merged in the final product, as I am seeing a whole lot of overlap that cancels out parts.\n\n"

      "content": "Nice, I like it. It looks quite similar to the light weight I'm designing for my typeface [Furet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420202950/http:/typophile.com/node/37075) (sorry, that thread isn't really up to date at the moment).\n\nI'm not really digging your a, h, m, n, r, s, u. Going into that:\n\na -- I think the sudden angle of the shoulder (top right) is a bit too angular for the typeface.  \nh -- I miss the notch.  \nm -- Sticking on the second arch to an n doesn't work.  \nn -- Also misses the notch.  \nr -- I think the ear should start a bit lower.  \ns -- Interesting place to put the notches, but not very consistent when compared to the other characters.  \nu -- Missing the notches as well.\n\n"
