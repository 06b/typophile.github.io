  "content": "Hello all—\n\nI'm attempting to apply templates that I downloaded from thegridsystem.org I didn't realize how temperamental it was going to be with me!\n\nThe documents, found here [http://www.thegridsystem.org/categories/templates/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022005730/http:/www.thegridsystem.org/categories/templates/ \"http://www.thegridsystem.org/categories/templates/\") , are straightforward enough; they consist of grids and guidelines. The problem is applying that single page in the InDesign file to the entire document. If I create new pages, with some templates, nothing is replicated from the original. In other templates, only certain elements are replicated. For example: for the 6 column, 8.5x11, the baseline and vertical column guides duplicate themselves, but the horizontal guides do not.\n\nWhat's up? Is there a step I'm missing in the application of templates?\n\n",

You can control this stuff in the Pages palette. You may have to fiddle with the options and stuff (like make a guideline 'global') to get the guidelines to be visible on all of the pages.\n\n"
