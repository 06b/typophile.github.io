The closest thing to Vogue is James Montalbano's [VF Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802205349/http:/www.terminaldesign.com/fonts/vf-sans-complete-family/), but it's not really the same thing.

I'm afraid I thought this Intertype take on Futura was one of the ugliest typefaces I saw in serious use, so I'm not surprised no one wanted to revive it. Back in the 1960s, it was associated with very cheaply printed material, from people who couldn't afford a genuine Linotype machine.\n\n"

Pretty isn't everything.\n\nAnd besides that, Vogue and Tempo are as different from Futura as any other geometric sans serifs from that era. They were definitely designed to be substitutes, but they weren't exact copies. They had unique qualities of their own. Tempo had a very lovely cursive italic in the lighter weights.\n\n"

Pretty isn't everything.</cite>\n\nWhile this is undeniably true, in general a typeface needs to be aesthetically appealing to commend itself to those who use and purchase fonts. I wouldn't set a high bar for this, but I found Vogue to be distinctly unattractive, and its former use creates negative associations.\n\nAnd this makes it unlikely to appeal to advertisers, the number one source of demand for typefaces. Also, as a text face, it's not particularly effective; it isn't, say, Ionic No. 5 - acceptable in appearance, and highly legible.\n\nIncidentally, another killer for a typeface, I believe, is looking \"dated\". Revivals can have subtle changes that fix that, of course. This, for example, is why we don't see much Cheltenham these days, although it's readily available. Even one of my favorites, Cloister Oldstyle, seems to have this flaw to a degree.\n\n"
