( [www.mori.art.museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808070115/http:/www.mori.art.museum/ \"www.mori.art.museum\")), Bourgeois has been now been released as a major 32 weight family. It is not the most experimental font we have designed (it has a very light virusfonts touch to it) but it is certainly one of the most usable, well crafted and mature. We hope you will find that suitable for a number of uses, both text and display, please check the virusfonts website at [www.virusfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808070115/http:/www.virusfonts.com/ \"www.virusfonts.com\") for specimen sheets and pricing details.  \n+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\\_+\n\n",
