  "content": "I am very excited about our second issue of Building Letters, this issue has an indian feel to it with :   \n   \nSami from Underware in India   \nRathna Ramanathan on Indian street sign painters   \nA visit to an Indian design firm   \nExploring India the Brand   \n   \nSlighly less Indian is an essay by Neville Brody about his personal point of view on the responsibility of being a designer, plus lots more...   \n   \nOn the font side of things, we have exclusives from :   \n   \nMax Kisman   \nIan Swift   \nDonnald Beekman   \nHarsh Patel   \nMiles Newlyn   \nDavid Luscombe   \nJim Richardson   \n   \nCommercial typefaces from :   \n   \nBruno Maag   \nFont Kitchen   \nSimon Schmidt   \nFelix Braden   \nRian Hughes   \nPizza Dude   \nAustralian Type Foundry   \nAlejandro Paul   \n   \nPlus an exclusive Indic border design by John Downer. These will be free with the magazine.   \n   \nOn the poster front, this time we have Emigre and Eboy creating two fantastic posters.   \n   \nThe cost of this issue is likely to be just ï¿½10 + post and packaging (all packs will be mailed record delivery after lots of problems with missing packs last time).   \n   \nAs with last time, this is all about raising money for charity, so get your credit cards ready!   \n   \nJIM\n\n",

So lets get down to facts what has been done in the last year. It's nice people like to get involved, but I have to know there are results.\n\n"

Yep we have all that in the next pack and it will be on the new website which will be uploaded in the next week. One of my friends went over to check things out a few weeks back and he has pictures and a report of where we are at.   \n   \nJIM   \n===\n\n"
