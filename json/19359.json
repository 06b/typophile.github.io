Also, [Vincent Pacella](http://web.archive.org/vincent%20pacella) had been hopeful in developing a releasing some of his own designs through CG.  \nThere were many type designers from around the world, both known and yet-to-be known that I had the pleasure of meeting.\n\nAlso, a young [Garrett Boge](http://web.archive.org/web/20101114204828/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/boge/garrett/) was knocking at the door in 1989.

Infringement could involve one in legal hassles.\n\nHere is a hypothetical case: a very well known and long-lived typeface from a very well known firm is suspected of being based on someone else's drawings. Since this face had been licensed and cross-licensed over the years, if someone could make the claim that the very well known typeface itself was an infringement of this previous design that they had legal rights to, and won an entitlement, they could very well seek compensation based on all moneys made over the years.\n\nYes people do copy metal faces all the time, and sometimes they get a letter from a law firm. If rights had been established and there is a legal continuance of those rights, as in licensing, copying a metal face is as wrong, and potentially as dangerous, as copying a digital face.\n\n"

In fact the reason there's no digital version is probably due simply to the fact that there was never a photo version! These days people will much more rarely bother with reviving a metal face (especially one that's hard to find actually used extensively).  \nBecause you need to physically find it, and then print it!\n\nhhp\n\n"
