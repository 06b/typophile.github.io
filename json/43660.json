I know that you do not recognize it ‘finished’  \nYet I do. I would love to see it just as it is now. Maybe threre are some defects when it comes  \nto digitalzing issues (for commercial use) I do not think that there are defects - on the contrary -  \nI do think its charme is the thing that counts!\n\nHave you ever seriously thought about it?  \nIt is a beautiful version that you made so far as I remember. It struck me.  \nPerhaps it may do so with other people, too.\n\nSalute  \nStefan\n\n",
