As people become more informed and less impressed by flashiness, perhaps such attention getters may not impress the new desktop graphics folks, but I wonder if their customers will ever have that sort of savvy? I have been hanging out doing font ID's in newsgroups and forums for over 3 years and I can almost count the number of times people asked about text type on my fingers. (This forum has a better percentage of those 'clients' I'd say).   \n   \nIn my opinion 'newness' (even if it's old fonts being revived) is what attracts the font collectors and users. To me that's what is a bit funny about Neutraface as a font fad. There's nothing radical, or inventive, about it, just like there wasn't with Chalet, but House does such a nifty marketing job, that they make everyone want it. I agree with you Dan that is has an elegance, but so did the designs that it imitates.   \n   \nYou know the line about how 'history repeats itself'? It's true in fashion and in fonts too. Art Deco and Retro fonts appear to be in vogue, and this is a great time to revive them. Fonts like Bauhaus and Eurostile and their conceptual offspring seem to be timeless, in that they manage to keep looking 'new'. Part of that is because many people don't know the history, so they begin to repeat it, thinking they have discovered something. I tend to think that's they way it will always go, just like the way skirt lengths and colors change with the trends, but rarely really discover anything new.   \n   \nOne person's idea of font sophistication may be only as good as the uses the font is put to. If it's the right choice, you look like a true artist, if it isn't you are one of the masses just playing with fonts.   \n   \nThat's my bit of font philosophy for today.\n\n"

It may not be as widespread as _the humanist sans outbreak_ of the 90's, but one need only look at a Veer catalogue to see the incredible number of retro brush scripts and swashy \\*new\\* designs.
