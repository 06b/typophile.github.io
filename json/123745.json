  "content": "Modak is a Free and Open Source, Heavy-Chubby Devanagari-Latin display typeface. The design started off as one of our heavy hand sketched letterform explorations. The characters were cute/round and not bulky/rigid. The consonants and Matras were overlapping, instead of them being successive characters.\n\nThe resulting typeface is one of its kind and probably the chubbiest Devanagari typeface to be designed so far.\n\nThis project is led by Ek Type, a collective of type designers based in Mumbai focused on designing contemporary Indian typefaces.
