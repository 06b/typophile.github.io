(The only thing she eats anymore, god bless her, at 92.)\n\nAt first I couldn't find her beloved Peaches & Cream - and then I did, looking like a box of elbow macaroni.\n\nI was wondering what you thought about this. It isn't a \"design\" question - I felt it more appropriate in general discussion, as hopefully, none of us designed this.\n\nThe one on the left was the package they have been using for years, nicely balanced, well thought out - fun with type...  \nthe one on the right is there new and improved - or as they say, \"New Look, Same Great Taste.\"\n\nI don't want to influence you - but am I the only one that thinks they hired a kid out of school who had to prove he was worth the salary they were giving him?\n\nI'd love to hear your opinions. Honest.\n\nP.S. I know that Quaker Oats was having some problems and the US government made them change some of the claims on their packaging. That might have been the excuse for a new design, but I would have liked to see a design first.\n\n",

Growing up in the family grocery store, stocking boxes of Apple Jacks, Cocoa Puffs, and Sugar Smacks at age ten, I was fortunate to get weekly, intimate exposure to package design. Some I loved, others I hated. My brother and I would sit together in an aisle, on milk crates, and every once in a while pose a \"which is cooler?\" question. Liquid Plumr or Drano? Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines? Speas or Tree Top? Hi-C or Haiwaiian Punch?\n\nNot many things in the grocery store are more classic than that Quaker Oats cylinder. It breaks my heart every time a brand chooses to redesign its packaging for the sake of \"updating.\" Yes, I love technology (but not as much as you, you see), but thank God for Quisp. I think it's the only kid's cereal cartoon character that hasn't been destroyed with Illustrator gradients.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419214940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quisp-cereal_5851.jpg)\n\nAs for the new Quaker packaging, fine. Go ahead and ruin a good thing. That's about all I can say anymore. I'm tired of seeing it happen. Creamette, Mountain Dew, Oxydol... But if I could have my way, I think it would make much more sense to model the instant oatmeal packaging after the classic cylinder, something more like this one:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419214940im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quaker-oats_3997.jpg)\n\nThe bottom line is I'm sick to death of drop shadows, gradients, and outer glows, and I crave flat colors and hard lines. It's an opinion, I suppose, but I often wonder how much package updating is done only because it has become so easy to do it, and student-just-out-of-school or no student-just-out-of-school, 21st century designers love their digital effects.\n\n"

The new corporate-technical look also has a nutraceutical vibe; I can't see what else is on the package, but I bet there's something about how healthy oatmeal is.\n\n"
