  "content": "For some reason, my Word is giving me problems(hell, what’s new). It worked fine, till I installed Linotype’s Font Explorer. Are the two incompatible? Strangely enough, it works fine on my laptop, but not my desktop at work. I’m running a Mac, OS 10.4 and the Word is a 2004 legit version. I can’t for the life of me figure out why it doesn’t work. It opens, but then as it starts to check the font menu, it gives me messages that some fonts in my system are corrupt - like Times CE & CY (which I can’t even find on my system!)\n\nAfter I’ve clicked maybe a million times to “okay”, Word hangs. Brilliant.\n\n",
