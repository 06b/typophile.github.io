  "content": "hi everyone,\n\ni am designing a logo for a small company called Analysis Factory which provides dashboards to other companies for quick data visualization; i.e. to monitor the finances of the company. The clients can update an Excel spreadsheet, and the dashboard shows them the current charts and graphs in an interactive dashboard.  \n( [http://analysisfactory.com/solutions.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013105846/http:/analysisfactory.com/solutions.htm \"http://analysisfactory.com/solutions.htm\"))\n\ni have done a logo that they immediately liked, so now i am trying to narrow it down and work out the details. please review the 4 options (4 pages in various colors) and offer some suggestions for improvement. as far as kerning, i know i still need to do that!\n\nthe client wants a stacked version and a horizontal version.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [AF-logo2-4pgs.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013105846/http:/typophile.com/files/AF-logo2-4pgs.pdf) | 703.75 KB |\n\n",

Is that Helvetica Rounded? It's trendy, but I have a soft spot for it.\n\nWhat I don't like is the balance between the mark and the type.\n\nIn your first set, the mark is too large in relation to the type. In your second set, it's too small in relation to the type. I think you need to aim for something in the middle. Also, perhaps give the mark a bit more space in relation to the type. Give it some breathing room.\n\n"

But after I saw it was helvetica rounded it just felt a little too playful for a serious company. Every time I see helvetica rounded I think of \"playschool\" or toys in general.  \nIf you are locked up on the typeface I might try to match the roundness of your icon corners, meaning make the icon rounder. If you are not locked up you can try another typeface that matches that shape, a bit more squared but round. Or you could even bring regular sans typeface and then play with making it's corners rounder. Could be interesting and I would try a wide typeface to match the width of the \"F\" on the icon or again try to match the icon to your typeface.  \nOverall looks interesting, play more with the type, stack it, try \"TitleCase\" since it looks like you have an Upercase \"F' in your icon instead of lowercase etc.  \nWhen you place the icon next to the icon horizontally it reads \"Fanalisisfactory\" be careful with that, perhaps stacked on the side but align the bottom to the \"x\" height of your type.\n\nGood work, hope this helps.\n\nKco\n\n"

Just a thought, though...\n\nI still don't like VAG (to playfull) but I can't think of something better. Maybe a Din-like character?\n\n"

If Lorenk decides to use this typeface or another that is similar, the mark should be positioned differently. Maybe just raise it a little (bottom of the mark in line with the crossbar of the \"A\") and nudge it a bit to the right so the spacing look right.\n\nAloha!\n\n"

For the unframed horizontal version, swap the words' colors, diminishing the \"Fanalysis\" problem and helping to associate each word with its counterpart in the mark.\n\n"

It is similar to Eurostile, but better (in my opinion). It's strokes are fairly equal and balances well with the icon. It is structured but has slight curve like the icon. It also isn't distracting from the logo.\n\nI would customize the font by taking the tail out of the \"t\" and maybe making the stem and descender in the \"y\" straight to match the icon.\n\nYou need to move the icon from the center. Everything is so symetric and boring. Moving it to the left gives it energy and motion.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013105846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/foundry-monoline3_5684.gif)\n\n"
