When a designer like Dawn finds a great deal like $35 instead of $99 for fonts that some type designer has in good faith licensed to some vendor, in the belief that he's going to make some money in royalties, the designer can come to 'Under the table...' and send a confidential message to the original type designer asking if he or she will accept $35 to buy a license under the table (confidential and under the table because so as not to undermine the value at which the type designer would prefer to be selling his type). If the type designer agrees, he or she gets the full $35, instead of a percentage of a percentage of a percentage of a discounted discounted price, and the designer gets the fonts with the added joy of putting his or her money in the hands of a type designer, with the only caveat that he or she agrees to keep quiet.   \n   \nOf course, the long term solution, for the type designer at least, _is to stop signing contracts that allow vendors to cross license and discount prices._\n\n"
