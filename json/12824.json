  "content": "Hi, I'm hoping someone can advise me on this one small question.\n\nIn our books, we usually list the typeface(s), and sometimes the designer, such as:\n\nType set in _Typeface_  \nor  \nTypeface: _Typeface_ by _Designer_  \nor  \nTypeface: _Foundry Typeface_\n\nThis info typically goes in the colophon, or sometimes on the copyright page. Recently, I found this little tidbit in one foundry's EULA:\n\n_The names of these typefaces are registered trademarks of [Foundry], and as such may only be used in keeping with accepted trademark practice, including identification of the trademark owner's name and only in conjunction with output produced using this font software._\n\nWhat is \"accepted trademark practice\"? (I looked through the Typowiki and didn't find anything.) It seems extreme to do something like:\n\nTypeface: _Typeface_TM by _Designer_  \n_Typeface_ is a registered trademark of _Foundry_\n\nHow would you handle this? Any advice?\n\n",

Thanks for that. -- Each foundry probably has what they consider to the _the_ way to identify their typefaces. Does the foundry have any samples? I just googled this, as I'll bet you did first anyway, and it seems several foundries use the same phrase. I'd probably lean toward the second option. I am sure that the foundry will simply appreciate the effort made.\n\n"

Which means of course that everybody loves Lapsang Souchong, right?\n\nMarnie, unless you have a really unobtrusive place to dump all that trademark stuff, I would simply ignore that clause. After all, any font house is more than happy to see any credit at all; they wouldn't come around and harass you for a technicality, souring a positive precedent with you. And if they do, you come and tell us, and we'll make sure they regret it.\n\nhhp\n\n"

The headlines and labeling are set in various weights of _Faceplate_, designed by Rodrigo Xavier Cavazos from Psy/Ops.\"\n\n- \"Typest [sic] in 10/12pt Palatino by Intype, London\"\n\n- \"Composed in Scala and Scala Sans, typefaces designed my Martin Majoor in 1994.\"\n\nBased on these samples I gather that no publisher is putting a little TM or (R) after names of typefaces. The last one is from the _Chicago Manual of Style_ and I tend to defer to them. (Although... [the FontFont site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016032659/http:/www.fontfont.com/press_release.html) does use the (R) registered trademark symbol after Scala, I can't read their EULA without buying anything, so I don't know whether or not it includes any language like the quote in my original post.)\n\n"

      "content": "I think that the real question here is a redactionary one. Almost every book mentions trademarks these days (i.e., Coca-Cola, MS-Windows, etc.), and 99% of the time, these are not properly attributed. Ideally, when the text is edited, the copy-editor who flag-down and research every mentioned trademark. Then the very last page of the book could have all of the trademarks listed together in full legalese is six-point condensed light type, or something ridiculous. At least then they are in there, and you have yourself covered, should anything come up (which it wouldn't).\n\nIt is mis-uses of big-company trademarks that I would worry about more (i.e., the Coca-Colas and the Microsofts, etc.). Typefaces are trademarked so that others do not make fonts that us the same name (or something deceptively similar). Designing a new font & selling it under the name **Ef Ef Metaa** ist just asking for trouble.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016032659/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

That's it. The book I'm working on now refers to many trademarked names, including products from big companies like Xerox, Kodak, Adobe. We did double-check all the names to make sure they were all spelled, capitalized, and punctuated correctly, but there isn't any sort of \"legalese\" section that says \"iGen3 is a registered trademark of Xerox\" etc.\n\n"

What I did imply is that **enough** people here are willing and able to help you confront preposterous demands by font houses that such font houses will end up regretting the public relations fallout. For example, why did Adobe back off persecuting that Russian programmer? Because it ended up becoming bad for its image.

      "content": "I would have to agree with marcox: as far as I know, colophons are a courtesy, not a legal requirement. What I believe the EULA referenced does _not_ say is that you are obliged to acknowledge every instance of the typeface's use. What it _does_ say is, if you _choose_ to credit use of this typeface, please spell our name correctly and completely (including any trademark designations affixed thereunto), and make sure you actually used the typeface you said you used.\n\n**hrant: _Anybody who ever thinks that has to be completely bonkers._**\n\nSigh...H-man, when are you gonna learn: punctuating your arguments with insults doesn't make them more persuasive arguments; if anything, it makes them _less_ persuasive, because you seem compelled to add a spurious _ad hominem_ element to them.\n\nAnd it might also be productive for you to stop for a moment to consider the possible consequences of your continuing campaign against EULAs. As things currently stand, although a EULA is a legally binding contract, virtually all foundries treat them as gentlemen's agreements. The rest of the world is not so understanding. Assume for a moment that you wanted to purchase an automobile on time, as most folks do. You go to the dealership, select an auto to your liking, and are handed a purchase contract. If, at this point, you were to say, \"I do not accept this contract because it exploits the working man,\" do you think for an instant that you would drive out of that lot in that car? Even if you were to keep silent and sign the contract, with the intent of ignoring it once you got what you wanted, it wouldn't take long for the repo man to show up and reclaim the car.\n\nThankfully, font foundries do not employ such measures against people who fail to live up to their end of the contract...but what if they _did_? Consider for a moment this scenario which, unless I have a gift for clairvoyance of which I was hitherto unaware, is purely hypothetical:\n\nA major distributor of fonts who is also a major player in professional imaging decides that your attitude toward EULAs is actually the one which prevails in the marketplace. In response to this scofflaw attitude, a new font format (for argument's sake, let's call it OpenType 2) and a new imaging protocol (let's call it Postscript 4) are developed which **require** the purchaser to register a font online before it can be installed, much like the registration systems now employed by other software manufacturers. In order to install the font, you must accept the EULA; if you attempt to install the font on more machines than the number for shich you have purchased a license, you will be unable to. To round out the picture, let's say that our hypothetical Postscript 4 will only accept this new font format and will only allow you to image the fonts which have been registered in this manner. And every time you upgrade computers, you will have to go through a process of unregistering and verifying delection all of the fonts on your old computer, and installing and reregistering them on your new box.\n\nProbable? Likely? Even possible? It doesn't matter. If the major players became convinced that their economic interests are being threatened, they _will_ take measures to protect themselves. Well, think again. Let's keep the agreements gentlemanly...and while, we're at it, let's keep the debate here gentlemanly, as well.\n\n"
