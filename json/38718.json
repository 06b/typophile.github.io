There were no exact matches, but I think you're right that this is from the Deco era. Nick's closest styles were [Pismo Clambake](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010638/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/pismo-clambake-nf/) and [Jaunty Gent](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010638/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/jaunty-gent-nf/), which only show that the era is similar to his work here.\n\nIs Nick around? Do you recognize this script from one of your books?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The original design goes back to 1926 to Wagner & Schmidt, then cast by many foundries in 1927. Troubador Open was a Haas design by E. Thiele from 1931, if I read this right.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The original Rechtman, I believe, can be downloaded from the [Mac Font Vault](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010638/http:/www.erik.co.uk/font/script.html).\n\nAlso, [Faces.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120219010638/http:/www.faces.co.uk/fonts/fontview.cfm?productsku=IN100134) sells commercial versions of some of Rakowski's fonts. Presumably they are superior to the old shareware in technical quality or character set - but I don't know that for a fact.\n\n"
