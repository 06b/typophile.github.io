The Bloomingdale's logo isn't well known outside the United States, and I happen to dwell in Australia.\n\n_Someone sent me the logo for a retirement home that makes use off two intersecting “o’s” but I don’t think it is a true ligature._\n\nWhy not? What disqualifies the overlapping structure from being a ligature? I think what you're getting at is the departure from normal or accepted structure for a ligature. Saying it's \"not a true ligature\" is an exclusionist and conservative view. If that's true, then you should be able to define \"true ligature\".\n\nAnd you know, the moment somebody defines \"true ligature\" I will be along to demolish all such notions.\n\n_I would like to use the double-O ligature in the title of a publication, but feedback from someone said that overlapping O’s reminded her of unity, or gender symbols (male and female).

In my opinion for a ligature to be a _true ligature_ it doesn't have to join or overlap but to be designed with consideration of the pair (or more) of characters and with consideration to possible surrounding characters.\n\nTim\n\n"
