An opentype face with lots of glyphs would be great too.\n\nThings I like about this face is\n\n- its condensed nature,  \n - vertical terminals on diagonal characters (e.g leg of the R)  \n - and the digits\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\n[Link to Neighbourhood](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021153102/http:/andychung.ca/work/neighbourhood/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021153102im_/http:/typophile.com/files/neighbourhood_4223.png)\n\n",

Someone also mentioned [Alpha headline](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021153102/http:/www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Custom+Typefaces/Alpha+Headline/) but I find it a bit clunky (and it's not comercially available), another similar face was [Carplates](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021153102/http:/www.type.co.uk/index.php?p=a_to_z&let=*&id=10697)\n\n"
