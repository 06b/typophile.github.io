  "content": "Hello, everyone. This is my fist posting to the forum. I've been reading this forum for a few weeks and have learned quite a bit from your critiques. Thanks!   \n   \nI am currently designing a logo for a progressive non-profit, for their new leadership-development program. they have already settled on the name, which refers to this resource network (of 4 parts)... unfortunately i couldn't talk them out of using \"matrix\" since that word has been killed.   \n   \nI am soliciting any feedback that you may offer, the more brutally honest the better. On this forum I have watched some pretty mediocre designs begin to sing after the valuable critiques provided by all of you.   \n   \nI'd love to hear which direction(s) have the most potential, and any ideas with integrating the \"matrix.\" Thanks in advance.   \n   \n ![Some different avenues I've been exploring...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018203647im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20908.gif)\n\n",

I think that the shapes are such a strong form that even if people dont notice at first its a strong enough image to stick in peoples heads. Then when they notice that its an e and a four they will go 'oooo!' Quite afew TV companies in UK have logos like this and I dont think they suffer for it.   \nPerhaps you could even say e4 matrix under the logo or employ the idea above (see below). What I'm really tryin to say is that I hope you dont back away from this design becuase of an(imho) unjustified thought that people might not see what it says.
