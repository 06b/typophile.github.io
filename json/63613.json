Do you worry about the font featuring common Latin-language or Roman-era contractions, etc.? Most of all I would work the angle that Latin uses far fewer letters that have extenders in the lc. So maybe something with a highly varied x-height region, to help along readability? Unless you're shooting for what Latin text is famous for: aesthetic regularity. Unless unless you're being even more aesthetically-minded and you'd like cuspy-cupped serifs... Like I said, an interesting question.\n\n\\* Maybe Andreas thought Erik meant Latin-script as opposed  \nto Latin language? Which would indeed be a dumb question,  \nalthough still not deserving Andreas's reaction.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Translated to English, the phrase means \\*Fortune favors the bold.\\* I am not sure how to say the phrase in Latin.\n\nMy main concern is cultural consideration. Should I choose a font from a particular historical era? Maybe a font created by a designer from a certain country? That is the type of stuff I would like to know.\n\n"

But the reader can never be ignored, so the \"culture\" of the user has to be factored in.\n\n\\* Hopefully not Trajan. Maybe La Gioconda by Farey & Dawson.\n\nWhat's the context?\n\nhhp\n\n"

I guess he mostly cares about having it look cool since no one will be able to understand it besides him anyway.\n\nI have also been trying to learn more about fonts lately and not just choose a font because it looks nice, or it's popular. I am currently reading \\*The Elements of Typographic Style\\* by Robert Bringhurst. I figure by the time I am done reading it I will be more of an expert on fonts and typography. I am relatively young and I have just recently graduated from going to school for Graphic Design.\n\n"
