If you have lurked here a while you will realize that we get all kinds of requests, and we don't always know if someone is trying to play with us, so I can see where Tomi's response came from, especially on April Fool's Day.\n\nYou will also realize, if you spend any time here, that we are generally very helpful if we get anything to work with, and if your question is honest.\n\nOne last point: please try to make your titles more descriptive, so that we know which one we are looking for if we find an answer sometime well after the post first appears. You can see if everyone says some variation of \"I need help\" we would never know which thread to pick up. If you give something that describes your sample, like \"Slab T with no foot serif\", we would always find it again, if we located an answer. Also, it's good to know if you have other letters -- the more information you give us the more it helps.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
