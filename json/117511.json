Unlike the latin now I having problems to evaluate the space between the letters and the high of some of the glyphs.\n\nI do not know the Arabic language, nor Russian.\n\nBelow are a few words written in Arabic, can you tell me if they are spelled correctly?\n\nThank you\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Arab\\_s 2014-06-25 alle 12.22.36.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121833/http:/typophile.com/files/Schermata%202014-06-25%20alle%2012.22.36.png) | 38.22 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Have you tried comparing your typeface with a regular arabic typeface in your operating system? Because the sample you are showing here seems a bit illegible to me. I can read arabic script but not the arabic language just farsi. Contrast is reversed in arabic script so horizontal lines are thicker. This is not a universal rule but this could make your design ugly or beautiful in eyes of many designers. I can't point to some of the glyphs here but the last letter in the fifth line should be similar to the second letter in the seventh line and the difference is only in the dots. But in your design shape of the base character is also different which in the fifth line looks better. Any way you are better off showing the character set view of the font.\n\n"
