While working on a new font, when I installed a font for testing it shows strange positioning problems as in image Tahree114\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415113950im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tahreer114_5093.jpg)\n\nBut when I change the zoom size or font size there is no such problem as shown in Tahree150 below\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415113950im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Threer150_5441.jpg)\n\nI am using FontLab and MS Volt.\n\nBest regards,  \nAtif\n\n",

I dont know arabic but it looks like a detail on the first example could infact be there but has been pressed up to the baseline because of such hinting instructions.\n\n"
