Is there a way to buy specific fonts instead of the full package?   \n   \n2   \nFurthermore, I hate the policy of buying before trying. I'm willing to have another blind go, but this has already cost me money I wouldn't have spent. Anyone knows if it is possible to actually try a typeface (say, just the roman) before buying?   \n   \nRodrigo de S\n\n"

The CC version seems to stand somewhere between the two, perhaps closer to BS; so I'll be needing the experts. However, the small caps and the Titling from BS or even LT will do, I suppose. They are not that different from CC and, anyway, I only use small caps and Titling in headers, where difference will not be noticeable. I try to avoid bold, but Bitstream's is very attractive (as much as a bold can be in text setting). Anyway, if I use it, I again restrict its use to headers.   \n   \nI hope I can get away with buying only 4 fonts (roman and italic osf and the experts).   \n   \nThank you for your advice.   \n   \nRodrigo\n\n"

Back in the seventies, when we were both at Mergenthaler Linotype, Matthew designed 4 weights of Galliard, each with an Italic version. They are the Roman, Bold, Black, and Ultra weights. Mergenthaler later licensed the design to ITC, and it became ITC Galliard. When he and I started Carter & Cone, he went back to his original drawings and added all the wonderful characters that we had never produced while we were at Bitstream (he and I were two of Bitstream's 4 founders). Anyway, we brought out the package of 11 fonts for Galliard Roman and Italic, and we've been trying to find the time to fill in with the other weights, but we do so much custom work that Matthew hasn't gotten back to that project. When people want the additional weights, we suggest going with the Bitstream version, which was produced under his direction.\"\n\n"

The uppercase has slightly less space (but I think it is not more condensed), but otherwise it is the same. SO I think yes, they should work together. Linotype's is a rather different fount.\n\n"
