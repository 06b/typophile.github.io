  "content": "Hi there. Need help finding font to use for the chapter openers of a book on the Films of Ken Russell. The publisher wants “gothic, gory, perverse, over the top.” If you’re not familiar with Ken Russell, you can check him out at imdb. He’s, shall we say, “irreverent.” I’d like to give it that b-movie feel, without it looking too much like a horror flick font (no dripping blood, etc.). Or maybe a kind of Goth Punk type . . . Any ideas?  \nThanks,  \nSarah\n\n [‹ What's a good face for a beginner to emulate?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224115743/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30417 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Good typeface for small printed pricelists ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224115743/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28900 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Here’s how it could look in FF Merlin, which has a variety of styles.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224115743im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/goth_4917.png)\n\nOr you could mix blackletter “Gothic” with sans serif “Gothic” in the same word.
