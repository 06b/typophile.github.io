I have it as an embroidery design, but would like to match it in true type font so I can use it in my other embroidery program. If you search for Jack and Jill font you only come up with the embroidery font option-not what I need. I'm sure there has to be a match out there somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it. Any help or suggestions?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [party princess closeup 2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041326/http:/typophile.com/files/party%20princess%20closeup%202.jpg) | 310.84 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I'm inclined to agree, although this sort of look is common enough in scrapbooking fonts. I found one free and two commercial fonts that might be close enough to use as substitutes, but not if you HAVE to match your sample. The freebie is Pizzadude's [Love Letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041326/http:/www.dafont.com/loveletters.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Isabella). The commercial fonts are [Sugar Shack](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041326/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/sugar-shack/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D37%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DIsabella%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D30) by Bob Alonso,and [Amore](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041326/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/amore/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D37%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DIsabella%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D22) from ParaType.\n\nIf you study the Love Letters or Sugar Shack fonts, and imagine a few changes, like adding serifs, you can see how perhaps this font of yours might have been developed as a custom font 'inspired' by one of these others.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
