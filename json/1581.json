      "content": "The best guess I can make about that is some of the Numbered Gothic faces, such a Gothic No.3 (up to numbers in the hundreds). Both Monotype and Linotype proliferated a wide range of widths and weights of various Gothic (or Grotesque) faces. These were being brought into use in the late 1800's, so the timeframe fits your samples easily. To expect all of these to have made it into digital form is probably wishful thinking. But you could probably find some reasonable (and virtually indistinguishable) versions at MyFonts by searching on the terms Gothic Sans or Grotesque. From an ID standpoint you are missing some (for me) key letters, like the g, and G, but my impression is that some of the [Font Bureau 'Bureau Grotesque'](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024053355/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=FB000020X1P1&start=1) faces would be pretty similar.\n\n"
