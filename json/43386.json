See also [Burbank](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422064727/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=565), where he makes a well crafted animated-cartoon style font and then multiplies it with a dizzying variety of styles. Being able to multiply styles is where being a techno-wizard gives you an edge.\n\n\\>thanks\n\nYou’re most welcome!\n\n"
