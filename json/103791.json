  "content": "hi.  \nany quick suggestions or starting point for a type that that can accompany this logo?  \nit needs to read at small sizes and have some of the same dna. i've gathered a lot of stuff i thought would fit,  \nbut i'd like to see if i'm on the right track compared to other typophiles. thanks.  \n-etah chen.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gel_6184.png)\n\n",

That would take less time than trying out lots of fonts that obviously don’t match. It’s not as if there are any tricky letters like /S to draw.\n\n"

They appear to be the result of some horizontal condensation so either thicken the verticals or lighten the horizontals. As it stand now it looks amateurish.\n\n"
