Specifically, the cap V (with it's Matt Groening Life In Hell bunny ears) and the r characters were basically built from scratch. The two e's were loosely based on the ones found in a script called Hostess. Hostess one of several revivals developed by Tim Ryan of SourceNet back in the mid-90s. We were going to market Tim's collection of faces through the Image Club library, but never managed to get a licensing agreement in place.   \n   \nSadly, I don't know what ever happened to Mr Ryan or his fonts. I know he did some contract work for Red Rooster at on point in time.   \n   \nHere's what Hostess SN looks like:   \n   \n ![Hostess SN character set](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031064139im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18783.gif)\n\n"
