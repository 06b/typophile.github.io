      "content": "If it was up to me, I would've colored the roofs bright red. Other than that, think scale: 'luxury' - much larger, that comma is a disaster (closer and smaller). There are kerning issues in the title. 'Lifestyle & location': either bring it closer to the top line or give it an oversized pretty ampersand, maybe a color accent on the ampersand. I think it was Philip Stark who said that helvetica/(arial) when used as small paragraph text looks like shit. Try Arno maybe.\n\n\n\n"

The back doesn't seem remarkably different than the front.\n\nAt the very least, maybe give the front more emphasis in scale and the back less.\n\nMaybe consider a script face?\n\nAlso, where's the URL? ;o)\n\n"

The blues make this very cold; it's almost mono-chromatic...when I think of a luxury home I think of warmth; something inviting. It's also very flat...it seems there could be more depth. I also agree with ZUZ3L and tina's suggestion of a script font or possibly something clean and modern.\n\nCould you possibly work in smaller photographs of the inside of one of these luxury homes?\n\n"
