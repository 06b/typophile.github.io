If you could take a few minutes to answer the following questions it would make a significant contribution to my research.\n\n1. Name the 10 most common typefaces the average living person has seen through out the course of their life. If you can’t name 10, just name as many as you can. Place them in order of frequency.\n\n2. Who sells number one on your list? If more than one person, company, foundry &c sells it, say so. Three references should do.\n\n3. About how much does it cost?\n\n4. If you designed a font that was as common as Times New Roman and sold it as part of a business, what do you suppose would be your annual revenues from this font?\n\n5. For some industries it is not so hard to find out how large they are (sales; profits). Does anyone have any idea how large the typeface industry is on these dimensions?\n\nThank you for your participation and I look forward to your responses.\n\n [‹ Original Besley Clarendon](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201165703/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40635 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tuscan brackets ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201165703/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41566 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Graphic designers buy fonts, so those bundled with vinyl sign cutters, those used by books and newspapers, bundled with computers are probably not the best sellers.\n\n5. Both Monotype Imaging and Bitstream are publically traded companies so you can probably get a good picture based on their annual reports.\n\n"

Sales has nothing to do with this question.”\n\nThis is confusing; why is your thread title “How big is the font industry?” and why are you asking about annual revenues? If sales is of no interest, and visibility is the crucial point, then you are talking about exposure, perception, popularity, which, in western cultures, does not necessarily reflect anything about the “font industry”.\n\nI say this because your questions seem unfocused, and my answers would have to be lengthy and include many caveats and questions in return. For example, what do you mean by “as common as Times”? Since Times is about 90 years old, and has been made available in every type format since its release, and has been included in all major personal computing platforms as a default since the early 80’s, it’s impossible to consider designing a typeface as widely used, or as easily available, or as thoroughly exposed as Times. This completely ignores the issue of what Times has historically proven to be worth in financial terms, or what you might pay as the total cost of a new design.\n\nThis is the tip of quite an iceberg.\n\n"
