I checked the \"designers\" section on their [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202052627/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep), but the information on Kirchner is unusually sparse: \"Robert Kirchner, an Austrian FontFont designer.\" I know he passed away a couple of years ago due to illness.\n\n"

He had made the font in 1989 for a client in Austria and offered it later for distribution by FontShop International.\"\n\n"
