My great grandfather utilized this typeface throughout his life as the identity for his business. Can anyone assist with it's identification or nearest modern day typeface that comes closest?\n\nThanks in advance...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821184042im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_5561.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821184042im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2_5237.png)\n\n",
