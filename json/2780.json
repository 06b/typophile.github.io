      "content": "OK. Here is Grace replicated in Delphian Open, which I converted to outlines and either removed the white parts or moved the black parts together. I also manipulated the outline of the R to pull the tail down and outward a bit. I used a white square to block out the left leg of the A and it even created the same gap between the R and A. If \"Squooshing\" includes stretching, that's what was needed here (maybe you could do that as vertical \"squooshing\", but I actually widened the characters). If exactness was needed I would have played much longer, but I think I showed how this was probably done.   \n ![GraceDelphian](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201030923im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24695.gif)\n\n"
