      "content": "Hello, I have many letters that were hand-written in German with the Sutterlin font. These date from the early 1930s. Since this was the time when Hitler came into power, they would contain interesting historical information. Therefore, I would like to translate them, but I cannot read this script. This is also so because of variations in the handwritings.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThank you very much.\n\n[“Heroes from the Attic: A Gripping True Story of Triumph”](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017125619/http:/www.herobooks.com/)  \nA Memoir by Herman Neuman  \nMiraculous Survivor, Author, Inspirational Speaker  \nToastmasters International\n\n"

However, they often also offer translation into English, or at least can communicate in English.\n\nSearch for <cite>Sütterlin, Kurrent, transcription</cite> etc.  \nF\n\n"
