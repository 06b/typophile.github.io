They are inviting designers to create fonts inspired by children suffering from physical disabilities.  \nBesides the chopped Arial they used on the video (which reminded me of the [Fix Arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415041240/http:/www.typophile.com/battle36) topic), I think there are a couple of good fonts when we scroll down. But I still feel kind of sad knowing the guys who conceived this project couldn't think of any other way to represent disabilities other than cutting things off.\n\n",
