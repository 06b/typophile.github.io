This is both depressing and scary. Apparently, it's restricted to only certain denominations, but isn't restricted to just US currency. Also, there are many caveats to what exactly will and will not open. Does anyone else know anything about this?\n\n",

      "content": "This is actually not so exotic if you think about it. Every image has a histogram. I suspect they feed in a set of functions that approximate various currency histograms (and you can do these in RGB, LAB, CMYK or who knows how many models) and if the approximations fit closely enough, Photoshop won't let you do it.   \n   \nThere would have to be other factors as well to keep someone from putting a big lump of color next to the bill to throw off its historgram. Fascinating stuff!   \n   \nThe easy way around this is open source software like the GIMP. The scary thing is requiring these tests to be done at the hardware level. I'd be surprised if the latest scanners from the leading brands didn't all have similar routines in their hardware. Once that happens, your problem is getting the image into the program.   \n   \nThen there are the printers. I'd bet they're targeting those as well. Especially the cheap disposable CrapJet printers where all the RIPping is done in the OS printer driver.   \n   \nPerhaps a clever dumpster diver could salvage one of the unprotected models before they all go Big Brother.   \n   \nIt would also have been interesting if Adobe had only protected US currency and not the Euro. That way they could (literally!) manipulate the world currency market. Counterfeit Euros would be very healthy for the US economy right now. :-/\n\n"

No fancy histogram checks, no image content recognition. Just a simple pattern detection algorithm.   \n   \nNew versions of JASC Paint Shop Pro and Ulead PhotoImpact also contain this currency detection algorithm. A current proposal will require this of all image editing software.   \n   \nThere are ways around the system. Opening it in Photoshop 7, hiding the layer and then re-opening it in Photoshop CS works. Or you can scale the image larger than 150% or smaller than 75%. The Treasury Board also said they will give out electronic versions which do not contain the protective pattern if you ask nicely.   \n   \nI'm curious to see the result of adding this pattern to an original artwork. Will it still open in Photoshop CS? Does Photoshop look for more than just the EURion Constellation when determining what is a bank note?\n\n"
