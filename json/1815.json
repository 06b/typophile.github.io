Whenever I have   \nthe @ glyph previewing, it shows whatever is in the   \nglyph window instead of what is actually in the cell.   \nDoes anybody have a solution or have the same   \nproblem?\n\n",

      "content": "This is a feature. The @ sign is a wildcard, which shows the currently selected glyph. This is very useful because you can build a small set of preview strings to check any glyph in particular contexts, e.g. [nn@nn](mailto:nn@nn) and [oo@oo](mailto:oo@oo) for basic spacing tests.   \n   \nIf you need to display the @ sign in the preview window, use the convention /at . The slash is an escape character in preview strings after which you can identify a glyph by its name.   \n   \nYou can also use the convention \\XXXX in which the variable is a Unicode character hex value.\n\n"

If you want to see the   \n@ character, and not what's in the glyph window, type \"/at\".   \nYou can do this for any character that can't easily be typed   \nor can't be typed at all. Just type a slash followed by the   \nname of the character. You may need to type a space after   \ndepending on what follows.\n\n"
