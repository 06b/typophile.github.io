It’s a game of letters, the whole alphabet will pop up whilst flicking through the pages and some of transform into other letters. The I becomes a K, the K an I depending on which strap you draw. I t plays with sweet little effects. like mirror and transparent paper to get different letters from the same “base”. Check out the [video](http://web.archive.org/web/20090713040843/http:/www.metacafe.com/watch/1186973/abc3d/), a loveley presentation of the book with very fun music [[2]](http://web.archive.org/#foot_2), which surely describes it better than my words...  \nFunny story behind the commercialisation is, the apparently unwanted marketing campaign. A [youtube video](http://web.archive.org/web/20090713040843/http:/www.abc3dbook.com/) showing the book has been circulating.
