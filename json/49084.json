Would you sketch and then scan and then use illustrator? What is the best way to do that in illustrator?\n\nSorry if my questions seem novice but I really would love an insight.\n\nJay\n\n"

A technique I learned from Stephen Rapp. Then I scanned it in and traced it in Illustrator CS3. I have to admit I did a lot of cleanup on this logo and it shows. I am still a novice when it comes to the wonderful world of lettering. :)\n\nHave a great weekend,\n\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira\n\n[www.borgeslettering.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201145508/http:/www.borgeslettering.com/ \"www.borgeslettering.com\")\n\n"
