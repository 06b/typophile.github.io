There’s kerning issues in almost every word, extra bold capital letters paired with bold cap letters, and the words do not have a proper baseline. The more you look at it the more problems you find. It’s kind of annoying to look at after a few minutes.\n\nMegaflicks sign  \n [http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e57/davemathew76/megaflicks.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090611035153/http:/i37.photobucket.com/albums/e57/davemathew76/megaflicks.jpg)  \nThis is a video store sign. The picture is pixelated, but I just thought this example of bad type was funny. There’s terrible kerning that makes the letters too close together to spell something else. Check it out.\n\n",

It’s typographic folk art, and it’s a great example of what someone can do who has no training and few tools (a lettering template in three sizes: large, colossal, and humongous), but who has imagination and knows exactly what message he/she wants to communicate. When I see a that sign, I think, “I want to eat here.”\n\n"
