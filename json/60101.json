I am still trying to brain storm more concepts, but i am having a bit of trouble turning out new ideas. This may also be due to a family emergency i have been dealing with this week.\n\nhere is a question.. when u guys are stuck on a concept.. what brain storming techniques do u use to get things going... I know of taking breaks, getting fresh air etc.. but when your ready to attack your problem what are some things u do?\n\n"

Then, either a) you'll accidentally stumble upon something that works or b) you can fix the mistakes in your fake logo and in the process maybe come up with something that works. Or you could just end up with a really bad crayon rendering of Papyrus :-)\n\n- Lex\n\n"

Both remind me of one of my all time favorite logos: [Nine Inch Nails' famous NIN](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023204005/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Nine_Inch_Nails_logo.svg).\n\nThe middle of E, S, and E aren't align with each other in the current RESET version. And what about taking off the wings of that arrow (the fins?) and simply leaving it as a clean spear point? Would match the straight edges of the rest of the type in my eyes.\n\n"
