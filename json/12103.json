Drawing from the artistic and cinematic influences of his native Hollywood and the golden age of sign painting, designer [Jason Walcott](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001116/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jason%20Walcott) tries to capture the glamour and spirit of this era in his type designs. This library maintains an arguably American feel.\n\nThe Jukebox foundry (formerly known as JAW Fonts) was acquired by [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001116/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer) in 2003 - [Press Release](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205001116/http:/www.veer.com/about/pressroom/releases/veer_pr_jbaquis_release.aspx). The Jukebox library is distributed exclusively by Veer in North America.\n\n",
