      "content": "\\> May this be a custom work?\n\nI guess that for logos, this is a likely occurrence. It is interesting to notice that in the SDMO leaflets, when they need a \"compound\" logo, either they use another font for \"SDMO\" or mix the original logo with some other font. Here is an example\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022054823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MicsTELYS_5255.jpg)\n  \nwhere, according Acrobat, the font used for \"Mics TELYS\" is \"Ostara\" (?). This being said, I am no designer. \n"
