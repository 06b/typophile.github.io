  "content": "Any thoughts on Requiem for a wedding invitation?\n\nI'm just beginning to brainstorm for this project but I'm open to recommendations for sans serifs that might work well with Requiem. I'm a bit concerned that this font might be a bit too formal/elegant as a standalone font family for this project. Requiem is simply gorgeous and I'd be thrilled if I can pair it with a modern/contemporary sans to tone it down a bit. Any ideas? I'm trying to stay away from flourishes and scripts but am looking for something clean, modern and elegant. Maybe a sans?\n\nA separate thought is something along the lines of Aviano without Requiem. Clean, modern, sophisticated. I'm also very much drawn to Jana Thork but am not sure about the uncial approach for this project.\n\nI recently purchased Ministry Script for my own wedding invites and am thrilled with the results.\n\nThanks for any help that you can offer.\n\nJosh\n\n",
