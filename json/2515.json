A kind of \"Wish you were here\" on the postcard sort of thing.   \n   \nAlso may need to have a somewhat thicker stroke width than your average handwritten face to ensure good legibility on screen and/or when layered over photographs with bright/tropical colors.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \n -t\\</font\\>\n\n",
