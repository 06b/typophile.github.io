The original book appears to have been published in 1962, when handlettering was still a mainstay of any art-school curriculum, and publishers often used handlettering on book covers and jackets, as is the case here. The two **B** s are not identical, nor are the two **a** s. (It's harder to see the differences in the three **e** s, but they aren't identical, either.)\n\n[Baker Signet](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014072713/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baker-signet/) is similar, though it doesn't have the single-story **g**.\n\n"
