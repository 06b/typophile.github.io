  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm a graphic design university student going into my final year and have chosen to do my dissertation on the use of typography in architecture.\n\nMost of the resources on this topic focus on signage or wayfinding systems, but I would like to look at buildings where typography is much more integral to the overall design; this could be as part of the actual building (such as the wales millennium centre) or separate but in a way that really adds to the overall impact of the design.\n\nI'm struggling to find good examples of this, especially in the UK where I stand a better chance of being able to talk to architects/typographers involved in the project – I'm appealing for suggestions please! I know there are a couple of other posts in this forum related to this and I've already checked the references out. REally helpful but I jsut need more examples really\n\nAny suggestions of buildings that use typogrpahy or related resources would really be appreciated, thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "wow, thanks everyone! This is all really useful stuff. It brings up some interesting questions that I've been trying to work out myself too e.g. where does the line come between type that is truly integrated with the building and type that is just an addition? At first I thought I'd just assume that if the type is 'part of the building' e.g. carved into it, then it's integrated, but I think it's more complex than that – loads of old buildings have engraved letters that don't really make much impact on the design and then you'll find a building that has type effectively as a sign stuck onto it, such as Fukutake House suggested by satya, but the type is much more integral to the overall design. Any thoughts?\n\nIf people are interested here are some of the best examples I've found so far:  \nOXO tower, Wales Millennium Centre, TVAM building in Camden, Milan Polytechnic College, Graduate House of Toronto University, ESISAR school of engineering in France, South African Constitutional Court. I've also happened across some mentions of Fortunato Depero who seemed to be part of a futurist movement and designed structures/buildings that were entirely type for advertising purposes, but I haven't been able to find much information on him. Does anyone know anything about him?\n\nThe Steingruber Alphabet suggestion is really interesting – I'll definitely be looking into this more! As for Nicolete Gray, I agree; she is definitely the main source of writing on this subject. I've found her book Lettering on Buildings, which I think includes most of the articles Iore mentions, as well as Alan Bartram's Lettering in Architecture and Jock Kinneir's Words and Buildings. A few other books are slightly related but those are the best I've found so far. Does anyone know of any more recent books on the subject? The most recent of these is 1980 and using typography and architecture has become a lot more common in the last few years I think?\n\nSorry for the length of this post!\n\n"

I call it 'Typotecture: typographic elements applied to architectural design'.\n\nI started carrying out research on it while I was doing my undergraduate studies in Greece (5 years ago). At that period, I tried to define typotecture, record and analyse its history with emphasis to contemporary examples (using many of the ones listed above) and evaluate it. At the RCA, my intention is to develop it further, especially in practice using current digital tools (scripting, 3d modeling, rapid prototyping).\n\nIn my opinion, one of the 'good examples' of typotecture - maybe the best - is the Marion Cultural Centre in Australia (last picture), where the boundaries between typography and architecture become blurred. It is one of the few cases where a visitor trying to read the name (semantics) of the building ends up reading the structure of it.\n\nAs you have already noticed, the information for this subject is limited and fragmentated, but this should be a reason for you to continue and not be frustrated!\n\nKeep up the research!!!\n\nI'll be in touch!\n\nchrisostomost\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223937im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Typotecture_3927.jpg)\n\n"
