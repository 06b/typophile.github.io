Is there anything out there that you guys could point me to?\n\nOr could you give me a quick run-down? Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019074347im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Embossed_5538.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Here's a simple way:\n\n1. Make the background black  \n2. Create new layer and add the blue color and add bevel&emboss/contour to it.  \n3. Write the text (a new layer is automatically created)  \n4. Rasterize this layer  \n5. Use the wand, mark the type and select the blue layer..  \n6. ..and hit delete.\n\nVoilla!\n\n"

      "content": "If you're using Photoshop, there is an even easier way and it leaves the text editable.\n\nTo mimic this example:  \n1. Make the background blue  \n2. Add your text in dark gray (as Northbay previously stated, this automatically creates a new layer)  \n3. Add a layer style to the text layer – Outer Bevel, direction down  \n4. There is no stage four\n\nThis is not necessarily the best way, but it's quick.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is to add a softened drop-shadow of the text in a lighter colour to mimic a highlight. You can even get an approximation of this effect in CSS (see [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019074347/http:/www.reynoldsftw.com/2009/03/text-embossing-technique-with-css/)) and throughout the iPhone UI, for example.\n\nMy quick example here is:  \n—Style: Outer Bevel  \n—Technique: Smooth  \n—Depth: 1%  \n—Direction: Down  \n—Size: 3 px (this is only a small test image, a higher-res image will be different)  \n—Soften: 5 px (same)  \n—Angle: 90º  \n—Highlight Opacity: 65%  \n—Shadow Opacity: 50%\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019074347im_/http:/typophile.com/files/outerbevel_4032.jpg)\n\n"
