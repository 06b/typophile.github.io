  "content": "I’ve got a book here, published in 1994. The textface is definitely [Bembo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415235617/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bembo). But there are a few minor differences compared to the Linotype/Monotype Bembo I know. The leg on the ‘R’ isn’t as extrem and the ascender/terminal on the ‘f’ doesn’t lean to right as far. The ‘W’ seems a bit narrower. Was/is there another version of Bembo?\n\n",

Monotype also makes a book version of Bembo; and Adobe has their own version of Bembo. If I had to guess, I would say it's one of these that accounts for the differences you are seeing.\n\n"

For the same reason it can’t be an alternate-glyph-opentype font. (I guess that’s what you meant by Roman Alternate, Aa.) It isn’t Adobe’s Bembo either.\n\n"

Even a few short italic words will do.\n\n"

This would account for the fact that there are no kerns (see italic f and Roman f, italic j etc.). I suppose that Roman J and italic J (which are not shown on the scans) will have no kerns too, because line-casting machines did not have kerned letters.\n\n"

Linotype would have still been possible in 1983, but Linotype in West Germany never sold a linecaster version of Bembo. That is the problem here.
