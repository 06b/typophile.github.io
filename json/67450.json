It must appeal to a younger client base (18-25) while not alienating the existing client base (45-60 age bracket). The key words for the brand are ACTION, SUCCESS and WINNING. The current font used is Eras, which is not fresh although does have a sense of action. I would like to get any suggestions on a serif and sans-serif pair based on the above criteria. Any opinions are appreciated.\n\n",
