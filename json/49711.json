  "content": "Hi!\n\nI'm currently working on my portfolio, so some constructive opinions will help me very much.  \nThe dimension is 20x20cm and it's meant to be printed. Here's a preview:\n\n[http://issuu.com/petar\\_pavlov/docs/portfolio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417045205/http:/issuu.com/petar_pavlov/docs/portfolio \"http://issuu.com/petar\\_pavlov/docs/portfolio\")\n\nSome of the fonts appear darker than they are at this preview.  \nI would like to know what do you think about the overall layout - is it engaging enough or it looks dull; size of the fonts (mind that one page is 20x20cm); and quality of the work.  \nThe headers and footer are still not applied, as well as the front page. There are more projects that I'm planning to include, so this is just a sneak-peak preview :)\n\nThanks in advance! and be harsh :)\n\n",

The text is brief which is also good.\n\nI noticed a big typo on the third spread\n\n\"Threat the words...\"\n\nshould read\n\n\"Treat the words...\"\n\nYou don't want to threaten words, they can be very powerful!\n\ngood luck.\n\n"

      "content": "I really like your portfolio/work. I think that font weight is to light that you are using in the captions either that or it is not communicating correctly in that PDF. Maybe use a thicker weight of the same font? I think it is engaging but the font would help be more \"cutting edge\" than just a caption.\n\n"
