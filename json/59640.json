  "content": "Hi there, since I've become involved with the fine art of typography, I've stumbled into some great looking historical types which, in many opinions, dind't receive the appropriate digital version yet - or haven't been digitized at all. Here are my first choices:\n\n1. The great VAFFLARD \"First Manner\" type - a more humanistic cut on the neoclassical genre. Bill Troop worked on it in the Nineties and has been so kind to show me his versions, both in the display and text size. We've talked about it one year ago in this thread:\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/47453](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123060102/http:/typophile.com/node/47453 \"http://typophile.com/node/47453\")\n\nI really hope Bill can get to a full working version, someday.\n\n(In the meantime, I'd suggest to take a look at his recently released Didot Display [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-display/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123060102/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-display/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-display/\") and Didot Headline [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-headline/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123060102/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-headline/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/didot-headline/\"), two titling types in the same vein).\n\n2. FONTANA, designed by Giovanni Mardersteig for the Collins dictionary in 1936 - a variation on Baskverille. A small example can be seen here: [http://www.typotheque.com/articles/microtypography\\_designing\\_the\\_new\\_col...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123060102/http:/www.typotheque.com/articles/microtypography_designing_the_new_collins_dictionaries \"http://www.typotheque.com/articles/microtypography\\_designing\\_the\\_new\\_collins\\_dictionaries\").\n\n3. DANTE, again by Mardersteig. The existing digital version is good, but it seems to lack the \"presence\" of the original metal version, which can be seen in this Flickr set by Florian Hardwig: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2402240423/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123060102/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2402240423/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2402240423/\")\n\n4. CALEDONIA, by W.A. Dwiggins. The \"New Caledonia\" version and the Bistream Transitional 511 (I had the chance to test the latter) seems too weak and miss old style figurals.\n\n",
