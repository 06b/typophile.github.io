I bought the whole lot and am uploading a picture of some of them - mirrored for your convenience.\n\nOf course I want to see them in action. What technique should I use? I do not know a print shop that uses wood type and have no press of my own.\n\nPerhaps you can recommend a website?\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142637im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Woodtype_5917.jpg)\n\n",
