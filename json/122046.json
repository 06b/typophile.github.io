Stroke thickness and spacing between stacks are similar. Letter-forms for the capital letters are generally similar but the numbers are quite different. Major differences in the capital letters include the lack of a spur on \\_G\\_, angled instead of horizontal terminals on \\_S\\_, the curved stroke and terminal angles on \\_C\\_ and \\_G\\_, and the bottom stroke on \\_J\\_.  \nComparison was made to the Stack specimen in my Letraset Product Manual. See the scan I posted in [http://typophile.com/node/107360](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421234843/http:/typophile.com/node/107360 \"http://typophile.com/node/107360\")  \nUnfortunately, Staxx is unusable for commercial purposes because it is an orphan font by a defunct company, and there does not seem to be any legal owner of the intellectual property in its digital fonts.  \nDon\n\n"
