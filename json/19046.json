Can you please help me with some tips on\n\na) Headline fonts  \nb) body text (what is the english term?) fonts\n\nMore specifically, I'm looking for a contemporary, technical feel, with good legibility. The book is on games of all kinds, so I am not looking for \"fantasy\"-type fonts.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
