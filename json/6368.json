  "content": "So the other day I bought this monolithic pine chest with a 3x3 arrangement of hefty drawers for $10, sanded off the [disgustingly thick] varnish and stain (man, was that a chore, even with a belt sander), and now I have a blank canvas so to speak. I've bought a nice reddish wood stain (and a matte varnish) for it, but I'd like to do something more than just restain it all one color. But I don't want to make it a freaky piece that can only be appreciated by a... freak. Any ideas? FYI, the dimensions in feet are about 3H x 6W x 2D, and it has a nice paneled top (like old wooden floors had). It was built on June 16, 1978, which is two days before I turned 10.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

Really quite ugly and very disappointing. To get a nice result you need to hand sand down with progressively finer sand paper, to avoid the splotchiness. Then you need to first put on a pre-treatment - do they call it 'conditioner' - that soaks in an prevents the stain from being too different on the summer and winter wood and getting the zebra effect. Then when you stain it will get a lovely natural look with the glow of the deeper color.   \n   \nGet a book on it for the details.   \n   \nThis is enough bother and the result lovely enough that you may not want to do more.\n\n"

The conditioner pre-soaks it somewhat, so you don't get such a stark contrast.   \n   \nIf you do decide to go the stain route, try the process first on a raw wood pine board, so you will have an idea about the result, and whether you like it.

In my art school hay-days, I used to make my own acrylic paint with Rhoplex AC33 acrylic emulsion. You could add a small amount of store-bought acrylic paint into a base of AC33 for a translucent color. Or you can add raw pigment into AC33.   \n   \nThis sort of thing can be done with matte medium or whatever, but I found AC33 to be a much better solution.   \n   \n_So I tried the stain on part of it, and it came out as complete mierda ... I don't want to bother with a conditioner_   \n   \nHave you ever used sanding sealer? With some [softer] woods, it can help to give you a more even finish. This may be akin to what William refers to as a conditioner.   \n   \nA side note: there are 2 additives that improve the brushability of paint. Floetrol for water-based (latex) and Penetrol for oil-based. I've never used them in anything other than house-painting, but they may improve your surface somewhat. In house-painting they make a rolled surface looked professionally sprayed, and a brushed surfaced look rolled. They may well make a finger-painted surface looked brushed, but I've never tried.\n\n"
