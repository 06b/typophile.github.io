As my type skills are very limited I was hoping you guys could give me some advice on how I could improve it.\n\nf\n\n [‹ Copy fitting exercises for students](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195826/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14469 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typophile Search Problems ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202195826/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36794 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The subject of the exhibition is “in focus”, and my piece will be about what focus your life has.\n\nI’m going to split the sentence into 4 parts, sort of like a puzzle. Each part will be printed on a transparent sheet. The four sheets are hanging from the roof on a straight line behind each other with 50 cm space between them. I’ll shrink the parts according to perspective, making the “whole picture” only visible from a certain point in the room.\n\nViewing just one of the sheets will not make any sense, and I’m trying to make it even more unrecognizable by building the letters with these lines and curves as seen above.\n\nHowever, I’m actually only looking for help on improving the actual shapes of the letters.\n\n"

It succeeds at what your objective is not, so your true objective, if actually achieved, is not readily apparent. This can be interpreted as failure.\n\nYour plan to break up the line of text on multiple planes is enough to make this difficult for the viewer. Don’t make it harder on them by using letter shapes that are not readily recognizable even when viewed from the angle that assembles the text. A simple geometric sans face such as a light weight of Futura should be enough if the letters are suspended in this multi-plane system.\n\n"

I feel that the **a** could use some changes too, maybe because the teardrop shape is a bit narrow. Also, there is less space between the strokes of the **y** than in the other characters shown here.\n\n"

When I was at Cranbrook, there were plenty of designers (Alen Hori, Scott Makela) “destroying legibility.” Trust me, that is what you are doing. It’s cool, really. But the problem is we are not seeing a photo of the installation, but instead a screen shot of the “perfect” view of the letter forms. I doubt most viewers will recognize them as type when you further fragment them as you describe. Futura is a wonderful, amazing font. When you break it up it wil resemble clearly drawn lines and shapes. When you stand at the perfect spot, the cosmos will come into focus and you will get the “aha!” moment you crave.\n\nH.
