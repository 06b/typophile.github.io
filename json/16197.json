I’m wanting to use Mayo dingborders ( [http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024907/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp \"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mayo.asp\")) for the subtitles, in a layout, and xpress get me in trouble. Mayo form words into borders and pressing space norùally create a blank border; but in xpress, it does not, putting instead a normal space... is there a solution\\* to force the log to use the font settings in the mayo formed words ?\n\n\\*Other than using Indesign. I would have prefered a lot, but xpress was installed in the computer when i arrived for the job, and the paper is too poor to buy Indesign only to please me and my ideas of opentyped fool titles and good typography.\n\n [‹ Font for guitar letterhead](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024907/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16185 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [This font is sick! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024907/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16244 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Some programs assume that the regular space character is blank and only use the width. I’m not sure why. In these cases, the non-breaking space (option-space) may work.\n\n"
