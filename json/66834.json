Or, just as well, it might have been drawn completely from scratch. Keep in mind that not every letter is part of a font.\n\nIf you are looking for fonts in a similar style, [the Sudtipos foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20130805214739/http:/sudtipos.com/home) is a good starting point.  \nF\n\n"

      "content": "I think what a lot of us forget is that lettering like this has been done for a longer time than there have been computers, and probably will always continue to be. The reason is that an artist can always see potential in a word or phrase to do things that express personality, design, or style, that a computer font would never be able to accomplish. Even in these days with some remarkably clever OpenType designs, there is a limit to the ways you can expect a font to do things. There are no such limits on what an accomplished lettering artist can do. [Here is a link](http://web.archive.org/web/20130805214739/http:/www.calligraphersguild.org/julian.html) to an article by Julian Waters, a skilled calligrapher and lettering artist, writing about Calligraphy, Lettering and Typeface Design. There are some links at the bottom of it that can take you to more examples of the work of lettering artists.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
