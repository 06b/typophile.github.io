  "content": "Hey All,   \n   \nI'm working on a dingbat font and want to create it using only cross platform (Mac and PC) slots without any custom encodings . . .   \n   \nMy question is, what is my max slots and what are they?   \n   \nBy my count so far it's:   \n   \nA-Z - 26   \na-z - 26   \n0-9 - 10   \nshift 0-9 - 10   \n-\\_=+[]{}|;':\",./\\<\\>? - 20   \n   \nThat would be 92 by my count . . .   \n   \nAm I missing any? Do I have some I shouldn't? BTW, I do not wish to include the space character slot in this count . . .   \n   \nThanks All!   \nStuart :D\n\n",

For instance, people using Central European keyboard layouts won't be able to access some of these characters, but they all exist in both MacRoman and Windows ANSI. Also, some people may not be able to figure out how to type a lot of these, even if they are accessible.   \n   \nIn any case, it might be best to stick with characters that can be typed using only shifted and unshifted keys. That would rule out most of what I've listed above (except the backslash), at least on US keyboards.\n\n"
