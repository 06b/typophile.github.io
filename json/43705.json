They want the Snag part to be bold and masculine but the clothing part to be smaller and have a bit of contrast between the two. This is what I have come up with. Does anyone think this looks good? Can anyone suggest anything?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019123051im_/http:/typophile.com/files/20BayViewTrail001_6722.jpg)\n\n",

As for the lower line, I’ll quote Jan Tschichold: “It is generally wrong to letter lines not containing the same width just in order to achieve a squared off effect.”. That lower line reeks of work that was rushed or simply done with little interest. It’s a pretty generic solution that I often see on badly designed signs in front of government buildings.\n\n"

If the tag is on a pair of jeans, I don't think it's necessary to tell someone that it's clothing. Perhaps this goes outside of your typography based inquiry and into branding (which you may or may not even be able to change), but it may free you up from what James was getting at.\n\nOddly enough, diesel's logo is somewhat similar to your approach, but theirs works a little better because they aren't trying to force-justify the tagline.  \n [http://www.pittimmagine.com/cimgs/diesel-logo200.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019123051/http:/www.pittimmagine.com/cimgs/diesel-logo200.jpg \"http://www.pittimmagine.com/cimgs/diesel-logo200.jpg\")\n\n"

That being said, it's hard to give one a \"masculine\" typeface. You don't want to fall into a stereotype, and use some faux-photocopied grunge font, or some chunky ultra-bold / slab serif just to evoke a feeling of masculinity. I think nearly any typeface, depending on how you dress it (no pun intended) can have the potential to serve a masculine purpose. I'd imagine the fashion style would be the biggest influence. Is it like american apparel, abercrombie & fitch, Banana republic, ralph lauren?\n\n"
