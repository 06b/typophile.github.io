I don't have any suggestion for the V's, I hate drawing that letter myself.   \n   \n- Consider adding a curve to the stem of the 7.   \n   \n- Consider lengthening the bar of the E (but not the F).   \n   \n- Something about the at-sign doesn't seem right.   \n   \n- The pound and percent signs are really wide!   \n   \nPaul\n\n"

      "content": "Hi David,   \n   \nit also reminds me in a good way to House Gothic, a very nice type.   \nI totally agree with Paul. I have some personal things to add too:   \n- Try thickening the diagonal in the UC 'S'   \n- The '+' and '#' signs are a little heavy   \n- The 'z's bother me a little. It's the round foot.   \n- Try making the bars on the '$' thicker. I think they are to thin.   \n- Although I like it, the \\* doesn't seem to fit. Hmm... maybe it's me.   \n- Try moving the diagonal in the '?' down. Perhaps that opens it up a little more.   \n- Shouldn't the downscore be a little more down?   \n   \nBut nevertheless it's a very nice type. I see good potential for it. Good work in only three days.   \n   \nI'd like to use it.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"

      "content": "Hi David,   \n   \nSome things that catch my eye:   \n- the lc 'k' should be wider   \n- the 'v' and 'w' are not my favorite. I think the UC 'W' is wide or has at least to much white in it   \n- try changing the curve in the '2' and 'z'. It's strange and destroys the balance   \n- move the bar of the lc 'f' a little up. That's no problem   \nthe belly of the UC'Y' could go a little bit down. It feels now not heavy enough at the bottom.   \n- the 'o' in the %-sign could be a little less wide if you ask me.   \n   \nThese are just the things that personally bothered me. It's up to you as the designer how you want your type to look. I think making the changes would make the type more homogenious.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"
