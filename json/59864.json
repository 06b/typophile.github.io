I re-designed the \"T\" though (below) 'cause it looked more like a \"C\".\n\nI just bought this new one and what a pleasure to use! Now I have a complete character set. I can especially see the difference when I outline it. Very smooth, about 10 times fewer anchor points.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202224054im_/http:/typophile.com/files/book#3cover_72_6625.jpg)\n\n"
