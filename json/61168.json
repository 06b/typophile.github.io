  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWondering if anyone can offer me insight on this:\n\nI've been approached by a New York designer to supply my Halvorsen family free for a trial period, for the purposes of a pitch. That is, the designer wants to purchase but needs to design some roughs first for management approval, and requests access to the fonts in order to do so. The designer named another foundry (whom I have emailed for verification) which has previously supplied fonts in this way.\n\nThis seems a dangerous practice to me. Even though I have no reason to doubt the honesty of the designer, I'm just wondering if anyone else has been approached in this way and if so, what other solutions are possible?\n\nThanks, Wayne | Australian Type Foundry\n\n",

Check out Font Bureau's [testing license](http://web.archive.org/web/20140729133959/http:/fontbureau.com/help/testing) for an example. It is based on the licensee's honesty, but, after all, so are standard license agreements.\n\n"
