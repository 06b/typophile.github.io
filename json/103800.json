The BQ and BT versions have minor differences.  \nThe character widths may have been expanded slightly.  \nYour image shows a font with small caps. Neither the BQ or BT Normande has this feature. I suspect the effect was created by the designer of \"Horse Event.\" Alternatively someone has created a variation on Normande, which is a very old design dating back to about 1860.  \nDon\n\n"
