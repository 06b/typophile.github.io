Any thoughts?\n\nOn a different note, check out the new HP logo at the start of the ad. There is a comment about it on [Brand New](http://web.archive.org/web/20110128115304/http:/www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/). I prefer the silver version to the blue.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110128115304im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hp_5310.png)\n\n",

But would it be easier to draw type if you could draw it (I don't mean with a pen and tablet but actually drawing on the screen where the picture appears.) Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about again? Someone put me straight.\n\n"
