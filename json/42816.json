The Hard points remind me of Bureau Eagle Bold ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/bold/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080308200024/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/bold/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/eagle/bold/\")), but it’s not that clunky.

Gill Sans Extra Bold is the first thing I thought of, too, although the “m” and “n” feel more like Eagle.\n\n"
