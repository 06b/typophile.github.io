The name of the font appears on the top of the scan together with the foundry name and the year but I haven't seen anything like this digitized. I think it looks wonderful and I was wondering how the rest of the letters of the alphabet look like. So please, if anyone has some examples similar with this it would be great!

I hope to be able to recreate it, especially now that I know how some of the letters look like. I was having trouble imagining how the letters X, K, and Y would look like. And yes, the typeface was cut by Edwin Ruthven from the Loy's book. Thank you again!\n\nStefan\n\n"

My experience in making this type of font is that it works well if you get the basic letter forms right before doing the punch outs and additions such as balls attached by tendrils, or mustache split ends. Good luck with your project.  \nDon\n\n"
