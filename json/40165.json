  "content": "Hi Typophiles!\n\nI’m currently “working” on a table for easy typeface–finding and I need some help putting it to the test. I’ve looked at different faces and set them up in my table, but I need some extreme examples (stuff that does not usually happen). So I’m asking for your help in looking for some faces that:\n\nA) Have VERY high x-ascender ratio  \nB) Have VERY low x-ascender ratio\n\nJust a couple of faces of each should be enough (I don’t want to steal much of your time).\n\nI’ll post the table as soon as I have something interesting to show, as it’s in its early stages.\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\n [‹ spex - font](http://web.archive.org/web/20071221230414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40160 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Calgary: December meeting ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071221230414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40042 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
