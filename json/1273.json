It must have come from a German font house, and considering that blackletter -which was used almost exclusively in Germany until about the middle of WWII- has very different control characters than roman, I'd guess that that famous test string is from the 1950s. In fact it also seems to me to be the sort of analytical stuff Zapf might have played a part in.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

He believes—quite credibly, I might add—that the word was created as a test at the [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20101216073937/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) foundry, before the Second World War.\n\nThe \"author\" would then be [Dr. Rudolf Wolf](http://web.archive.org/web/20101216073937/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Dr.%20Rudolf%20Wolf) (died 1942), who among other things was the designer of the Memphis type family. [August Rosenberger](http://web.archive.org/web/20101216073937/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/August%20Rosenberger) may have been involved as well. Rosenberger cut several of Memphis' weights, and would later cut designs of Hermann Zapf's, including Palatino.\n\n[Otmar Hoefer](http://web.archive.org/web/20101216073937/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Otmar%20Hoefer) addes to me that this was by no means a universal word.
