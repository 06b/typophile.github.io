Thus, this web application has now emerged as something more than a tool to create Kufi arabic calligraphy - it has become a Typogrid.\n\nTechnical Features:  \n- User-friendly interface  \n- Export as SVG and PNG  \n- Import SVG files  \n- Compatible on iPad, Tablets and smart phones\n\n-  \nQassim Haider\n\n",
