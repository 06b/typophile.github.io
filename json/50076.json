  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking at designing books for a sports book publisher. To that end I want to choose one serif and one sanserif type family which can be applied to all books, but are large enough to allow for a decent amount of variation.\n\nThe serif I think should be clean and modern, with a serious touch. Right now I'm considering [Utopia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019152240/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/utopia/). For the sans I would like a lot of weights, and also oblique forms (preferably true italics). I'm thinking serious, but with a twist. [Interstate](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019152240/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/) has occurred to me, but I'm not sure how well it works together with Utopia.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n/Måns\n\n",
