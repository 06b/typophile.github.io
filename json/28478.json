You need also to think about the page layout.\n\nWill you have large type or small? How long will the line be (measure)? How much leading will you use? And what is the mood of the subject matter, and the mood you want to convey as an author? Also, how will the final product be printed? By laser; by offset?\n\nThe answers to these and other questions will tell you more about what face is most appropriate. Of course, these will interact with the faces you try: if you have latitude you can try different faces with different layouts to come up with a good solution. For example, I think that the small x-height of Adobe Garamond Pro makes it work best at larger text sizes.\n\nOh, if you haven't read Bringhurst, do--you will find it a revelation.\n\n"
