  "content": "Hi Everybody,\n\nI've been lurking around these forums for a while and found them very interesting and enlightening; plenty of good ideas and a very healthy level of participation, I think.\n\nAnyways, a few friends and I recently started a small, highly focused IT / software development and consulting firm and so were looking at getting a new identity and image to go with it. After going through several proposals and explorations for our logo, we eventually settled on the one I'm attaching.\n\nWould love to hear any comments you might have on it :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [devdeo-logo-small.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019091728/http:/typophile.com/files/devdeo-logo-small.png) | 8.13 KB |\n\n",

I don't mind the colours. it speaks of a friendly company though, which I presume you were after.\n\n[Communication Design, Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019091728/http:/www.solid-creative.com/)\n\n"

You could adjust the ev kerning slightly tighter.  \nHave you tried any other separators a [modified virgule](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019091728/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgule) might sit better with the geometric letterforms.  \nTim\n\n"

We kinda liked how the ( gave the logo some space, but you might be right we could find some other interesting separator.\n\nI sort of agree with your comment on the o, but a plain o just looked too weird to me. Might be wrong about that, though :) Haven't seen anyone I showed it to confused about it's meaning, fortunately, but I'd love to find something else to offset the effort.\n\nAs for the ev kerning, good catch, I'll see to modifying that.\n\nFWIW, all the text (including the '(') is just plain old Century Gothic. The final o as it stands right now is just the greek small sigma, while the two e's are the cyrillic capital E and the cyrillic capital ukranian le respectively. We sort of chose them because it game some simmetry to the logo (and we software developer types like symmetry ;))\n\n"

How do you want this mark to work for you? Logo making is not just tinkering with letters. I imagine this sounds harsh. I don't mean it to be.\n\n"

As for the entire name of the company, well that's the name we choose, and honestly, it is meaningful to us, though not something anyone else would recognize (and frankly they don't need to, either).\n\nThe other thing is that we most definitely didn't want to end up with a \"common\" logo for an IT shop with, say, a clunky computer clipart :) And we wanted something more sober, with very simple lines.\n\n"

      "content": "This is an interesting discussion. FWIW, the \"deo\" in our name is a degeneration of \"neo\" (\"new\"), which was something we wanted to represent in our name but couldn't use directly (because of another company that used those three letters in an unrelated way).\n\nEben did say something that struck me as odd. He said \"it sounds like you are saying that the logo’s purpose is to look a certain way but not mean anything\". I didn't mean that at all. I consider the logo to represent the company and the company's name, that's the purpose. Our company name is devdeo, and that's what I'd like the logo to reflect. Now, whether the company name means something or not that's another story, I guess.\n\nI'd agree that, yes, the name might not be as explicit as other names (like Ratbaggy says \"Development and Consulting Technologies\"). Problem is, pretty much all the other company names in this business around here have names based on that sort of thing and honestly, it's not very pretty.\n\nA second problem with that approach is language: We are located in south america (colombia to be precise) and our language is spanish. Hence, choosing a meaningful name in that sense would've meant using a spanish name. Nothing wrong with that per-se, but the problem is we also have international customers, most english speaking, and so the spanish name just wouldn't have worked very well there (at least that was our opinion, we might be wrong). So, we decided to go with something that would work well (i.e. was easy to recognize for both sets of audiences). Yes, while the 'dev' part is intentionally english-ish, it is a commonly used prefix here for things related to software development and thus easily recognizable.\n\n"

What I'm not sure I'm understanding correctly is whether you have an issue with the logo itself or the company name (or both). The company name is what it is (if you don't like it, fine, but that's the name we choose and that's the name we're sticking with), the logo is a different matter. If you get a customer requesting a logo, do you force them to change their name because you don't like it? :)\n\nBut I've explained our reasons for choosing the logo and the \"letter tweaks\" as you call them, and so far haven't seen anyone saying anything about it. Maybe you don't agree with them, and that's fine again, but I'd love to hear anyone explicitly say why they suck, instead of just arguing about the company name :)\n\n"

It sounds a bit like you are saying 'codegod' which might mean 'we code well'. That is just what it sounds like to me.\n\nI guess what I still don't understand is what the devdeo logo is meant to suggest if anything. You said 'modern' & 'focused' so far but really you could say more. And you could even work off the fact that you are in Columbia. That could be very effective. Effective at what? you may ask. What's the big deal?\n\nTo me the devdeo logo far while okay in it's way ( really! it doesn't suck or anything ) is also a bit too similar to other logos in approach. It makes it too forgetable. I guess I am saying why not try more ideas? Why not set out with an idea about the specific assumptions you want somebody to make about you when the see the logo - and cultivate that impression specifically. And make the logo more memorable. It's \\*way\\* more work but if you succeeed they logo will work harder for the company.\n\n"

I was just responding to Tomas when he said:\n\n\"not something anyone else would recognize (and frankly they don’t need to, either).\"\n\nThis sounded to me like like they were making a part of the logo and name that was not functional. To me this sounded like he was maybe saying \" Well, okay; this logo thing, it's not that important. I mean, if half of it means something to the customer - that's enough.\"  \nThat sounded less that ideal to me. Thats all. If the 'e' works or not is just one aspect of a logo.\n\nRE: \"If you get a customer requesting a logo, do you force them to change their name because you don’t like it? :)\"\n\nForce them? Never. But convince them; if it's for the good of the business. Sometimes. Yes! I have actually convinced clients to change their whole identity. Name, logo & everything. Sometimes that old identity had even won awards. But the reason to do it can never to do with my own likes or dislikes. How I feel is irrelevant. The reason to change a logo (or occasionally a name) must to do with effective marketing of the company and it's services. One client of mine was holding onto an award winning logo that no longer worked for them. Why wasn't it working? It related to a business model they were no longer using and which had publically failed. Even though the old logo had won an award it was not serving the business interests of the company anymore - the new logo helped them get 1.25 M in venture funding. The new logo served the new business interests of the comany & helped them say: we are a new company with a new outlook and a new business model.\n\nSometimes a logo is meant to work with consumers. Sometimes other companies. Sometimes with investors. Sometimes a combination. But it's wise to think about the purpose of a name & a logo and craft it to be effective for your goals.\n\nTomas, the fact that you use the word 'force' in your question tells me I am making my arguements to you in a way that is too strong. So I will stop questioning your approach to logo making here. I have made my point - probably too many times. If I can be helpful to you regarding the shape of an 'e' let me know.\n\n"
