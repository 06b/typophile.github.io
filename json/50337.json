Now i went a few days ago to the streets to search ideas and i found one lettering from a paint car shop. there wasnt the all alphabeth but i try to design it completely and this was my result.(i think its like a modular system)  \nbye  \nMatias Nahrwold  \nChile\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121145742im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00173_5869.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121145742im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00174_3828.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121145742im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00175_5629.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121145742im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00088_6489.JPG)\n\n",

      "content": "Nice drawings!  \nIf you do get stuck on certain characters, try using a paint brush to draw. This will allow a natural flow of the strokes. The rounded terminals are a dead-give-away to this style of type.  \nI also noticed that your numbers, or figures, are looking very blocky. The numbers in your reference photo fit better with the typeface. Try drawing the numbers with a similar stroke contrast to the lower case letters so that all the characters will harmonize with the design.\n\nKeep up the good work!  \nTerrance\n\n"
