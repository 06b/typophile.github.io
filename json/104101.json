It's definitely Art Deco based in my searching I saw some similar with the flair on the A/R/ along with the shallow M. But none quite as squared off.\n\nAll that lower arc distortion is done via text warp in either Ps or Illy or whateva...\n\nThanks!\n\n"

Lots of letters follow the R model. You could adapt an O to the A. Not quite as cornered as your sample but it might do as a rough match. Or you could do some blending with Compacta.  \nDon\n\n"

Once I got the font into Illy it was plain to see that that effect can be achieved via a mesh ...after it was mangled in Illy it was stroked in Ps and then hit with a grunge effect.\n\nNo wonder you didn't recognize one of your own ...LOL!\n\n"
