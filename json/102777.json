Everything works perfectly except the kerning.\n\nMS word 2010 doesen't take count of the kerning of my new font...  \nKerning works perfectly on Oppen office, but I have to make it work on MS word. Is it possible ?\n\nSomebody knows what is the problem ? Can somebody help me ?\n\nThanks for help :)  \n1nordman\n\n",
