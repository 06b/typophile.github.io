Based in the Visual Communication Department at the Glasgow School of Art the work of the five members moves from the typographic elements and traditions of letterpress through comic books, landscape photography, international graphic foraging, through to the interface between digital media and colour perception. In the second half of the talk Out of Print member Edwin Pickstone will introduce his own work, in which he seeks to find value in, and evaluate the position of, the now commercially redundant process of letterpress.\n\nSteve Rigley is the Programme Leader for Graphic Design, whilst Edwin Pickstone works as Artist / Designer in Residence, spending the majority of his time caring for and working within the School’s sizeable letterpress facility.\n\n",
