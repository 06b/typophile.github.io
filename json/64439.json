(Taken from youtube so a little blurry).\n\n[http://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/23/2399346a3eb304aed87e9874275466...](http://web.archive.org/web/20091120171244/http:/wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/23/2399346a3eb304aed87e9874275466d2.29253.jpeg \"http://wtf2.myfonts.com/uploads/images/23/2399346a3eb304aed87e9874275466d2.29253.jpeg\")\n\nAny one with any idea? I think its defining characteristic is the way it sloopes downward at the top of the D, R and downward at the bottom of the U’s, G, etc.\n\nAny help would be sweet\n\n",
