It is incredibly legible at small sizes, with its tiny ascenders and descenders. First thought it was HM Revenue & Customs Modena, but it's not...\n\nMight be an easy one, I must confess.\n\nThanks in advance...\n\n",

But, the one in my flickr looks kinda different from [Modena from HM Revenue & Customs](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112083328/http:/customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/downloadFile?contentID=HMCE_PROD1_027379). Specially the 'a' and the 'y'. The ascenders and descenders are shorter than HM R&C type, too, which I'm starting to think is not called Modena, perhaps?\n\n"

The HMRC fonts are listed as IRModena.\n\nIt appears to me that the x-height is increased in the condensed, relative to the letter height, and that the descenders are brought up in pro.\n\n"
