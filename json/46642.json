Rarities that TypeCon attendees can see in person include Aldine and Jenson books, a Gutenberg bible leaf, The Doves bible and many classic presses and printers including Kelmscott, Grabhorn and Bruce Rogers.\n\nIn addition the library is currently exhibiting: _The American Vandal Abroad: Mark Twain’s Travel Writing 1866-1897_ in the Mark Twain Room of the Central library. The Twain room features the original manuscript of Huckleberry Finn and Twain letters and publications from around the world.\n\nThe exhibits will be on display throughout July during regular library hours.\n\nAlso inside the Central Library is Fables Café, a popular lunch spot adjacent to the Encore Editions bookshop where deaccessioned library materials are offered for sale.\n\nThe library is located at 1 Lafayette Square just blocks from the Hyatt Hotel.\n\n[http://bflobookarts.blogspot.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907011035/http:/bflobookarts.blogspot.com/ \"http://bflobookarts.blogspot.com/\")  \n [http://www.typecon.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907011035/http:/www.typecon.com/ \"http://www.typecon.com/\")\n\n [‹ Art of the Movie Title](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907011035/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46600 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Which type face is this? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907011035/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46667 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Having a Doves Bible in a Doves binding placed into my hands was a humbling experience. It is a lot smaller than you would imagine in person (like most celebrities I suppose). There may even be an Ashendene book in the exhibit, Eben!\n\nI checked, sheep are not allowed in the library. Sorry.\n\n"
