  "content": "hi people,\n\ni am searching for a typesface or a combination of typefaces that, if well set, can communicate a premium experience. it's a bit difficult to explain, i am working on a wordmark for a premium brand in the real estate sector -\n\nthe design elements would be the brand itself + a corresponding travel destination (like toscana or bretagne, et cetera..). a two part wordmark basically -\n\nany suggestions would be great - currently i am working with a combination of something like bodoni/didot with trade/smth. comparable (but a face less classical and more contemporary (younger faces) would be interesting, too -\n\nany suggestion? time to write some down?\n\nbest + kind regards,\n\nsteffen :)\n\n",

They are bursting with classy modern faces. Their website showcases them in a nice way as well that may help you see qualities in typefaces that may not be apparent at first.\n\nThere are others, of course, but H&F-J came to mind first (as they often do for me).\n\n"

I've used their Andrade Pro for some higher end cultural stuff, its a bit less formal than Didot/Bodoni, especially in regards to the Serifs which are a bit softer (esp. good for a display face) it may sit well with a more modern humanist sans-serif (I used Priva for ex.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018035839im_/http:/typophile.com/files/andrade_5505.jpg)\n\n"
