  "content": "So I saw this font in AIGA's 50 Books of 1962 book.  \nThe title of the book cover that includes the font is \"41st Annual of Advertising & Editorial Art & Design\"\n\nIt's very similar to Didot, but the 4's are very different. The closest 4 I've found is Bell MT.\n\nPlease help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [IMG\\_1422.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205050734/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_1422.JPG) | 110.67 KB |\n| [IMG\\_1421.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205050734/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_1421.JPG) | 125.04 KB |\n\n",
