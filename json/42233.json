Let me find an image of it and i will post it here.\n\nhere is a link...\n\n[http://i3.ebayimg.com/05/i/000/d4/d4/8856\\_10.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140928101605/http:/i3.ebayimg.com/05/i/000/d4/d4/8856_10.JPG \"http://i3.ebayimg.com/05/i/000/d4/d4/8856\\_10.JPG\")\n\nthanks!  \njosh\n\n",

Stockport is south Manchester and where I have spent lots of time.\n\nNote the 'FACTUS 1' on it which means FACT US no. 1 as in the USA version 1.00 release the first US release by Factory Records.\n\n"

I definitely remember him saying about the reluctance to include type on the outer sleeve, but I can't be sure about the 9pt Helvetica comment, I may have just imagined this, or its a mis-informed comment I've heard somewhere?\n\nUntil now, I've always just presumed it was Helvetica, but never really studied it up close... so I was wrong to say it definitely IS without checking - sorry.\n\nAfter more investigation, I now agree with Lex & Miss Tiffany - It's got to be Univers.\n\nAs I was checking my recently purchased 12\" Remastered Vinyl (2007) it has thrown up an interesting point. The UNKNOWN PLEASURES title appears to be set in DIN or Akzidenz?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140928101605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/UP_4290.jpg)\n\nIf you check out the next image, a sticker from the back, it claims to have 'original artwork' - I don't think so!\n\nThe sticker also reveals that the artwork was 're-editioned' by 'Something Else'... I think they have some explaining to do... I'm feeling a little cheated here!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140928101605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Sticker_3482.jpg)\n\n"

I have many US and UK CDs that are the same and My wife who's a Manc has UK version of the ones I have as US. Her UK Suede Cds aren't the same as my US 'London' Suede (??? they are Mancs!) and the songs are different.\n\nAnd to be honest I'm surprised I have the US version of Unknown Pleasures since most of the LPs I have from back then were 'Imported' since the first versions were never producted in the US until much later.\n\n"
