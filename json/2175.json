  "content": "This is the russian equivalent of the zip code/postal code. The standard envelopes (from the former USSR) came printed with the template of those faint dots on the front of the envelope where you would write the zip code numbers, based on the way shown in the example you posted (this was printed on the back flap of the envelope as instructions on writing the numerals). I'm not sure if there was a system of OCR in the Russian postal system, but this sure looks like an attempt at one.   \n   \nThere are similar typefaces that are based on a grid, mainly they're based on the way old Liquid Crystal Dispays in calculators were designed. But those had an extra 2 diagonals in the grid.   \n   \nI'm not sure there is a typeface based on this exact grid system. You might search [Paratype foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000841/http:/www.paratype.ru/) for something similar.\n\n",
