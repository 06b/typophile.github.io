Need to identify this font.\", I always liked the extra bit of info you mostly get when a type-Id request was made. And I also find it quite handy to know which roads the person who requested the ID has taken already (whatthefont etc) or what his/her guess is.\n\nBut to get back on topic: I haven't got a clue which font this is.\n\n"
