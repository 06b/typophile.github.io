It's very similar to one called \"Vanessa,\" but isn't quite the same. Any clues?\n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [bowfinpw](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414232306/http:/typophile.com/user/2088 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

Some sort of type styling software was used, possibly Photoshop, or Illustrator, and probably with some editing of features that didn't make good 3D shapes. I think Vanessa is the answer you were looking for.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
