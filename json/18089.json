But if you wanted to use your local grocer's hand-painted sale signs, I think that could make for a very interesting project!\n\nA very good example of this would be the TypeCon 2005 logo designed last year (it was on the t-shirts).

I wouldn't mind having another go at it, and from what people are telling me, it sounds like a lot of people what to jump in, but need some more time. What does everyone think?\n\nI had a harder time with this one than I thought. I had some troubles taking the warm living stone letters into cold bezier curves. At first I tried to follow the original characters more literally. In particular, I love the wacky variation in stem width. When I aped the same variations in splines, though, it just looked like a bad free font. What looks like character and warmth in stone, just looked tacky when digitized. So I evened out the characters, which I think is working out pretty well in its own right, but it has a totally different soul from the original.\n\nI think Mark's entry suffers from the same issue. So much of the flavor in that incredible lettering comes in the texture and subtle imperfections. I think they get a little lost in the transition to splines. That being said, sometimes I get stuck designing for the specimen, and not thinking about how designers might use the characters. I think Mark's alphabet could work really well once it is placed back into a context by a designer.\n\nDan, if you don't have access to a camera, try flickr. Found type is found type, right? Just cite your source.\n\n"

      "content": "Christian, what you're saying about found type is very true. And I agree with your assessment of my attempt. I think I could do better if I spent more time on it, but it may not be possible to really capture the spirit of the original in any case, as you point out.\n\nWhen you think about it, type--even digital type--, as a medium, is severely restricted in terms of visual expression. It's just black and white and there are limits on complexity. (This is why I like doing lettering--there are fewer restrictions.) Once you have a font, you can go further, using color, texture, and context to make something visually rich and unique, but a font by itself is limited (not that this is necessarily bad, it just is).\n\nIn any case, it all comes down to interpretation when drawing from any source material--even your own sketches. I remember seeing a piece written by Oswald Cooper (reprinted in U&lc. I think) about the endless ways the same historical typographic source material might be interpreted by a type designer. It will be different for every designer, and each designer may have multiple interpretations.\n\n"
