  "content": "Hello\n\nJust thought I would throw this one out there and see if anyone had any suggestions for a font(s) that could accompany the main brand fonts which are [foundryflek & plek](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826043458/http:/www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_plekflek/example01.html).\n\nThe accompanying font(s) can't be display fonts though, they are more for legibility and especially for the web. The font(s) don't have to be system fonts though as the text used for web is embedded inside flash, so no worries there.\n\nWould love any helpful suggestions as I'm sick of always sticking to good old Helvetica Neue.\n\nCheers\n\n",
