I would suggest showing a diversity of ideas and directions and also be honest in picking work that you’re proud of and that reflects you.\n\nI hope you don’t intend to come out a carbon-copy of these guys, as dezcom hints at. It’s about listening to their ideas and choosing what touches you, what doesn’t and how it can be appropriated into your own thoughts and methodology.\n\nI would also say don’t be afraid to throw digital work into the equation. It’s about form and content — not imitative modernist print design or who’s the most ’swiss’.\n\n"

Maybe take a risk on a few edgier piece.\n\nI really like their [site](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821150757/http:/basics.sfgbasel.ch/m6x1summer.htm) — weingart’s hand no doubt\n\n"

I’ll catch up on Hofmann in the weeks to come.\n\nSo yeah, don’t just grab works diverse in form and content - submit stuff that clearly demonstrates a technical acuity to communicate and the principles thereof.\n\n"
