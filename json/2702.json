Friz Quadrata is very different in certain ways: look at the g and e in the lower-case, and look at the overall contrast between thicks and thins -- Friz has a much lower contrast than this face, which, I believe, is much closer to the Carmina I identified earlier.\n\n"

And, it's definitely not Friz.   \n   \nAlso: Note to Mark Taylor: Carmina is not \"the Mac equivalent\" of your Fritz font. Carmina is the original and is available for both Windows and Mac. Fritz is just a bad copy. There may or may not be a Mac version of it. You would be better off with Carmina unless you absolutely must have that bad spacing.\n\n"
