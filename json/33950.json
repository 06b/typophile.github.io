  "content": "this is happening on a mac running 10.4.9. it's been happening for a while, and i've never gotten a reply from any of the fontlab people as to whether they've seen this happen.\n\nsee attached file. this is what my contextual menu looks like when i select a glyph cell and try to activate the contextual menu.\n\nalso, my application menu is split into two menus. one with the name of the app contains services, hide fontlab, hide others, show all, and quit.\n\nthe second menu is immediately to the left, and is accessed by selecting blank space (which is completely weird). it contains about fontlab, about fontlab products, and a menu divider followed by nothing.\n\ni have some contextual menu extensions installed, and i'm running some app enhancers (fruitmenu, menu master, windowshadex) which are all turned off in fontlab. i've also tested with all the extra stuff uninstalled, but the problem persists. anyone else had this happen?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture-1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030729/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-1_1.gif) | 12.32 KB |\n\n",
