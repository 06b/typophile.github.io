  "content": "Hi guys!\n\nDo you like puzzles?\n\nI made a Logo for my music project a while back in mspaint on another computer. I really like the font. It has nicely shaped 'O' the arrows on the 'S', the lanting 't', the roman style 'V'. Here it is below:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822160556im_/http:/typophile.com/files/What%20is%20this%20muvverfonting%20font_5209.jpg)\n\nI now need a banner printed and there is a special offer on right now , but the jpeg I made is way too small so I need to redo it as a vector. However I can't find the font. I've tried the online image font search tools and even went through about 100 questions on one site trying to narrow it down.\n\nMaximum kudos for he/she who finds it first ! =)\n\nHoping you can help. regards,\n\nDavid\n\n",
