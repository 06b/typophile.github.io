I got the univers condensed font.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219143837im_/http:/typophile.com/files/careerbuilder_univers_3927.jpg)\n\nThe top one is from illustrator.  \nThe middle is the original  \nThe bottome is photoshop\n\nIt may just be that the font is very pixelated, but it seems that their font is bolder, and skinnier at the same time, no?\n\nThe Illustrator file is straight up, and the photoshop file is using light condensed with a faux bold.\n\nI aslo tried putting a stroke on the font in illustrator, almost there if not there?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219143837im_/http:/typophile.com/files/careerbuilder_univers2_5410.jpg)\n\n"
