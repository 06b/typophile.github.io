  "content": "Hi,\n\nWhat font would be similar to the handwritten, bold, all-caps type with caps in the attached image -- I'm referring to the one line on top, and 2 lines of it more or less in the middle? The type is from a mid-18th century Spanish manuscript.\n\nFor a special event, I'm doing a poster that will feature this image, and I would like to use a similar font for the headline. I would love to find a font that retains some of the fluidity of this handwritten type.\n\nI'd be most grateful if anyone could suggest font(s) that come closest to this historical type.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Sea manuscript font.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425083222/http:/typophile.com/files/Sea%20manuscript%20font.png) | 1.42 MB |\n\n",
