Just the fact that  \nthere are in fact two of them already is encouraging (I mean legally)  \nand I know that even H&FJ have used names that were already out  \nthere, but I'm wondering: what are the probable legal ramifications?  \nPractically speaking, is it only Berthold that one must avoid tangling  \nwith like the plague?\n\nAnd I'd like to bundle another question in here: What are your thoughts  \nconcerning serif/sans font systems where each has a different name?\n\nhhp\n\n",

Above and below is just what I think is correct…\n\n\\>I thought they could mostly get me to stop using it, not  \n\\>sue me for the money I’ve made from it up to that point! :-(\n\nLike every lawsuit, that would be up to a judge (and jury?) to decide. But they could try, and if they try, it might cost you. The trademark holder probably won't care about your font, just that you are generating income with their property.\n\n\\>That’s no good. So I assume people like Solotype and H&FJ  \n\\>had checked the trademarks. How do I do that myself?\n\nHow do you know that? I don't know that. The best thing to do is ask. If you want to register a trademark, you should have a lawyer do research for you to see if the name is in fact trademark-able.\n\n\\>More questions:  \n\\>1) If the previous one does not have a trademark, isn’t  \n\\>there something equivalent to “previous art” in copyright  \n\\>whereby it’s no longer possible to obtain a trademark on it?\n\nDon't know. If no one has a trademark on the name, you can apply for one. If the others don't want you to have it, it is up to them to file an objection with the authorities during a certain application period.\n\nIn terms of copyright and design patents, those are not names, and are not things that fall under trademarks, which is waht I thought you were asking about. Protection for design copyrights and or patents differs depending on where you are. If I were you, I would ask the other other designers, rather than ask for legal advice. Solotype and H&FJ are just a phone call away, right?\n\n\\>2) When do trademarks expire?\n\nNever? ;-)  \nCopyright is good for life of the author (or company), plus 70 years. At least in the US, I believe. Whether TMs another matter are?\n\n\\>3) If I do trademark it, what can I do about the pre-existing one?\n\nSee what I wrote above. Your trademark application can be contested for a certain period of time.\n\n"

But they only last as long as someone is using them, and trying to protect them. They may become genericized, and then anyone can use them, like \"aspirin\" in the U.S.\n\nThe basic concept of a trademark isn't at all like a copyright. A copy write says you made (or acquired) something creative and have the final say on reproduction. A trademark claims only that you have a product with a label and it is so intrinsically entwined with the product's value that others using that name might benefit from your reputation, via that label.\n\nKeep in mind neither you, Solo or Image have to have registered the Trademark to get benefits from it, that just makes things easier in litigation.\n\nIf two parties are using a name to sell two different (unrelated) fonts _at the same time_, either one would have a poor claim that the name is linked in the markets mind to only their face. Especially if neither is stopping the other. (Unless they are pursuing different markets.) However, the same applies to you, as well, if there are already others using that name, unregistered, good luck getting a judge to give you real trademark power, even if the local PTO had taken your money and given you a certificate. Keep in mind, to maintain that Trademark, you will have to be a hawk on the butt of anyone using it, as well.\n\nOthers, feel free to correct this.  \n----\n\nOn the other half of the question, If you want a sans and serif with different names are they at least phonetically or thematically related? I have two projects in the cooker using that idea, a sans/serif pair and a text/display pair.\n\nI also feel that if they are a \"close pairing\" they should have more similar names. If they share little more than metrics, then a weak link seems right.\n\nWeren't Myriad/Minion were designed to compliment each other? Similar but subtle.\n\n"

      "content": "\"Weren’t Myriad/Minion were designed to compliment each other? Similar but subtle.\"\n\nNot really. Myriad came later and was co-designed. I don't think they are that closely related; I would rather use, um, something else with Minion rather than Myriad. Myriad was originally a showpiece for Multiple Master technology, and was highly engineered to give smooth results across a wide range of width and weight. We just don't see many width variations of it any more.\n\n"

The sad fact is that since the digital boom, it's much much harder to get the name you want because so many are taken. You could re-spell the town name or make up a word that includes part of it (rhymes). It's not Paducah is it?\n\n"

In principle, it would have to be a word that is generic to the _consumers_ of the product it labels to never ever be trademarkable. Probably words like Typeface, Font, Alphabet and Letters.
