  "content": "Greetings,\n\nI have developed a font that works in every Uniscribe application (and even some non-Uniscribe applications) that I've tried \\*except\\* for Microsoft Word. Even WordPad works. The font shows up in the font list (even with a correct preview) but Word does not let me switch to or type in that font. So, e.g., selecting all (ctrl-a) and choosing the new font does nothing.\n\nHave any of you run into this sort of thing before? What could the cause possibly be?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
