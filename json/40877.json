  "content": "Can anyone point me in the direction of some good examples of Church Newsletters, or similar that are also well designed. I am looking to do some work on a monthly newsletter for a local church and I am looking for inspiration.\n\nSpecifically, I am looking to develop a very informal/handwritten approach that feels 'friendly' and maybe a little 'haphazard' rather than one which is 'clean' and 'well presented'. I want the newsletter to convey a 'small community' feel that is 'developing' and 'learning' together, so I want the newsletter to 'look and feel' a bit quirky.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions for a handwritten/script font that is versatile enough to cope with a newsletter approach?\n\nAs you have probably all guessed by now, I am new to all this, but love the art of words, that so many of you here make look so easy and yet I know is the product of so much learning.\n\nI'm just wanting to get started, and looking for ideas.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n\n",
