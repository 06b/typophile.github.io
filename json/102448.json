      "content": "I wonder why it needs serifs at all. They look like an add-on. This work reminds me of the nineties, when it was utterly cool to chop off the serifs from serifed fonts. Look at David Carson’s layouts for Ray Gun. I see the different approach here in Mixtra. The type could do well without the additional serifs. However, me thinks the S and s are too light weighted at the top and the R’s head should be bigger.\n\n"

      "content": "I essentially agree with you guys.\n\nThis is a style that's hard to pull off - but I don't think its impossible. Maybe angling the serif-less terminals would help. For example in the \"fl\" ligature in Patria (where instead of fusing the letters I removed the head half-serif of the \"el\") I think that makes a big difference.\n\nhhp\n\n----\n\nToday, learn about the Armenian Genocide.\n\n"
