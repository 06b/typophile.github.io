  "content": "I’m designing a short publication of one of the work done in one of my classes this semester and thinking about having it wire bound. It probably won’t exceed 40 pages so I’m thinking that a perfect binding will just fall apart, and I want it to lay flat so I can talk about it in interviews without having to hold it down. So I want to have it spiral bound.\n\nMy book-arts friends think I’m just some sort of lazy monster, and are trying to convince me to do some wacky stitched binding or some other crazy thing, and say spiral bindings look cheap. Do designers really look down on spiral bindings, or are my friends just being snotty because they want to see everything hand bound from five kinds of paper with printed vellum tip-ins?\n\n",

      "content": "Every binding system has its advantages and disadvantages.\n\n1) Perfect-binding requires a minimum thickness to be effective. I doubt your 40 pages, even if printed on cardstock, will be thick enough. (And if printed on cardstock will probably tear the binding apart.)\n\n2) Coil or Spiral bindings look nice and come in many colors and sizes. But, because of the nature of the spiral, opposing pages of spreads do not align. One side of the spread will always be lower than the other side. Only a problem if you've got crossovers.\n\n3) Wire-O bindings are slightly more complex than Spiral (looks somewhat like a wire version of Cerlox), but allow opposing pages of spreads to align. Also comes in many sizes and colors. As Chris mentioned, Coil and Wire-O bindings do not add structural strength to a book, so they tend to be floppy. Using a heavy card back cover to add strength is common.\n\n4) Saddle-stitching could work, depending on your page size. If doing the stitching yourself, you'll need a stapler that can accommodate the width of your printed page.\n\n5) Rivets & grommets also come in a variety of colors and sizes. Two options available: a single rivet will make a fanbook (think Pantone swatchbook); a couple rivets in line will seal one side of the book but this uses a lot of space. Anywhere from a half-inch to an inch of each page of your book will become inaccessible to the reader (this is easy enough to design around by adding additional space to each inside margin).\n\n"

So I guess I'm like your art-friends. I've also recommended and used both Spiral and Wire-O systems in different projects. I see them as gimmicky. I also see \"novelty\" typefaces as gimmicky. But I'll still use them, if they are right for the project.\n\n"

      "content": "Speaking from a user's point of view rather than a designer's point of view, why oppose a far more practical solution because of aesthetical preferences?\n\nSpiral bindings are probably underappreciated because the coil binding spines are made of plastic instead of traditional materials like leather or paper. The association with cheap spiral-bound notebooks doesn't help either. The difficulty of utilizing the spines for displaying the title of the publication, making identification difficult when shelved, must be another reason it is not used for more expensive projects--they would be harder to display in bookstores and the like.\n\nI think that's a shame because there are lots of situations where one needs a lie-flat binding, and spiral bindings are hard to beat there. Not only do they lie flat, you get 360-degree rotation at any position in the book. From my own experiences, dense mathematical texts can often benefit from being spiral-bound as one often has to have them open at a single page and take several minutes studying the material on that page, all the while taking notes or solving problems using the page as a reference.\n\nUsing hard covers takes care of the slouching when placed on bookshelves should it become a problem. If the book is really thick, the pages will follow the curve of the coils when closed rather than line up neatly, but that won't be a problem with 40 pages.\n\n"

It also has 'loop saddle stitching'. One of the brochures at Typecon had this, and I thought it looked more classy than normal staples. Your publication might be too thick for that, but you could look into it.\n\n"

      "content": "If your book art friends think you're a lazy monster, probably some others will too. It's human nature to look down on everyone who uses things not to their liking, and designers, as a generality, are all too human.\n\nHere's a thought: In a town the size of Washington D.C., there has to be a number of people who teach classes in hand binding. Even in Durham, North Carolina, there are a couple. My wife took a couple of these courses, and most of the projects involved binding books of less than 40 pages. Anyway, for a fee, one of the teachers would probably bind your project for you, with nice covers.\n\nOn a more general note, if you don't mind the art-book people looking down on you for a bit, your schoolwork gets you your first job. You get your second job based on what you achieved in your first job -- You won't be showing your schoolwork during your interviews for the second job. For the second & subsequent jobs, even the school itself is less important than what you've achieved at work. I'd hire a good, productive person who had gone to the local community college over a RISD grad whose professional work wasn't quite as good.\n\n"

I hate the plastic bindings but I like the metal spiral binding. A very simple method to make it look less ugly in the eyes of your \"book-arts-friends\" is to make a hidden spiral binding. You add as last \"sheet\" to bind no \"sheet of paper\" but a simple cardboard with the width of approx. 4 times the width of your papersize plus the width of the spine (??correct term??). The cardboard is four times ??channeled/scored??.

And coil binding tends to come undone more easily, in my experience.\n\n[EDIT] Oh, and I agree with Nora... It depends on how you use it.
