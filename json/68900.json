During that time he won several first prizes in design contests. In 1965 he moved for one year to São Paulo, Brazil, to work at the Editôra Abril where he learned magazine design. In 1967 he was awarded a scholarship to study at the HfG Ulm by the German DAAD, but unfortunately the school was closed in 1968.\n\nAt the end of 1969 he travelled to Germany with the same scholarship and studied at the Visual Communication Institute of the Superior Fine Arts School of Hamburg University (IVK-HfbK) between 1970 and 1975. Always a typography lover he made some unpublished or unfinished type designs between 1968 and 1989.\n\nIn 1991, while living and working in Valencia, Spain, he acquired a Mac and all the necessary software to take the first steps in digital type design. As a result of the process since 1995 he has published 12 typefaces with ITC.\n\nAt the moment works and teaches graphic design and typography privately in Córdoba, Argentina.\n\nFonts designed by Luis Siquot:\n\nITC Abaton  \nITC Arecibo  \nITC Arecibo Too  \nITC Cali  \nITC Florinda  \nITC Juanita  \nITC Juanita Condensed  \nITC Juanita Deco  \nITC Juanita Lino  \nITC Juanita Xilo  \nITC Juanita Xilo Condensed  \nITC Portago\n\n",
