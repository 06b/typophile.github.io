How small can I go with this before its print quality starts to get questionable? I've never worked with small/light fonts before when going to press.\n\nThanks!  \nMike\n\n",

(which will have to be screened to achieve the color)  \nNeenah Classic Crest is a nice paper to print on, but the process will affect the outcome.\n\nIf you're printing dark on light you can go smaller/lighter than if you're printing in reverse (ie knocking out white on a dark background etc, where dotgain will affect the type weight)\n\nIn addition to that - what is the smallest typesize you're contemplating right now?\n\nAs to printing small - make sure that someone over 40 can read it! (You'd be amazed how much people will struggle with small type, and you don't want important info such as the email address or phone number to be too small to read by the person who's getting the card).\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

Sure some of us might need glasses to read it, but it’s not like this requires long periods of continuous reading.\n\nOn a related note, “5th Floor” with the superscript “th” is totally Microsoft Word and doesn’t belong on a business card, especially not an executive-level card. And at that size the fake superscript letters just disappear. Either write out “Fith” or just use 5.\n\n"
