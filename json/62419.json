More that one glyph on a single type body.\n\nI never heard it used in relation to handwriting.\n\nI understand that an fi ligature solves the problem of the hood of the f crashing into the dot of the i (except in turkish). I also understand the fl and other f to ascender ligatures solve a spacing and color problem.\n\nI understand the dutch ij ligature because of how those letters are treated as a unit in the language.\n\nI see no reason why a u and an a have to be designed as a single glyph/ligature. There is no color or spacing problem to solve. What other use would there be? If you want to use it to design a logo than by all means go ahead. But I don't think you are going to find it in any character set in an existing font\n\nAnd just so you know where I'm coming from I always thought those ct and st ligatures to be an archaic affectation with no modern typographic relevance.\n\n"

It would be great if someone posted some 'ua' ligatures from handwriting. And how about sending some of your own 'ua' ligatures James, you and anyone else in a sort of unofficial Typophile battle? Actions speak louder than words...\n\nBy the way I have a book wihich has many typefaces by Spanish type designers, it is called 'Typosfera, Las nuevas Tipografias'.

I would agree that these forms are no longer appropriate to book length texts, simply because readers are not used to them; there was a time when they regularly appeared in book typography, so they can't be considered inherently inappropriate: they're just inappropriate now. But there remain settings in which they can be used sensitively and benefit typography precisely because they are out of the ordinary: they can signify out of the ordinary texts. And of course they can be used to deliberately evoke period typography.\n\n"

Pretty amazing.\n\nI somehow find two discussions here: Typography as a function (with ligatures like \"fi\" that solve legibility issues) and typography as decoration (with ligatures like \"st\" which by no means solve problems, but yet add interesting touches for type-embellishment).\n\nOf course, a ligature like st/ct won't help in copy text, but if they are used in a logo or in short sentences, they could be the winning touch for a minimal site. Take a look for example at this one: [www.pisto-magazin.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091558/http:/www.pisto-magazin.de/ \"www.pisto-magazin.de\")\n\nlabyrinthos: My client is a cardiologist with a deep interest in photography. He wants to build a minimal site to showcase his pictures, with a brief comment right below them. A blog. So we are designing a minimal, type oriented site that focuses on content and pictures. I'm attaching a preview of what we have now, everything is set in Helvetica (no more than two sizes), pixels are measured perfectly within a 930px grid, and so we need an interesting, yet not so disturbing, logo for the header. We thought that \"Luan\", in red (like in Pisto Magazine), will work. And thought that a ligature/swash for the \"ua\" could help even more.\n\nHere's the site we are working on: [http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5520/luancom20090928grid.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091558/http:/img143.imageshack.us/img143/5520/luancom20090928grid.jpg \"http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5520/luancom20090928grid.jpg\")\n\nThanks!\n\n"
