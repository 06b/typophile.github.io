The job post is from May, so they probably filled the slot. But if you have strength in type font development, vector based art and Photoshop, you might have a chance to get on their list of freelancers. Branding studios could really rely on someone with type design and font development skills.\n\nAlso, [US-Circle](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.us-circle.com/), the people who posted the job are a staffing firm for creatives.

If i could give simple job search/dating tips: find out what the other party is looking for and what they’re all about.

And did you have any experience with it before applying?_\n\nno formal education, but a lot of reading (the classics: elemenets, anatomy, letters of credit, etc.) also i had taught myself how to get around in FontLab and I had taught myself OT programming. I hadn’t completed a full typeface before starting work at P22, but I have since finished one of my own personal projects and released it through our subsidiary, [IHOF](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/IHOF). To find out what [P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/P22) was looking for, i emailed [Rich](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Richard%252BKegler) and then we talked on the phone and agreed it might be a good fit. I was in Buffalo a week later and i’ve been here since.\n\nIt looks like [House](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/House%252BIndustries) is looking for “Strong bezier drawing skills, a knowledge of FontLab and willingness to learn proprietary techniques also a must” as well as a team player. Seems pretty basic.\n\nActually, at the same time I was talking with Rich, H&FJ actually had an opening and they called me and we had a good chat. They hired someone else, but it was flattering to at least be considered for a position with such a reputable foundry. At that time I had a bit of a website up showcasing some original font projects which i had begun, and i think that was a help, too. You never know what _could_ happen unless you apply—nothing ventured nothing gained.\n\n"

She ended up at FontShop International in Berlin.\n\nI have been an intern at Linotype for over a year now, and I really love it. That internship came from contacts through school. Specifically, another student had worked there for two years, and wanted to stop. He told our typography professor this, who informed me of the soon-to-be opening. Then the student arranged the interview for me.\n\nEurope (specifically Germany, Holland, and England) has a lot of type foundries and type designers, many of whom take interns. The biggest problem for Americans is that some European governments will not issue work permits for interns (in some countries, an “intern” is actually one legal, regulated type of job category—and therefore one of the lowest). I am only able to work in Germany because I have a student visa (I’m a graduate student in Offenbach). I’m sure the exact rules vary from country to country. But if you want to work in type, I wouldn’t discount “Old Europe.” There is quite a bit of action going on here, both in terms of small foundries, and bigger ones.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

Or is English fairly prevalent there ? ( Non english speaking countries ) That would be even more incredible, to go to the land where most of type history was made.\n\nYou said interns had a job bracket, if so, can you afford to live indoors while working?  \nAlso, do you per-chance know what immigration policy /work permit is for the British isles ?\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t know much about the UK, but I have a feeling that the rules there for Americans are a bit less strict than on the continent. However, living costs in London are higher than anywhere in Germany.\n\nMost German companies (and Dutch, French, Swedish, or Italian companies) run all internal business & discussions in German (or Dutch, French, Swedish, or Italian, respectively). However, it is quite common in Europe for interns from other countries to be hired who do not speak the local language. In fact, I got my internship at Linotype _because_ I was a native English speaker. Before working at Linotype, I worked in other design agencies. Finding internships here has not been difficult at all. However, I do speak German, which greases a lot of wheels. I wouldn’t have been admitted to my graduate program without being able to speak German, and therefore wouldn’t have gotten my visa/work permit.\n\nEnglish is very, very prevalent in Europe. That does not mean that all Europeans will want to speak it with you, though. Especially when they are upset about something, or need to tell you something important or in a hurry. Beaurocrats get very angry if you do not speak their language perfectly.\n\nMost interns in Germany do not make enough money to support themselves. Some do, however, including myself. It is different from company to company. Interns do not _have_ to be paid anything, and prestegious internships in non-design fields are often unpaid here.\n\nI don’t know how other countries stack up. In general, I think that it would depend on the company’s policies. I have a college degree and some real job experience already, so that certainly helped with salary negotions.\n\nHere’s the bad news: After I graduated from RISD (during which I spent one semester in Germany), and started working in Washington, I began applying for both jobs and internships in Germany (I wanted to go back, for personal reasons). I didn’t get one call; not one. So I decided to go to school there for real. I had a hunch that might improve things. It did, and after I moved back to Germany to begin school, all the doors openned up.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505104017/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

You don’t need to present a full character set in order to get a good critque. Especially if you are on a deadline (which you are ;-) ), work on getting it right in text first (what the word “text” means depends on the fonts’ application).
