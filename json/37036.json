Chiding him for his contribution is like making excuses for not putting your foot down when it counts. If typophile’s moderators have any real guts at dealing with piracy, threads like this that link to pirated font sources would be simply be deleted without discussion.\n\nThere’s nothing to discuss. Just get rid of it. There is no excuse for strealing fonts, and there is no excuse for not deleting posts by those who support it.\n\nMy point: be firm but fair.
