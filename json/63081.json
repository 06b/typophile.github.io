Some topics relate somewhat to the problem, yet none have provided the necessary answer.\n\nSo here we go:  \nI have been asked to change the auto line spacing of an existing font, due to the reason that the program which is going to use the font cannot change the line spacing. I have used FontLab and I tried to go to \"Font info\" and change in the ascender and descender value, yet in order to minimize the distance, I have to ignore the 1000 UPM \"rule\". This sort of works, but it also scale the letters, which I would prefer not happened. It also seems to affect the hinting of the font, and apparently the generated font only seems to work in InDesign and not illustrator. I have read the pdf mentioned in this post [http://typophile.com/node/59348](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203131954/http:/typophile.com/node/59348 \"http://typophile.com/node/59348\") but it did not help me.\n\nSo I turn to you guys, and hope that somewhere out there, at least one person has succeded in the \"simple\" task of reducing the line spacing in an existing font.\n\nHope to see some contructive replys\n\nAll the best  \nBenjamin\n\n",
