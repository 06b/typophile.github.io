I’ve used a few for effect here and there, and I’m wondering if anyone else has done the same. There are quite a few stinkers out there, but a couple of them are quite nice.\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

When I first started GD school I didnt even know the scope of fonts, but very quickly I came to learn that the free ones arnt really worth it. You may find something that works for display text, but I would be hesitant to set body of text with what Ive found for free out there.\n\nMake sure its not a rip off of someone else’s hard work. Type in “free fonts” in the typophile seach box, youll find plenty of threads/nodes regarding this subject.\n\nWhat are you using the fonts for? What is your desire for the font?\n\nBEst advice, take a look at some of the top typeface design sites and see what you think of those faces vs. the free ones you have come across.\n\nOff the top of my head:\n\nmyfonts.com (affordable for the most part)  \ntypography.com  \nlinotype.com  \nveer.com  \nfontfont.com  \nfontshop.com\n\nThere are lots of very respectable good type houses out there.\n\nI hope im on the right track on this answer, any more seasoned typophilers please correct me if im wrong.\n\nCheers\n\nJames\n\n"

Some fontmakers improve their skills with time, some don’t. **Some** is not **all** —even **most** is not **all** ; so, please, can the categorical statements.\n\nSecondly, just because a particular font may not suit **your** purposes doesn’t mean that it doesn’t suit someone’s purpose. I cannot begin to tell you how many emails I have received from underfunded nonprofits, churches, youth groups and the like, thanking me—sometimes blessing me—for providing them with free fonts to dress up their projects. And it’s not only organizations with limited means who have used them: Turner Classic Movies (print ads), Warner Brothers Television (props in _Blue Collar TV_ and _Smallville_), the Tank McNamara comic strip—even PBS (program titles for a Soul Stars of the 70s special)—have all found appropriate uses for some of my freeware fonts. I also cannot begin to tell you how many people have “appropriated” my free fonts and packaged and sold them for profit, without asking and without sharing those profits.\n\nSo, maybe it’s time to lighten up on the freeware folks. Respect, I realize, is out of the question, but the common courtesy of consideration on a case-by-case basis, rather than wholesale dismissal, is not, I believe, too much to ask.\n\n"

I was responding to Chris’s assumption that a free font was automatically a poor font, if it was appropriate for quick/slapped on use. I couldn’t find the html code for a slashed equals sign, so I used the ascii equivalent. It comes from some programming language, where “!=” defines one variable as NOT being another.\n\nAs someone who has released more free fonts than commissioned and commercial faces, I will admit that the quality is erratic. Even though I release free display types specifically to fight the stereotype of small character sets, rip-offs, and other lameness, They don’t get all the love the $ fonts do. For revivals, I try to be very caring however, since I’m not otherwise honoring the original’s design. That’s why I have only one so far.\n\nCuttlefish-  \nYes, I think so. maybe I can mock something up like what I mean. I’m not too good with interactive db-driven sites, but I might be able to cobble some sort of example where people could moderate fonts on build quality.\n\nRyan-  \nI think the consensus was nailed in your own OP.\n\nEveryone-  \nI don’t think this is simply a board of free-font haters. I find the knee-jerk venomous reactions amusing. Appreciating free fonts is truly a conflict of interest for some people. Others just happen to hate corny decorative faces, which are often free. And some folks are more into the function than form, too.\n\nThylacine-  \nI agree with you on every point. As for your question of why, here’s a long answer (italicized for those who want to skip it):\n\n_When I was younger I was crazy for Nick’s and Ray’s fonts. Even though I then had no idea who they wer, or that they were even alive. ;) The idea that you could do what they made possible was exciting and in the end, inspiring. I feel the world looks better, literally, for their input. (In fact, finding out that many of the most important people in type design are alive now is astoundingly cool.)_\n\nFree is an easy way to get them out there. And seeing one’s faces used is titillating. I would never have used one of my decorative faces for setting long poems on a web page, but someone has. I don’t know if anyone but the author and I see it as she envisioned it, but it was ...interesting. And probably still better than using the same old, “workhorses”.\n\nThere is also something amazing that in this industry, I didn’t need to be a “font merchant” to receive sincere recognition. I haven’t won mass awards, but then I haven’t paid to enter the comps, either. The indirect encouragement of Ray Larabie, Fontplayer, Luc Devroye and others has affected me profoundly. I feel I am a far more cogent artist these days.\n\nLast, I do things that are pointedly experimental, and that I consider more art than design; to me, giving them away sometimes simply feels right. There are quality free text fonts out there as well (documented above), I imagine the reasoning is as varied as as the designers, and as complicated as my own.\n\nAlthough I release free fonts under very liberal licenses for use, and sometimes modification, it has still actually led to some paid licensing. Had they been commercial only, they might never have had the exposure to create that demand. The free fonts have also led to very fun commissions.\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20091010041057/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20091010041057/http:/www.exclamachine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20091010041057/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"

And a very small # of people pay anyway, presumably for the same reason the designers give the type away.\n\nThat big businesses should have to pay, but that PBS or “the little guy” shouldn’t is a political view that I happen to mostly agree with, but it is just a viewpoint, and what some other designer does with his own work isn’t subject to my paradigm. There is no Font Recording Artist Association to buy us laws, fix prices, create racketeering schemes, sue grandmothers and force manditory payment systems. If there were, we wouldn’t even have this conversation, as the free fonts would be buried in a avalanche of hype for the pay ones.\n\nI personally prefer what we have now, I think.

Several up and coming designers have, and their works are now being offered for sale (granted minimum — like as low as $6 per font) but, it is affordable and I believe helps the designer have a sense of credibility.\n\nAnd everytime I think the shareware guys are shrinking - a new High School Freshman chimes in...\n\n"

In the case of _Smallville_, the assignment was to produce a banner that one would expect to see at a high school dance. Would a high school student head to Veer and drop 80 bucks for a font, or would he or she scope out the free stuff? I think the designer understood—and executed—the assignment perfectly.\n\nIn the case of _Blue Collar TV_ and _Tank McNamara_, the font of choice was Team Spirit, a “jock” font, the particular style of which—until I released an improved commercial version named Boola Boola last year—wasn’t available anywhere else, at any price. Again, the use was entirely appropriate to the purpose at hand.\n\nNaturally, I would prefer that, all things being equal, designers would purchase my commercial fonts rather than use my free fonts. But all things are not always equal, and sometimes the free font is the better choice. If the shoe fits, wear it; if the font works, use it.\n\n"

I went free font hunting. But after downloading everything in existence, looking and examining them to see their letterforms and character sets, and printing out a sample I came to a scary conclusion:\n\nThere are two reasons that people can charge for fonts. Those reasons are called knowledge and skill. (Aside from time and overhead, etc.) The skill in gently crafting the bowl of a lowercase b. The knowledge of exactly where the lines of perfect geometry need to be broken to make a letterform <cite>appear</cite> perfectly geometric. Etc., etc.\n\nBut that doesn’t change one pertinent fact: What a type designer chooses to charge for his/her work is none of my damn business.\n\nAnd if someone like Nick here wants to give/sell cheaply his work and it fits the criteria of the design I’m doing, why would I complain?\n\n"

When it is time to enter the working world, I would be much more satisfied paying my peers for their hard work than taking what I can get for free.\n\nAlso, there is a font called Accidental Presidency that I found on a free site that I really like.

There are too many hallmarks of amateur work in it.\n\nNote for example that the lowercase rounds are shorter than the x-height instead of taller, or the mess in the counter of the lowercase “g”, or the wildly inconsistent sidebearings. Should a lowercase straight get a sidebearing of 34 or of 8? This might be a “design feature” if you were to think of this as a grunge font, I suppose.\n\nOf course there are a number of free fonts that are of truly professional quality, and a number of commercial fonts that are of pretty dubious quality. But if one were to graph the frequency of various quality levels across the two groups, there would be two big normal curves which would only overlap in their tails.\n\nOn the other hand, if you buy a commercial font, you may be overpaying for the value of what you get, and there’s never any danger of that with a free font.\n\nI don’t hate free fonts, and I don’t find them particularly threatening, because they are so far removed from what I do on a day-to-day basis. I do sometimes find it frustrating that it’s a lot of work to explain to people how far removed the average free font is from the kind of work we do.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
