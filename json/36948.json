  "content": "Dear All:\n\nHere’s my situation. I write academic papers for a living, and I’m pretty much committed to writing them in LaTeX. Some of my work requires technical notation, for example. I’m also tired of the fonts that come with LaTeX or are easily installed off CTAN. I’m wondering how I might expand the repertoire of fonts I can use. I’d appreciate any suggestions.\n\nThanks,  \nBernhard.\n\n [‹ Accents calculated in size of ascender?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503074405/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37001 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [[ANN] New release: SigMaker 3 for Mac and Windows ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503074405/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36999 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "In addition to the Font Installation Guide, the LCDF typetools are a very easy way to install OpenType fonts into LaTeX. There is an automatic mode that is almost automatic. I think there’s one configuration—the updating updmap if I remember correctly—that’s not automatic. These comments are based on my experience running LaTeX under Linux. I haven’t tried doing this on Windows.\n\nEdit: OK, I hate to be one of those Linux-using, command-line loving people who throw the word “easy” around indiscriminantly. After looking up the scripts I wrote to install fonts with otftotfm, I’d say the correct phrase is “easier than it used to be.” And it’s writing of the .fd files for use with LaTeX that’s not automatic. There appears to be a script called [otfinst](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503074405/http:/www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/otfinst/) that automates even more of the process.\n\nScott Thatcher\n\n"
