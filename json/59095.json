  "content": "Dear typophiles,\n\nI'm building a new sans in FontLab and tried this and that and didn't save each time I changed something. So I deleted some glyphs which I decided I won't need in this early status.\n\nBut what bugs me is that as far as I know it's not possible to make a deleted glyph look like the ones I didn't touch at all (light grey with a dark grey version of what the glyph possibly looks like). I know I can generate a glyph with nothing in it but this leaves a white place in the font window just like I deleted everything in the glyph window.\n\nCan I reset the look of a glyph in the font window to default?\n\nI hope this is not too confusing. Thanks in advance.\n\n",
