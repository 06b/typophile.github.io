Crisp clear characters.  \n2. Extended characterset.  \n3. 'l', '1' and 'i' are easily distinguished  \n4. '0', 'o' and 'O' are easily distinguished\n\nforward quotes from back quotes are easily distinguished -prefer mirrored appearance  \nClear punctuation characters, especially braces, parenthesis and brackets.\n\nAnd whether on screen or printed looks fabulous and is a san serif.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nI know I am in my own little world, but its ok.
