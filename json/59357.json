  "content": "We've just released a new font based on old metal type called Foundry Ornament, which features heraldic creatures and floral designs from old metal type. The first font of this sort we've done in more than a year, and the result is very appealing.\n\nWe also just made available a major revision of our classic Tuscarora font, which has been quite popular but is now upgraded with additional alternate characters and an expanded character set.\n\nSamples of both are attached and you can check them out along with new articles and features at [fontcraft.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020025654/http:/www.fontcraft.com/).\n\nDave\n\n",
