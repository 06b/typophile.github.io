Anyways, check it out and tell me whaddaya guys think.\n\nOld Logo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052330im_/http:/typophile.com/files/oldlogo2h_4427.jpg)\n\nNew concepts\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052330im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2htest_4162.png)\n\n",

I dont know.\n\nThe client loves his old logo, he suggested me to try something with pixels, but i dont like that idea at all, i have tried a couple of times to do something with that concept but it just doesnt work for me, the ironic thing here is that i am a pixel artist, ha.\n\nIll appreciate any comments or suggestions to complete this because im kind of lost here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052330im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2hwtf_5673.png)\n\n"

There was some kind of a chit-chat with the client and what i can remember the most was \"we need something more professional, but we really like our old logo\" after that i just throwed what I thought it would be better than the actual logo (anything can be better than that.. thing imho) anyways, I've talked with the client and he gave more specific (sort of)directions, his company does JAVA applications, so java's icon or similar stuff = good. I tried to convince him to avoid the pixel stuff, and he gave me an opportunity, so, with java's icons in mind I came up with this, i tried to recreate java's logo in a different way, same structure, but different shapes, i like it, but i would love to hear opinions&comments about this before sending it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052330im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2hsoftwarelog07_5649.png)\n\n"

Would it be worth trying a version without the steam coming from the cup?\n\nSidenote: Do you know what the \"2H\" stands for?\n\n"

I think flat dark grey or black text would work better. 2H and software need to be visually separated (perhaps a different weight or colour). Also, I'm not crazy about the all caps...maybe 2HSoftware instead?\n\n"

If the former, well, then, that makes sense.\n\nThough, as sch2525 points out, the logo is really just a 3d-ified versino of the real JAVA logo...maybe a tad too similiar.\n\nAs for the latest version, while, yes, it's all cliche with it being shiney and reflective, I think you've pulled it off quite well. Very slick!\n\n"
