Maybe similar to the Coroflot logo ( [www.coroflot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905083948/http:/www.coroflot.com/ \"www.coroflot.com\")). Icon concepts attached.\n\nThanks for ANY suggestions.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905083948im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/dp-logo_4706.gif)\n\n [‹ PHP embedding](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905083948/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46680 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Retro futuristic / hi-tech font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905083948/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46700 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
