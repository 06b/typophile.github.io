  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI’ve recently decided to design and create a monogram for personal use. In the era of e-mails, IMs and text messages I find myself writing an old-fashioned letter more and more often. The personality of the handwritten letter is unparalleled by electronic communication, and its old-fashioned charm is lovely.\n\nThus my decision to design a monogram, which will be made into a seal (you know, the kind with lacquer you stamp at the bottom of letters), and which will be printed on stationary.\n\nPlease tell me what you think of this first design. The initials stand for Wouter Spaak, which is my name.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [monogram\\_black.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115612/http:/typophile.com/files/monogram_black.pdf) | 227.58 KB |\n| [monogram\\_full\\_colour.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115612/http:/typophile.com/files/monogram_full_colour.pdf) | 228.57 KB |\n| [monogram\\_greyscale.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115612/http:/typophile.com/files/monogram_greyscale.pdf) | 226.27 KB |\n\n [‹ Hebrew Wedding Monogram](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115612/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40321 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [cast iron furniture business logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115612/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40135 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Personally, I don’t like the rhombuses, it makes the whole thing to busy. Do they stand for something? Most seal I’ve seen are placed in circles.\n\nCheers!  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nFischers Fritz fischt frische Fische, frische Fische fischt Fischers Fritz.\n\n"
