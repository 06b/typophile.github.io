  "content": "Right, I recently started with Flash, so my knowledge of it leaves much to be desired.   \n   \nbecause regular anti-aliased fonts don't give the right feel to the design, I turned my head towards pixelfonts, but also those I found far from being my choice.   \n   \nThe only solution that I found satisfying was using html text Verdana.   \n   \n[insert laughter and possible insults]   \n   \nright, is there a pixelfont which comes incredibly close to the html/anti aliased version of Verdana at font size=\"2\" ?   \n   \nThanks for your patience ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111416im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n",
