  "content": "I created [Jaquizaca](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lamatas/jaquizaca/) in 2001 to make [inter-titles for a TV programme](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/vimeo.com/74241282). After twelve years it was revised and updated with ligatures, contextual alternates and other OpenType features. It supports all the European languages using Latin alphabet.  \nIn 2004 I draw [a snakes'n'ladders board](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/242/0/124175.pdf) to illustrate a magazine article on graphic design process. Now, with a little help of my friends, I translated it into [English](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/242/0/124178.pdf), [Spanish](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/242/0/124177.pdf) and [German](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/242/0/124176.pdf).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Jaquizaca\\_1440x720-1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/typophile.com/files/Jaquizaca_1440x720-1_1.png) | 74.49 KB |\n| [Snakes-n-Ladders.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043637/http:/typophile.com/files/Snakes-n-Ladders_0.png) | 73.52 KB |\n\n",
