I'm being interviewed this afternoon between 3 and 4 pm for [Neon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019084846/http:/www.radio1.be/radio1_master/programmas/neo/r1_neo_home/index.html), a program on [Radio 1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019084846/http:/www.radio1.be/) (Belgian national radio), about 50 years of Helvetica.\n\nI hope I don't screw up! :^P\n\nBTW I'll be proudly wearing my \"Who needs Helvetica?\" Hattenbach T-shirt. Figures...\n\n",
