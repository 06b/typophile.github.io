  "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI, for some time now, have had an interest in typography and I've been absorbing all I can for the past few years.\n\nI think during the next few months I want to try my hand at designing a typeface and font for my own educational purposes. I just want to see what I can do, and how I can resolve certain issues with creating the letterforms and I imagine that experience will help me understand and be able to better set other typefaces in the future.\n\nSo here I am, I've got Adobe CS3, Inkscape at my disposal. I've heard of and used font-forge to view fonts before.\n\nIs there any software that is either free or very cheap that I could use to create an educational font?\n\nif I turn out to like it and have the patience for it, what is the best professional software I could buy to continue my work after that? is there an industry standard for this sort of thing?\n\nI imagine the folks over at dejavu.sf.net would be a great asset as well - besides there and this forum, are there any type-design communities I could check out for additional information and suppourt?\n\nThanks in advance for everything, I really appreciate the helpful nature of this forum :) and hopefully you'll see some stuff from me in a few months!\n\n",

Typetool is another option, but I found it just too limiting and upgraded to Fontlab.\n\nIf you’re a student Fontlab offers a very substantial discount on Fontlab studio. I rank it among the better investments I made in school.\n\n"
