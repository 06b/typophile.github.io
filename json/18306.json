  "content": "There is a one day workshop taking place in Toronto, Canada on April 6th from 9 to 4 pm. It is being put on by the RGD Ontario (the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario). The title is Intro to Glyph Drawing and Type Design and focuses on \"the proper techniques for digitally rendering glyphs and the basic concepts of digital typeface/font design\". It looks absolutely fabulous and I was just told that the event will be cancelled unless there is more interest in it. (Personally, I can't imagine why there wouldn't be!) So if you're in the area and at all interested: [http://www.rgdontario.com/news/events.php#glyphs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060836/http:/www.rgdontario.com/news/events.php#glyphs \"http://www.rgdontario.com/news/events.php#glyphs\")\n\nAndrea\n\n",
