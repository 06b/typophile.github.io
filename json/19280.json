  "content": "Hi all,  \nI’m looking for alternatives to a typeface that is not available in electronic form, as far as I can tell from my searches.  \nThe face is called ’Quadra’, designed in 1970 by Rudolph de Harak. Can anyone suggest something that closely resembles this?  \nCheers.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070803081121im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quadra-font.gif)\n\n [‹ Toy’s brands typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20070803081121/http:/typophile.com/node/19281 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Recommendation for IMPACT alternative ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070803081121/http:/typophile.com/node/19275 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
