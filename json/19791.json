I surely won't be able to look at it the same way again...\n\n",

The O and H, for example, are symmetrical, why not the U? The only reason I can think of is that U was derived from V and, therefore, follows the same thick/thin pattern.\n\n"

On the other hand it's difficult to shake the familiarity of centuries of consistent use.\n\nOne of the funny examples I can think of is the previous incarnation of the logo of Belgian telecommunications company [Belgacom](http://web.archive.org/web/20130502035036/http:/www.belgacom.be/home/en/jsp/dynamic/homepage.jsp). It used a customised version of [Template Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20130502035036/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=E.1145.0.2&attributes.sampleSize=24&sampleText=B+E+L+G+A+C+O+M&sampleSize=24) where the original O and M were flipped horizontally because the stress was inverted. The O didin't bug me that much, but the \"correct\" M looked so wrong to a nerd like me. :^)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130502035036im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Belgacom_logo_5207.gif)\n\n"
