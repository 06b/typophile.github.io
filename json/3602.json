  "content": "Hello everybody, this is my first contact and I would like to have your critique for a font i started to work on. I applied the characters on the clich√© phrase \"the brown fox...\" and to a logo (the logo is fiction, just to try the types). For the moment i have designed just the lowercase, and in the future i will plus greek letters (i am from Greece).   \nI would appreciate it if you could give me your views plus I would be greatfull to receive some methodological informations on how to develop my work.   \n   \nthank you   \n   \n ![sample1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524125520im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif)   \n ![logo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524125520im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif)\n\n",

So, i expanded a little bit the horizontal stems of \"e\" and I applied the diagonal cut edge on the descender of \"h\". The problem is still with \"z\" and is called \"diagonal stem\"...you see in none of the types i used diagonal stems, so i tried to keep a vertical stem for \"z\", too. To be honest, now that i used it i like it and i think it fits between the neighbooring types, but still there are no other angled stems around, so is this convinient? I tried also a \"z\" with descender, but maybe this is too strange and i want to know if it is legible to you, beyond any historical taboos...thanks again for your advices   \n   \n...i just read your notes Tanya, i will try them later.   \n   \n\\image-(sample2)\n\n"
