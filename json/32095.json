  "content": "Has anybody out there ever heard of the typeface GST Polo by Georg Salden. Just found it in a book by Erik Spiekermann. It says there that it was created in 1972. It sure looks like the grandpa of all what Spiekermann became famous for (Officina, Meta, Unit).\n\nMyFonts doesn't even list Salden as a designer.\n\n",

There are only a few of them available there, I think he designed dozens more. Very nice guy, by the way.\n\n"
