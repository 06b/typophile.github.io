      "content": "Second, a general comment: brand and model are interesting, but key specs are at least as important. For example, I have a Lenovo (“IBM”) ThinkPad T61P. But how I got that configured (screen size/resolution, memory, hard drive size) is a lot more relevant.\n\nGenerally, I recommend that you get 2 GB of RAM. Regular 32-bit Windows can’t address more than 3 GB, and any less than 2 GB is a false economy for performance. If your budget is tight, you’re better off getting a slower processor but still getting 2 GB of RAM. For whatever model you pick, you probably want the biggest hard drive you can reasonably afford before the prices start escalating crazily.\n\nRelated to screen size, a host of related questions: Will you be using an external monitor for most of your serious work, or will you be relying on the built-in LCD screen of the laptop most of the time? Do you have good eyesight and a high tolerance for small stuff on screen? How much What format of outlines are you likely to mainly be working on? (Which is implicitly looking for “what em square size are you likely to be working with in your type design work?”)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

But by far the best computers I have bought have been from Dell. I have one large Dell Inspiron 9100 laptop that I’ve used as my main machine for the past three and a half years, and recently bought the small Dell XPS 1330 to use as a travel machine. I particularly like the customisability of Dell computers: I maximised the RAM and got the fastest CPU option for the XPS 1330, and it is blisteringly fast compared to my older Dell.\n\nThomas, as I understand it, 32-bit Windows only provides applications with a 3GB flat virtual address space, but kernel components will address a separate gigabyte. So 4GB is the actual limit (which is what I got in my XPS, and I hope I didn’t waste money on an unused gigabyte of RAM!). But in order to provide access to the full 3GB, either the computer manufacturer or administrator needs to set the /3GB flag in the boot.ini (in pre-Vista versions of Windows)\n\n[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791558.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709012403/http:/msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791558.aspx \"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791558.aspx\")\n\nor the IncreaseUserVA in BCDEdit (Windows Vista)\n\n[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906211.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709012403/http:/msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906211.aspx \"http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa906211.aspx\")\n\nIf you are buying a computer with more than 3GB of RAM, you may reasonably expect the manufacturer to set this, but you can ask them to confirm this.\n\n"

You can get a standard-ratio screen at 1600 x 1200, or a wide-screen at 1920 x 1200. But this factor alone will likely significantly narrow your choices - which is probably helpful.\n\nJohn Hudson and others are correct about RAM on PCs.
