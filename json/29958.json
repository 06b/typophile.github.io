While there, I was hoping to go on a bit of a type tour - looking at places and things of typographic significance.\n\nWhat suggestions of places and things to see do people have? This may be an interesting list to make into a sticky post too.\n\nThings I'm thinking of are:\n\ntype foundries  \npresses  \nmuseums  \ntypographers birth places/places of work  \nexamples of fonts\n\netc.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
