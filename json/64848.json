Elegant but quite reminiscent of roman forms and proportions, Biographer keeps the calligraphy mostly toned down, but its ascenders and descenders occasionally flare out in final swashy confidence. As usual with Sudtipos fonts, alternates are plenty and the personal touch is never amiss. Biographer could be great for womenâ€™s lit and poetry book covers, but also for products packaging where conveying comfort and peace of mind is of importance. An extensive range of languages are covered (Western and Eastern European, Baltic, Turkish, Maltese and Celtic)\n\n[Sudtipos fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102041250/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)  \n [Sudtipos on Facebook](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102041250/http:/www.facebook.com/sudtipos)  \n [Sudtipos on Twitter](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102041250/http:/www.twitter.com/sudtipos)\n\n",
