  "content": "I am creating a set of OpenType fonts for professionally typesetting Biblical Hebrew.\n\nUnlike previous generations of computer-based typeface software, placement of upper taamei mikrah (or taamei mikrah positioned above the Hebrew aleph-beis characters) is no longer determined by the user of the left-to-right typesetting program. Even is cold-type, hot-type, or even computer-based film-type, placement was determined by the operator annd/or the typesetting program. The actual typeface was passive, and did not determine the exact positioning of the various diacritic markings, such as the nikkud, the taamim (trop), the meteg, or the shva-nah, etc.\n\nHowever, in the newest generation of Biblical Hebrew typesetting, the operator/typesetter and/or the typesetting program does not determine the placement of the diacritic markings. The actual well-crafted OpenType Biblical Hebrew font determines the placement of the diacritic markings.\n\nSince that is the case, I seek to know if there is a rule or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah.\n\nI have noticed in pre-computer age Biblical Hebrew books of the Hebrew Bible, the placement of upper taamei mikrah were often determined by where they would fit best. In most post-computer age Biblical Hebrew books of the Hebrew Bible, many recent books have made the placement of upper taamei mikrah on the far left hand side of Hebrew aleph-beis characters, in order to allow certain symbols to be placed above the Hebrew aleph-beis characters in the center.\n\nIt seems then that there are no hard rules or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah. Or, the earlier typesetters or typeface creators/programmers simply were unaware of any hard rules or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah.\n\nDoes anybody know if there are rules or wisdom governing the correct positioning of the placement of upper taamei mikrah? Pease share them with me, or inform me of the contacts with the appropriate scholars who do know.\n\nSimilar, I am interested in the various rules for shva-nah, shva-nach, komatz katan, komatz gadol, hataf komatz katan, hataf komatz gadol, and any other grammaticalrules governing Hebrew.\n\n",

In this way, people who were maskilim could be easily identified (by their knowledge of these topics), as theor outward appearance was similar.\n\nAs a ressult, unfortunately, most people, including great scholars, no longer are familiar with these topics.\n\n"

But how & when to use/apply the rules — that’s another story. What do you know?\n\nThere are many books on the basics of Hebrew grammar. What I seek is not basic. I don't seek the definitions of these forms, such as, shva-nah, shva-nach, komatz katan, komatz gadol, hataf komatz katan, hataf komatz gadol, etc.\n\nAs you write, I seek \"how & when to use/apply the rules\".\n\nI seek to better understand these rules, the conditions of their use and application, in order to incorporate them into the OpenType Hebrew fonts I am creating.\n\nFor example, John Hudson created the excellent SBL-Hebrew OpenType Biblical Hebrew typeface, and incorporated the Hebrew grammatical rule of the furtive patach into the font.\n\nOne vowel in Hebrew is the patach, pronounced AFTER the Hebrew letter positioned above it with an \"ah\" sound. However, if the patach is position above the final Hebrew letter of the word, and that final Hebrew letter is either a Ches or an Ayin, then its positioning in under the extreme left side of the Hebrew letter. This indicated to the reader that the patach is not pronounced AFTER the Hebrew letter, but instead BEFORE the Hebrew letter.\n\nTis kind of patach is called the furtive patach. Whether the typesetter or user knows this Hebrew grammar rule of not, the furtive patach automatically appears of the condition arises. I seek to do the same thing regarding other Hebrew grammar rules, wherever possible.\n\n"

You want to read the whole bible;find the words with meteg;apply the rules, build an OT feature — how many substitution? 500? 1000? 2000? Just for one mark!?!?\n\nDagesh:  \nLet's see the next sample — Genesis 1: 11. The word peri (fruit; mentioned 200 times, more or less) + dagesh. One of them is  \npunctuated with dagesh hazak. So, just for one word! + one mark you want to have 200 substitutions?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414023937im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PeriSample_6387.gif)\n\nI don't think so.

Plus, with variable character widths, this was too difficult to program in a font in the pre-OpenType days. So, the upper taamei mikrah were simply placed on the extreme left.\n\nHowever, if the upper taamei mikrah are placed according to the way they are chanted, perhaps their placement varies.\n\nPerhaps, similar rules apply to lower taamei mikrah, as you half seriously imply.\n\nBtw, David, I think shva-nah, komatz katan, and hataf komatz katan, is doable through font-based ligatures, not through OT/VOLT replacements, although I agree that its not practical or efficient as you describe it for meteg.\n\nAnyway, I will know OpenType and MS VOLT's limitations better by next month.\n\nIn the Talmud we learn that when one knows well the limitations that one deals with, then the fun begins, creative work arounds, etc. I don't give up easily.\n\n"

And we have different histories of ashkenasi, sfardic, yemeni, iraqi, etc. pronunciations of Hebrew just to confuse us further in trying to think about these issues.\n\nSo wouldn't just leaving the masorite marks as is, admitting we don't exactly know, be a better course of action, rather than trying to create a system of pronunciation that is not modern, nor do we really know whether it's ancient?\n\nI mean, Avot also says that the wise person when he doesn't know says, \"I don't know.\"\n\nShabbat Shalom\n\n"
