He formed [Jukebox](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021011211/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jukebox) as branch of his JAW Designs to market his type designs. Much of Walcott's work is inspired by the lettering aesthetics of the ‘50s and ‘60s Americana. Jukebox typefaces are available exclusively at [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021011211/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer).\n\n**URL:**  \n [http://www.jawarts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021011211/http:/www.jawarts.com/ \"http://www.jawarts.com\")  \n [http://www.veer.com/jukebox](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021011211/http:/www.veer.com/jukebox \"http://www.veer.com/jukebox\")\n\n",
