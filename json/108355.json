      "content": "Oak Wood has an earlier internal font date and its numbers are in same style as its alphabet. Pompeii Caps has a different style alphabet and, when adjusted to same scale as Oak Wood [i.e. reduced 91.892%], its numbers and other non alphabet characters are a point for point match with Oak Wood. I suggest Oak Wood is probably an original work -- I have not seen it elsewhere -- and Pompeii Caps is a copy, except for the uppercase letters A to Z.  \nDon\n\n"

From 1991 to around 1994, I made these typefaces as a labor of love... a little money here and there from the (then, before the internet made a big splash on the world) shareware world.\"  \n\"Today, I've updated these typefaces to show my web and email addresses. I've not changed anything about the designs - errors and foibles still present :-). My typefaces are interesting, unique, and original... perhaps not Foundry material (doesn't bother me)... just good clean font fun for the family!\"  \nLink to his website now redirects to a singer.  \nDon\n\n"
