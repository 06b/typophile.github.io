Grant is the quintessential Typophile, dipping his toes in every aspect of typography - fontographing, selling, writing, and all the tech stuff. He’s been around the block and knows what’s what and I’m proud to call him a pal.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/grant2.jpg)\n\nPictured: Grant in his natural habitat.\n\n",
