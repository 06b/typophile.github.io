      "content": "Digital Engraving on 9th at Folsom is excellent. I've wroked with them for years.   \n   \nFull Circle Press in Grass Valley is also top notch and considerably cheaper than any other LP printer around. They're very cool about sending press sheets so you don't have t make press checks.   \n   \nI've worked with Mercurio Brothers before (though not for LP), a good choice for the budget-conscious project.   \n   \nJulie actually refused to let me make a press check. Haven't worked with her since.\n\n"
