Presumably it's used because the font doesn't have a set of small caps, and scaling regular caps down 5% or 10% obviously doesn't look so bad as scaling them down to x-height.\n\nSo my second questions is, are there fonts with a set of those slightly smaller caps -- maybe in addition to a set of regular small caps?\n\n",

Between them and small caps (SC), there is mid caps (MC). Also, there is petite caps (PC) which are even smaller than SC. I assume these are all the commonly known sizes of small caps?\n\nAtma has SC, MC and QC, but does any font have all four?\n\n"

When would one need five sets of caps (incl. the regular full-size caps)?  \n [More typefaces with petite caps in this older thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023211337/http:/www.typophile.com/node/51622).\n\n"

Misleading indeed.\n\nI personally think 2 sets of smallcaps is very nice to have, 3 gets harder to manage, and 4 is really overkill for all but the most exotic applications. BTW it's also worth considering that small caps and petite caps have their own OT features, while more additional cap sizes need to be put into stylistic sets.\n\n"
