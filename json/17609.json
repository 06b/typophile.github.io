  "content": "Hi fellas  \nI'm looking for a book (or site) which shows the differences in fonts of different vendors. For example: an Adobe Caslon is maybe more true to the original than an ITC Caslon but the ITC has maybe a better legibility in smaller grades due to an increased x-height and a Berthold Caslon blablabla....\n\nDoes something like this exist or do i have to invent it? ;-)\n\nCheers and thanx for help!\n\nRoland\n\n",
