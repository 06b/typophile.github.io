The clients who call us beginning with “we love Minion, but...” — as described in the first post in this thread — are the ones who want to populate a large design system with “customized” fonts.

So the client commissioning the modification pays for licensing the original font, and the modification fee. This is reasonable, because the modification fee is paying for their exclusive custom version of the font.\n\nI’ve had this kind of work done on my fonts, and I’ve done it on fonts designed by others: for instance, for newspapers, headline or agate versions of “standard” fonts. My client could have contacted the original foundry, but was confident in my ability to do the work adequately, on time, and reasonably priced. No doubt the original foundry could have done it just as well, or better, but for my client they are an unknown quantity.\n\nHowever, I would never mess with the beziers of a font from Font Bureau, or any other foundry that prohibits it in their EULA. They are not being unreasonable, merely setting the terms of a contract which potential users can take or leave, and other font workers are legally bound to observe, no matter what they think of it.

I was guilty of the same some years ago; but I’m not into EULAs. On the other hand, as Tiffany might tell you, there has been a return to more reasonability lately, probably partly because of the bursts of public outrage such as this.

If it’s the ability to make money, I don’t think your argument holds water, since companies richer than the ones you would consider “serious” do that all the time. And if it’s not about money, then is it about typographic integrity? That’s also problematic, because of the cultural deficiencies in the concept of intellectual property, especially in something as inherently derivative as type.\n\n\\> mutual respect amongst designers.\n\nThat doesn’t work either, obviously. Not least because some font houses -who do prohibit any modification- deservedly don’t get any respect from other designers.\n\nThe only thing that ever works is Reasonability. And that clause isn’t. Which is why it does more harm than good.\n\n\\> not exactly what you’d call “those in power”\n\nIn the context of the type world, **of course** there are some entities which have more power than others, for various reasons.

Where do you think all the money goes - donuts?\n\n\\> The speed limit is 40 because they know people will be driving 45.\n\nExactly! And EULAs have the no-mod clause to scare a small segment of users into following it; these are equivalent to the few people on the road who **do** always drive under the speed limit. And it’s notable that these people are usually too old or they’re illegal aliens.\n\n\\> with contracts and EULA type things there are specific borders that you have to adhere to.\n\nYes, and this absolutism is what makes it not work. Traffic laws are pragmatically constructed (even though they’re made to control peons). But such a clause is a EULA is either broken or not; and when -not if- it **is** broken, you’ve broken your best chance at getting cooperation from the user.

So it’s a balance, and a pragmatic, nebulous, **human** balance. The over-reliance on formal law benefits those in power; it is designed to keep us peons. And this overt formalism is perhaps the single greatest flaw of western culture. It is inhuman. And pretending that we expect people to follow an unreasonable clause in a EULA is counter to how I was personally brought up.

Not the foundry’s branding, but what people tend to do with brands. Like was said above, a modified font-x looks like font-x with a funny nose, but big companies want that anyway.\n\nSo big company goes to a designer (or to a branding agency, who then goes to a type designer). They say, we want to license font-x from foundry-y. We are going to buy a 10,000 seat license. Since foundry-y allows font modifications, we want to pay you to modify font-x so that it represents our new “branding goals.”\n\nSuddenly, the designer, or branding agency and designer, are making a lot of extra modification money. Most type designers/foundries would prefer to do that modification themselves, and get that money instead of letting it go to a third-party. Sure, they are still getting the licensing fees, but they want to control all money made with their products.\n\nSince this is in large part about money, I’m sure that any foundry with a no-mod clause would, for an extra licensing fee, sell a modification license to the licensee. If you want to modify font-x, but foundry-y doesn’t allow it in their EULA, you can get a EULA upgrade for a fee.\n\nOr you can go to foundry-z, and license font-w. Foundry-z has a different EULA. That is the way our market works.

Big Company, having contacted Foundry Y, finds that Foundry Y is indeed interested in doing the customization of their fonts.

This is where your relativism leads, Hrant: Big Company gets to cheap out, at the expense of the fine people of Foundry Y.\n\nSimilar to Foundry Y is a small outfit called Hoefler & Frere-Jones.

If Adobe doesn’t allow modifications, the designer should recommend another font from another foundry.\n\nIf the client says, “yeah, but I just want you to design me a typeface that looks just like Minion, because you are cheaper than Adobe,” then the type designer should walk away.

It was a serif Armenian font, a niche market then quite thirsty (but now no longer). I released it, sold a number, and was glad to see it used anywhere and everywhere. Most users had certainly not paid for it. But being the pragmatist, I could simply not get angry. Which isn’t to say I don’t like/need money - I’m human too. In fact, the sales and commissions I made in the last quarter of that year financed my “famed” 6-month sojourn in Barcelona; I only left for LA -via Beirut- when I ran out of money (and missed my Armenian community too much). Anyway. What happened is one day I saw a CD cover with a sans version of my darling design! I tracked it down, and found out it was done by an old buddy of mine from back home!! Yes, I was a bit angry at that appropriation, but it subsided quickly, and required no action, even though the guy was about 15 minutes away from me. You know what peeved me the most? That he chopped off the serifs **but didn’t alter the spacing...** That’s a strong aspect of the relationship I have -and I’d like to keep as much as possible- with my work. Note that I didn’t have a EULA. And THAT DIDN’T MATTER ONE DIDDLY, not to him, not even to me! Now, I don’t expect -or even want- everybody else to be like me, trust me. But I’m not some alien. What I felt, and what I still feel, is an aspect of humanity, and like any aspect of humanity, it can’t be conveniently ignored.\n\nA more “glorious” anecdote along these lines:  \nLegend has it that when the barbarian hordes were pillaging Constantinople, a Byzantine noble sighed: “If only they knew what they were destroying, I wouldn’t mind one bit.” To me, this is the sort of thing that elevates us above mere animals.\n\nhhp\n\n"

That’s perhaps what irks your detractors.\n\nYour testimonial brings up another of my thoughts... thanks for the segue...\n\nHad your friend been required (or politely asked) to at least contact you regarding derivatives in a EULA, you would have at least been able to advise him on the spacing issue. You probably could have arranged a subsequent licensing arrangement for the derivative. A better product would have been delivered and compensation could have been spread around.\n\nHuman or not, poor behavior is poor behavior as determined by environment. A bull in a china shop is still going to destroy the goods. The type biz environment is fragile and delicate, and a lot of items aren’t packaged with enough foam peanuts and crumpled newspaper. A no-mod clause is an attempt at padding against breakage, but then these items sit on the same shelves as your open-box wares. The bull is ignorant of the packaging... he’ll smash them both the same.\n\nThe balance of extremes which you are striving for will only be attainable if type designers and modders and users work in concert and in good faith... to tame those bulls or at least keep them in the pasture. There must be a network of trust and respect and conditioning in business matters for your ideal market to emerge. Naturally, communication and respect is the crux of this dreamland, and some animals will never learn the language.\n\nWhat can be learned from the Open Source Initiative? Has this been discussed at any conferences or forums with respect to font licensing?\n\n"

In fact, no law can stop anyone from doing something that isn’t public or doesn’t affect others. So the “open for education” argument doesn’t really influence EULAs, mod, no-mod, or no-mod-for-profit.\n\nAlso, I wasn’t stating that just because something has no victim it’s right to do it. I just thought that since “it hurts the type designer” is so used to justify EULAs, it should be possible to use the opposite to justify not following them. It was all one big question, really, but I guess my point was lost in my bad english.\n\n"
