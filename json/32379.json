  "content": "I’m currently working on a photo journal publication and wanted to seek opinions from other designers regarding whitespace around photographs. The publication itself is landscape format so as most of the photographs.\n\nIs there a generic rule whether should more white space be added if for instance the photo contains a main subject. And less white space (margins) if it is just a photo of a landscape for instance?\n\n [‹ Aaux Pro VS Freight](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010735/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32409 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for OpenType humanist sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010735/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13281 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
