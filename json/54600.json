      "content": "There has been no digitization that I'm aware of. I think Dorothy Abbe (WAD's heir) denied permission during her lifetime.\n\nI'm not aware of any promotional poster for Falcon. The fonts were only published posthumously, released in 1961 under Jackson Burke's supervision, many years after Dwiggins had passed away. WAD did some preparations on a promotional booklet (specimen) in 1943. I've seen some of the setups in the C.H. Griffith archive, but I'm not sure it was ever published when the fonts were released, and I've never run across the printed piece (though I'd love to add it to my collection).\n\nI have some proofs of Falcon, but I'm not inclined to post hi-res images to the Internet. What's your specific interest? Feel free to contact me off-line.\n\nMaybe I can trade you for some Quinto do Noval Nacional 2000 vintage . . .\n\nJust kidding ;-)\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"
