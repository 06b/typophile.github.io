  "content": "Hey there   \n   \nMy name is Stuart Penny and I am currently studying Graphic Design in 4th year (Honors) at RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia. As part of my final year personal research project, I have initiated an exploration into illustrated typography. I have sent you this letter to request a contribution due to your experience and unique perspective on typography.   \n   \nTo illustrate the idea that type, like humans, in their own way have individual characters and personality, I am asking you for a short story, statement, or quote depicting a moment in your type related life that either stirred, annoyed or even humored you. It may be something you saw, heard or even said about type or type design in the hope of uncovering how type portrays an individual personality, culture or time in which it was created.   \n   \nAs each story will have its own personal tale I intend to hand illustrate each story typographically. Each story will then be unique and enforce the idea of individuality within type design.   \n   \nFor example I recieced an email the other day. with a picture of a video store called 'MEGA FLICKS\" the font used and with increadably tight kerning it read \"MEGA F/\\_/cKS!\"   \n   \nIf you have any questions e-mail me at [stupenny@yahoo.com](mailto:stupenny@yahoo.com), or [theworks@rmit.edu.au](mailto:theworks@rmit.edu.au)  \n   \nThanks for your time and I look forward to your response.\n\n",
