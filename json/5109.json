      "content": "My absolute favorite is Real World InDesign. The new CS edition is just shipping in about a week (Amazon lists availability in 11-12 days). It also seems to be the favorite reference of my fellow Adobe-ites.   \n   \nNow, depending on what your approach and background are, and what you are looking for, there may be another book that would also be good to have. But Real World InDesign is the indispensable reference, covering both how to do things, overall complex concepts, and very importantly \\*why\\* you would want to do (or not do) certain things. I've had two copies of the ID2 version: one for the home, and one for the office. On those occasions when I need to do something or figure out some InDesign behavior I am not understanding, Real World InDesign has come through pretty much every time.   \n   \nOn top of that it is very well written, being both clear and humorous while conveying complicated ideas.   \n   \nI hope that helps!   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT   \n   \nThomas Phinney   \nProgram Manager   \nFonts & Core Technologies   \nAdobe Systems\n\n"

      "content": "As someone trying to extend the usable life of my old blue+white G3 (450mhz/768MB RAM), would you imagine CS to be a net positive, or a negative compared to Indesign 2? I don't feel like I need the features (and am wary of the lack of backwards compatibility), but is it really noticably faster/more stable? If Apple can do it with OSX, no reason Adobe can't, I suppose!\n\n"
