  "content": "The style known as _Scotch Roman_ is considered as a modern face.  \nBut if you look closely at the design of a _Scotch Roman_, it appears it has the bracketed serifs of the transitional faces.  \nModern faces in the Vox-AtypI definition are called _Didones_ meaning Didot and Bodoni. These two types have hairline serifs.  \nPunchcutter Richard Austin who previously worked for John Bell and gave him transitional types was the creator of _Scotch Roman_.  \nI observed some specimen of _Scotch Roman_ that have the high contrast of the _Didones_.\n\nWhat is your view on _Scotch Roman_ inside the Vox-AtypI category system?\n\n",

I would not have thought to do that—having scrupulously mimicked the effect of 150-years ago, with optical sizing, I was so invested in that idea that I forgot my own mantra, which is that you never know what will work until you try to make it work, and see what happens.\n\n"

      "content": "There's nothing wrong with optical sizing. But there's also no reason you couldn't have made Scotch Micro Micro which starts with the assumption Scotch Micro is what the 11 point looks like, and Scotch Micro Micro is the corresponding 6 point.\n\nAfter all, a smaller optically sized font is bolder and wider - and bold, condensed, light, and wide weights of typefaces exist without being related to optical sizing, as well as different typefaces differing in these characteristics.\n\nOptical sizing may involve other parameters as well, but the fact that a certain quantity of boldness and wideness makes a 6 point face correspond to an 11 point face doesn't prevent that quantity from also being approximately what the 11 point size needs to look better to someone. And that was likely because of how tastes changed in 150 years.\n\n"
