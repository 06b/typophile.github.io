I'm rather curious: What visual and design quality do the two fonts share that make them appear so similar in strength and weight? Corpernicus doesn't seem to have been designed for Web (is it?) so I'm very interested in how the two look so alike. I have always like Georgia, but it's a little meaty for print so I've been interested in examining fonts of similar quality. Sadly, I lack the eye and vocabulary to put my finger on it.\n\n",

      "content": "Galaxie Copernicus is a take on Plantin, a 16th-century genre, and Georgia is a Scotch Roman, a 19th-century genre. Plantin does have a large x-height compared to other designs of its era, but if you go into the details, there is very little similarity between the two genres and hence the two faces.\n\nHowever, Georgia, as you noted, was designed for the screen, and Galaxie Copernicus was designed as a member of the Galaxie family that includes a grotesque (a sans serif subgenre), so those decisions probably affected the proportions, colour, and sturdiness of the designs. That could be said about a lot of other contemporary designs, though.\n\n"
