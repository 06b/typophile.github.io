So probably eths and thorns and wynns and all that sort of stuff at some stage, but yogh in the immediate term.  \nIf all else fails, which of the free “big” fonts d'you reckon is closest? I've tested a stretch of Sabon with Gentium yoghs and thorns in it, and it doesn't look _too_ bad...\n\n",

I'll check them out in more detail later, but at first glance I think one of the first three (Alphabetum, Cardo, or your own Andron) looks like it's going to be the best match.\n\n"
