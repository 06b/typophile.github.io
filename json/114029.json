Note the repeating letters are the same.  \nEasy to make this type of font and quite a few are available.  \nStill no exact match but you might like Face Type's Strangelove as a substitute [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/strangelove/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826061243/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/strangelove/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/strangelove/\") The name might have ironic connotations for a wedding but refers to Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick’s cinematic masterpiece about the end of the world in nuclear war. Don't miss Captain Kong with his cowboy hat riding the H-bomb like a bronco as it is dropped from the bomb bay of a B-52 or the beautiful melody of Vera Lynn singing Until We Meet Again as the bombs explode all over the world. Great lettering in a well constructed font.  \nDon\n\n"
