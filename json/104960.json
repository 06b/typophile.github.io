  "content": "Hi!\n\nI'm looking for typefaces that are like Neutraface, but without the low x-height. Right now I'm using ITC Avant Garde Std Xlt, but I'm wondering if there are more options out there. I think the characteristic I'm most interested in are the big, very circular counters and bowls. A plus is the super pointed M and N's.\n\n:)  \nThanks for any help.\n\n",
