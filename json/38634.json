Yet it appears that his typographic œuvre is wider than that and I wondered if anyone at Typophile had ever seen two other designs by Baines I’ve heard about, Toulon and Horncastle (both 1994).  \nThank you very much.\n\n [‹ Slab Serif Similar to SOHO](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031220004/http:/typophile.com/node/38605 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Good, regularly-updated, cutting-edge design blogs? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031220004/http:/typophile.com/node/38595 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
