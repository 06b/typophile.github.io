I don't think I need to explain \"I live\", just that it has so much meaning given the subject of the book. It is all hand drawn type (in sharpie) on a wall that looks like it's been painted multiple times.\n\nIt's a funny thing for me, If given a decision I usually choose something pretty or comical, but the strong concept for this cover are what caught my eye.\n\n",
