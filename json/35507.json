Have you ever used Seattle's public transport?\n\nIn any case, I work at a hotel downtown. Here are your options:\n\nMetro bus: As above. You get to ride next to the hobos, and the drivers have little patience for lots of luggage.\n\nGreyline bus: It's basically a charter bus that stops at various locations.\n\nMisc. Shuttles: There are 2 dozen handfuls of different companies. They're all the same, and they're all mediocre.\n\nTaxi: Screw those guys.\n\nTowncar: My preferred method. We can arrange to have a car meet you, drive you downtown, and you won't have to put up with a lot of baloney from the driver. If you call your hotel, or preferably me since they pay commission, we can get anything from a limo to a suburban to a minivan to a towncar to ride you into town in style.\n\nI have my preference, but the greyline/shuttle services work fine. Not very comfortable, and slower than molasses, but they'll get you there eventually and they're almost decently priced.\n\nThe towncars are fast and comfortable, and cost less than a cab because they're a flat rate, not on the meter.\n\n"
