  "content": "Normally, I hate when clients request to use a “handwriting” typeface because I personally think if you want handwriting, you should actually use handwriting and scan it. Unfortunately, this is not always possible especially with clients that like to change copy at the last minute.\n\nSo last week I posted up a question on Twitter asking for suggestions for a handwriting face that isn’t too scripty/brushy and doesn’t suck. The Twitter conversation can been see here: [https://twitter.com/realdougwilson/status/438050628548325376](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/https:/twitter.com/realdougwilson/status/438050628548325376 \"https://twitter.com/realdougwilson/status/438050628548325376\")\n\nHere is a condensed list of the faces I found most useful.\n\nRoller Script by Nick Cooke - Lots of good alternates and both a rough and smooth version.  \n [http://www.g-type.com/rollerscript-font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.g-type.com/rollerscript-font \"http://www.g-type.com/rollerscript-font\")\n\nFresco Script by Fred Smeijers - Not sure I like the lc “g” but it fits in the bigger family of Fresco. Good amount of weights as well.  \n [https://ourtype.com/#/try/fresco-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/https:/ourtype.com/#/try/fresco-script/ \"https://ourtype.com/#/try/fresco-script/\")\n\nSuomi Hand Script by Tomi Haaparanta - More “aggressive” than some of the others, but still has a good feel.  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suomi\\_type\\_foundry/suomi\\_hand\\_sc...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suomi_type_foundry/suomi_hand_script_ot/?affId=98220 \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/suomi\\_type\\_foundry/suomi\\_hand\\_script\\_ot/?affId=98220\")\n\nErikRightHand & JustLeftHand by Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum- Two variations on proper handwriting.  \n [https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/erikrighthand](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/https:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/erikrighthand \"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/erikrighthand\")\n\nSignature by Henrik Kubel - Loose, marker feel.  \n [http://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/signature.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.a2-type.co.uk/html/signature.html \"http://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/signature.html\")\n\nCaflisch Script by Robert Slimbach - Obviously a classic, but I feel this is too used and not unique enough.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caflisch-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caflisch-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/caflisch-script/\")\n\nI would love suggestions for additions to this list. Remember, the face needs to have a handwritten feel and not too fancy/scripty or brush script.\n\n",

I love the cross-out version as well.  \n [https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/mister-k](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/https:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/mister-k \"https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/mister-k\")\n\nNotera by Måns Grebäck - Another informal script.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/notera/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/notera/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mawns/notera/\")\n\nInstant Vivd and Instant Quick by Jérome Knebusch - A very nice, restrained but still handwritten face. A nice mix of handwriting and type design.  \n [http://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue\\_6\\_instant\\_.html?lang=2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.batfoundry.com/catalogue_6_instant_.html?lang=2 \"http://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue\\_6\\_instant\\_.html?lang=2\")\n\nScripto by Franck Jalleau - Informal script with lots of good alternates and Open Type tricks up its sleeve.  \n [http://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue\\_7\\_scripto\\_.html#](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202228/http:/www.batfoundry.com/catalogue_7_scripto_.html# \"http://www.batfoundry.com/catalogue\\_7\\_scripto\\_.html#\")\n\n"
