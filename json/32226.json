      "content": "Hi gardenize,\n\nOur corporation uses Suitcase. Our experience has been that the less fonts loaded in Suitcase, the better.\n\nWe create our sets by project. For instance, when I’m working on a brochure, I create a folder on my hard drive that contains only the fonts used in the brochure and name the folder: brochure fonts. I load that folder into Suitcase, where it becomes a set, and activate it while I’m working on the brochure. When I’m done, I pull the set out and Suitcase is empty (except for system fonts) again.\n\nThe advantage to this method is that all fonts must be deliberately added to a project, rather than automatically opening via Suitcase. This may not be a preferred method for your organization.\n\nKristin\n\n"

      "content": "I use Font Explorer but it must be similar. My sets are:\n\nantique/distressed  \ncalligraphic/uncial  \nclassic serif w/expert  \ncondensed - this is both for sans and serif fonts  \ncool (this one is way subjective!)  \ndingbats  \ndisplay/initial caps  \nfunny  \ngrunge  \nhandwriting  \nnouveau/deco  \nretro (mostly 50s style here)  \nsans  \nscript  \nslab  \ntechno\n\nI also have a few sets for foundries. But my basic purpose for sets is to browse the categories. Unlike Kristin, I keep all my fonts loaded in Font Explorer so having the sets avoids my needing to scroll thru literally thousands of fonts to find something that grabs me. It took awhile to set all this up but then it’s a snap to maintain - when I add a new font I just dump it into the relevant category(s).\n\nI used to create job or project sets, but since Font Explorer activates automatically when you open a file, that doesn’t seem necessary anymore.\n\n"

So apart from regular serif, sans, I think of other way of making and using sets efficiently, for example how much I am using some particular font ( gotham, din for example), then for example classics (including both serifs and sans - garamond and  \nhelvetica for example - historical value of course), somethin modern or something like that...\n\nOf course study of any new particular work is essential,\n\n"
