  "content": "I am helping a friend make a wedding invitation and they have submitted to me a font that they would like to use (or something very similar). It is listed as SAR. I can't find it anywhere on the web. It is a very elongated serif font, with a deco/20's feel to it. I have been to many sites and still can not find it. If it helps, all of the lower case letters have the same cap height with acsenders as tall as upper case cap height.\n\n",
