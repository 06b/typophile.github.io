The [former free for personal use version](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132209/http:/www.dafont.com/bitsumishi.font) would need a little bit of tweaking so may switching for the [Pro version](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132209/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/bitsumishi-pro-v2) and get some stylistic alternates (mainly /R) should do the job.\n\n"
