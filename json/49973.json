I’m working on the annual Product catalog and wondering if anyone has any insight besides the usual suspects for header and body and combos. I’ve been looking at some higher-end car brochures like Mercedes and Audi for inspiration. Lots of Helvetica sprinkled with a little Franklin Gothic. Nothing against either but maybe somebody has some other ideas.\n\nThanks!!!\n\nBilly\n\n [‹ Walbaum Woes](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009110124/http:/typophile.com/node/49968 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Anachronistic Collateral for a badly written play. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009110124/http:/typophile.com/node/49900 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think the key to so-called high end design is it leans heavily on the information design aesthetic.\n\nYou could also go for something a little more obvious. Just as good mind you.
