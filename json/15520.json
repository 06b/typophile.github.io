I can't seem to find it for download anywhere. The net's all full of [Tengwar](http://web.archive.org/web/20130406053554/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Tengwar) and runes instead when I search for \"hobbit font.\"\n\nIt can be a lookalike or something very similar, too.\n\nThanks for any leads...\n\n",
