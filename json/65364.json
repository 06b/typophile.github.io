Is there some technical reason for not kerning slashes? Or do they just not get kerned because kerning them is a PITA and users don’t care?\n\n",

Even parentheses, and the dollar sign and the symbol for pounds sterling were considered “typographic accessories”. Later on, with Monotype and Linotype, a somewhat greater variety of characters would be made specific to each typeface, including (, ), $, and /.\n\nFor a given typeface, there would often be available matching small capitals, accented letters, and fractions.\n\nBut characters like +, =, \\*, @, # and % were sorts. There would be one or two generic versions sold by point size, not typeface.\n\n"

So we do and have kerned slashes and quotes since kern 1, (1989). I have noticed that quite a few founders only concern themselves with kerning the cases and have always assumed that they simply expect the user to kern the odd combination that gets in the way.\n\nWe feel our fonts should just work seamlessly unless the user tracks a lot... or something horrid.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

Quotes, because of their position, greatly benefit from kerning, and and are used very often in text._\n\nI’m always surprised at the number of otherwise well-kerned fonts that don’t include the combinations of single-quote/double-quote. In English, at least, this combination occurs quite frequently, whenever there’s a quotation within a quotation (whichever way around you prefer to use them — singles first [UK] or doubles first [US]). I’ve gotten in the habit of globally inserting a thin space between them, so they don’t run together into what looks like three single quotes together; but whether that amount of space will work really depends on the typeface.\n\n"
