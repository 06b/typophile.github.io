  "content": "!Carlos Caffeinated (TT) has the usual 4 styles: regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic. Everything is cool in every program, except the CS2 applications. There, there is only regular and bold-italic. Inspecting the file's properties and tables I cant find a problem. A free font, this a low-priority problem to solve sometime when I redraw the font (already planned).\n\nThen...\n\nMy newest font, intended to be my first commercial release, has three cuts with the same basic4 in each. However, Cut #1 has all 4 in all applications, including CS2. Cut #2 and #3 have: Regular, bold and bold-italic. _No \"Italic\" (In CS)._ But, the \"Regular\" is italicized. How can this be?\n\nIn Word's font menu, Windows's font preview, and several small font viewing applications, as well as all other font developing tools, everything is kosher.I am developing all the cuts side-by-side. I've poured over this for days, recompiled, completely re-entered the name fields, stopped all other development, re-rendered the italics from the original design, scoured the web for a clue, revised the OT naming system, and now I'm all out of ideas. Please help.\n\n",
