This is a bilingual edition, with the original texts to be composed in native Tibetan script, or Uchen.\n\nAlso: does anyone have Tibetan font recommendations or general information about Tibetan fonts?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Type Design - Where do I start?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122115400/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49048 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Multi-Use Collection ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122115400/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19314 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
