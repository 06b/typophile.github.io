After all, the logo will have a lifespan of at least ten years....and with digital paint being cheaper in the future than \"hard\" printed images that need frequent replacement, all surfaces will have the potential to be animated. So an animated logo now would be ahead of its time.   \n   \nYou could also have a flexible system, rather than just one design -- as with the original FontFont logo (which seems to have petrified these days).   \n   \nAn animated GIF could be used for the logo online, although the animation would have to be subtle, of course. Like Mr Coles applauder.   \n   \nHmmm, maybe I could do that on my site...\n\n"
