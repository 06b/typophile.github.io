Was playing around with Chalet but feel it doesn’t sit with the mark... please feel free to critique... suggestions for typeface are most welcome.\n\nThank you\n\nMcD7\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Evoke Creative Mark.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515082246/http:/typophile.com/files/Evoke%20Creative%20Mark.png) | 9.86 KB |\n\n",

I think you should continue to play around with this solution though.\n\n"

Glad you remembered it though, Cheers!\n\n@Melo - Thanks for the feedback. It took me along time to come with a suitable name that I liked. I do like the letter combination of the letters and maybe that is where I should concentrate...\n\n"
