  "content": "Hi,\n\nHas anyone seen this commercial. They are using an handwritten typeface in this commercial that is kinda similar to the emtype logo which was made by Eduardo Manso himself and is not a typeface and which is again kinda similar to the Bello Pro by Underware, but definitely different) =)\n\nI'd like to know the name of that typeface and where to get it. Nobody at Côte D'Or could tell me. =)\n\nThank you very much!!\n\nregards,  \ndav.\n\n",
