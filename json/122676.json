  "content": "I am a historian, and not an expert in fonts, but I am frustrated. I am looking for an English font that has the equivalent phonetic letters to Arabic letters. Eg. A heavy T with a dot under it, a dhall or d with a line through it, etc. Is there a font similar to Garamond (for publishing purposes) that has all of these characters?\n\nEG: Sa’īd Ibn Ḥusayn changes his title to Imām ’Abid Allāh al-Mahdī Billāh.\n\nI find myself using multiple fonts to find all of the different characters I need. Is there one font that has them all? Perhaps an Arabic font that contains them? I prefer to purchase it so that I can use it regularly.\n\nI am currently inquiring about Brills new font, which seems brilliant, but not available for commercial use... ie they do not want any competitors using it. Any suggestions anyone?\n\nDan Gibson\n\n",
