Clean up as much antialiasing as you can -- it's of no use for anything this small. You can even try downscaling without resampling, and check if there is enough recognizable detail left to work with.  \nFrom that version, scale down to 16 x 16 and clean it up one pixel at a time.\n\nI drew my own favicon literally one pixel at a time, from scratch:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140807050921im_/http:/typophile.com/files/favicon_6255.png)\n\n-- worth the effort, as it preserved the black-white pixelated view I was after.\n\n"

Yours is a bit smoother, and if I had spent more time doing mine, it would probably have been a little more like yours in some parts. For example, I think you did the back of the cyclist better. On the other hand, I prefer my rougher style when it comes to the head, which I think should be separated from the body, and the wheels, which I deliberately made bigger, to make it look more like a bike, and less like a kick scooter.\n\n"
