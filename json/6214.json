      "content": "I don't know about the Bicycle font -- I couldn't find anything really close enough to even suggest as an alternate. As for \"playing cards,\" it actually looks like someone squeezed Gill Sans Light, rather than using an actual condensed face, but I could be wrong. Either way, mixing that and Futura Condensed together in an already bad design makes this piece just so difficult to look at. The original designer of this classic package must be turning over in his/her grave.\n\n"
