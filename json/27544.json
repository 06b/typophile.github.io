The logo font is Garamond Bold and I would like to find a standard system font to compliment it so that when letters are composed in MS Word a nice look and feel can be kept intact. Does anyone have any ideas of a font I could use?\n\nThank you for your help and insight,\n\nDuncan Robertson\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TxHL\\_Logo\\_Final.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080824070841/http:/typophile.com/files/TxHL_Logo_Final.png) | 12.4 KB |\n\n [‹ Fonts representing Old Italy?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080824070841/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27353 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Garamond Changes When Conterted to Outlines ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080824070841/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27546 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
