  "content": "Howdy Typophiles,\n\nI was referred here by Mike Yanega, Bowfin Printworks.\n\nIn early 2005 I designed a website for a client using  \na PC running windows 2000. In the interim I have learned a  \nvaluable lesson in web design - always document your  \ncolor schemes and font choices.\n\nRecently I was forced to upgrade my OS to XP and  \nfailed to document my collection of Fonts. Then of  \ncourse the customer called out of the blue requesting  \na site change... DOH!\n\nSo my dilemma is, I have searched high and low all  \nover the net and have not been able to find the font  \nused at [http://www.jimsweetwater.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808060045/http:/www.jimsweetwater.com/ \"http://www.jimsweetwater.com\")\n\nThe font is used all over the home-landing page and is  \nalso employed as the font for the text buttons and  \nheaders on the sub pages.\n\nThe font is characterized by open (unclosed) lower  \ncase a, b, d, e, g, & p.\n\nIf you can help ID this font I’d be truly grateful.  \nI need to create new text buttons and without this font I’ll  \nhave to recreate every button on the site.\n\nThanks!\n\nTreblemaker  \nSF, CA  \n [http://www.WorldWideTed](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808060045/http:/www.worldwideted/ \"http://www.WorldWideTed\")\n\n [‹ (x) Mustard Seed Associates, Restoring Eden, CCSP - Papyrus, Adobe Minion, FF DIN {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808060045/http:/typophile.com/node/19195 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Die falschen Teilnehmer\" squarish sans - Nuri {Urban One} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808060045/http:/typophile.com/node/18445 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
