The fact that it's anti-chirographic or not how some established designers always make their \"g\"s is really entirely moot - readers don't react to that stuff, at least not in a text face. And I realize now that the lc \"k\" needs more character as well.\n\nBoring might seem \"safe\", but in this overcrowded scene it more often translates to reduced salability. Unless you have a stellar pre-existing reputation, the font includes thousands of glyphs, or something else that makes it stand out. Slimbach can get away with being boring, in fact he's probably come to depend on it, but you and I Eduardo cannot.\n\nLike Erik S points out, the funky \"g\" in Meta  \nhas been an <cite>asset</cite> more than a drawback.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Eduardo,\n\nTwo comments after a brief look:  \n1. The lowercase looks much better than the uppercase. The main problem with the uppercase is inconsistent weighting of the thin strokes. Compare the middle crossbar of the E with the top. Yes it should be thinner, but only slightly so. And the serif is too lightly bracketed. Compare the top of the E with the thin part of the O, of the U, of the G, of the Q etc. Those are too heavy in my opinion. They match the M and N thin strokes which are also too heavy I think. The caps need consistent modulation. I think matching all the thins to the top of the E will give a good feel. Also, I think the uppercase is slightly too dark compared to the lowercase. For languages with frequent caps (like german) this is a distraction. One other thing: The points on the W and V are not very pointy! They seem too chunky and out of place.\n\n2. The lowercase j  \nThe terminal is too weak. It should be as strong as the f. Also, the j needs more support at the baseline. The problem is accentuated by the tapering stem. It almost shrivels away to nothing. Perhaps less taper and start the curve a little higher (closer to the baseline)?\n\nJFP: What makes a good guillemot? How should his be revised? More point? More stroke modulation? Slightly higher so they work with caps too?\n\nRandy\n\n"

So it's easy to notice and say, 'clean that up'.  \nSo if you have a few examples of weirdness, they are excised, and the thing gets an even finish, but ends up bland.\n\nThe other route to go is to multiply the weirdness so that it takes over the font, but in an even, well-finished-weird kind of way.\n\nWeirdness, pardon me, I mean personality, can also camouflage bad finish, by rendering \"good\" finish an unecessary fussyness.\n\n"

If somebody considers a certain conventional mean as being some sort of formal requirement then I guess any divergence from that could be called \"uneven\". But since I don't believe such a mean exists (at least not at the formal visual level) I prefer to see \"uneven\" as: something confined to overly distracting color; and something that can actually be useful - with there being such a thing as <cite>too much</cite> evenness.\n\nIn this design for example the original \"g\" -which JF complained about- I would never consider \"uneven\", even though I can't really be sure it's structurally ideal (although I suspect it's fine, and I like to give the benefit of the doubt to divergence/innovation - as long as it's well-motivated).\n\nhhp\n\n"
