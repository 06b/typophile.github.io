I know I should probably know this, but it's something I have never looked at until now...\n\nThanks for any pointers.\n\n",

OT FontFonts include features and characters not found in the legacy formats, so they aren't a simple conversion to OT.\n\nAnd \"Std\" is such a horrible name anyway.\n\n"

The minimal Pro character set includes ISO-Adobe and Adobe CE character sets, plus the euro, litre, foursuperior and estimated symbols.\n\nCan I call the OpenType fonts I make Pro fonts?\n\nAccording to the OpenType list postings Adobe is not claiming any trademark on the Pro designation with reference to OpenType fonts. Although anyone is free to use the word, it would reduce end-user confusion if the type community remains consistent in their use of the term.\n\n"
