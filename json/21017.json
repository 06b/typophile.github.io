The glyph reminds me of the Renaissance born symbol for addition; representing the first letter of the word piú or plus. Alternatively, it could be a fancy way of depicting a new paragraph.

I believe that glyph was put in INVERTED QUESTION MARK (U+00BF) on 1530 Garamond Archaics due to the lack of a better place. In fact, there's not really a proper place as I think Unicode does not have code points for a lot of the glyphs present in that font.\n\n\\> _Yes, this would be a glyph ID I hate putting my topics in the wrong place … sorry._\n\nNo worries, there's not really a proper forum for glyph ID either :^D\n\n"
