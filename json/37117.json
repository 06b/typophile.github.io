  "content": "I check this site quite frequently, just to see what discussions are going on, usually just browsing through the homepage articles to see what people are talking about.\n\nThe other day someone had a Type ID question about the Miller High Life logo. ( [http://typophile.com/node/37023](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180402/http:/typophile.com/node/37023 \"http://typophile.com/node/37023\") ). I chimed in with a suggestion (which is rare) and today wanted to check back on the thread to see if anyone had come up with anything else.\n\nThinking it would be faster I typed in “high life” in the search box, which was in both the title and body text of the post, but got no results (i tried both with and without quotes around “high life”). Then I tried searching for other words that appear in the post that I remembered typing “old stock” “neighborhood”... but the post never came up.\n\nI finally found the post, by browsing through the type id forums - but kept trying to see if I could get the post to come up through the search box - mostly on principle. It seemed like if I couldn’t find a post by searching for text that I knew I had typed - what’s the likelihood of finding the results I want when using keywords to search for a topic I’m researching.\n\nIs there something I’m missing here? Thanks!  \nConnal\n\n [‹ How related are members of Type Families?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180402/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35727 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Embossing ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180402/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37049 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I notice many web sites have a search function tht says “search powered by Google”. So there must be some way of automatically incorporating the Google search capability, probably some scripting available from Google, and probably free. Perhaps the Punchcut folks could look into this. Not much point having a search function if it doesn’t get results. Typophile threads are a valuable resource on typography and design. Anyone visiting the site should be able to search it effectively without having to figure out that you need to use Google.\n\n"
