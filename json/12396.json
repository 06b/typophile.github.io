  "content": "dear typophiles,\n\ni know this is very, very raw, but nevertheless is hope you have some advice on the general direction of these forms.  \ni am presenting it in this early stage because next week i'll take part in a workshop with jeremy tankard with the topic of \"how to genereate a bold and italic from a regular\". i'd like to work with my own stuff, therefore i decided to design a few letters as a basis - my aim will be to develop these sketches into a serious and usable font family ... someday.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [no-name-yet.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/typophile.com/files/no-name-yet.gif) | 3.16 KB |\n| [no name yet.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/typophile.com/files/no%20name%20yet.pdf) | 47.54 KB |\n| [text-sheet.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/typophile.com/files/text-sheet.gif) | 26.18 KB |\n| [text sheet.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/typophile.com/files/text%20sheet.pdf) | 4.48 KB |\n| [sample22.6.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/typophile.com/files/sample22.6.pdf) | 21.18 KB |\n\n",

I think that the in.leading strokes into the m and the r are too diminutive, though, unless the type is shown really big, they'd disappear.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

I did see Dwiggins in the _action_ as well as the jarring transitions between the strokes...which I really like.\n\nThe bowl of the a is too small in comparison to you o and e. I like the second f more than the first as the bottom stroke, IMO, shouldn't move forward it should trail behind.\n\n"

      "content": "Good work.\n\nI think that the top of the a extends a bit too far to the left. The letter looks like it might kip over in that direction.\n\nThe f seems to fall toward the right more than the h does.\n\nThe j doesn't seem right. I'm having troubles with both the top's in-stroke, and the tail on the bottom. The top in-stroke doesn't seem to be in harmony with the rest of the letters, and the tail could probably be a bit more interesting.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172808/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"
