If you’re viewing this web page on a PC then you’re probably reading 9pt Georgia right now.\n\nI’ve not used Flash but i believe you can turn off antialiasing to make Georgia render as a pixel font like you can in Photoshop. I think most of the Windows system fonts were specifically designed to work this way.\n\nI may be wrong on some or all of the above, or i may have misunderstood your question. It’s been a long day.\n\n"
