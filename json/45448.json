Details on the link; this is the important bit:\n\n<cite><br>\nAn exciting and challenging Knowledge Transfer Partnership has been established between the University of Reading's School of Arts &amp; Communication Design and Monotype Imaging Ltd.</cite>\n\nThe 24-month project aims to utilise academic expertise to recapture know-how embedded in Monotype's library drawings for legacy technologies, and formulate a testing and development process to generate new, extended character set typefaces. Building on the recognised quality of Monotype's library new, multi-script typeface families will be developed during the project. The role will be based at Monotype in Redhill, Surrey.\n\nYou will have a BA 2.1 or above or a MA in Typography or related field with experience in digitising and testing typefaces. You will have some experience of developing extended character set typefaces, and preferably some experience with non-Latin typeface design. You will be proficient in Fontlab, with demonstrable experience of developing OpenType fonts. You will have strong research and documentation skills, and good communication skills. You will be organised, meticulous, and a good collaborator.\n\n",

No students are involved, although I suspect that graduates may apply.\n\nThe scheme is part-funded by the company, part by the UK Technology Transfer Board. The University employs the designer, who gets seconded to the company, and provides the academics' time for contribution. The day-to-day reality looks very much like the person is employed by the company, but with close contribution by the academics involved.\n\nThe objective is to enable companies to capitalise on expertise in UK universities for strategic benefits. The scheme has been very successful, but this is the first such project focused on typography (full details [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150110232830/http:/www.ktponline.org.uk/default.aspx)).\n\n"
