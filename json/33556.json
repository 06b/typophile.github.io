Can somebody recommend some fonts with this little flourish?\n\nI’m using the font for some book captions.\n\nI feel like the captions for the New Yorker cartooons have these W’s.....but they in fact don’t.\n\nMany thanks in advance,\n\nDavid\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612042826/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%203_23.png) | 5.94 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Type Director's Club call for entries #48 body font - Filosofia {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612042826/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34030 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for a sans serif w/ an italicized lc 'e' ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612042826/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33407 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

These types of are often cited as models for Caslon’s work in the 18th century. They do bear a definite resemblence, though there are differences.\n\n"
