  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI have just given a folder of font by a friend - however the formats are unrecognizable in my Mac OS X 10.6. The files are all in .afm .inf .pfb .pfm formats and I could not find the TrueType or OpenType format at all.\n\nI have looked up on Google, they said it's a kerning format, etc.  \nBut I need help on how to compile all of them into the .ttf format? So that I can use this typeface.\n\nThanks so much.\n\n",

Not used normally in Windows, except in special situations.  \n.inf = An informational file used by some older MS-DOS programs.  \n.pfm A file similar to the .afm, required by Adobe Type Manager (ATM) for Windows.  \n.pfb The file that contains the actual font outlines for use with Windows.\n\nOnly the second two are normally needed to use a Type 1 font on Windows.\n\nWindows PostScript Type 1 fonts have not been supported by any version of Mac OS (or even the Mac version of ATM). You will need some sort of conversion utility or font editor to make them usable on a Mac.\n\n"
