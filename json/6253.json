I'd like to do a few myself. Here are a few comments:   \n   \nSerifs: Thai, of course, has those little circles (I don't know the correct term) that begin the stroke, and are important in distinguishing letters. I think your typeface would benefit from indicating these with a more noticeable serif where they should be.   \n   \nThe Bangkok Bank's logotype ( [http://www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok+Bank/Main.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317163016/http:/www.bbl.co.th/Bangkok%2BBank/Main.htm)) has a similar face, but theirs could use a small boost in legibility too, I think.   \n   \n? & ? (kho rakhang & kho khuat): I think you're going to have to emphasize the upper-left part of these letters more. Give them more room, and the less you use the half-width strokes, the better, in my opinion.   \n   \n? & ? (do dek & to tao): I think the \"inner stems\" of these letters actually need to extend inside the letters' counters more, and the left side should \"bubble out\" more if possible.   \n   \nSome of these suggestions may apply to other letters too. Good work! I'd like to see more.   \n   \nPaul\n\n"

I'm sure there's a happy median somewhere. And, the more I look at it, I think you're right about the half-width strokes. They get pretty annoying. Once I get some revisions done this weekend, I'll throw up another image. BTW, I really like that no nu in Bangkok Bank.   \n   \nPart of the impetus for starting work on Thai fonts is due to a friend of mine from Bangkok who was lamenting the dearth of good Thai language fonts. Both \"modernist\" display varieties (he's of the opinion that Thailand missed out on modernism almost entirely and went straight to glorious [post-modernity](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317163016/http:/www.thomasriddle.net/high-on-chatuchak/pages/elephant800.htm)) - and also decent bilingual faces. That is, other than Angsana and Cordia and whatever other crap comes bundled in Windows. In fact, what he wants is something along the lines of what you posted Hrant. Something without all the \"curlicues.\" So I've also been working on another face (which I'll post sometime soon) that's supposed to work with Univers.   \n   \nAnd if you're interested Paul, there are some good online [papers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317163016/http:/seasrc.th.net/paper/paper.htm) about Thai characters by a computational linguist working at CRCL Bangkok.   \n   \nThanks again guys.   \n   \nNate\n\n"

E.g., the Futura-looking labels on the phone booths in Chiang Mai. I wonder if that's mostly due to the monstrous sweep of the West into Asia, or if it might just be the evolution of their script. After all, English has come a long way from Lombardic script and blackletter.   \n   \nIncidentally, somewhere in vast expanse of cyberspace, there's a 14MB .pdf file of a 400 page book (in Thai) that, I believe, is a treatise of some sort on Thai letter design.

A writing system is an extremely powerful piece of cultural identity, and a homogenous gray world seems deathly boring, no?   \n   \nOn the other hand, it's a complex issue: there are certainly some good reasons to bring \"modernism\" to different parts of the world - it's enriching. But it does have to be done sensitively: in the sample I showed (the bottom line), the results are both overly harmful to Thai culture _and_ dysfunctional as well: when a person who reads both Thai and some Latinate language sees that thing, it's just confusing.   \n   \n--   \n   \nWow, that PDF you describe sound like a dream...   \nWhy don't you just put it up on some site for us to download?

There's also a three letter version which is like \"LA\" or \"NYC\" (also below).   \n   \nThe two versions of \"Thailand\" that I posted above translate to (1) _bpratheht Thai_ and (2) _Thai_. _Bpratheht_ essentially means \"country\" or \"nation,\" but in Thailand most of the signage uses the second version, as _bpratheht_ is really a Western concept, not very Thai.   \n   \nKrung Thep Mahanakhon   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317163016im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16012.gif)   \n   \nKTM   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317163016im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/16013.gif)\n\n"

More, if you translate \\*.unk into \\*.swf's, they are not replicated at original size, but at some browser-mazimizing size, destroying pixel lock. an associated HTML file helps, a GIF screen dump helps more. Not to say Flash compatibility is unimportant to prove - it's huge. Only, get Unicode compatible ASAP.   \nThe unk/swf showed me a clear Thai on the grid, making me think of futurist Thai space travel, starring stars I have never seen.\\*\\*I only know Thai from my local restaurants (in San Francisco, that is a reasonable taste).   \nNathan, if you'd like to publish this font or a greyscale adaptation, please let me know.
