  "content": "Hi Typophiles!   \n   \nI was wondering about the origins and the further development of the so called pilcrow sign. All that i found was this small text. Does anybody of you know more about the \"clenched fist with the index finger extended, pointing right\"?   \nHow it looked like in the different epochs and how it was used?   \nThanks!   \n   \nhannum\n\n",

      "content": "I've never heard the \"fist\" explanation. It sounds suspicious to me. There is a history of printer's fists with fingers pointing, used to draw attention, but I believe these derive from the 19th century and have never heard of them having anything to do with the pilcrow or paragraph mark.   \n   \nThe pilcrow began as an ornate form of the letter 'C' -- for \"capitulum\" -- and marked the head of an argument or thesis. You can see this form still in use in typefaces like Centaur which are based on the earliest type forms.   \n   \nI don't recall exactly the evolution toward the current \"backward P\" form, but Hrant might have the references handy. Do you still have a copy of Parkes, Hrant?   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

(i've checked on ebay for old copies of the magazine, no luck). anyways, that's all i can think of for now. ciau!\n\n"
