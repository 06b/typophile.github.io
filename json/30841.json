This means it has no equivalent in what we know as digital fonts. **This alphabet only exists for engraving machines to make these watches, not as a digital font.** We can’t find this font because it simply **DOES NOT EXIST**.\n\nOther examples are alphabets available for the stamping machines that produce automobile license plates, for sowing and embroidery machines, for stone engraving et al. It just is a different world. In some rare cases you’ll find alphabets that have digital font counterparts, but more often than not they will be unique to that reproduction system.\n\n"
