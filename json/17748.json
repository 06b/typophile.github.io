Maybe that is light enough for you? Are you looking for a lighter weight to pair with that?\n\nHere is a link to the whole ITC Franklin Gothic family, which has 20 parts: [http://www.linotype.com/655/itcfranklingothic-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115073900/http:/www.linotype.com/655/itcfranklingothic-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/655/itcfranklingothic-family.html\")\n\nQuite similar to that is [Lightline Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115073900/http:/www.linotype.com/89881/lightlinegothic-family.html), also originally by [Morris Fuller Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115073900/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Morris%20Fuller%20Benton). It looks both Light and Condensed to me. Maybe it'd hit the spot?\n\n"
