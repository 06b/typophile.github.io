      "content": "Finally, my college minor in Math pays off! ;-)   \nActually, this is more like junior high stuff.   \n   \n58 degrees?! Is that correct? Well, you take the tangent of 58 = 1.6003-whatever, which is about a 16/10 = 8/5 slope. But that translates back to ~57.9946 degrees, so sticking with 58 is really just as good in this case.   \n   \nBut if you want a simpler/more\\_elegant slope you could use 3/2 which is 1.5, and the arc-tangent of that is about 56.3099 degrees, so use 56.31 and you'll get a nice two pixel move vertically for every three pixels you move horizontally, which means your line will have alternating two and one pixel steps.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Ren�, it's very easy to calculate the angle, in degrees, if you know the slope (and vice-versa). Softwares like Excel, and scientific calculators have the necessary (arc-tangent and tangent) functions. No need to know formulas! ;-)   \n   \nAnd, I think all type design softwares have that \"measurement\" tool. You can measure any angle, in degrees, with that tool. It's very simple too, if you don't want to go to the calculator.   \n   \nFor example, let's say you want to calculate the angle, in degrees, for a 2:3 slope. Just draw a rectangle, 20units x 30units (40x60, 80x120, or anything proportional), and measure one of its diagonals. The software will tell you the angle. That's it.\n\n"
