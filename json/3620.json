Also, the \"S\" is pretty ugly (heh)...be cruel, but please - help me with some hints.   \n   \nThanks ![Phatto Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043143im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28671.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "It seems like you're trying to \"cram\" an even stroke through a rather low x-height with the \"s\", and you would probably have to with the \"z\" also.   \n   \nWhat I would suggest is either cleverly play with angles or make the middle stroke's weight thinner.   \n   \nAlso, consider giving the \"k\" (and your to-be \"z\") more-or-less straight diagonals, it's okay to have some unique members in a set.   \n   \nOverall, this is a really neat style. What about that \"a\"? It looks a bit off...   \n   \nGood luck!\n\n"

Give him the foot it needs   \n   \ni,j: stems should be same height   \n   \nk: perhaps give the upper arm an angle   \n   \ns: the spine is way to light as it is right now. But it's overall too constructed. Get away from a fixed witdh perhaps. Draw!   \n   \nt: make the horizontal stroke a little thinner   \n   \nu,y: too wide, should be a little more condensed than the n.   \n   \nx: too horizontal. make it a little more condensed   \n   \nFor all joins (connection curve/stem): make the outline a little lighter there. You might even consider trapping. But I'm sure the man from the lambic valley will help you on this issue.   \n   \nThis for the beginning.   \n   \nServus   \n   \nDominik\n\n"
