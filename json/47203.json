  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nWell I don't usually post work but I would really like this project to be a strong as possible and thought I would see if I could get some feedback from this great community.\n\nThis is the basic layout spread and typefaces I have gone with (Thanks Jos loving Museo).\n\nSorry the content is all filler but I am still waiting for the editorial, but wanted to get a jump on the inside layout. Please give me any suggestions and crits you have.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825005529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/layoutComp_5095.jpg)\n\ncheers\n\np@\n\n",

      "content": "I don't think it looks professional. Why? Here's why:\n\nI don't like the top and bottom green bars. Especially not the top one. And they also don't complement each other.\n\nText boxes don't have enough white space around them, hence unprofessional and unrefined look.\n\nLeading with this wide text column is too tight.\n\nImagery doesn't match in style even though presented as part of the same publication.\n\nAs said at the beginning. Looks like anyone could do it and as most wanna-be-a-designer would do it. Sorry. Don't like it at all. Golfers are usually richer people and this doesn't reflect this fact. This spread reminds me more of a church mass invitation than anything else.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

I have tweeked it bit and here is what I am looking at now.\n\nReally would like to play with the white space more but at 5.375 x 8.375 and a limited number of pages it tends to get a little crowded at times.\n\nHere is an example with at least some of the editorial I am waiting for.\n\np@\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825005529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/comp_4690.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Ok. This looks much better. But if I were you I'd use some free photographic material instead of clip-art vector graphics. It will make it look more sophisticated and nice.\n\nIf space is a problem in that case I'd get rid of coloured edged colour bars because they tend to make content space even smaller and less breathable. I'd incorporate more organic shapes (softened photographic material may work nice if partially also in the content background) that will look nice.\n\nEliminating as many limiting surfaces you'll gain breathing space. BUT. Don't get tempted to make content any bigger because you won't benefit anything.\n\nYour layout is very full already. If you can't get through with decent looking brochure I'd suggest you convince your client to either cut down content or add more pages. Prepare some very good arguments (include some printouts that will look much nicer and convincing) so client will say yes to whatever you'll say.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

      "content": "Hmm...after looking at the design, considering it's for a golf championship, it looks elementary; almost like it's a pre-made template (sorry! no offense: ). Is this something the client suggested?\n\nWhen I think of golf, I think of sharp, crisp, clean lines, sophistication, rich greens, blues and golden browns with nice contrast. I also think of openness, no boundries, like that of a golf course. Your design seems restricted and too structured. I would suggest playing with the curves that you would naturally find on golf greens, sand traps, the ball, etc...Opening up the design, like Litera suggested will give you much more room to work with. I hope this helps...\n\n"

      "content": "I disagree with the above comment. I think that the design blends subtle curves and straight edges very nicely. While golf courses are \"natural\" (is there anything really natural about manicured greens and strategically placed sand, trees, and water?), the game itself is very structured. The ball is perfectly round, the club is perfectly straight, everything is perfectly precisioned.\n\nI actually like the idea of the green strip at the bottom of the original image you posted. But have you tried making the strip asymmetrical across the spread? And what about doing the page-number ball on the even-numbered pages and a pin/hole on the odd-numbered pages? Hmmm does this seem too cliche?\n\nMy father has been design golf tournament collateral for years, so I might be a little over-zealous about this stuff.\n\n-S\n\n"

You could go both ways; it all comes down to personal preference :)\n\nI would still like to see darker, richer colors...I think the drab, gray background is throwing me off.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello again every, thanks again for the feedback. here is some new pages with the a few layout tweaks and some actual editorial.\n\nlitera: I agree and thank you for all your points. But, the look they where going for this year was a more vector look, all the tickets and such have a vector image of a golfer sort of silhouetted in solid colors. I tried to reflect that my own way with the dimples of the ball. I would love to work in more pages with the client but I work in the production world and I am given a set number of pages to keep the price of printing down. What the boss man says, I do.\n\nSorry aluminum but the client likes the golf balls so they ended up staying.\n\nOberlange and sch2525 I think you both make very good points for both ends, I played a bit with curves like you suggested but just kept coming back to the more structured look.\n\nWell thanks again and hope I am getting closer to something half decent.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825005529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/page39_6251.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130825005529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/page44_5238.jpg)\n\np@\n\n"

      "content": "Okay not much of a design comment but in your first comment two guys from my University (Auburn) are listed. War Eagle! (and also my undergrad school and rival to my current one, Alabama.... Roll Tide!)\n\nI like the colors, and most of the plays (all?) are from universities, the design matches very closely with standard university non-big-3 sports. These are the colors I would have expected, I think the blue previously suggested would make it even more cartoonish.+\n\nI really like the texture you've given, as it nicely matches the dimples on a golf ball, ditto for the curved lines which make me think of wind. It's a clean layout which is the image I get from golf players (who else makes sure their shirts and pants are ironed before they go out to play sport?)\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».
