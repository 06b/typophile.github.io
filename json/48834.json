  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m looking at getting some opinions on a logo I’m currently designing for a photographer.\n\nThe client likes to give the impression of being a person and not a company, and therefore doesn’t want over the top branding. It was therefore my job to come up with something simple and to the point.\n\nWith this in mind I simply want to focus on creating a logo that was simple yet recognizable (as it will also be used as a watermark on his images). So far I have been playing with the his name and have come up with the following 4 alternatives.\n\nComments, suggestions, critique welcome by all...\n\n:)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [craignye\\_logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201100234/http:/typophile.com/files/craignye_logo_0.jpg) | 67.15 KB |\n\n [‹ Mexicoooo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201100234/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48821 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Media(/marketing) company logo, design from scratch ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201100234/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48452 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Normally I’m usually all for Helvetica, it’s a classic, but in this instance it doesn’t work.\n\nYou need a typeface with more warmth, charisma and character. Helvetica is the complete opposite of what you’re going for.\n\nAs for the wordmark, creating a ligature to connect his first and last name doesn’t seem to be a solution. Ultimately, you are turning the name into a company. To remain in your concept of creating a personal logo and not a company logo, you really need to keep his first and last names separate. Craig Nye is a person, craignye isn’t.\n\nAlso could you elaborate more on what you or your client consider over-the-top branding.\n\n"

I agree with avestic - its not really working as a personal logo, it looks like a corporation based in NY.\n\nMost photographer’s logos i know of are very clear on a first name last name distinction and much simpler than your initial jpg. Its an interesting name your working with, i wouldn’t try and be too fussy with it.\n\n"

As mentioned above helvetica is not an ideal way to sell personality.\n\nPresuming that [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201100234/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/craignye/) is him I think that maybe you could try to incorporate the style of photography that he does.\n\nI can’t imagine a lovely decorative signature working with his photographs or even muted, cool helvetica. Maybe be more energetic and vigorous with the style of writing in order to communicate the energy that a lot of his photos have!\n\nTry writing his name using ink and a blunt stick, and don’t be shy with the ammount of ink and the energy that you put into it. The more expressive and energetic the better!\n\n"
