I Googled over the web, and found that Moving Brands, a newly emerging design firm based in Lodon helped making the new logo for the the new emerged company in 2007. There is also an animation verson of the logo. Pretty impressive.  \nBut I still have no idea what exactly the typeface is. The font looks like a customization based on Neo Sans and Frutiger. Any thoughts?\n\n"
