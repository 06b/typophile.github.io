As a basic example, the weight or color of the face might change based on how fast it was entered by the user.   \n   \nI am interested in researching existing typefaces that have unusual programming to see what precedents have been set. I�ve scoped out the experimental section here on Typophile and looked at �random� fonts such as Beowolf and Flipper. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions of other typefaces to look at, or books/articles/web sites that might be relevant to my project.   \n   \nThanks,   \nAngela Wolak\n\n",

And the links mentioned above already cover a lot of ground.   \n   \nThe one caution I would state early on is this: be careful to keep functionality always in sight - avoid turning things into self-serving formal aesthetic exercises.   \n   \nBTW, the \"g\" in Analogue makes me think you should be designing type.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
