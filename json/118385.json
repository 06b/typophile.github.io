Inspired by Old English cultures and their descendants between the mid-5th century and the mid-12th Century. Made up of two styles, Wallington Regular that consists of 491 glyphs and Wallington Small Caps with 365 glyphs. All glyphs are divided into several OpenType features such as Ligature, Contextual Alternates, Old Style Numeric and some astonishing special characters that allows you to mix and match pairs of letters to fit your design.\n\nFind out more : [http://ink.creativezeune.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317082142/http:/ink.creativezeune.com/ \"http://ink.creativezeune.com\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317082142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_4492.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317082142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4_4962.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317082142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2_6555.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317082142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3_6664.png)\n\n",
