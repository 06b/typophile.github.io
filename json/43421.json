  "content": "Hey all,\n\nWorking on my first typeface for school. Its supposed to be a display face and we pretty much have freedom to do whatever we want in terms of design approach. I had a crazy idea of mixing Helvetica Neue with Adobe Casslon - Since I've always wanted a serif that's close to Neue (after working on it I realize how crazy this sounds).\n\nAnyhow I've continued working on it and have a very rough version of the lower case, perhaps you could guide me in the right direction. I know the last five letters don't match at all (v,w,x,y,z).\n\nAlso have a rough version of the uppercase but not in Fontlab yet.\n\nThanks very much :-)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [jaffa\\_specimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417142741/http:/typophile.com/files/jaffa_specimen.pdf) | 41.58 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I think you have a great start, but there are some elements that are throwing me. I think that some of the serifs on the caps are very angled. They need to point less out and more down. The stroke contrast seems to be too strong right at the top of the bowls of most lowercases.\n\nThe terminus of the lc g is a little odd. Maybe since its a serif, you may need to make it an eyeglass (two-story) g.\n\nI would love to see how this turns out.\n\n"
