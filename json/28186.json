  "content": "Years ago, I created [Kosal Says hy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042507/http:/www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2243) purely as an my first font endeavor. I uploaded to as many sites possible hoping to see it used everywhere (however bad it may be.) Lo and behold, I do a search for graffiti fonts on myfonts and see a font that is extremely close to my original drawings. So close that it can't be a coincidence: [Shallow.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042507/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wilton/shallow/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/comparison_3976.gif)\n\nLooks like the designer softened up the letters, added whatever ornament necessary to distinguish it, thickened the strokes, and made some much needed improvements. Is this legal? Probably so, because I labeled it as freeware, right?\n\nNot that it bothers me, my original was crappy anyway. I'm just surprised.  \nSlightly flattered.\n\n",

Although these fonts are available for free, the author retains the copyright, meaning that restrictions usually apply to alteration, reproduction, publication and distribution of the font. Practically no author will allow you to sell his/her font for profit or to include it in another product or CD-ROM compilation without permission and in most cases you will not be allowed to use parts of the font to create your own font. Detailed copyright information is usually included in the corresponding font zip-file as readme.txt, copyright.txt or an equivalent text-file.\n\nIt was a nono after all.\n\n"
