We are making some changes/updates and the original web design company, in a display of sour grapes, is not telling us what font this is, because they want to do all the updating work.\n\n[Click here for a sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20090517085055/http:/www.energyottawa.com/_images/english/inside/green/t_green_generation.gif) or [Click here for the full website](http://web.archive.org/web/20090517085055/http:/www.energyottawa.com/green_power/index.cfm?dsp=template&act=view3&template_id=46&lang=e)\n\nAny help anybody can provide in identifying this font would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks\n\nTim\n\n",
