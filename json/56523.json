  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’ve posted this before, and got the answer that it could be squooshed Helvetica Rounded, and it possibly is. HOWEVER, I Can only find Helvetica Rounded Bold which seems far to bold and thick. the typeface looks just like it, but it’s so fat, when in the logo every trace is so nicely thin. Incredibly, I have the same problem (only black and bold versions available) for several similar rounded fonts. Is there an Helvetica rounded (thin or light) not so fat? where?  \nIs there any good alternative (rounded thin) that looks just like Helvetica?  \nThanks.  \nPedro\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090403080112im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_3551.jpg)\n\n [‹ Help our studio identify this bold serif.](http://web.archive.org/web/20090403080112/http:/typophile.com/node/56530 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Beautiful Serif - Any ideas?
