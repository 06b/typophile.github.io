  "content": "Hi,\n\nmy client is a Franco-German auditing firm consisting of three people. The company is based in Paris and works for German, Austrian, and Swiss companies operating in France.\n\nThe logo they are after should be a very simple wordmark containing their company name (\"ABTF\") as well as a brief description of what they do (literally: \"Audit, Bookkeeping & Tax in France\").\n\nUnfortunately, I was only able to come up with one idea:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120615013212im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_5917.png)\n\nI am planning to color this logo in the colors of the French flag.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of it and how it could be improved. Thanks a lot for any input!\n\n",

Also the lockup seems very uncertain. I don't think you need the rules. I'd try something bolder on the right, or maybe a white box around the right. But more importantly, the idea.\n\n"

Actually, I'm making a website for the client and the logo is \"just\" a by-product. Here's the current version of the website, if anybody is interested: [Link to project](http://web.archive.org/web/20120615013212/http:/temp.designbits.de/)\n\nFeedback is appreciated!\n\n[Webdesign Hamburg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120615013212/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"
