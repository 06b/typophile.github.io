  "content": "Hi,\n\nI came across this logo recently for Centropolis and love the condensed deco font. I tried finding it but couldn’t. Silhouette is the closest I got: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/silhouette/silhouette/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200114/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/silhouette/silhouette/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/silhouette/silhouette/\")\n\nAny suggestions? Any fonts that look like this?\n\nThanks,\n\nTal\n\n [‹ Critique of magazine logo design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200114/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36582 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [High School Newspaper critique ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200114/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36765 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
