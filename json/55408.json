  "content": "I was doodling and came up with an ambigram for my name, Daniel. It works pretty well, but of course there's always room for improvement. I'm looking to use it as a logo, either for my blog or printed/embossed on a business card, so I'm flexible in terms of size, styling, weight, etc. The top one is the core design, below is the \"stylized\" version I came up with on my netbook in MS Word (forgive the crudeness).\n\n[http://i39.tinypic.com/2r44oqh.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724150801/http:/i39.tinypic.com/2r44oqh.png \"http://i39.tinypic.com/2r44oqh.png\")\n\nAny suggestions or ideas? Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [daniel.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724150801/http:/typophile.com/files/daniel.PNG) | 40.76 KB |\n\n",
