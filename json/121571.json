  "content": "Hi,\n\nThese are home poker chips that were designed about ten years ago, with the artwork stamped on them in foil. I've gotten permission to recreate the artwork for my personal use, but the owner no longer has any art files. So while this post is mainly for the top font \"CASBAH CLUB\", I'm also interested in what was used for the denominations (if different) and for \"LAS VEGAS\" at the bottom. I'll of course create new requests for them if necessary.\n\nHuge thanks for any help you can give me!\n\nCheers,  \nMikko\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317212538im_/http:/typophile.com/files/casbah%20club_6485.JPG)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Formal Script 421 (Ondine) \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [DPape](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317212538/http:/typophile.com/user/3945 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
