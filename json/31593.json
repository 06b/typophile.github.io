Can you explain why you won’t be using Freight Text? Are you limited to your current font collection or looking for something new? Tell us more about your subject matter and audience.\n\n"

I will be purchasing Freight text later on. Also I don’t wan’t to limit myself to just using Freight text with sans. I want to to expand my possibilities and I’m not really good with font combos (also Minion is available).\n\n_Tell us more about your subject matter and audience._\n\nI’m designing a new logo for a property manager and I think that Freight Sans has the right personality and seriousness that the logo needs to convey. The name is Burns Glover Property Management. I also chose Freight Sans in anticipation of other applications such as signage of various sizes and newspaper ads.\n\n"

Tarocco is just recently expanded into a OTF family which now carry (redrawn) old style figures for all 7 weights. Also alternates have been added along with a set of ornaments. It will be released with Psy/Ops soon, but already available upon request.\n\n/SH\n\n"
