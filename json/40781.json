The ’B’ is awkward and the [counters](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153905/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/counter) are clogged, evidence of mechanical extrapolation to make the heavy weights, rather than redrawing. This is not Chester’s best work. I’m hoping he updates it [like he did Apex Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153905/http:/www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/Example+About/).\n\n"
