The name is Andromeda Audio Networks. There is a much better visual potential here, namely the metaphor of constellations as networks. Just looking for some comments on my first hack at it.

The silhouette of the mountain range creates an awkward white space between the graphic and the name.\n\nTry other variations on the constellation theme and perhaps other non-star related concepts.\n\nI’m rusty on my mythology, but could you draw anything from who Andromeda was?\n\n"

She was rescued by Perseus.\n\nThat theme was not to uplifting or appropriate for a corporate logo, so I thought I’d just stick with the constellation. Unfortunately, as you can see, the constellation of Andromeda leaves much to be desired. I’m having a hard time coming up with something interesting that can stand alone with just that silly V shape.\n\n"

      "content": "The current treatment of the stars is a natural looking one, however you may well run into problems when this logo has to be used at smaller sizes than shown in your example. Issues such as dot gain and variable pressmanship may cause these fine details to fill in on printed matter, and will also suffer when used on screen. Adopting an approach which uses larger, stylised pointed star shapes would be both punchier and more robust.\n\nI would get rid of the tan colour for the constellation, and design the logo in black and white only until you are completely happy with the shapes. For colour variations you could consider replacing the black of the sky with a very deep blue.\n\n"

Try AAN with a star (or a few stars) with the name stacked under it in 3 lines. By doing this you can over time establish AAN star(s), as their look much like the Dallas Cowboys. I guess what I’m saying is you are being to literal.\n\n"

The mountains are extraneous.\n\nThe constellations/networks thing is good, but you’re not emphasizing it enough. Perhaps you could design an interesting network-ish web of connections, with a central emphasized shape that looks like an ‘A’? Maybe?\n\nDunno, but Andromeda’s a galaxy, not just a constellation, so I think of [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104529/http:/www.science-explorer.de/astronomie/space-andromeda.jpg) and [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104529/http:/www.starshine.com/frankn/astronomy/images/Andromeda.gif) more than the form in your first design.\n\nThe typeface is interesting. Though I guess it’ll change with the different concepts.\n\n"

I also suggested to use two typeface, a strong one for Andromeda and medium on for Audio Media, probably in the same family.
