      "content": "Brendel Informatik, I have come to learn, digitized quite a few typefaces that are otherwise unavailable digitally. I think that Plakette is a digitization of the Permanent typeface family (the g and, especially, the y are quite distinctive). This is Plakette DemiBold:   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415052043im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69878.gif)   \n   \nUsing and stretching this, I was able to duplicate your 'panic' image.   \n   \nPermanent originally came in more than one weight and [Brendel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415052043/http:/www.qbf.de/tceng.htm) offers Plakette in five. The only other digital version of Permenent I'm aware of is [URW's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415052043/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/permanent/). Pre-digital Permanent also used to be offered in versions with and without descenders. URW's offering matches Plakette DemiBold, except that it is without descenders while Plakette is with descenders.\n\n"
