  "content": "My dad's asked me to create a website for his law firm (only two lawyers), and the first thing they want to do is create a new logo. They don't currently have a \"logo\" per se, but simple text used on their letterheads.\n\nHere are a couple of the ideas I've been working on. I don't want to just have a plain text logo, so I tried my hand at an accompanying symbol/image. I couldn't come up with anything original that related to law/lawyers, only a gavel and the scales of justice images which are incredibly overused.\n\nAny ideas where I can go from here?\n\nTheir areas are: divorce law, criminal defense, civil litigation and personal injury. The firm name is King & Lloyd, P.A.\n\nI want the logo to be simple, clean and portray professionalism, trustworthiness, and success (?).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sample1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150119233418/http:/typophile.com/files/sample1_3.jpg) | 44.8 KB |\n| [sample2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150119233418/http:/typophile.com/files/sample2_4.jpg) | 49.68 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I rather like sample1; it's classy without being stereotypically stuffy. I like the contrast between the sans-serif text and the fancier ampersand, and I think the text meshes nicely with the colored blocks.\n\nHowever, the ampersand seems a bit off center to me... maybe you could move it to the right a bit? It feels like 'Lloyd' is all by itself there.\n\nAlso, the small serif text on the bottom doesn't fit quite right to me. I think you should stay with a serif font, but that particular one seems a bit too plain perhaps.\n\nI hope that helps. Good luck!\n\n"

Something to relate to the type.\n\nI think the colors work. But not with such a bold, black font. Try using shades of black or to soften it with a blue black. For me, it is not appearing too friendly.\n\nPersonally, I would be using a + sign between the names. But that's just me.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"
