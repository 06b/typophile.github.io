      "content": "Good catch Ryuk.  \nThe record is post 2011 so it's almost certainly digital Brothers, which according to Identifont was designed by John Downer for Emigre in 1999. I note from his Identifont biography that he published essays on type history and hand lettering have in Emigré magazine and House magazine. Unfortunately, I have none of these at hand.  \nDoes anyone have any idea as to the source of the original design?  \nThe Myfonts tags included \\_cigar\\_ so I looked for matching lettering. I found an online image of a Tampa Life cigar box label from 1927 which looks somewhat similar toe Brothers:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TampaLifeCigar1927_4427.jpg)\n  \nsource: [http://www.magazine.usf.edu/2011-fall/slideshow/history-preserved/tampa-...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065029/http:/www.magazine.usf.edu/2011-fall/slideshow/history-preserved/tampa-life-cigar.jpg \"http://www.magazine.usf.edu/2011-fall/slideshow/history-preserved/tampa-life-cigar.jpg\")  \nLarger image at: [http://russellsshirts.blogspot.ca/2012/11/cigar-label-tampa-life.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065029/http:/russellsshirts.blogspot.ca/2012/11/cigar-label-tampa-life.html \"http://russellsshirts.blogspot.ca/2012/11/cigar-label-tampa-life.html\")  \nAnything else?  \nPerhaps there is a 19th century woodtype? I note Brothers has catchwords, which were available as special cuts from 19th century foundries.  \nI note Brothers is similar to Gin [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/gin/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065029/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/gin/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hold-fast-foundry/gin/\") a design at least partly inspired by gin and whiskey bottles.  \nFinally, I see that what comes around goes around. The logo for a new cigar box -- Caja del Campion [http://www.cajadelcampeon.com/blogs/news](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317065029/http:/www.cajadelcampeon.com/blogs/news \"http://www.cajadelcampeon.com/blogs/news\") -- is a match for Brothers. The blog refers to the movie O Brother Where Are Thou, which which seems to use Brothers for the title -- with the alternate R, but not to the Brothers font.  \nDon \n"
