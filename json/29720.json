I'm afraid, syntax highlighting is the best you'll find.\n\nYou might want to contact the developers of [MetaType](http://web.archive.org/web/20100427182448/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METATYPE1).  \nAlso have a look at [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20100427182448/http:/typophile.com/node/29008).\n\n"

      "content": "\"syntax highlighting\" makes a text editor recognise the code of a particular programming language (i.c. METAFONT) while you're typing. This reduces the risk for typos and other mistakes that will have the interpreter misunderstand your program. Just look for a plug-in and add it to the editor of your choice: erroneous code will not be highlighted, whereas valid code will be hightlighted according to the syntax.\n\n"
