  "content": "Hi Forum.\n\nI would like to identify two fonts I saw in a publication.  \nThe first (sample 1) is a handwriting Script.  \nThe second (sample 2) is a modern Sans Serif. I know this one but can't remember the name or Foundry.\n\nThank's\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sample1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112215/http:/typophile.com/files/sample1_0.jpg) | 72.71 KB |\n| [sample2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112215/http:/typophile.com/files/sample2_0.jpg) | 73.02 KB |\n\n",

[Sweet Pea](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112215/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/sweet-pea/) is fairly similar, but that's the most I can say about it. A few of her others also resemble it a bit.\n\nI also looked at Rob Leuschke's work, but nothing was very close.\n\nSeeing the language used, this could be from a Scandinavian font designer -- an area we don't see enough of to know very well, speaking for myself.\n\nIf someone does ID it, I would like to add it to the Script Font ID Guide.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
