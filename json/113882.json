  "content": "I would like to ask, how much would i charge for designing a book by project (not by per hour). Charging by per hour are just minor changes. We cant keep track by charging the whole idea and design by per hour nor by per page. The book size is 280(h)x280(w)mm and pagination from 200-250pgs with hard cover.\n\nContent for Quotation:  \n1. Proposal on Concept Approach  \n2. Consultation on Concept  \n3. Design layout typography  \n4. Scan, photoshop, Illustrations/tracings graphics, search for stock images  \n5. Content Editing / Proofreading\n\nPlease do let me know if i missed out anything or whats the best idea.  \nThank you for sharing your knowledge and experience.\n\nregards,  \nMartin\n\n",
