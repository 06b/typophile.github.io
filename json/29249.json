It appears that ATypI is a professional group and SOTA is an enthusiast's, to probably oversimplify. The other groups Tiffany mentioned I am not familiar with. I am curious what people have to say about each, particularly since I am not connected to \"the type scene\" of my area. If there is one.\n\nSome things I am curious about are the future of type and such things as emerging computer typography, DRM and its place in type, as well as various things such as independent foundry culture, online collaboration tech, and communicating the value of type as media itself. Or just networking. I imagine I might learn more at this point by just gathering people's impressions, rather than saying, \"I feel so-and-so, who shall I hang with?\"\n\nI'll have to say, in some industries, it was worth the price of memebership, and no other commitment, to get the magazine. :)\n\n[Choz Cunningham](http://web.archive.org/web/20100114141730/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20100114141730/http:/www.exclamchine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20100114141730/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"

You _could_ separate them as the former being for the business and the latter for the enthusiast. But, if you delve under the surface you will find many similarities. Both focus on the educational, historical, and technical sides as well. You will find more graphic designers at a SOTA conference (TypeCon) than you will at ATypI, but both conferences garner support from practicing type designers and foundries. As well, both are equally good for networking. Many people who attend TypeCon also attend ATypI.\n\nTypeCon is held once a year somewhere in the U.S., this year in Seattle, whereas ATypI travels between continents. TypeCon's workshops have a broader interest in the book arts, letterpress, and graphic design, but all from a type enthusiasts point of view; as well as having workshops on the technical side of type creation. ATypI has the TypeTech forum which focuses on type and its creation and use, much more technical and generally not for the beginner. Both organizations are determinedly involved with education.\n\nFor instance, if you do want to hear about DRM, all you have to do is put a bug in the ear of a board member, me for instance, and we can try to get something put together at TypeCon. (The same could be said for ATypI.) Last year, Frank Martinez led a discussion about the legal side of things, most specifically the EULA and copyright I believe at TypeCon. However, the BEST way to get a talk on DRM is to volunteer to speak on it. ;^) Or, to find someone more qualified and tell them to volunteer. Volunteering is what keeps both organizations going. It is to the volunteers and those that attend and participate that make these conferences work and keep the organizations going.\n\nSimon gave you a very good question and I'll have to second that. You will get out of the group what you put into it.\n\n"

I like to 'know-it-all' before offering my opinion in any but the most casual circumstances. And public speaking is about as appealing to me as most people.
