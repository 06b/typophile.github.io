  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI'm very pleased to say that I have produced a new art print.\n\nThe print is called 'Blazing' and is available exclusively from Pictures on Walls.  \nPOW is a big gallery selling the work of some extremely talented and established artists including Banksy and Antony Micallef, so I think it's a very positive development.\n\nIt's an ambigram, which means you can read it both ways up. Details here:\n\n[www.seblester.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014105432/http:/www.seblester.co.uk/ \"www.seblester.co.uk\")  \n [www.picturesonwalls.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014105432/http:/www.picturesonwalls.com/ \"www.picturesonwalls.com\")\n\n",
