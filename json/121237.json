  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nI found this book called “PALETTE 01. Black & White. New Monochrome Graphics” from viction:ary ( [http://victionary.com/product/p01-bw/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095516/http:/victionary.com/product/p01-bw/ \"http://victionary.com/product/p01-bw/\")) and I loved this font they used on some quotes and all the paragraph texts which in my head looks a bit like Rockwell but an stencil version.\n\nI've seen online a few slab serif fonts but they are not as nice as this one. Does anyone know which font is this one? I took a very bad picture at the book store and found a few more online from the book.\n\nTHANKS!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Stag Stencil \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [riccard0](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095516/http:/typophile.com/user/46071 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [IMG\\_9935.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095516/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_9935.jpg) | 189.03 KB |\n| [p01\\_bw\\_s\\_01.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095516/http:/typophile.com/files/p01_bw_s_01.png) | 427.69 KB |\n| [p01\\_bw\\_s\\_07.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095516/http:/typophile.com/files/p01_bw_s_07.png) | 399.56 KB |\n| [Victionary\\_BlackWhite\\_Low-1672.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095516/http:/typophile.com/files/Victionary_BlackWhite_Low-1672.jpg) | 318.55 KB |\n\n",
