  "content": "This book cover reminds me of a sort of dark Dr. Suess drawing. Maybe Dr. Suess's evil twin brother, Dr. Sinister! It just caught my eye when I was looking around the library. I also like that they used the paint brushes and pencils to make the XX's to represent the roman numeral 20 .. that's pretty neat-o. Do you think they used the pilgrim hat to symbolize America? hm... Either way it's got some really cool stuff in it if anyone wants to check it out, it's in the art section. :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130628094102im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bookcover1_4774.jpg)\n\n",
