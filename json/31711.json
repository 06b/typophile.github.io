I have no desire to go back to psyche in any capacity- it wouldn’t be right anyway, because my heart’s not in it any longer. I do think the experience has helped me be a better designer on a psychological aspect- I’m pretty good at getting a feel for what clients will like… it’s hard to explain so briefly here.\n\nIf I weren’t an illustrator, I’d want to be a rock star. Get up on stage and deafen myself as I pound the crap out of my instrument and then go drink beer after the show. Maybe run off with some adoring fan. I say this because I thought working with type would be similar, and man what a let down that has been. :)\n\nIf I couldn’t be the rock star and needed to get something a little more “down to earth”, I’d go into sales.\n\n"
