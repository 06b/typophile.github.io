But we are reprinting this book and I need to know what font this is to recreate the cover.\n\nWe couldn't find it for building the website so we used Harrington: [http://www.haikuwisdom.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826032206/http:/www.haikuwisdom.com/ \"http://www.haikuwisdom.com/\")\n\nBut now we need the font for the second edition of the book.

So, first the original BB&S font:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826032206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LiningAngloDetailBBS1907SM_3567.jpg)\n  \nThen an original digitization. Fivios mentioned an Anglo \"Generated by Fontographer 4.1.5.\" I found this in my folder of original digitizations by Dan X. Solo of metal type fonts that he had purchased during his many years of hunting for metal fonts. The digitization is of good quality, not merely an autoscan. This digital font was distributed [1998?] by Dan X. Solo in Dover Victorian book + CD pack. The legitimate way to acquire it is by purchasing the book.  \nSo the digital font ID could be Dan X. Solo's Anglo.  \nThere are some other digitizations but of poorer quality. I have not checked their provenance, but some might be original creative works. Version 2: Angelo 1993 B & P Graphics, Ltd. Can't say if this is their original or they lifted it from someone's earlier digitization, perhaps Opti. Version 3: Viata Script, Softkey, 1992 SS & Rankle 1995 Elfring Soft Fonts. And more loose ends: Anglophile (Novel), Anglican (WSI).... I have not checked.\n\nDon\n\n"
