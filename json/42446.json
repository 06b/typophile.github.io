It is certainly an impressive type system in its coverage of sans and serif, multitude of weights, and Cyrillic and Greek scripts. It certainly seems to have aspirations of being a versatile workhorse.\n\nWhat do people think of its Baroque spirit and distinctive flavour, though? As much as I admire it, I do worry it might be a bit too flashy for \"serious\" work. I guess you can never accuse František Štorm of being boring...\n\n"

I actually did a small writeup that hasn't been published yet, which hits all the same points about the family that you just made. Overall I feel it's a very solid type system, but definitely should be saved for occasions when appropriate and probably not suitable for everyday work (although i don't think I would mind seeing it all the time).\n\n"

Though right now, I haven't seen it in use anywhere, and I'm itching to see examples. I know, it was only released last year, but hey, I'm impatient.\n\nIn my search for Anselm in use, I ran into [this surreal thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424140020/http:/www.hpmuseum.org/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/hpmuseum/archv017.cgi?read=128086) about the font choice for labels in an open calculator project. As far as I can tell, a group of aficionados are collaborating to build a calculator, code name Phoenix. One of them has suggested Anselm (sans, I believe) for the labels, and has even contacted Franta Štorm about extending the character set as needed for a scientific calculator, and got a positive response from him.\n\nWow, that's one use I had not thought of.\n\n"

I'm hoping he recused himself when it came to the category that he was entered in and subsequently won. I've heard grumblings about conflict of interest in the past.

We wrote to Maxim Zhukov, organiser of the advisory panel, and to Matthew Carter, the chairman, prior to the competition to let them know that neither of us were able to participate because we were submitting a design. We recommended some possible replacements. Maxim later contacted me to see if I could recommend someone qualified to take a look at entries in two scripts for which he did not have advisors (neither script Devanagari), and I gave him some names. He was unable to find anyone to review one of the entries, and asked me some questions about the design, to which I gave what I believe were impartial answers regarding its fitness to the stated purpose of the design (low res devices). I believe, although I have not seen confirmation yet, that the design was the 'OTS Ethiopic' from Monotype Imaging, for which the TDC are apparently awaiting artwork for the website.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the number of people with experience designing for certain scripts is small, but such scripts shouldn't be penalised during the judging due to lack of qualified advice.\n\n"

That felt good. I just wanna say that actually it’s not the first time that two Mexican are selected in the same year. It happened in 2006 —Gabriel Martínez Meave (yes, Presidencia’s author) and Alejandro Lo Celso, although Lo Celso is certainly more Argentinian than Mexican—, and in 2005 Leonardo Vázquez won with Bunker, a display face. And Martínez Meave again in 2001. Maybe the difference is that this year we had significant clients: a renowned publishing house and the Presidency of Mexico (no less).\n\nOf course, I hope this will be repeated. ;)\n\nCH\n\n"
