The listing says \"old brewery stock\" Tivoli Brewing Company original _Mile Hi_ beer bottle label.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014100411im_/http:/typophile.com/files/milehi_5904.JPG)\n\nI was wondering if anyone here would know what font is being used for \"Mile Hi\".\n\nThanks :)\n\n",
