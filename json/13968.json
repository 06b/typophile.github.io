  "content": "I am using TypeTool to make some adjustments to SimSun. The reason is that one of my clients wants me to compress a font slightly. This feature is not available in the software I use for reporting, so I need to be able to compress the font at TTF level. I have opened Simsun and used Tools|Transform and then changed the Horizontal scale. This is all good except for the fact that one of the characters comes out really strangely. Can anyone advise on this or alternatively, I would be happy to pay for some help on this.\n\n",
