The founders are based in Argentina and Prague (Czech Republic), respectively. From their description:\n\n> \"The company developed out of the desire to create an independent platform for publishing high quality typefaces and to collaborate on new type projects together. Hence the name. TypeTogether's focus is on finding innovative and stylish solutions to old problems for mainly the professional market of text typefaces. However, there are also a couple of more experimental display faces in the make. TypeTogether also aims for excellent technical performance, broad language support and at least the standard Opentype features.\"\n\n**External Links**  \n [Official Site](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230702/http:/www.type-together.com/)\n\n",
