All I am able to stir up so far is very cursory.  \nI figured if anyone could help me, it would be the great minds at Typophile.  \nCan anyone here point me in a good direction to find useful information about Schroeder?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n-Chuck\n\n",

      "content": "There seems to be enough basic info (such as where he was living at some key points in time) to be able to use some of the available genealogy sources, including newspaper searches for related articles. Probably not much in Mill Valley, but as you know, there are/were quite a few papers in Saint Louis. There are also immigration records, naturalization data, census records, military records, and lots more. It depends on what kind of information you're looking for. - Herb\n\n"
