I would really appreciate advice on the font choice, so that I can get maximum benefit. I attached some images from the book, so you have an idea of what Font might go well with it.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [4\\_color.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417205550/http:/typophile.com/files/4_color.jpg) | 604.12 KB |\n| [2-3acolor.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417205550/http:/typophile.com/files/2-3acolor.jpg) | 971.36 KB |\n| [12.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417205550/http:/typophile.com/files/12_3.jpg) | 1.12 MB |\n\n",

That doesn't mean they can't be perceived as beautiful. Many people, especially parents, may find children's drawings to have some kind of beauty in their own right. Now I think it shouldn't be forbidden to show such pieces of beauty or wake associations with them by similarly-styled drawings or fonts. An image like that reminds me of the fun children have scribbling and drawing and of their creativity. It doesn't remind me of limited abilities.\n\nOf course, that doesn't mean these associations are appropriate in every case that involves children. It may be that such \"childish\" fonts are used too often. But still, I think it's perfectly acceptable to use them if they fit the topic. Just as it's acceptable to use imperfect adult handwriting fonts in some cases!\n\n"
