The target audience for this campaign are young people experiencing a transitional period in defining their sexual orientation. Teenagers who are scared to express who they truly are in a society full of stereotypes and prejudices. Your thoughts and assistance would be very helpful.\n\n",

It's more important to choose a font that communicates 'approachable, understanding, appealing to young people'. Or something else...I don't have the design brief.\n\nI wouldn't choose a font just because the person who designed it happened to be gay. That would be the same as positive racism, and could contribute to stereotyping. (\"Gay people are so creative\" kind of nonsense.) Surely the point of the campaign is that sexuality itself is a non-issue, and the difficulty lies in growing up in a society with prejudices.\n\nPick a font that fits the purpose. Have a look at what other welfare organisations are doing.\n\nI've designed promotional stuff for gay organisations but always picked fonts that communicate their tone, as I would for a straight organisation.\n\n"

If you feel more comfortable send me an email to my personal account [bitesofdesign@hotmail.es](mailto:bitesofdesign@hotmail.es)  \nI really want to keep away from stereotypes and experiment with typography, text and content.\n\nBendy, the point of my campaign is exactly as you say, 'sexuality itself is a non-issue, and the difficulty lies in growing up in a society with prejudices'. Obviously, a gay designer won't necessarily design just towards this social issue but the chances of them being involved with similar projects may be higher.\n\nThe tone of the campaign is to encourage young people to come out, to be confident, to appreciate life regardless of their sexual orientation. I've recently been looking at wood type block and am considering it as an option. Wood type would represent diversity, nature, origins. Typefaces used for organisations supporting the LGB Community are mostly handwritten. There is one typeface used by one of the organisations that I really like – ‘knockout’ with its tall x-height in the lower characters.\n\nAluminum, you are completely right. I have gathered lots of info and done a fair amount of research towards the topic, very little of the information I found is innovative and the topic is a bit of a red herring, as you describe it. I’m finding it really difficult to keep away from stereotypes and to focus on typography.\n\n"

Are you making adverts, info packs, branding the organisation or doing web design? We should be careful to focus on the design.\n\nFor me and lots of gay (and straight) people, sexuality plays no part in professional life. I realise this project needs to talk about sexuality in an open way but by purposely picking a font by a gay designer there is the risk of implying a person's sexuality is relevant at work.\n\nI can see however there are a lot of different points of view so it's going to come down to you.\n\nI'd choose some lively sans. Woodtype is an interesting idea too. Will you post your design when you've decided?\n\n"

Not a font that feels like it's trying to be invisible, but not one that feels like it's _trying_ to be \"different\" either; but one that goes its own way, proudly, and happily. Now if only I had an example :)  \nActually, a \"lively sans\" sounds good.  \nIn any case, I think I would avoid casting the type too much in terms of perceived genderedness in this case. That can so easily slip into embarrassing, blunt cliché.  \nLike… whatever you do, don't do anything with swashes! :-\\\n\n"

This is the kind of typographic pigeonholing I think you should avoid, especially for this kind of campaign, which is about stereotyping and pigeonholing. Making a design that looks very 'gay' (like pink, feminine and/or macho) might actually scare of a big part of the people you try to reach. You could play with these cliches, but this is a slippery slope. I would choose a modern, open-minded typeface, with no explicit connotations. Knockout could be good, but I'd rather go for something a bit cleaner, but not quite as clean as Gotham. I can't come up with names right now, but I hope this helps.\n\ncheerio Queneau\n\n"

What matters is context beyond the fact that its a gay issue. Gay people don't live in pink houses, after all.\n\nFinding a 'gay font' is actually going against the campaign, IMHO. The whole point of combating homophobia is to show that aside from the particular sex they date, there really is no difference between gay people and everyone else.\n\nAs such, I'd suggest working on the overall campaign first. Get the message/verbiage pinned down and then see which way the visuals head. At that point, I think one could start suggesting a typeface based on that criteria.\n\n"

You say it's to \"tackle homophobia,\" then you said it's to promote young closets to come out. I suppose that's under the homophobia umbrella (fear of being recognized as gay), but to many straight folk, the term _homophobia_ has little to do with those who are not out and way more to do with fear/misunderstanding/hate/threat of or by homosexual society on the whole.\n\nIf the goal is to do both, consider coming up with a concise mission statement. For example, the American Lung Association's mission is _to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease_. It clearly delineates two separate but related ideas. Anyway, you see where I'm going. Best of luck.\n\n_@Scott:_ \"If I was afraid to come out of the closet, a poster with rainbows and Raavie would scare me even more.\" Very well said.

It's hard to say exactly what else to do with the layout as there's no graphic elements yet and it's hard to tell what tone we're aiming for. I wouldn't use a big question mark, just keep one in the text, there's no reason to emphasise it when WHY is so big already.\n\nI think 'transsexual' prefers to have two s's (but both spellings are possible).

They haven't seen this designs yet. This project is part of my final major project, I designed the brief and picked the issue by myself, simply because I disagree with injustice in the world. Hopefully Stonewall want to use them for one of their campaigns.\n\nLately, I've been working in the content and the combination of words, I'm quite happy with it. Also, I divided the question in two different sections to facilitate the comprehension of information. Step 1 you select the odd one out, then Step 2 you read why is the odd one out.
