Instead it appears only in Low, Medium & High Justification and in all those Fonts which have large Number of Ligatures i.e Adobe Arabic, Microsoft Arabic TypeSetting Font etc.  \nWhen I used the Microsoft VOLT to create the same font the problem appeared as shown in the 2nd image given below.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822161021im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Font%20created%20with%20VOLT_6106.jpg)\n  \nBut I am bound to VOLT because I do not know how to use LookUps, Anchor attachment for Marks and Accurate Kerning in FontLab. In this respect FontLab is very difficult while the Volt is much easier.  \nIs there any solution Typophiles ?  \nI think to Inform the Volt Developing Team. But I do not know about them.

It doesn't support purely discretionary features such as [dlig], but it supports all the required features and also those features such as [liga] and [calt] that should be on by default. The Uniscribe Arabic shaping engine takes care of all this.\n\nWhat Zuhair's screenshots indicate is a problem between certain states of the Word Arabic justification algorithm and some fonts. The fact that there seems to be a difference in behaviour between fonts with OTL tables generated by VOLT and those generated by FL/FDK certainly is intriguing.\n\n"
