This particular font is 50 years old -- early '60s --, but it was \\*hugely\\* popular in the late seventies as well.\n\nIt's an annoying habit. Walk with me down a shopping street and I'll go \"Arnold Boecklin .. Optima .. wossthat, Frutiger? .. Peignot ..\" Scares the hell out of people who can't discern Arial from Comic Sans.\n\n"
