      "content": "VOLT has a GUI (to throw in another abbrv), AFDKO -- which I assume you mean -- doesn't have one. On the other hand, I can't really work with VOLT, GUI or not. It assumes quite a lot of background knowledge or something. There are just a few reasonable tutorials, and from the barrage of questions with 'VOLT' in the subject line in this forum you can derive how clearly written they are ...\n\nAFDKO, on the other hand, has been advertised as the bee's knees if you're into scripting and command lines. Well, I'm into that, so with a little help from the accompanying documentation I'm pretty much able to make it sit up, beg, and occasionally roll over and play dead. MakeOTF has a few peculiarities (such as insisting on a 'registered family name'??), but the latest version also comes with an updated TTX, and that gives more control over a font than a mere mortal could ask for, including even larger ASCII documents to wade through. I've just successfully compiled a font with MakeOTF, despite a large wad of warnings, and was able to put remaining finishing touches into a TTX dump.\n\nSince both are free, just install both of them and see what works for you.\n\nFontLab is built upon the ADFKO (not yet the very latest version, but I'm sure they will announce clearly and loudly when they do) but all the interesting OTF stuff is still done by typing in commands. DTLs OT Master (full version) allows you to just type in the required values -- although you still need a good background in Opentype to know what goes in which edit field.\n\nOn the subject of GUIs, I'd be sorry not to mention [FontForge](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029051547/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/) -- it's _also_ free, and from what I have seen, you can do vast amounts of 'coding' in a GUI environs. A minor drawback is that it's Linux based (I think it _should_ work just fine on a modern Mac OSX).\n\n[Edit] Almost forgot: traditionally, VOLT works best with TrueType fonts, and ADFKO with CFF (Postscript) fonts, although both created valid OTFs. However, there are tricks to use CFFs in VOLT; and its major feature, being able to add cursive, mark-to-base and mark-to-mark features to fonts (needed for accent positioning and scripts such as Arabic) has finally been integrated into the last ADFKO.\n\n"

This means that there's a little less space than that left for the actual kerning data -- which is Class1Count\\*Class2Count\\*ValueRecord(s)[1] -- plus Coverage and ClassDef1 table lengths to make sure that Coverage, ClassDef1 and ClassDef2 tables are in reach.  \nIt is not too hard to reach this limit.\n\n[1] For kerning to work, there must be a value only for the first glyph of the pair, i.e. one Record.
