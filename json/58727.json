Once I get some idea of how other people are viewing it I’ll let you know what feeling I’m aiming for and hopefully some of you will have some more font suggestions.\n\nThanks so much!\n\nEDIT: Before I get comments about the typesetting...I don’t own this font yet so these are mockups using screen captures. The type needs a lot of work that will come later.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090607102151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_concepts8_4436.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_concepts8.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090607102151/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_concepts8.pdf) | 155.78 KB |\n\n",

Why not one color?).  \nThey both are fighting for attention, they both don’t get what the deserve. Besides that the stem is very wide and bold, the hands - however - are tiny. I don’t like this.  \nThe hands are lost.\n\nThe whole is a bit dull, not vivid.  \nThe font doesn’t feel right.\n\nIn the distant I can see somewhat of a fairytail, but not a nice one.\n\nIt is dark, especially the lonely hands crying out for help.  \nIt doesn’t give me a good feeling.\n\nBut then again ... ten people ... ten opinions.  \nHope this helps.\n\n"
