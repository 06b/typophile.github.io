The House Industries EULA is the most notorious for this sort of thing (although it happens only with a high price ceiling), but I get the impression it’s becoming more common as type designers start thinking about font licensing as stock licensing. The next version of my EULA will require any company with gross income above a certain (large) amount to have a special license for using a typeface in a logotype.\n\nI think the font industry should do serious designers a favor by requiring a special license for any for-profit logo use to keep commercial fonts out of logo contests :)\n\n"
