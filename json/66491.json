The OpenType Basic version, full commercial licence, of Adelle Bold and Bold Italic can be downloaded free of charge at TypeTogether's website.\n\nThe award winning Adelle is a dynamic slab serif designed by Veronika Burian and José Scaglione. While it is conceived specifically for intensive editorial use, its personality and flexibility make it a real multiple-purpose typeface. The intermediate weights deliver a very legible and neutral look when used in text sizes, providing the usual robustness expected in a newspaper font. The unobstrusive appearance, excellent texture and slightly dark color allow it to behave flawlesly in continuous text setting, even in the most demanding editorial applications.\n\nAs it becomes larger in print, Adelle shows its personality through a series of meassured particularities that make it easy to remember and identify. Its energetic character, so inherent to slab serif fonts, becomes evident as the typeface is used for subheadings and headlines.\n\nThe full OpenType Pro version of this font family has 12 styles, ranging from light to heavy, with more than 900 characters per font. It provides support for many OpenType features such as small caps, stylistic alternates, fractions, five sets of figures and more.\n\nTo download the fonts go to the address below and use code: f21dd6a\n\n[http://www.type-together.com/index.php?action=carro/getFreeFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014042354/http:/www.type-together.com/index.php?action=carro/getFreeFont \"http://www.type-together.com/index.php?action=carro/getFreeFont\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014042354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/02_5439.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014042354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/03_4044.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014042354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/04_4419.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014042354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/05_4198.jpg)\n\n",
