  "content": "So, I'm launching my personal portfolio site, and I'm currently titling with a free font called [Alte Haas Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419005701/http:/www.dafont.com/alte-haas-grotesk.font). I probably don't even need to point out that it's ... er ... quite Helvetica-inspired.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419005701im_/http:/typophile.com/files/altehaasgrotesk_5643.jpg)\n\nI'd love to buy a sans-serif font with a similarly gentle rounding aspect (not looking for anything as direct as [Helvetica Rounded](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419005701/http:/www.linotype.com/13208/helveticaroundedbold-font.html)).\n\nI shouldn't mention my budget for this purchase isn't too liberal, so the more affordable the recommendation, the better.\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions!\n\n",

I suppose I'm a sucker for a two-story a / single-story g system in a basic sans-serif.\n\nThese are really good directions. If anyone else cares to share, I'd love more suggestions! Thanks!\n\n"
