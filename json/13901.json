  "content": "Maybe my question has been asked somewhere else already, but search not beign available yet...\n\nIs there a way, either from Fontlab or from a script (maybe robofog?) to have a list of all the glyph combinations possible. Lets say an output to a txt file.\n\nFor instance, I’m currently working on a 620 glyphs font and would like to quickly check out all the possible miss matches in the metrics and kerning. I’ve used the KernKing by Mr Cabarga but I’ve yet many more glyphs that are not covered in there.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n [‹ Offsetting italic to fit with roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706164910/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14966 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Converting quotes in InDesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706164910/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14996 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
