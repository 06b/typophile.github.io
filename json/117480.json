I'm sure it is in fact a font, though it could well be a digitised handwriting font from a collection or app install.\n\n"

None of the usual ID tools came even close, and keyword searches at MyFonts came up with some similar ones, but no matches. Similar, but not quite as random-looking: [Paquita](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701151511/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/paquita-pro/?refby=bowfin); [Mrs Ant](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701151511/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hipopotam/mrs-ant/?refby=bowfin); and [Bookeyed Martin](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701151511/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/tart-workshop/bookeyed-martin/?refby=bowfin).\n\nMy guess is that this may be a custom made font, which anyone with no lettering skill and about $10 could create.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
