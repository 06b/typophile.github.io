      "content": "Hi Gregorius,\n\nso you want to design a [typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122044816/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/typeface) and produce yourself a [font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122044816/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/font).  \nAnd as you want to use it for type-setting your thesis, I assume it’s about a Latin text face – right?\n\nHow many time do you have? You have to be aware of the fact that creating a font will take a _very long_ time, at least if you’re doing it for the first time, and if you want the outcome to be reasonably good and usable.\n\nGiven that setting an academic paper usually requires more than just one weight (e.g. Roman, Italic, Bold, maybe Small Caps, several sets of figures, …), I strongly recommend to rethink your plan. You’ll be better off with a little less ambitious aim. You could design a nice display face for titlings/headings, for example.\n\nTo answer your question – have a look at these older threads:  \n [Advice for a beginner](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122044816/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36268)  \n [Type Design tutorial anywhere? – How to create fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122044816/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35134)  \n [What books are there on type design?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122044816/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37860)  \nand of course the [How-To](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122044816/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/How-To) section in the Typophile Wiki.  \nF\n\n"

      "content": "thanks Hardwig\n\nyeah i know that creating a font need extra time. i won’t create all of family type or characters set (ligeratures, etc) in my font, maybe just one family type with uppercase and/or lowercase, that’s why i must have good concept for this decision.\n\ntruly, it’s not about my ambition. i want to learn and experience the process of creating a font. btw, i can’t change the topic anymore.\n\nthanks a lot for your advise, i appreciate it, and for those great links, it’s helpful\n\n"
