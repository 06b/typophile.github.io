  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to replicate the 'iOS 7' title text for a project I am working on and I noticed that the version of Myriad/Myriad Set that is used is thinner than even Myriad Light, which is the thinnest version available commercially. Has this been made thinner by Apple's design team and if so, how can fonts be made thinner? I have added a sample below for reference.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312164912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ios_title_5872.png)\n\n",
