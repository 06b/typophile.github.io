  "content": "At Greater Albion we’re still putting the finishing touches to our next major release, ‘Crewekerne’-in the meantime we’ve been having some fun trying it out in ‘real-world’ applications.\n\nCrewekerne offers a charmingly hand drawn Roman family in the best traditions of the ‘Arts and Crafts’ movement of the early 20th century. Why not have a look in at our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013135729/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/) and see Crewekerne at work. We hope to release in the next week or so.\n\n",
