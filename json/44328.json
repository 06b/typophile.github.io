I should pay you for doing my homework!\n\nYour suggestions are smart and much appreciated, though the handwriting in the sample evokes a bit of art deco, which is the flavor I am hoping to get across. Something that would capture New York in the 30s/40s. I would like to avoid something too cartoon-captionish if at all possible. Doesn’t even have to be handwritten.\n\nSince you asked, I’m working on a book project, written by the late Dai Vernon, who is revered as one of the greatest sleight-of-hand artists who ever lived. He practiced well into his 90s, mentoring many famous magicians—ranging from Houdini to Ricky Jay. His creative thought process truly revolutionized the art, so much so that he was lovingly called, “The Professor.” The sample you see above is from one of his personal notebooks; a list of favored methods for nullifying the cut in a game of cards, or otherwise moving things around in a deck of cards “invisibly.” He spent his latter years at Hollywood’s Magic Castle, which, thanks largely to his presence, became the epicenter of all things magic.\n\nThanks so much for all the assistance!\n\n"

[Estilo](http://web.archive.org/web/20091022132422/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/estilo/) is probably a better choice, but you’ll need an app with good OpenType support to get the characters you want.\n\n"
