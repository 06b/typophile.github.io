What are your procedures when designing and developing? I guess I would just like to know how it's done and maybe get a few pointers so I can set out designing.\n\nI figure once I have a couple hand sketches done, I would translate them to Illustrator to refine and then something like TypeTool to assemble it? I don't know - please let me know how YOU do it!\n\nThanks\n\nBrian\n\n",

I've never designed an entire typeface before, but that book helped me when I design my own letters and reshape existing fonts for my logos.\n\n"

      "content": "Billy, What book would that be?\n\nBrian, I am sure you will get many good answers but the first way to begin to get effective & useful answers is to narrow the question. And actually that will be my 1st step. What is the purpose of the type? Answer that question well, and thoughtfully & you will have a chance of doing something worthwhile. Otherwise - Maybe not so much.\n\n"

      "content": "The way one starts on a new font depends too much on the given purpose at hand and the nature of the given designer for any elaboration to be highly useful to you in particular. If you try to follow somebody else's methods too closely you are likely to become confused and lost in the long term.\n\nIf, like Eben says, you can focus on a specific purpose (and I would add factor in your own creative nature) then the <cite>technical</cite> advice we might be able/willing to provide should help you get to somehere meaningful (to you) faster and better.\n\nhhp\n\n"
