  "content": "I'm interning these days and currently that means learning Flash, alas. I've always like Unibody 8 from Underware and followed the instructions to use it in Flash exactly. I placed the text on full pixels, turned of anti-aliasing, set it to 8px, and increased the leading past the default. However, the tops of full height characters are being lopped off. This is most noticable on the lc \"f\" and the continued absence of the dot over the \"i\". The SC work fine, so I think it is only the one pixel getting chopped off. Has anyone else ever encountered this?  \nThanks.\n\n",

The way these new options were worded was probably unfortunate, as they're not quite intuitive. I guess that's the problem.\n\n"
