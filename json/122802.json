  "content": "Dear reader,  \nI am looking for the right font for an Identity. I must me a little bit of a Vintage look font, not to serious, not to loose. Maybe something like Futura, only there is a J in the name and I prefer one with the curve, instead of straight down like Futura.  \nIt also should have O's in the name.  \nMaybe someone has tips?\n\nThanks\n\n",

I think [Brandon Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145405/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-text) or [Brandon Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145405/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque) could be fine choices as well, maybe a bit overused as webfonts lately.\n\n"
