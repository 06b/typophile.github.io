That means they're designed to describe syntactically and encase other elements.  \nUL means unordered list and holds LI - list items. It doesn't hold text on it's own.  \nDL - same thing. Means definition list and holds dt and dd elements.  \nThe comments parser that Typophile uses is just guessing at what to with the text within a UL or DL tag but yet outside of a LI or DT or DD tag.\n\nRegards,  \nrich\n\n"
