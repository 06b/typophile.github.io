  "content": "I'm trying to decide what to pair Stag (used for headlines) with, it's used in a design I've inherited and have to turn a digital publication around quite quickly. Currently it uses a combination of Meta Serif for body and both Gotham and Whitney for box outs and folios.\n\nDo people think the Stag/Meta combination work? and do you think Whitney or Gotham should be the preferred sans??\n\nThink it's a case of 'can't see the wood for the trees' - can't see objectively on this...\n\nThanks\n\n",
