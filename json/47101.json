      "content": "Hi Mike,\n\nThis is a very subjective question, since it’s hard to guess how much ’tweaking’ you want to do. I looked through hand-drawn lettering fonts for each of the three styles on the cover. (1) = HOW GAMBLERS WIN; (2) = OR THE SECRETS OF; and (3) = ADVANTAGE PLAYING. I looked for fonts without layering that you would use for (1) and (3).\n\nThese would be fonts I might try for these (just ideas based on a quick look):\n\n(1): [Ad Hoc](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/ad-hoc/), [Rekord](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-rekord/), [Repent](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.dafont.com/repent.font), [Sinclair](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/sinclair-script-rr/)\n\n(2): [Escher Hand](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/escher-hand/), [Kooky](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kooky-bt/)\n\n(3): [Moulin Rouge Solide](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026074328/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/toulouse-lautrec-moulin-rouge/)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

You’d need to pull in the points of the serifs, but the flaring might match the cover lettering fairly well.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
