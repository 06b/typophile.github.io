A simple conversion.)   \n   \nGoto Source Forge to download and install XonX. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071344/http:/sourceforge.net/projects/xonx/)   \nDownload pfaedit and unpack. [http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071344/http:/pfaedit.sourceforge.net/index.html)   \nDrag the pfaedit directory to the Applications directory.   \nStart XDarwin (XonX).   \nIn an X terminal window (not an OS X terminal window) type pfaedit and you're in business.   \n   \npfaedit seems very solid, but the Aqua-XonX combo is rather tetchy.   \n   \nOroborOSX makes a nice window manager to go with X Darwin: [http://oroborosx.sourceforge.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102071344/http:/oroborosx.sourceforge.net/)   \n   \npfaedit is basically a Unix/Linux X11 app, but there is also a cygwin version that can be used under Windows. Installation instructions for both Mac OS X and Windows are available on the pfaedit home page:\n\n",

Before Motorola's PowerPC and Intel's Pentium, FPUs were separate (like the 68882 - man, I miss that chip), so software didn't assume you had an FPU, or had a special version for FPUs. The problem is that FPU instructions are specific to the FPU, so for example something written for the 68882 won't work on the PPC, which is why you use the non-FPU version, which won't be as fast as native PPC math, but like one of my CompSci teachers once said about a contract competition he had won: \"Hey, my code would be faster too if it didn't need to work.\"   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Like when I make a Director movie that takes over the screen, I don't want an unpredictable/ungainly border around it.   \n   \nApple had its own resolutions for a while, but then they sensibly started conforming to the Windows sizes (except for that funky 1152 thing), but now they do this... The thing is, it's not just Apple: I was recently pricing different configurations of a Compaq laptop, and the options went 1024, 1440, 1600 - no 1280, which is such a nice resolution for a 15\" LCD. I think LCD manufacturers are targeting DVD playback, and the computer manufacturers have to go along to maintain good pricing.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
