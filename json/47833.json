There are many examples of revivals today that are like that. Mark Simonson in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20101230165738/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15379) thought it was possible that Chopin was the original name and that Phil Martin renamed his version of it, so who really knows?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
