What is the purpose of installing the font in the way you describe - using the Apple Installer? I have installed it as a photoshop plugin and it does show up in the filter menu...what does installing it this way do for you?\n\n2. You mentioned that you tried to sell photofonts but people only bought the case studies because there was no way to use them. Is it your experience that designers, who can use the fonts as plug ins, don't need them because they can just design what they want in photoshop anyway? Is there not a market to designers who don't want to be bothered and want to use ready made colorful/image fonts?\n\n3. You mentioned that there were good things to come technologically which could change things. You said this back in April. Can you elaborate on this? Is there anything new you are aware of?\n\nI think it looks like a ridiculous amount of fun to design image fonts with photofonts/bitfonte, and I would like to do them to sell them. Do you think there is no market for them yet? What do you see the landscape to be in the near future?\n\nI would appreciate your thoughts.\n\nThanks!  \nLaura\n\n"

Photofont Start is a Photoshop plugin that lets you use photofonts.\n\nPhotofont Start needs to be installed like a normal application (using the Apple installer), and it gets installed in the Photoshop plug-ins folder.\n\nThe user can install photofonts in the plugin -- basically, the .phf file is copied to the correct folder. An Apple installer could just put the .phf file in the right location for you.\n\nA.\n\n"
