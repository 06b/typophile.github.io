I don't know any font having /F and /1 that could fit together so perfectly.  \nAnd if you have a [closer look](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027181959/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/case/168347/), that looks not even well drawn to me. But, if you still need something to start with, you could take any generic sans of your choice, from Futura, Avant-Garde or even Gill Sans, slanting it on purpose. A quick way would be using [Diamanti Diagonal](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027181959/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/diamanti-diagonal/).\n\n"

      "content": "my thoughts exactly. the \"base\" appears to be (to me) Futura, in a heavier weight (hard to say exactly due to the amount of extra stretching/slanting). The F is not a letter at all, rather a 1 placed over a black box to create the effect of a letter. finding the 1 with only that single character will be the chore.\n\n"
