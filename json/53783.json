  "content": "Hi typophiles,  \nI’m trying to improve this flyer, if anyone would like offer any comments,  \nthat would be helpful.  \nI’ve only used Avant Garde, because that whats they’ve got in their logo,and trying to keep some consistency.  \nI feel a little stuck about what direction to go with it really.  \nI want to use a font thats friendly, but suggests credibility as well.  \nShould i try and find something with a similar feel to avant garde, to go with the logo, or something to contrast it.  \nIt would be nice to get a consistent look,with the body copy and display,  \nthroughout all flyers, poster etc.\n\nAny thoughts?  \nmany thanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426052049im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fly2_5016.jpg)\n\n",
