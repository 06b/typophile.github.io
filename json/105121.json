  "content": "Not too many people are visiting the Critique-Typography/Composition Forum. But there are some interesting problems and discussions there. Maybe you should make that a regular stop. [http://www.typophile.com/forum/28](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414143401/http:/www.typophile.com/forum/28 \"http://www.typophile.com/forum/28\") They'll treat you right down there!\n\nForum designers, much of the stuff that gets posted there could also be in the Design Forum. Maybe you could consider this if there is a change in the website.\n\n",
