Feel free to comment how you wish tho.\n\nI went for a simple, circley, wiggly, snowman style :)\n\nAnd off course what a great thing the Font Aid team are doing to raise money for this tragedy. Good to know there's so many caring people out there.\n\n---  \nJoe\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331010040im_/http:/typophile.com/files/snowman_6518.png)\n\n",
