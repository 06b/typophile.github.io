Martin Taylor in their 1983 book _The Psychology of Reading_. From the information below, you will see that the construct includes a whole lot more than ‚Äúthe shape of the word as a whole.‚Äù The term is a result of Taylor and Taylor‚Äôs efforts to factor ‚Äúinterior features‚Äù into the ‚Äúshape definition‚Äù of words.\n\nTaylor & Taylor list ‚Äúthe seven groups of mutually confusable lowercase letters found by Bouma (1971)‚Äù. They mean the S1, S2, S3, S4, A1, A2 & D grouping of lowercase letters Bouma introduced in ‚ÄúVisual Recognition of Isolated Lower-case Letters‚Äù, which they number from 1 through 7, as follows [the descriptions are Bouma‚Äôs; the groupings are a result of confusion frequencies culled from recognition tests]:  \n1 = a s z x : [HB‚Äôs S1] inner parts and rectangular envelope  \n2 = e o c : [HB‚Äôs S2] almost round envelope  \n3 = r v w : [HB‚Äôs S4] oblique outer parts  \n4 = n m u : [HB‚Äôs S3] rectangular envelope with well-expressed vertical outer parts  \n5 = d h k b : [HB‚Äôs A1] ascending extensions protruding from a well-expressed body  \n6 = t i l f : [HB‚Äôs A2] slenderness  \n7 = g j p q y : [HB‚Äôs D] no description  \n1, 2, 3, & 4 are categorized by Bouma and the Taylors as short (S); 5 & 6 as tall (A); 7 as projecting (D)\n\nTaylor and Taylor: ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄúBouma shape‚Äù of a word can be defined by listing the group numbers of its letters: ‚Äúat‚Äù has the shape 16 (short-filled, tall-thin), and ‚Äúdog‚Äù is 527 (tall-fat, short-round, projecting).\n\nTaylor and Taylor found that by their Bouma Shapes ‚Äî defined in this way ‚Äî something like 87% of the words in the English language corpus they used unique.

But here is how Saenger defines the term in his glossary : ‚ÄúThe shape of a word when written in upper- or lower case letters and delimited by space, as defined by the Dutch psychologist Herman Bouma.‚Äù\n\nSaenger‚Äôs argument in the book is. ‚ÄúWhile the paleographer‚Äôs principal focus has been on the classification of individual letter forms, the student of the history of reading in the medieval West is primarily concerned with the evolution of word shape, and letter forms are important only to the degree that they play a role in determining that shape. Thus the adoption of the miniscule, that is, lower case letters, as a book script is significant for the historian of reading insofar as it contributed, in conjunction with word separation, to giving each word a distinct image.‚Äù\n\nI originally glommed on to the ‚Äúeach word a distinct image‚Äù idea because of the content the Taylors gave to it, and because of Gerrit Noordzij‚Äôs account of the ‚Äòconsolidation‚Äô of the word [Chapter 6 of _The stroke: theory of writing_]. Now I believe that reading starts with a low-resolution indexing of word items in parafoveal preview and proceeds to a feature-analytically based processing routine that occurs at and upon fixation. The low resolution indexing provides informative ‚Äúensemble statistics‚Äù that go beyond the envelope shape of the word or the simple pattern of ascending, descending and neutral characters, and provides a reference frame for the feature-analytic processing. The feature-analytic processing yields information about words at the level of their role-units (prototypical structures, like stems and counters): the identity of the role units, their relative positions, local combinations (in letters), and their across-the-word distributions.\n\nSo where the the Taylors‚Äôs notions might apply most directly, as far as I can see, is in relation to the kind of information the ‚Äúensemble statistics‚Äù contain. There is currently a growing body of research in this area.\n\nBut I just wanted to provide a little push-back on Thomas‚Äôs ‚Äúbouma nonsense‚Äù comment.\n\n"

The \"word superiority effect\"‚Äîletters within words are more identifiable in a short time than letters within non-words‚Äîprima facie supports the idea of whole word pattern. Word pattern does not necessarily mean the oversimplified version of word envelope, as Peter says. Peter's idea is that for skilled readers and familiar words, the visual pattern of the whole word, like a Chinese Character, is read, rather than by going the route of first identifying letters and then doing a look-up‚Äîwhich we can also do. (And yes, I know there are root characters in Chinese.)\n\nSupposedly the word superiority effect is made compatible with the letter identification and look-up view by 'interactive activation', but that this operates routinely for skilled readers has not been actually tested, only simulated in computer models. It is a model that can simulate the process, but whether it actually works that way in the brain is not known. Peter and I are quite doubtful that it operates routinely as claimed, because we think it would take too much time in the brain for the rapidity of skilled, normal reading. A more more one-way link between visual pattern and sound and semantics (rather than cycling up and down) would be quicker.\n\nMy understanding is that a difference between Peter's and Hrant's views is that Hrant thinks Boumas operate mainly in the parafovea, whereas Peter thinks this is an important but limited influence, and the main impact is on letters seen in the fovea.\n\n"

Instead of a clear dichotomy between two theories, it seems more like a spectrum. I will be curious to hear what folks think the practical differences are between a theory driven by bouma shape (that includes full topology of individual letters) and one driven by individual letters that allows for interactions and effects of neighboring letters.

If we don't need to recognise individual letters in order to make a first pass at word recognition, then that would explain why crowding doesn't seem to be a major impediment to rapid and accurate reading. If, instead of recognising individual letters _as such_ we are taking in information from multiple letters in the foveal fixation (I'm with Peter on this, not Hrant) and recognising patterns that resolve to letter sequences, then the closeness and visual interaction of those letters that inhibit individual letter recognition actually become useful. This is how I understand boumas: a perceptual unit of recognition.\n\nThe latter point is important, I think, because it avoids having to commit to defining bouma as any specific graphical phenomenon -- such as the 'word shape' -- and, indeed, indicates why such definitions are unhelpful. A bouma is a thing in the perception, not a thing on the page. This also means, of course, that it is liable to individual variation, i.e. you and I might perceive different boumas when reading the same piece of typography.\n\n"

And it‚Äôs a matter of providing perceptual-processing _touchstones_ for typography and type design.\n\nIf a feature-analytic processing of the S1 to S4 / A1 & A2 / D shapes (see above) in _bounded maps_ of visual information is seen as a foundational dynamic at the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù of reading, factors like distinctive cue-value, clear delineation, proper salience, relative location and some kind of cohesive equilibrium at the elemental level of shape primitives (letter details) are easily seen to be matters of intrinsic and densely interacting importance. A rhythmic spacing, a consistent contrast-styling scheme and strategic construction here, mindful of these factors, produce a gestalt integrity at the level of the whole word. So this provides a natural fit with the express attunements of experienced type designers and typographers to matters of spacing or fit, consistent contrast styling, and strategic construction.\n\nThe feature analytic processing that leverages bouma-shape particulars isn‚Äôt the whole story in identifying words though. Feature-analytic processing is generally thought to lead to a kind of parallel letter recognition as a next step which then underpins the orthographic processing necessary to get to words. In current models the feature-analytic processing is often underspecified, but your sense of moving toward the middle is apt. The two processing routines are compatible: they can be seen as different phases or sub-routines of a single hierarchical process.\n\nI‚Äôm exploring the equally compatible ‚Äî and neuro-mechanically plausible ‚Äî idea that in the normal reading of extended texts by skilled readers feature-analytic processing yields ‚Äî as a result of ‚Äúunsupervised‚Äù perceptual learning ‚Äî a more elemental decomposition than the decomposition into individual letters. My more elemental decomposition is a decomposition into what I‚Äôve been calling role units. This then underpins a higher level parsing of the word into what can be called role-unit string kernels.\\* By leveraging the overlap in these string kernels in familiar words the visual word-form resolution system gets to words and a word superiority effect.\n\nI‚Äôm generally hesitant to use the thread-space of a topic with another focus to summarize my perspective, but I feel it might be necessary to show that what‚Äôs involved in addressing your follow-up Thomas is not just a moving to the middle.\n\nIn the context of this thread, and its bouma-shape by-way, I suspect that the lower case construction is a construction that more effectively leverages for the purposes of individuating gestalt-level units, the dimensionality of the western alphabet‚Äôs cartesian feature-space ‚Äî with it‚Äôs more diversified or informationally rich implementation of the compact base-line to x-height zone and more strategic use of the ascender and descender zones.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\* string kernels in this scheme are units with the structure x+(y+z)+a (where x and y and z and a are role-units, and the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign inside the bracket indicates a local or contiguous combination implemented by a letter junction or a common edge, and the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign outside the brackets indicates an ‚Äúopen‚Äù or non-contiguous combination constrained by immediate adjacency.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415062614im_/http:/typophile.com/files/string_kernels_72ppi_5970.jpg)\n\n"

Indeed, words are perceived and represented in exactly the same way as other visual objects. The phenomena that have been taken as evidence for specialized orthographic representations can be explained by assuming that perception involves recovering information that has passed through a noisy channel: the early stages of visual perception. The noisy channel introduces uncertainty into letter identity, letter order, and even whether letters are present or absent. We develop a computational model based on this simple principle and show that it can accurately simulate lexical decision data from the lexicon projects in English, French, and Dutch, along with masked priming data that have been taken as evidence for specialized orthographic representations.\n"

      "content": "Kevin, John, I've been batting back and forth with Peter some ideas about a brain processing model that would give a more detailed causal account of how the brain would work to identify words in the manner Peter has hypothesized. This model building is with an eye to identifying a crucial experiment to test the usual 'slot processing' of letters against Peter's whole word model.\n\nFirst, Peter warns me that the phrase \"word specific visual pattern\" is often used in the literature to refer to all aspects of the word‚Äîthe type style, weight, the slant, etc. So above I should have more accurately said that Peter's theory claims that immersive reading of skilled readers involves identifying words by the _relational structure_ of letter features across the whole word. The key features he thinks are 'role units' such as ascenders, bowls, stems.\n\nThe model I've developed does give a prediction in answer to your insightful questions, Kevin. I call the model \"recursive relationship filtering,\" using \"matrix resonance.\"\n\nBefore I describe it, let me give some background that will make it more clear where I am coming from. My impression‚Äîand I only know the literature second hand in discussing with Peter‚Äîis that most of the modeling is too heavily influenced by the Anglo-American tradition of associationism, beginning with Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. The idea is that the whole story of learning is variations on the theme of repeated association of events. Kant thought that instead we have an inborn framework that we use to interpret perceptual information, and without that framework we are \"blind.\" So association plays a role, but inner frameworks are equally important.\n\nA key development beyond Kant came with Darwin's survival of the fittest. Psychologists and philosophers took Darwin as a model for learning, and said that Kant's idea of inner frameworks was correct, but that we actively adapt and change them, using trial and error to better and more accurately capture meaningful information from the welter of perceptual data that comes into our brains. This was the idea of K√ºlpe in Germany, and is followers in the Gestalt and W√ºrtzburg schools of psychology, and by the American pragmatist Charles Saunders Peirce. My teacher Popper was influenced by teachers from the W√ºrtzburg school, as I explained in my book with John Wettersten, _Learning from Error_ (in the German edition _Lehrnen aus dem Irrtum_).\n\nThe relevance of this long-standing dispute to reading models is that I don't assume that skilled readers simply use the same process as those learning to read, but just do it faster. ‚ÄîThe processing patterns of learning and skilled readers are not isomorphic. Instead, I assume that in learning to read fluently, the brain sets up, by trial and error, a framework and pattern of connections that will very quickly and efficiently decode the structural pattern of words.\n\nThis is related to Elkhonon Goldberg's theory (See _The Executive Brain_) that one side of the brain deals more with novelty, and the other with learned, more efficient processing structures. In effect, as we learn, a much more efficient structure is set up on one side of the brain only. This idea is corroborated, Peter tells me, by the discovery that skilled readers have more 'lateralization'‚Äîprocessing only in one side‚Äîthan learners, who use both sides more.\n\nI'll post this prelim now, and then explain the model later today.\n\n"

The contention that there is no orthographic code to crack is a bit of a red herring, because, in the stimulus sampling approach used by Norris and his associates, a representation of letter order is assumed. On their own account ‚Äúthe Bayesian Reader (Norris, 2006) assumes that word recognition involves a representation of input string consisting of sequentially ordered letter identities.‚Äù These form the ‚Äúpriors‚Äù in a process that decides if the pattern of letters in the stimulus can be fitted to the coded representation. The newer work proposes ‚Äúan extension to the Bayesian Reader that incorporates letter position noise during sampling from perceptual input.‚Äù\n\nMy scheme doesn‚Äôt do everyday recognition on the basis of a representation of letter order, but on the basis of a relational filtering (see Bill‚Äôs post just above) at the level of role units, that detects string kernels before getting to words.\n\nIn 2012 Jeffrey S.

      "content": "So here's the processing model of 'relational filtering' to identify words, using Peter's concepts.\n\nFirst, it is a decoding model, encoding structural features, and then matching them to words. I don't know whether it operates at early visual processing levels, or only after the visual pattern is already processed to the point that we would recognize any script that we can't decipher. Second, this basic model doesn't assume that Peter is right about reading whole word structural patterns, though I think he is.\n\nThe motto is Michelangelo's \"the more the marble wastes, the more the statue grows.\" Its central feature is a filtering model, rather than a pure building-up model. It starts with a huge amount of data, and ends up with a single word through relationship filtering which arrives at a brief code.\n\nEach filter layer I will describe in terms of functionality, as I don't know exactly how this is executed by one or masses of neurons.\n\n1. The bottom layer or deck is a layer in which we throw a framework of an inner matrix (inborn or learned) over the incoming data.\n\n2. All the information on the bottom layer is sent to layer two, which establishes a 'set' as to what kind of pattern it is: whether the pattern is, for example: 1. a face, 2. a three-dimensional object, or 3. writing to be decoded. If the criteria in this second layer in the 'face' area aren't met, the signal is stopped, and not sent on from this area. Since it is a word the 'word' filter will detect a match, and all of the information will be passed on to the third level.\n\n3. On the third level, letter features are coded. The cells in the matrix in each small area are sent forward to the fourth level, in which a group of say four vertical cells is coded to represent location.\n\n4. The information on the third level is mapped to arrays of role unit detectors on the fourth level; each detector in an array can detect one of the possible combinations of the four states of the cells. All detectors receive the information of all four cells, but only where there is a match to the code of a particular role unit is the information sent on to the next level. All the alternative ID's for a particular role unit are passed on to the next level preserving information on what is adjacent.\n\n5. The fifth level puts together the role units in Peter's 'string kernels', as described above, and passes them directly to 'word codes', which code words as an assembly of string kernels.\n\n6. On the sixth and final level are all words represented in whole word structural relationship codes, codes of adjacent string kernels. Each complete word code assembled on level 5 is 'painted' or sent across the entire vocabulary, or at least common vocabulary, and whatever remembered word code matches that input, responds and links to a meaning and sound. The word is detected consciously at this point.\n\nNow this sixth level is the final decoding level only for skilled readers reading familiar words. If it is an unfamiliar name, for example, or a confusion typo, the information will be sent on to an orthographic level, where letters are identified and look-ups done on higher levels again.\n\nIn other words, reading by visual pattern, without any orthographic processing, is the preferred route, as it is quickest. But we can also do quite quickly‚Äîbut a bit longer‚Äîthe orthographic route. All of these routes have been built up in the learning process, and unfamiliar names etc. regularly draw on these skills. The idea is that processing by whole word structural pattern is the last learned, but the first used.\n\nWhen the words are well done visually, and the memory of the code is there, this is experienced as instant reading of words: we don't see letters, we experience meaningful words. In something like the scrambled letter tests, we are conscious of some time taken to stare at a word to decipher it.\n\nThe main advantage of of model like this is that it accounts for why we read AlTeRnAtiNg CaSe more slowly, which the interactive activation model just puts down to lack of familiarity. But this explanation is not plausible because the interactive activation says we first identify separate letters as abstract entities, and we are in fact extremely familiar with both lower case and caps.\n\nNext, I will post answering Kevin's questions with this model, and discussing all caps verse lower case. Sorry for the lack of an illustrative diagram. I don't have time to do one now.\n\n"

The body will do almost anything to keep up blood pressure, because if it is too low you can pass out and die. Similarly, the brain wants to perceive meaning, and perceive it now. It is a matter of survival, which carries over to reading speed.\n\nThe brain is massively connected‚Äîmore synapses than stars in the milky way!‚Äîand does parallel processing, but it is not that quick in cycling through a reflective process. (Reflection undoubtedly involves interaction of levels as envisaged in interactive activation.) Compare the speed of recognizing a face and adding 436 + 784. Also I don't see how going to a look-up of abstract letter identities isn't an additional step and time. You already have the letter features, and relationships in order to identify letters. If you just squeeze the ID from that, without going to abstract letter identities, you are leaving out a step, it seems to me, so that it is quicker. That's why I think we learn the whole word structural pattern‚Äîunconsciously, just as we learn grammar in our mother tongue.\n\nWhether we need to identify the flanking role units in the manner Peter suggests is less clear to me. We might have identified the structural pattern of the letters, and of the relational pattern of the role units in whole word in another way, maybe. But I don't see why a look-up of orthography of abstract letter units is needed routinely.\n\nAn important point to note is that the word superiority effect is a time-based effect. It is only when you flash words for very short times followed by a mask that you get it. It you look longer at words and non-words, it goes away. That to me is an indication of the fact that the race to word ID is won by whole word relational pattern, before it goes to orthography.\n\nThe race is 'won' when you get a meaningful word into working memory, as that is key to consciousness. To me you get the word superiority effect because word ID by the whole word structural pattern gets into working memory before the orthographic processing route. We are also very good at the orthographic route, but it isn't as fast.\n\n"

A lot of people even move their lips when they read. Those who read more quickly are more likely to be recognizing a word at a time, but even they consciously think of themselves as reading individual letters.\n\n"

In a relational filtering environment, this mismatch makes the local combination detection required to get to letters subject to crowding, unless the role-units that are adjacent to the string-kernel nucleus, are part of an already learned and synaptically supported code-item.\n\nAccording to Denis Pelli and others crowding is negligible in foveal vision. However, in a poster presentation at this year‚Äôs Vision Sciences Society Annual Meeting last month, Mara Lev, Oren Yehezkel, and Uri Polat found that when foveal processing of letter targets is interrupted by backward masking, the spatial crowding is revealed and that a release from crowding in the fovea is achieved by allowing an increase in reaction time.\n\nSo there is a psychophysical reason to favour a model that goes from role-units to string kernels instead of letters. Getting to independent letters would require squelching of elements in the area surrounding the string kernel nucleus.\n\n"

Language in particular is essential to social interaction, which is the big thing that gives us our advantage. Also it is important to winning and keeping a mate, so good language skills give a competitive advantage, pushing beyond 'good enough.'\n\nThe guy who can understand ladies very well is way ahead of the game.
