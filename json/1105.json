      "content": "This isn't as interesting as the serif one, but I think it does have a novel variety in the forms (like in the \"bdpq\" bowls, the \"s\", etc.) which makes it worthwhile. Not to mention that nice gentle stroke modulation - which you might actually apply more, like in the top of the \"a\".   \n   \nSuper-thin weights are very hard to make even, and you can see problems, like when you compare the \"W\" and the \"X\".   \n   \nYour descenders are long, but in a design like this it might be OK.   \n   \nI think the head of the \"g\" is slightly large. The Tilde is too dark. The \"y\" is great.   \n   \nThe only glyphs I have serious problems with are the \"G\", the \"Q\" and the \"R\". But I only have an idea for the last one: try making it open (no middle join to the stem). And I might just leave the \"Q\" like that, since it's such a flamboyant letter anyway. The \"G\" just needs tweaking. BTW, the \"Z\" looks like it's leaning to the right.   \n   \nI like the numerals, especially: that they're short; how sexy that \"2\" is. The \"4\" (especially) and the \"6\" and \"9\" are a bit wide. The \"8\" is great.   \n   \nOther stuff:   \n- That ampersand is great. So is the Pound Sign. And the Section.   \n- I think I'd make the bars of the Yen longer.   \n- The Pilcrow is superb.   \n- The Asterisk is too dark - although you might still leave it a bit darker than the rest, since it's supposed to get attention.   \n- At Sign: I'd use a monocular \"a\". Better for legibility.   \n- ae: I'd unify the mid stroke.   \n- OE: the \"O\" is too weak.   \n- fi/fl: very nice.   \n- Eszet: very nice. Maybe no descender.   \n- ch: the \"c\" is a bit strong.   \n- Agute/Grave accents: I'd place them a little bit more centrally.   \n- Some of the other stuff is too dark.   \n   \nTrapping: everybody knows I love the stuff, but in such a light design (which will almost always be used pretty large) those traps are too big. But in the heavier weights you want even more!   \n   \nSpacing: I think your overall tightness is very good.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
