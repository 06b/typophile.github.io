  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nThink Verdana. I want to start designing a new font and I want to use an underlaying screen grid to get the geometry of the glyphs just right. I don't want to make a grid-font, but want to use the screen grid as a starting point for the porportions. The font should be something like Verdana, Helvetica, DIN, or so.\n\nIs there anyone that has ever worked this way? Perhaps you have some information on the topic or just anything to get me started the right way.\n\nI hope that this way the font better works onscreen (in the right pixel size) and might therefor needs less hinting. On the other hand it should work best in print. Therefor the underlaying grid is just a starting point.\n\nThanx,  \n®ené\n\n",

So that may be a good reference.\n\n[http://www.typotheque.com/imgs/static/custom\\_type.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021002437/http:/www.typotheque.com/imgs/static/custom_type.jpg \"http://www.typotheque.com/imgs/static/custom\\_type.jpg\")\n\n"

      "content": "Thomas, that's what I need. I knew someone did this before, but couldn't find it again or remember who it was.  \nHrant, sure it works for a specific PPEM size, but that's fine. I think most fonts on screen are used between 10 and 13 pixels (correct me if I'm wrong). Pixel fonts can go smaller.\n\nIs there more info out there? Just experiences from people who did this procedure before. I don't want to step into any (to me) unknown pitfalls.\n\nThanx!  \n®\n\n"
