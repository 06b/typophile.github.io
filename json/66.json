The PC versions of Emigre fonts unfortunately lack this feature.   \n   \nWith full-fuzz antialiasing becoming the norm (or as Adam Twardoch likes to call it, full-alcohol) bitmaps in newer suitcases are becoming rarer and rarer. I'm trying to figure out a way to add embedded bitmap data to CFF .otf files.\n\n"
