      "content": "Hi Mads. Nice work. Reminds me a bit of Keedy's ol Jot face although they are not that similar, but I would guess design process is similar. It is excellent. H is very unique but fits well with rest of glyphs. A is a bit too angular, although form is very nice. Maybe P should have a tad bigger bowl...   \nAlso alternates would be ideal so it does not look too computer generated when used.\n\n"

      "content": "Mange tak Ole. You are definetly right about the alternatives. I'll have a second look on A and P as well. Though I'm glad that both of you are so positive towards it, I'm quite surprised that none of you comment on the X and Z..   \nI'm thinking the X might be a bit 'too much'. Of course, this would be solved if there were and alternative without the curl. Also, the Z doesn't have quite the right curve yet, I think.   \nI've been told that the T, Y and M stands out because they are very straight-legged in proportion to the other glyphs. Personally I like that they are a bit 'quiet' in comparison to for example the X.   \nAny thoughts on this?   \n   \nAlso, Ole: do you have a link to Keedy's Jot face? Is it Keedy as in Jeffery Keedy? I've tried searching the board and Google, but haven't found anything.   \n   \nMads   \n   \nps. I keep getting an 'Internal Server' error and no upload-dialogue when I try to upload pictures to the board. Does anyone know how to solve this?\n\n"
