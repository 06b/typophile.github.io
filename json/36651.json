For OpenType fonts, there is also a list of features so you can display just the glyphs you're interested in.\n\nHere are discretionary ligatures in [Adobe Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217181356/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/adobe_caslon_pro_ot/?acs=1&acs_ss=4) and [Adobe Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217181356/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/adobe_garamond_pro_ot/?acs=1&acs_ss=4).\n\nThe full glyph set of [ITC Galliard CC Alts](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217181356/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/carter_cone/itc_galliard_roman_alternates_cc/?sample_text=AaBbCc%20Handgloves&sample_size=36&acs_p=1&acs_pt=24&acs=1) and [Goudy Village H](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217181356/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lanston_type/goudy_village_h/?sample_text=AaBbCc%20Handgloves&sample_size=36&acs_p=1&acs_pt=36&acs=1) from Lanston\n\n"
