      "content": "Do you mean you are going to eventually set the book in metal Monotype Garamond? But you want to lay it out in InDesign or Quark before you start setting? Is that right?\n\nIf so, then by all means, as Kent says, digital Monotype Garamond is your ONLY choice. They are the “same” face, and no other digital Garamond looks at all like this one.\n\nYou’ll need to very carefully measure the height of the metal face, and then you’ll probably need to make a series of very small adjustments to make the size of the digital face match the height of the metal. Keep in mind that letterfitting between the two versions will likely be different. So if your book is justified text, you won’t likely get an accurate line-for-line layout once you start setting metal. & lord knows what you will find about the comparative widths of any particular letter in the two versions. If these have been altered very much in the digital version, this will further complicate how accurate your layout will be. Maybe you are doing poetry; then you’ll be lucky and have an easier job.\n\nThe overall color of the digital Garamond, printed on your laser printer, will also be much different than metal prints on paper.\n\ngood luck / have fun\n\npowers\n\n"
