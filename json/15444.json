  "content": "The form of the letters you use to compose words and texts often expresses more than you suspect. With the series of exhibitions entitled Type An Sich, the Catapult design office awards the letter the attention it deserves. In the spring of 2005 our gallery presented the letters of the Dutch typographer Gerard Unger. This autumn it is his French colleague Jean François Porchez who is taking up the torch. The exhibition from 13 October until 31 December 2005. Opening hours: weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. A lecture will be held on 24 November 2005 (more details later).  \nCatapult, Rubenslei 10, 2018 Antwerp, Belgium.  \n(close to the city park, within walking distance of Antwerp central station).
