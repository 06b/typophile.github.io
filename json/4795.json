  "content": "Hello all,   \n   \nI searched around before asking this question but couldn't find any answers so I guess I will just ask:   \n   \nIs there a Font Management program, or extensions for one of th popular ones, that allow the display fonts in numerous languages? I have English, Japanese and Georgian fonts and I can't seem to find an app that will \"see\" all of them. Font Book is just getting too unweildly...   \n   \nThanks for any advice!   \n   \nR\n\n",
