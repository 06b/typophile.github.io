      "content": "This is a really nice concept, specially the emanating waves integrated with the parenthesis. The only thing that doesn't really look right is the tagline, which is awesome for this logo but try making it a little bolder (a medium perhaps). I would also try a version with three emanating waves, although the concept is sound with only teo.\n\nIs the right corner of the top of the first left 'wave' rounded? or is it just my eyes playing tricks?\n\nGood stuff!\n\nJonE.\n\n"

The top and bottom brackets take precedence, and my eyes are also drawn to the \"corners\" formed in the negative space. I can't think of any solution at the moment, so I'm probably not being very helpful.\n\nThough I don't think it's too similar to the Simple Bits mark, at all.\n\n"
