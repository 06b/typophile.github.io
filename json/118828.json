  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm working on a logo for an accounting firm that I'm using the font ANNONCE [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317211442/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/\") for the logotype part of it. I'd like to use a script for a monogram as a symbol to accompany it. Does anyone have any suggestions? Canada Type, the maker of Annonce, has some decent scripts to use with it, but I haven't seen anything I love yet. The letters in the monogram are H and G if that's helpful. Thanks!\n\n",

There's a lot of modern geometric monogram fonts, for the traditional kind try Monogram KK or Vine Monogram. There's also my own design [Free Monogram](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317211442/http:/www.dafont.com/free-monogram.font) which is GPL.\n\n"
