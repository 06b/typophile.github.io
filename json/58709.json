  "content": "Grueber, a new release by Dalton Maag, is a two weight slab serif for display usage. The typeface is based on designs by Austrian architect Paul Grueber in the early 1900s for castle Hoch Osterwitz.\n\nDalton Maag also releases true Italic forms for our popular typeface Effra. The addition of Italics makes Effra a versatile choice for any design project.\n\n[www.daltonmaag.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123035106/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/ \"www.daltonmaag.com\")\n\n",

Well, I have no problems to agree that Frutiger is a good typeface, but Effra is about as close to it as I am as close to become the next UK prime minister.\n\nNick, no Grueber has no l/c alternates - yet at least. In fact, on the original carvings at the castle, what are now alternates were the actual letters. Together with Lukas we decided that we need more traditional designs in the base keyboard positions to cater for the more conservative tastes. As the l/c had no template to work from we decided for the time being not to include alternate designs.\n\n"
