      "content": "Stephen, it’s a good start.  \nThe weight difference between “head” and “way” are very close and on the drop shadow versions difficult to see. I’m not sure of the company or their intent, but the word-play should make sense.  \n“Headway” has a positive sense of making progress, and “Head Way” either connotes cerebral activity or a brand of headphones or hats.\n\nAlso, try treating the “y” as if you rotated the “h” 180°. That way the design looks completely symetrical with the “d” as centerpoint. Lose that little sliver of white between the stems of the drop shadow “h” since it is too thin and becomes bothersome. Good luck.\n\n————————————————————-  \nYes, I’m old, but I’m making headway!\n\n"

Personally I find the familiarity breeding indifference, further, I don’t find the icons add to the type or to the identity of the club. Sorry this is negative and the client might be of the opinion that the genericism is what they’re looking for and the fact is I don’t have any immediate solution to offer. Let us see any further evolutions.  \nTim\n\nbtw [http://www.headway.org.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104622/http:/www.headway.org.uk/)\n\n"
