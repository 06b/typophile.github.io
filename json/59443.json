Patrick claims Sassoon and TheSans had no influence on his work, which I find remarkable. Was going to write a Typographica piece if I get some time.\n\n"

I think its really obvious that the designer merged the two designs—and the result?— it looks unabashedly like two merged designs— nothing else. Normally I don’t have too much of a problem with that (well, if its ugly that’s another story) unless the designer cites his inspiration(s). As Lisa Lampanelli would say, “Your fronting and I don’t appreciate”.\n\nXavier Dupre comes to mind. He wanted to try Officina and Unit he did so—Vista and Sanuk. He wanted give a go with Triplex— Megano. At least he said so. I respect that because he respected his audience/customers by telling us.\n\nPost when you complete that article on typographica and thank you for the links too\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"
