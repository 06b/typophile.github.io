  "content": "BACKGROUND:  \nDuring the last few decades Greek typography has been strongly influenced by Latin elements. Often, there is substitution of Greek letters by Latin ones. A few designers try to preserve characteristic Greek typographic elements into their work, but overall Greek typography appears to trend towards Latin assimilation.\n\nAIMS:  \na) To define what constitutes Greek characteristics in a font,  \nb) To delineate the needs and problems faced by contemporary Greek typography end-users (graphic designers, book publishers of Greek texts, etc.)\n\nEXPLORATORY QUESTIONS:  \na) How do you define or how do you approach the issue of a Greek characteristic in a font?  \nb) What questions would you have for end-users of your fonts?  \nc) Why do you design Greek fonts?\n\nP.S. The results of this study, including all information from font-designers and end-users, will be posted in this blog in the end of June.\n\n",

But I am curious about your findings.\n\nMy understanding of the situation is that Greek typography is weakly developed due to the long period of Turkish rule, when printing in the Greek language was suppressed.\n\nThus, it came to be that most readily available Greek typefaces were designed in Latin alphabet nations for use in study of the New Testament or the classics - or for use in mathematical formulae. The latter application led to the infamous Porson typeface, long the standard for Greek, where the upper case was upright and very much like that of Latin, while the lower case was cursive... and italicized.\n\nThe upper and lower case of the Latin alphabet are based on a compounding of Roman capitals with the uncial script done at the behest of Charlemagne, but over hundreds of years, the two scripts achieved a unity and complementarity - for most categories of typeface, this process seems less far along in Greek.\n\nThe Cyrillic alphabet, based on the Greek alphabet, of course, illustrates what a completely Latinized Greek script might look like. On the other hand, most of the typefaces designed to be based on authentic Greek sources are sans-serif - and the advantages of serifs for legibility are well-known.\n\nSo I suspect that typography in the Greek language faces many contradictions - and its difficulties, compared to the success of the Latin script, makes borrowing and assimilation a strong temptation.\n\nIncidentally, I've seen the substitution of the Latin capital Y for the Greek Upsilon (Υ). The font used _here_ does that! I suppose people could also use W for Omega, but I can't think of any other replacements (not counting digamma and qoph).\n\n"

Could you explain your statment, please?  \nIf I understood correct, looking back to early Greek typography opresses the progress of Greek font design? (and I suppose you are speaking about the calligraphy of any other language)\n\nThe history of Greek typography reveals the big impact of byzantine scripts in the design of Greek fonts. While the latin typography evolved through a different path and always seemed modern. Based on which criteria could anyone desing a modern Greek font, but not using elements from calligraphic manuscripts?\n\nI am not an expert at all, but it seems to me that some recent fonts have quite a contemporary look based on byzantine roots… What do you think?  \nSee Maiola, Skolar, Colvert  \n [http://rosettatype.com/index.php?action=carro/search\\_by\\_kw&kwId=3&kwName...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/rosettatype.com/index.php?action=carro/search_by_kw&kwId=3&kwName=greek \"http://rosettatype.com/index.php?action=carro/search\\_by\\_kw&kwId=3&kwName=greek\")  \n [http://www.typographies.fr/uk/index.php?page=fontes&s=Colvert](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/www.typographies.fr/uk/index.php?page=fontes&s=Colvert \"http://www.typographies.fr/uk/index.php?page=fontes&s=Colvert\")\n\nAlso, I see a preference in \"calligraphic\" Greek fonts which are more suitable for extended texts, because they have \"fluidity\", while the modern ones are static and \"printed\" rather than \"written\". Should we change our attitude towards letters? To accept that they are not written anymore, but designed on a computer?\n\n"

The decision to support the polytonic range of characters is not just meant to be an advantage, but is clearly aimed at a specific user group: scholars of the classics who just need this entire set. As far as I can tell, Andron Greek is used more outside Greece by editors and scholars than by Greek customers.  \nLatinization. This is one of the most fascinating topics in type, actually. (By the way, one can cross-flavour every script with whatsoever writing style, you can do a chinese-looking Latin or an Arabic-looking Cyrillic; a Chinese blackletter face has been done recently… so far the game of it.)  \nThe greek minuscule got under Latin pressure over the last 15 years not only because there was some wishful mood of getting Greek ‘modernized’ – whatever this may imply. More than that we still see (and feel?) that the Latin and the Greek letters are basically identical. So the wish \\*to see either alphabet on the same level\\* seems natural. Not to forget that both capital alphabets co-exist as close kin without the medieval-age metamorphosis history of the minuscules, to the day.  \nSo the Latin journey of Greek was inevitable. When I started to work on Andron Greek I thought “make it look like Latin” in order to get a harmonized overall appearance. (I never intended to stick to one of the historic models like Garamond or Didot Greek.) The result was perfect: you couldn’t even spot a few greek phrases interspearsed in a Latin text because the likeness was extreme. But then I learned – again: inevitably! – that my achievement was ‘too much of a good thing’, the Greekness got lost and that was just bad. So I reworked it, several times. And I went back the path from Greekness to Latinitas, step by step. I found an old review image of that process, versions A to D in time order:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Greek_ABCD_6191.png)\n  \nAs you see I came quite back home to Hellas with the latest version D. But I was still not convinced. Some details were now “too Greek” – no. Not too Greek but too cursive, too scripty. The more traditional reverse contrast pattern (lambda, chi) did not fit in. I now knew I wanted it not more Latin, but more smart. And I compiled another version (M) from the previous ones:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Greek_M_kl_6361.png)\n\nBut still this was not the end. At least three more versions got tested.  \nAfter a year something very important happened: I was in Greece :-) (in Saloniki, actually). And I digged in the very life of Greek type: newspapers, shopfronts, the wonderful και, menus, even silly espresso cups.  \nWhen I was back I screwed up the font again and did those version which remained the valid one till today:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/and-gre-final_6628.png)\n\nI know that the result does not convince everyone. But the font found its way into use and that tells me that the solution is a possible one.\n\npostscriptum. Last year I enjoyed visiting Corfu. I learned that the island, although belonging to Greece and being populated by Greeks, is rather Italian by kind of its fauna and style of its architecture. I found this most remarkable.\n\n"

Note that Gabriola is a display face, intended for larger sizes, and looks too light in the screenshot; note also that the heavy horizontals in the SBL Greek are due to rounding at this size and resolution. Click on the image for a zoomable and printable PDF version.\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/JH-Greeks_3452.png)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/www.tiro.com/John/JH-Greeks.pdf)\n\nHrant's intervention introduced 'calligraphy' into this discussion, but I would prefer to return to the framework of Tatiana's original query. I don't consider any of my Greek types 'calligraphic'. The one that might seem on first glance to most obviously display calligraphic characteristics -- the Gabriola display face -- is actually the one that I created with least reference to scribal models, even less, it might surprise to learn, than the Helvetica World Greek.\n\nSo, some comments on how I 'define or ... approach the issue of a Greek characteristic in a font':\n\nI think Tatiana is correct to say that the history of Greek typography reveals the strong influence of the Byzantine scribal hands. It is not the only influence: one sees sometimes reference to archaic styles, especially in display typography, and the Complutensian and related pre-Aldine types saw revival in the 19th and 20th Centuries (ignoring for now the importation of styles from other scripts as in the blackletter and woodtype examples shown in this thread). Overall, though, the Byzantine style has been the dominant influence, but not simply in terms of its most obvious historical stylistic aspects: intensive ligation and contraction, cursiveness, varying contrast patterns, etc., which frequently blind people to its most lasting influence. It is within this style that the Greek lowercase letters came into existence and persist in being written up to and through the introduction of type and print publishing. So it is entirely ordinary that it should have become the dominant model, just as the relatively unligated, formal and more regularised humanist book hand should have become the dominant model for Latin type: typography pretty much everywhere picks up whatever is the main scribal book hand of the day and runs with it.\n\nWhen I am designing type, I'm generally thinking mostly about structure and texture rather than style. So the questions I ask myself are not about what consitute 'Greek characteristics' but about the structure of Greek letters and how these create a particular texture on the page that I associate with 'Greekness'.\n\nIn 2003, I designed the Constantia family for Microsoft, which was the last time I tried to harmonise Greek and Latin designs through stroke contrast pattern. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was that the ClearType rendering environment for which the types were designed is much more forgiving of thin horizontals and thick verticals than vice versa. At the same time, there are some Latinised contrast patterns in the Greek lowercase that I really find totally unconvincing -- too far removed from the historical evolution of the letter shapes --, so in Constantia there is a mix of contrast patterns (compare pattern of ο with that of π and τ; note pattern of λ). As I say, it is the last time I tried this approach, and Constantia Greek is my least favourite of my Greek designs (at least, of the ones I can still bear to look at). After the experience, I was left convinced that the shapes of the Greek lowercase letters, evolved through the Byzantine scribal model and its 350+ year typographic expression, naturally carry the pattern resulting from a more steeply held writing implement, and that this contributes massively to the Greekness of the texture on the page.\n\nAround the same time as the Constantia project, I began work on the SBL Greek type for the Society of Biblical Literature, and used the opportunity to renew study of Robert Granjon's Greek types, which I had earlier used as a model for the uncompleted, heavily-ligatured Clio type shown at the first ICTVC conference in Thessaloniki. For SBL Greek, I ditched all but two of the ligatures (γγ and λλ, which have become a feature of most of my Greek types), but stuck very closely to scribal letter shapes and proportions, and the variable contrast pattern. One of the personal goals of the project was to get a better sense of how much of the texture of Byzantine manuscript and Renaissance print pages was the result of the ligation and contraction, and how much was the result of the lettershapes and contrast patterns. My conclusion -- also confirmed by my experience with lots of other writing systems -- is that texture is built up from layers of characteristics, beginning with relative proportions and letter frequencies, then stroke contrast patterns, and that these, before the influence of particular weights and styles, contribute to what I think of as the 'feel' of a particular script on the page. The observable qualities that constitute Greekness in both a heavily ligated page of Aldine, Grecs du Roi or Granjon types of the Renaissance and a mostly unligated Foulis Press edition of the 19th Century are the product of structure and contrast pattern.\n\nAs I wrote above, Gabriola is superficially 'calligraphic' in style -- which is to say that someone who doesn't know much about Greek calligraphy is likely to identify it as such --, but unlike the SBL Greek is not derived from a scribal model. The Gabriola Greek, because it doesn't include the same level of ornamentation options as the Latin and Cyrillic, includes a compensatory of ligatures to enliven things. But these are all what I think of as tying ligatures, i.e. in which the shapes of the underlying letters are not modified significantly, only linked to each other.\n\n[This relates back to my study of the Granjon types, in which I classified Renaissance Greek ligatures into two kinds: connecting and morphographic. [The three pages of this PDF show the same passage in the Clio type with, respectively, no ligatures, connecting ligatures, and both connecting and morphographic ligatures.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/www.tiro.com/John/ClioDemo2.pdf) In general, connecting ligatures present no problem for modern Greek readers, since the basic letter shapes are easily recognised; many of the morphographic ligatures from the Byzantine/Renaissance tradition present considerable problems, as a straw poll taken at the first ICTVC conference confirmed.]\n\nAs with the Latin and Cyrillic, the Gabriola Greek explores what happens to structure and texture when lettershapes traditionally associated with a translation stroke model are instead made with an expansion stroke model.\n\nGabriola is a display face, so shouldn't be taken as directly representing any ideas I have about Greek text types (even though we hinted it so that it bears up remarkably well at text sizes on screen (better than in print)). However, when I came to design the new Greek type for the academic publisher Brill, I made use of many of the same decisions that I had employed in Gabriola. My point of departure in this case, though, was the Didot Greek types of the 18th Century, which were informed by the dynamics of the contemporary split nib, and are the basis, via Monotype 90, for the famous _απλά_, i.e. simple or normal, style of Greek literary publishing. The Brill Greeks represent a regularisation and softening of the stroke contrast of the Didot types, maintaining the traditional Byzantine patterns but applying them to less cursive, more formal and upright structures. For comparison, here is a characteristic Didot Greek -- from Firmin Didot's 1828 edition of _L'Iliade d'Homère_ -- shown above the Brill Greek regular and bold (obviously I've got very different ideas about wordspacing!):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DidotBrill_5267.png)\n\nIt's been very gratifying to see the Brill Greek in frequent use in Brill publications, and to note among other things that it harmonises incredibly well with the Brill Latin, despite a completely different ductus and contrast pattern. This confirms again something that I discussed during my Beatrice Warde Memorial lecture [_Same Difference_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/www.tiro.com/John/SameDifference-slides.pdf) [some corruptions in that PDF resulting in missing characters] at St Brides a few years ago: cross-script harmony is firstly and most importantly a matter of weight and proportion, rather than of ductus and contrast pattern. It is possible to elegantly harmonise two different writing systems together on a page without forcing either into the dress of the other. It is possible for both to display their characteristics textures on the page and still harmonise. Indeed, to take the notion of harmony back to its musical origins, it is possible for the two voices to produce beautiful harmony without one trying to sound like the other.\n\nFinally, a word on the earliest of my Greek designs shown here, the Helvetica World Greek that I designed for Linotype at the beginning of the millennium. [See also this comparison of the design -- here under its earlier name Helvetica Linotype -- with Matthew Carter's original Helvetica Greek from the 1970s.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/www.tiro.com/John/HelveticaGreeks.pdf) Some people, especially at the time of the release of Helvetica World, interpreted my design in terms of ideas about correct and incorrect ways to design Greek types, especially sans serif types, which I suppose relates directly to Tatiana's questions. I was bemused to find that I had both champions and critics in Greece, and there were references to the 'Hudson way' as something to be emulated or disavowed. As time has passed, I've tried to get away from that interpretation, and one of the things that I find interesting about the project is that it shows how much designing an extension of an existing typeface for a new script is like a work of literary translation: more than one translation is possible, and each is likely to respond to different aspects of the original. The original Helvetica Greek reflects the contemporary associations of Helvetica with internationalism, standardisation and, it must be said, westernisation; the Helvetica World design reflects my interest in the relationship of the mid-20th Century Swiss/German grotesk to the structures of 18th Century romantic types (esp. Didot and Walbaum). So my Helvetica World Greek is thematically related to my most recent, Brill Greek, although one might not guess so from a simple comparison.\n\nSo that's a longish answer to Tatiana's question (a).\n\nI'll give some thoughts to the other questions and try to respond in shorter manner.\n\n"

      "content": "What Gill knew about Greek would fit on the head of a pin. His comment that '...the leaders of typographic design in the fifteenth century never achieved for Greek what they did for Latin and modern languages' shows just how poor is his knowledge and superficial his analysis. In fact, the typographers of the 15th Century starting with Aldus achieved for Greek _exactly_ what they achieved for Latin, i.e. the translation into type of the standard scribal book hand of the day. And although this cursive style became the dominant mode of typographic Greek, it wasn't the only mode and the non-cursive Greeks of the 15th Century all point to more fruitful directions in Greek type design -- as Scholderer demonstrated -- than Gill's embarrassing Perpetua Greek, whose only redeeming feature is that no one ever used it.\n\nThe thing that I find remarkable about Gill and Van Krimpen and others who set out to deliberately Latinise the Greek script -- whether they used that term or simply talk in terms of 'modernising' or 'formalising' --, is that they end up producing stiff, clumsy and lifeless forms that do not combine well, _of a kind that they would never accept in their Latin type designs._ It is as if they abandoned all their knowledge about what makes a typeface work, ignoring all that they knew from Latin script even as they try to 'Latinise' the Greek. So when Gill writes that 'Just as the capitals of the Perpetua Greek are of precisely the same family as the Perpetua Roman, so the Perpetua Greek lower-case is of the same family as the Perpetua Roman lower-case', my response is 'No. It isn't. The Perpetua Latin lowercase has life and elegance, and pleasing curves, and nice proportions that make the letters combine well into words. The Perpetua Greek has none of these characteristics.'\n\n"

      "content": "\\> More than that we still see (and feel?) that the Latin and the Greek letters are basically identical. So the wish \\*to see either alphabet on the same level\\* seems natural.\n\nIn his book,\"The history of Greek script\", Antonios Sigalas (Ιστορία της ελληνικής γραφής, Αντώνιος Σιγάλας - I'm afraid is available only in Greek), shows how the handwriting of Latin and Greek languages at one point (first centuries AD) were so mixed, that with difficulty anyone could distinguish them. But this was due to social evolutions of Roman Empire, where Greek and Roman children were exposed to similar educational system, so the handwriting (dimotiki) on wax tablets was resembling, he says.  \nDespite this, through time, when Greek minuscule appeared (around 9th century AD) the letters distinguished themselves from Latin ones (because the Capitals of two alphabets had similarities and differences). [When someone tries to write fast, different alterations appear in letter forms, not to mention the natural conversion of upper to lower case. Try for yourself to write 'Γ' and then a very quick gamma, which will evolve steadily to 'γ'].  \n Aldus Manutius may be criticisezed for \"negative influence\", but in one way his printings preserved the characteristics of Greek letters and thus influenced greek typography for quite a long period. The lack of political and economic stability in Greece for few centuries (Ottoman rulling, revolution of 1821, WW1, WW2, again revolution, Hounda) didn't give the opportunity to the Greek type to flourish, as Latin did. Maybe this is an explanation why latin fonts always seemed more modern than greek and eventually dictated the style of contemporary fonts.\n\nAnd at this point I will have the (naive?!) courage to put in discussion a relation of the following theory to Latinization: that people tend to be more open to things that they are most used to, because they feel more \"comfortable\", safe.  \nHow is this related to Latinization?  \nLately, my friends are asking me what project I am doing and I tell them that I found (yes, I too wasn't aware of it) a fenomenon concerning typography - latinization of greek alphabet. And they are all surprised that something like this exists, because is not easily perceived by society.  \nLatinization was introduced day by day into Greek typography. The reader was getting used to the micro changes and could not see the image from another point of view, except of typographers, graphic designers etc. But you see, the released typefaces were read by all Greek speakers and not only. Unconsciously, they accepted what they were served for dinner.\n\nLet's see, hoω εαsγ γου cαη rεαδ τhις τεχτ?\n\nIf a English speaker is exposed for centuries to this king of metamorphosis of letters (which would occur with minor changes step by step), some day he will get used to it.  \nAs Matthew Carter underlines (From tablets to pixels, [1996],\" Which came first, the Greeks or the Romans?\" ), every epoch has its specific demands and people are exposed to different typographical approaches.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/carter_5262.png)\n  \nIt would be irattional to ask from a Greek to read today the complicated word \"para- παρά\" (see the image, up center) and from an English - \"que\" and \"pre\", says Carter. Even if these were the most common ligatures of the past when people could easily read them!\n\nFor me, there are some key points here:  \n1) Today, latin alphabet can be read everywere, in almost every society. Population is accustomed to it and as result, the phenomenon of latinization is unconsciously accepted.  \n2) The written forms of an alphabet is a cultural heritage, is the identity of every nation and social group. Aknowledge and education can prevent the Latinization process.  \n3) Even if we all agree that Latinization is a logical process of letter evolution, can you imagine universal type in 100 years? It will be all the same, no difference between latin, arabic, greek, thai, armenian, etc. Quite boring… and at some point, the return to roots will be inevitabile, I suppose. (I'm waiting for Hrant's :) critique about this)\n\nSo, I'm asking Andreas, \"the wish \\*to see either alphabet on the same level\\* seems natural\", is a intuitional statement or a unconsciously perspective directed from specific groups?\n\nP.S.  \n1) John, thank you for the comments about Gill! :)  \n2) Soon I will reply to other comments - specifically reffering to what I found about the \"characteristics of Greek letters\"  \n3) did you know that in ancient times the fathers were obliged to educate their sons, otherwise they weren't entitled to ask for support and care when they would become old?\n\n"

(Note, incidentally, that this may also suggest that the solution lies in making the capitals match the lowercase better, instead of the other way around - which Latin-script outsiders would favor, since they relate well to the capitals as they are.)\n\n"

Even if these were the most common ligatures of the past when people could easily read them!\n\nThe _ꝓ_ (_p_ with left-side hook) may be read as an abbreviation for _pr_, not always _pre_ -- what came after the abbreviation would determine the reading --, but the point about the challenge for modern readers is the same. I think it is worth noting, though, that while the Greek _παρα_ ligature is graphically more complex than the Latin abbreviations, it is decipherable because the underlying letter shapes and their order can be discerned in it (the Latin abbreviations cannot be deciphered from their shape, and one has to learn their meaning in order to read them). This is true of very many of the Greek ligatures, although some make use of neglected variant letter shapes, as in this _γγ_ ligature\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gamma_gamma_5541.png)\n\nand a few obscure one or more of the underlying letter shapes almost completely, as in these _επι_ and _ος_ ligatures\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/epi%20os_5628.png)\n\n[In my researches on Byzantine ligatures, I found that the letter _ε_ was most frequently subject to shape change in ligation. There are some ligatures in which it is indistinguishable from _ϲ_ (lunate sigma) and some in which it is reduced to a small curved stroke.]\n\nAs I tried to suggest in my long comment, I think the role of ligatures in terms of the characteristics of the Greek minuscule is easily overstated and can be a red herring -- as the free variant elaborations of the Arabic _naskh_ style can be -- distracting attention from what contributes most to the characteristic texture of Greek on the page regardless of the presence, absence or number of ligatures employed. This, I maintain, is primarily the steep stroke contrast pattern and the letter structures that evolved from that model.\n\nSince I mentioned Arabic, I'll point out that my review of Byzantine manuscripts led me to conclude that no rules existed for where and when particular ligatures or variant forms were used in Greek. So, unlike much of the letter shape modification and joining behaviour in Arabic, which is graphotactical (representing an aspect of a consistent script grammar), the Greek ligatures are free variants, whose use is a matter of personal preference or, sometimes, text fitting. With regard to the latter, it is interesting to note that Granjon's smaller sizes of Greek type include more ligatures than his larger fonts, and when one sees these small types used in marginalia and footnotes one can appreciate the space-saving value of many of these ligatures.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n> Greek lowercase and Greek uppercase are not harmonized; Greek lowercase essentially only exists in a cursive form, and so doesn't match non-cursive uppercase.\n\nI'd like to be careful in the use of terminology here, just to be clear what we are talking about. The term cursive can mean running in the sense of connected letters, which is clearly not what we're limited to talking about when it comes to Greek (indeed, in this sense the Byzantine manuscript style is at most semi-cursive). But if we apply the term to the internal construction of individual letters, then yes, the dominant model of Greek minuscule is cursive, i.e. the pen is not lifted in the writing of most letters, but instead strokes are reversed or turned to form transitions, as is the case with the humanist italic letters.\n\nThe relationship of Greek uppercase and lowercase letters is indeed complicated by their separate histories, although I think it is wrong to say that they are inherently 'not harmonised'. Better to say that they are a challenge to harmonise or, even more simply, that they do not harmonise in the same ways that Latin upper- and lowercase harmonise. The same can be said of Latin italic upper- and lowercase -- for exactly the same reason: uppercase letters with interrupted construction and lowercase letters with cursive construction --, and yet that doesn't prevent these being accepted as paired alphabets.\n\nWho was the first person to pair Greek upper- and lowercase letters as a true bicameral system? Tatiana, is this something that Antonios Sigalas discusses? My impression is that this was either a typographic innovation or, at least, contemporary with the introduction of printing. Byzantine manuscripts are mostly unicameral, employing only lowercase letters. Uppercase forms are found occasionally in them, but mostly as initials at the beginnings of sections or paragraphs, and not used systematically within the text.\n\nAnother thing to point out about cursive construction is that while in Latin script it is associated with the informal (quickly written) scribal hands that lead to the italic style of typography, it is only one of the characteristics of such hands, and isn't necessarily linked to informality. Slant and horizontal compression are other characteristics of informal hands, and while these are characteristic of the late Byzantine manuscript styles on which Aldus based his Greek types, there are plentiful examples of more formal Bzyantine manuscripts hands with broad and upright letters. The cursive letter construction is still the norm, i.e. pen lifts are minimised, and many letters are still joined in ligatures, but the overall impression on the page is much more formal and quite different from the Aldine style.\n\n[This article on the library at Vatopaidi has some nice examples.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/www.pemptousia.com/2011/11/the-library-of-vatopaidi-and-its-manuscripts/) [Right click on the images to view them at larger size.]\n\n"

So italic letters generally slant (lean) to the right.\n\nIn Latin script, the upright (roman) lowercase letters follow a formal construction model, i.e. if you were to write them with a pen, you would often lift the pen and put it back down on the page while writing many of the individual letters, but the italic letters follow a cursive construction model in which the pen stays in contact with the page much more, reversing direction to create new strokes rather than being lifted. As discussed earlier in this thread, the Greek lowercase letters have a cursive internal construction, which means that this distinction doesn't naturally exist between upright and italic styles for most Greek types.

The same thing applies to superior letters (and numerals): these can either be designed glyphs in the font or are faked by software. In Latin fonts, it is now quite common to have a full set of lowercase superior letter glyphs in addition to a full set of superior (and inferior) numerals. When I've made fonts for scholars such as the SBL Greek or the new Brill types, I've been asked to include full upper- and lowercase Greek superior letter sets, because these are fairly frequently used in the apparatus (textual footnotes) of critical editions.

I designed another sans serif Greek, a corporate type for Heidelberg Druckmaschinen produced by Linotype (the Latin art directed by Erik Spiekermann and based on News Gothic):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/HDGothicGreek_4767.png)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWith regard to accent position, in almost all types I position them to the left of the uppercase letters (excepting the dialytika of course), because for better or worse that is now the accepted standard and I think most Greek readers would think it strange to see them anywhere else. But recently I made a typeface for the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, which is one of the world's most important holdings of Byzantine seals and coins. That font represents the wide variety of uncial forms that Greek letters took during the Byzantine Empire, so that scholars can transcribe the appearance of text on particular coins and seals. One of the things we determined when planning that project was that in the Byzantine uncial the accents were always written above the letters, not to the right or left. One sees this also in ikons and mosaics.\n\nHere are some samples of that Greek (and Latin) typeface for seal and coin scholars. I suppose it too might be thought of as a kind of sans serif.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AthenaRubyShowing_6700.png)\n\n"

I've made a lot of use of it over the years, and have also corresponded with him.\n\nRegarding the perispomeni, in SBL Greek I used an asymmetrical tilde form, because that was representative of the renaissance types that were my primary inspiration. In the Brill Greek I used the inverted breve form, and would be inclined to do so in any new font. I now wish I had done so in the Gabriola type, although the swung tilde there works nicely with the subtle lean of the letters. The Athena Ruby font for sigillography and numismatics uses the inverted breve of course, since that is the form used in the Byzantine seals and coins.\n\n"

I suppose they were used only for logos.\n\nfor JOHN:  \nFirst,  \nthank you for the detailed explanations! :)  \nSecond,  \n\\>Who was the first person to pair Greek upper- and lower case letters as a true bicameral system? Tatiana, is this something that Antonios Sigalas discusses?\\<\n\nI was looking for days in my books, and it seems that Greek bicameral system was introduced after Gutenberg, and not by every publisher/punch cutter. Sigalas doesn't discuss about it and I could deduct this information only from images. Also, I noticed that for codexes, up till year 1645, there is no bicameral system, only occasionally uses of upper letters, as you mentioned. So, is a 'typographic' innovation.\n\nDo you know if the same happened to Latin? Or the bicameral system was introduced already in hand written texts before Gutenberg?\n\nI was reflecting about one of the characteristics of Greek letters, and I found some interesting images for Typophile's collection (as the images appear, 215 AD, 8th century AD, 1060 AD, 1079 AD, 1305 AD)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_5240.png)\n\nfor image 221 (the last): the first words are \"_ά]γωνισώμεθα΄χαλεπόν γάρ_ \".  \nNote that the ni \"ν\" in the word ά]γωνισώμεθα and χαλεπόν resembles a lot to \"μ\". And there are more examples of this kind.\n\nWHAT MAKES A GREEK LETTER LOOK GREEK:\n\n- ascenders and descenders (which are more in number in Greek alphabet than in Latin). If you cut them as much as possible, the result will be latinization of font\n\n- another way to emphasize the Greekness is the unequal sizes of letters (the image below), but then you are loosing the harmonization\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/screen-capture_4177.jpg)\n\n- serif and semi serif is another Greek element. Even in designing a sans serif Greek font, as Helvetica World or Whitney, it can not be a 'clean' sans serif (latin VS greek in Whitney font):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726im_/http:/typophile.com/files/screen-capture-1_6476.jpg)\n  \nBut exception are the capitals, as in John's project for Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection.  \nThis is the reason why lowercase Latin and Greek are considered two different categories of letters, especially in a cross script font?\n\nJohn, as I understood from your explanations about 'slant' factor, the Greek letters have a 'hidden system of implemented ligatures', and the design itself is based on this construction. Thus, the slant is the only distinction between upright and italic Greek letters.  \n- so we have another element: ligatures\n\nAlso:  \n- different x-height. But I couldn't find out if Greek's should be smaller than Latin's. Or is the designer who decides the proportions between them two?\n\n"

      "content": "For Latin, the bicameral system was introduced under Charlemagne, and so it existed in handwritten texts long before Gutenberg, who made considerable efforts to copy the handwritten texts of his day.\n\nAt first, the bicameral system consisted of tacking Roman capitals on to the uncial script, and it likely did involve occasional capitals for a little while at the start. But by the tenth century, the system was well established:\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian\\_minuscule](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161726/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule)\n\nIncidentally, I see that your examples of Greek manuscripts suggest a small x-height. In Latin typefaces, though, x-height is quite variable, depending on the design goals of the script. Thus, oldstyle faces like Caslon or Cloister Lightface illustrate the traditional ideal x-height, while Times Roman or Corona have much larger x-heights to maximize legibility.\n\nArmenian has a traditional \"Bolorgir\" form with a considerably smaller x-height than the Latin alphabet. The Armenian lowercase letterforms are suited to a small x-height, because they exclude two-storey letter forms; thus, lowercase S lies flat on its back. Greek lowercase, on the other hand, has a similar variety of letter shapes as Latin lowercase, so its natural x-height could not be much smaller.\n\n(If you feel I am being noncommittal on this issue, you are correct. In my opinion, whether the x-height of Greek lowercase should naturally be lower than that of the Latin alphabet is a question that can really only be answered by generations of native speakers of Greek as type designers, as typographers who choose type designs, and as readers. Anyone who wants can study old inscriptions and design a \"Greek\" typeface, but a self-conscious effort to incorporate Greekness into a type design runs the risk of failing badly. Yet, without conscious attempts, there will be nothing to choose from but Latinized models. The only resolution I see is careful study of both traditional and folk sources - and patience.)\n\n"

To be clear: ligation involves visual connection between different letters. In Greek this is optional -- unlike e.g. Arabic, Syriac or Mongolian --, but was characteristic of the Byzantine book hand and hence of early typography. What I was talking about with regard to italics, is the internal construction of lowercase letters, not their connection to each other. [See also my comments earlier about the use of the term 'cursive', which can apply to either joining of letters or to internal construction.] To understand this, consider the two common forms of the Latin lowercase a: the roman a can only be written with the pen being lifted from the page at least once and repositioned, i.e. first the top and right stem are written, then the pen is lifted and repositioned to write the bowl (a calligrapher may in fact lift the pen twice, using two separate strokes to write the bowl, especially if working at larger size); the italic _a_ can be written without lifting the pen from the page, i.e. starting in the top right, the bowl is written as a loop and then the pen reverses direction to form the stem. The roman a has a formal or interrupted construction; the italic _a_ has a cursive construction. The Greek lowercase letters as inherited from their Byzantine origins mostly have a cursive construction; only a few letters -- λ π τ ψ -- require that the pen be lifted during writing (θ and φ have both interrupted and cursive forms).\n\n"
