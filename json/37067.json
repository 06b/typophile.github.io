      "content": "Yes, I think you are all right.  \nI believe I spend so much time with the ‘a’ because it’s so much fun, too.  \nGuess it makes me a bad type designer enjoying so much drawing things like the ‘a’ and  \nneglecting so much important things like hinting, making the hard letters and so on ;-)\n\nPeter, agree with you that ‘a’ and ‘g’ are one of a kind in a certain way.  \nStrange in my case that I use to take and keep (!) my very first and spontanous version of the ‘g’  \nwhereas in the case of ‘a’ I do it over and over again.  \nIn fact its because the straight line that in the ‘a’ must not be a straight one, yet I don’t want it to be  \ncurved as well. Something in the middle. Sometimes harder to achieve with beziérs than drawing it by hand.\n\nYes, the ‘o’! It is very hard. Fortunately it doesn’t draw my attention too much :-)))\n\nLowercase ‘s’ is fun isn’t it?\n\nOk ok better stop here\n\nthanks guys for your opinions  \ngood to know that someone shares..\n\nStefan\n\n"
