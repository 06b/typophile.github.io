I’m trying to decide whether or not I should go through the hassle of setting up a paypal account so I can sell them to the general web public. I figure Typophiles would be the best market for these t-shirts.\n\nIf nothing else, you might be amused by Katrina’s designs. These came unsolicited at the kitchen table. She drew them, and at first glance I was confused...when she told me what they were, I, her alphabet-loving dad, couldn’t help but to smile with pride and glee.\n\n[Heavy Duty Fashion](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006023900/http:/www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet)\n\n [‹ Looking for a free alternative for Trinité No. 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006023900/http:/typophile.com/node/38225 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Embroidery,sewing & home embroidery software ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006023900/http:/typophile.com/node/38230 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I, too, thought it was great, as did the guy who printed 24 of them for me, but so far I’ve sold about 4 at the [local public market](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006023900/http:/www.viroquamainststation.com/). I think the problem is that the population of our town is 4,335. Once 4 people are seen with the shirt, nobody else wants it, regardless of how great it is!\n\n\\> I’d buy one if the t-shirt itself was a good cut and good cotton.\n\nAgreed. And here lies the problem with t-shirts. An average joe like me really cannot afford to print up an inventory of shirts to meet the demands of what has become a very particular market. So, sorry, there will be no excellent women’s cuts until I sell at least twelve of the remaining Tired Mom “standard-cut” t-shirts. I do have some mediums and smalls in stock, 100% cotton...they look good on my wife. $15 and I’ll cover the shipping. That goes for everyone and [every shirt I’ve got](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006023900/http:/www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet). [Contact me](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006023900/http:/www.heavydutypress.com/) if you’re interested. Thanks.\n\n"
