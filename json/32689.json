Not a font however :-)\n\nIt looks like spanish/italian painted lettering — what was my first clue :-) The ogee shape shows up in rococo and arts-n-crafts in northern europe also. I can see the small caps of DTL Fleischman with ogee crossbars evoking the same rustic look.\n\nIf this is for a logo, then letter it, or hire someone to do the lettering. It will get you much closer to what you want. Sorry, not a convenient answer.\n\nR\n\n"

Why do they have to look exactly like the original, why can’t it just borrow some of the charm and character.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070706062208im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_66_4249.png)\n\nThe example has an old world charm, but the letters are really pretty normal aside from the embellishments. Just look at “Hotel”, the majority of the characters are slab serifed, but what makes it unique are the embellishments of the crossbar on the H and E, and of course the inconsistent outline. Same with the A’s in San Agustin. This has a modern feel, and I could see it being used often, but what sets it apart from a standard utilitarian font is the additional features (which could be Alternative figure set in a font).\n\n**That being said, Cybele try [The Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20070706062208/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/antib/antib-.html) from Lucasfonts.**\n\n"
