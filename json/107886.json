I have been searching by myself but have not yet found anything.  \nDo you know what soft in which version would suit my old mac ? Free if possible...\n\n",

There are some older versions with 10.4 PPC builds already in existence, which would be easier than building it yourself from source:  \n [http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Font-Tools/FontForge.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420025100/http:/mac.softpedia.com/get/Font-Tools/FontForge.shtml)\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your answer. Unfortunately, I have tryed FontForge, but impossible to make it run. It seems that a lot of people have had same kind of problems. My english is probably not good enough to understand the technical answers that have been made on the web. Anyway, FF seems to be quite difficult to tame on a 10.4.11.  \nHaving post on an another forum, I have had the suggestion to swift to 10.5 and use Glyphs. So I have downloaded 10.5.6 on Softonic. I will clean and back up my PPC before installing and trying Glyphs...\n\n"
