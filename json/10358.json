  "content": "I'd be interested in hearing the opinions of Typophile regulars concerning the potential for reviving the \"thorn\" character, or creating a new \"thorn-like\" character, for use in our western alphabetic system?   \n   \nI've always found it curious that with the frequency that the \"th\" combination occurs, and how common compound \"th\" characters are in other alphabets, that it isn't a part of our Roman character set. This, despite the fact that for many centuries a compound \"th\" character was popular within the Latin abbreviatory system; and, of course, utilized within the English alphabetic system practically up till the 19th-century.   \n   \nThoughts?   \n   \ndm\n\n [‹ The ATypI Helsinki Program - he's coming for your sheep...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906155336/http:/typophile.com/node/13065 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Worst use of Fette Fraktur ever ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906155336/http:/typophile.com/node/12985 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Just thorn? Or eth also? Old English, like Icelandic to this day, had two letters denoting two different pronunciations that we now write with the pseudo-digraph _th_. The complication of modern English is that the contribution of other languages has multiplied the pronunciations that we represent with this pair of letters. To make any phonetic sense, one would want a separate letter to represent each phoneme. English may be too much of a mongrel tongue to support such systematic phonemic representation.\n\n"

      "content": "No, not eth too, just thorn. Actually, not really thorn either. Merely a new single character condensing the \"th.\" I agree, English is too much of a mongrel language to start niggling such phonimic details (lest we end up with 40 more characters in our alphabet). Since we don't establish such distinctions now with our current usage of the \"th\" combination I see no reason to start. I'm thinking more along the lines of how the English employed the \"Y\" character as a pseudo-thorn as a space saver.   \n   \nCertainly not a critical typographic issue. Just a little design project I've flirted with for personal entertainment off and on over the years.   \n   \ndm\n\n"

      "content": "I understand your point, and it is a good one. That's why I would limit it to just a \"th\" character. The English scribes and engravers used one for a couple hundred years without feeling the need to produce a character for every sound. Though I must admit that having an \"sh\" character is appealing to me too.   \n   \nNo doubt a good diacritical system in English would be a much better implementation. Especially in regard to things like names which in English can be almost totally subjective in spelling & pronuciation.   \n   \nI guess what I'm driving at is: If we were to adopt a new character representing \"th\" what would it look like? The \"Y\" substitution worked, but lends itself to confusion. The odoption of the original thorn doesn't blend well with roman characters. A straight ligature doesn't savve space; tho a condensed ligature (such as with &) would. Something that was familiar would lend itself to quicker adoption. So what should it look like?   \n   \ndm\n\n"

ATF's abortive interrobang must have been one of the first efforts but technology prevented its adoption then even as it would have done now. What has succeeded are the emoticons that can be constructed from existing characters. Personally, I don't like them and don't even know how to read them but chacun etc. My objection is to any typographical character that interferes with the overall aesthetics of the typeface. Thus I faintly dislike the German ch simply on the grounds that the spacing between the characters is too tight, and I deplore the beloved Icelandic eth on the grounds that it has evolved into a shape that cannot be formally related to any other character in a font. In this respect, the specifications for the eth are precisely analogous to the original formal specifications for the Euro symbol: there was nothing you could do with it, unless you ignored the specification.   \n   \nIn considering the standard PS set of characters, the glyph most in need of current reform is the eth, which sticks out like a sore thumb in every design where Icelandic taste is consulted. The only designer I can think of who was occasionally courageous (or sneaky) enough to put a stop to this aesthetic rot is Zapf.   \n   \nI think the EU should ban the character. Having first, one might hope, sent the Blairs to Elba.   \n   \nAnother reason to reform the eth is that it is the character the typeface designer spends the most time on with the least result. What has this irascible race done to warrant such attention?\n\n"

      "content": "Designing an eth that both harmonises with the specific typeface and conforms to the normative form of the letter is often a challenge, but there is a great deal of satisfaction if one pulls it off. Often, the eth does not harmonise with the typeface very well, which I think is the source of Bill's dissatisfaction with the letter. But it seems to me that throwing out the normative form of the letter is no more satisfactory a solution than sticking any old eth in a typeface. Most eths are not very good because the people who draw them have not spent any time writing them: they look at the eth as a difficult design problem -- and as a chore --, and not as a letterform.   \n   \nThe eth is a letter that originates in a time when the Latin script was written in a particular way with particular tool, and in a particular cultural milieu. Anyone who has seen the Beowulf manuscript in the British Library will know just how natural this letter looks in its original context. The problem of the eth for contemporary type designers is that we are obliged, for reasons of character set support, to include it in typefaces in styles that evolved in Italy, France and other parts of continental Europe, and in which the Icelandic language was never set until the 20th Century. The ductus of these type styles typically differs from that needed to make the letter eth, which means that one needs to rely on weight and proportion to harmonise forms, much as one does when trying to harmonise Greek and Latin designs without compromising the authentic forms of either script.   \n   \nThe eth is a kind of time traveller: a visitor from an earlier version of our alphabet. That seems to me to be an interesting sort of challenge, and not something that one should deal with crudely. The past, as the saying goes, is a foreign country, so I tend to approach the eth with much the same strategy as I approach non-Latin scripts.   \n   \n   \n_What has this irascible race done to warrant such attention?_   \n   \nIcelanders? They joined NATO and allowed the US to build air bases in their country. The strategic importance of Iceland in NATO during the cold war guaranteed their alphabet representation in the ANSI character set for Western Europe.\n\n"

      "content": "This in an interesting converstation. Especially since I am an Icelander. Here, in Iceland, the thorn and eth are natural characters of the alphabet. The two characters pop out quite frequently and are seldomly left out of a sentence. There have often been discussions about discontinuing the everyday use of them and replace them by “th” and “d”. This has never been enforced though and probably never will. Icelanders are conservative people and love their language heritage.\n\nDespite the nation’s love of those characters they have unfortunately presented a lot of problems in all kinds of areas over the years. For example Icelanders have, up until this day, had to patch their operating system to get the Icelandic characters right and we still have some problems with them in particular software programs.\n\nGunnlaugur SE Briem is and Icelandic type designer and on his website he talks a little about how to design the thorn and eth in a right way. Take a look: [http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/index.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906155336/http:/briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/index.htm \"http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.11/index.htm\")\n\nIn my typographical compositions the thorn and the eth don’t bother me as much as the accented capital letters like “Á” and “É”. They always seem to be in the way somehow and misalign with the cap height.\n\nRagnar Freyr  \n [www.onrushdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906155336/http:/www.onrushdesign.com/ \"www.onrushdesign.com\")  \n [www.formislandia.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906155336/http:/www.formislandia.com/ \"www.formislandia.com\")\n\n"
