Engelhardt.   \n   \n<u>Edit:</u> Hjerteforeningen was founded 31 years after his   \ndeath, but I still believe it could be based upon his work.   \nIn recent years danish design firms like Kontrapunkt and   \ne-types have \"reinvented\" the style of Engelhardt.\n\n"

It could be the heart that's making me see an obvious connection.   \nIt also could be something of Gunnar Billmann Petersens work although I don't recall having seen this logo in the great book about him. And the heart is not very him.   \nIt is probably a take on Knud V. Engelhardt's style by some of the new bigshots in danish graphic design as you mentioned.\n\n"
