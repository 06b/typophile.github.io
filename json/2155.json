      "content": "Paul, my only runin with German was when Remington Products thought they would sell cheap razors in Germany and we had to translate the user manual. We hired a translator and had them approve the galley proofs (typesetting days) I would guess it be a good idea to invest in a translator and let the client assorb the cost. It always costs more to redo a job than to do it right in the first place.\n\n"

Find a copy of _[Der Duden](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010233814/http:/www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3411040122/qid=1069372888/sr=2-1/ref=sr_aps_prod_1_1/028-1985432-0085309)._ This is the offical German style guide. You'll need a German speaker to help you find the information you need, since the book is very large and detailed.   \n   \n2. German does use italics when set in 'antiqua' type: the restriction against italics is for blackletter. However, _Der Duden_ will provide details on _how_ italics are used in German.   \n   \n3. The most common form of quotation marks today are opening baseline quotes (look like commas) and upper closing quotes (note: what we think of as _left_ quotes). These are included in the standard character sets for Western Europe.   \n   \n ![German quotes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010233814im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20927.gif)   \n   \nFormerly, German typesetters used inward-pointing guillemet. Refer to _Der Duden_ for when to use single and double quotes.   \n   \n4. Do not be tempted to extrapolate from German typesetting rules to Dutch. Hopefully someone can direct you to a Dutch resource as useful as Der Duden is for German.\n\n"

Start with a capital and then only names of \"things\", cities and people are written i capitals.   \nOr start every word with a capital - it's up to the designer to decide, not? As long as it's not an \"official\" paper for academies, research etc. there are no rules.   \n   \n2. German does not use italics, correct? Do they indicate book titles in any particular way? How about Dutch?   \n   \nIn Dutch, titles are either written in Italics or small caps (rare) as far as I know. But again I think it's up to the designer really.   \n   \n   \n3. What are the best quotation marks to use for Dutch?   \n   \nMore and more single quotes. Nesting: single -double/double - single. Double quotes are still alright, but I find them old fashioned.   \n   \n4. Are there any other obvious rules I should know?   \n   \nNo, not for Dutch, only if you're designing research papers, medical books, encyclopedias etc. (what is the exact term for those things?) where there is a list of resources you used.\n\n"
