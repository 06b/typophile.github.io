  "content": "Irma is a capital-only display typeface in 9 weights that is available in simple Sans & geometric Slab. Inspired by the principles of the Arabic alphabet, Irma provides different conditional letterforms, depending on whether characters occur at the beginning, middle, or the end of the word. Letters can have four different forms (initial, medial, final and isolated). The choice of these forms is controlled by a OpenType feature (Stylistic Set 1), which allows creation of typographic patterns using the negative spaces of the letterforms.\n\n[http://www.typotheque.com/news/new\\_font\\_release\\_irma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303/http:/www.typotheque.com/news/new_font_release_irma \"http://www.typotheque.com/news/new\\_font\\_release\\_irma\")  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma\\_slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma_slab \"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma\\_slab\")  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303/http:/www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma \"http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/irma\")  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/IrmaStd.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303/http:/www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/IrmaStd.pdf \"http://www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/IrmaStd.pdf\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303im_/http:/typophile.com/files/irma_sans_6025.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303im_/http:/typophile.com/files/irma_slab_typophile_5411.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Irma_specials_5269.png)\n\n",

Plus it's an opera. I saw it  \nin Rome as a kid, and I remember one thing from it: they brought  \nout real camels on stage!\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks.\n\n@skolato  \nWe are considering Cyrillic (since most of our fonts have Cyrillic support), but it is to a high priority at the moment. We'll see how will Irma do.\n\n@William Berkson  \nI have designed this typeface for a logo originally ( [http://www.steppinggrounds.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303/http:/www.steppinggrounds.com/ \"http://www.steppinggrounds.com/\")) and I was annoyed by large overshoots even in Display typefaces. Yes you need them in smaller sizes, but not having them allows creating typographic layouts impossible to make with overshoots. Just look at how the logo used on that website, it works much better without them.\n\nI was thinking of these kind of applications too ( [http://www.flickr.com/photos/typotheque/3871608837/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123303/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/typotheque/3871608837/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/typotheque/3871608837/\")) Again, only possible if no overshoots are used.\n\n"
