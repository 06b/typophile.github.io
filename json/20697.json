  "content": "What's the proper treatment of a trademark symbol when it appears at the end of a sentence in body copy, which itself ends with a period?\n\nIf the TM symbol is treated like any other character, and a period follows it, there's an unsightly gap between the last \"real\" letter in the word of the sentence and the closing period.\n\nSometimes I'll manually track in the period until it sits underneath the TM symbol (and appears where it normally would if there wasn't a TM symbol at all) but this can look busy.\n\nIs one of the two above treatments preferred, or is there another method?\n\nThanks,  \nR\n\n",
