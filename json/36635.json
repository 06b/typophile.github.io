      "content": "I agree with Rob as well... it needs something to break it up more visually, right now it's a lot of uniform text (very intimidating) -- but nicely done.\n\nAs for the resumé itself,\n\nA) Your \"objective\" is not one... it's a description. Needs to be changed to include the type of job you're looking for (can be modified depending on job). In other words, \"Designer seeks position as low-paid peon\" or whatever.\n\nB) Education - Lose the G.P.A. - if it's not 4.0, it looks bad, and if it IS 4.0, it looks like you're bragging.\n\nC) Employment - I feel kind of lost here, again because everything's the same weight. As an employer, I want to see 1) where you worked and 2) what you did... i.e., WEB DESIGNER, HORIZON MEDIA GROUP. I don't hink the address and phone are necessary, the city should be enough. And I think you need to make the \"descriptive\" text into more common english - a (short) paragraph, not bullet points. Include what the COMPANY did/was (i.e., \"Developed brand identities for clients of major design firm,\" or whatever).\n\nD) Software Proficiency -- this is tricky. Yous is fine, but you may want ot include versions too (Dreamweaver 6-MX, Mac OSX, etc).\n\nE) Selected Projects is OK, but i usually don't recommend this level of detail in a resume -- that's what a portfolio/interview is for. Since you don't have that much job experience, it may be OK here, but I'd lose it myself.\n\n"

Just label it \"Profile\" instead of \"Objective\".\n\n_No slams about it being in Helvetica Neue? I expected someone to groan._\n\nMy own resume is set in two weights of Franklin Gothic... If it's clear, and legible, and you feel that a clean sans serif says something about you, then I say use it.\n\n"

      "content": "I'll slam the helvetica. Well, I won't SLAM it, but I'd really go for something else.\n\nIt's also crowded. It needs more white space...both in the margins and in the leading.\n\nThe lines...might be a bit much. If you stick with them, consider fading them back to a light grey, but maybe try a version sans the lines.\n\nSkip the objective because a) you don't actually describe your objective and b) what you did write really should be flushed out as a cover letter.\n\nIf you are going to force-justify your text, hang the punctuation.\n\nSoftware proficiency...not sure if you need the years in there. I'd just make that a comma separated sentence. \"Skilled with InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, etc... Familiar with...\"\n\nSelected projects...I'd pull that out as a separate sheet. Make it a mini-portfolio. That way you can show some visuals.\n\nGood luck! And I'm jealous that you are in Portland. Love that place.\n\n"
