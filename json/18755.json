  "content": "Hello everybody. I am new to this forum.\n\nI am thinking about a topic for a school project (visual communication). I am interested in fonts/logotypes that are made from modular forms or based on grids. I know about the constructivist types of bauhaus or destijl.  \nI have a vague idea of creating something like a toolkit for constructivist typedesigning or something like that. Providing different grids and shapes in an analog and digital way... (something like that: [http://staff.lib.muohio.edu/~shocker/FemInv/patgifs/257630/01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130930190753/http:/staff.lib.muohio.edu/~shocker/FemInv/patgifs/257630/01.jpg \"http://staff.lib.muohio.edu/~shocker/FemInv/patgifs/257630/01.jpg\")). Or creating instructions how to find your forms for such a type.\n\nDoes anybody have any inputs, ideas, links, font examples?  \nI am greatful for anything.\n\n",

Do you set out to exercise the creativity of type designers within extreme limitations? Or do you want to create a \"toolkit\" to introduce type design to newcomers as Briem has done in the site I linked above?\n\nPerhaps there needs to be a balance between limitation and freedom, if you place extreme limits in the \"toolkit\", the resulting designs could be bland.\n\nThat said, I'm only a graphic designer with an unhealthy type obsession and I'm very interested in what type designers have to say.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

Pixel fonts might also be something too look at as a more recent development. Although, it seems you are referencing the Bauhaus, so try and dig up stuff on Renner, Frutiger, and the like.\n\n"
