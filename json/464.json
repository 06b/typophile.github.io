  "content": "Hi everyone,   \n   \nI'm currently working on some Cyrillic fonts, my first. I'm just getting a feel for the forms right now.   \n   \nI have a font that has regular Latin upper/lower case and small caps, and I'm now filling out the character set with Cyrillic letters. Should I be using the small cap height for the Cyrillic x-height? Since there are many lower case Cyrillic letters that look basically the same as a Latin small cap, this would simplify things. Then again, some Cyrillic lower case look like Latin lower case as well.   \n   \nBut beyond that, it's an issue of color: should the Cyrillic lower case have the same weight as a Latin set of small caps? Or should they go more with the Latin lower case (very slightly lighter), and also use its smaller x-height? But some of the Cyrillic lower case letters seem to demand more space, due to their being based directly off of the upper case (such as Yah, which looks like a backwards small cap R).   \n   \nSince it would be a rare situation in which Cyrillic lower case are standing next to Latin characters (small caps or lower case), I imagine that maintaining a level of consistency with regard to x-height is probably not a big deal.   \n   \nLastly, is there such a thing as Cyrillic small caps? It seems almost redundant, but I could see the possibility of them existing (I've just never seen any before).   \n   \nThanks,   \nAlan\n\n",

      "content": "Caveat: I know little about the particulars of Cyrillic type design. However, I have been spending a lot of time looking at and evaluating how scripts [should] behave when mixed.   \n   \n\\> Should I be using the small cap height for the Cyrillic x-height?   \n   \nWhich smallcaps? Aren't you the guy who makes 7 sizes of smallcaps? ;-)   \n   \nSeriously, my view (which stems from some informal linguistic analysis) is that a smallcaps height which is notably taller than the x-height is indeed the best guide for the Cyrillic \"x-height\". You can see the necessity for this as soon as you look at some text using the same guide for the x-heights of both Cyrillic and Latin: the former looks secondary, in apparent size.   \n   \nOn the other hand, you should know that this stance is somewhat anti-establishment. People like John Hudson (who I admit design aesthetically very solid Cyrillic fonts) are in the majority when they say that the x-heights should be the same. But they're wrong. :-)   \n   \n\\> maintaining a level of consistency with regard to x-height is probably not a big deal.   \n   \nIn fact that's a clue as to the boundary between immersive versus deliberative reading: in the former (like setting a book) you need overall balance of texture/size more, while in the latter (like setting a poster) you need (or at least might prefer) visual alignment.   \n   \nA reference:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome3.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome3.html)   \n   \n--   \n   \nI personally go even further and state that characters that seem to have identical structures in both scripts should actually have _different_ renderings! The reason is two-fold: emphasizing (even exagerating) cultural authenticity; and improving differentiation. For example look at the \"Getty\" sample on my link above: if it weren't for those parentheses, the reader would be seriously thrown off.   \n   \nAs an example of what I'm talking about in real life, check out the Cyrillic of Quadraat. John doesn't like it - I love it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

This is exactly what I plan to do.   \n   \nAbout the small caps: yeah, I'm all about quantity. It's actually not that family that I'm working on, but another. I think I will plod along with a Cyrillic x-height matching the Latin small caps, slightly higher than the Latin lower case.   \n   \nIt's been a while since I looked at Quadraat Cyrillic, I will have to check that out. What I would die for is a Cyrillic expansion to Clifford!   \n   \nI love this stuff.   \n   \nThanks,   \nAlan\n\n"

      "content": "BTW, another reason to vary the rendering of [superficially] identical characters is notan (the balance of black and white): if one script likes its letterspacing looser than the other (for example as a result of a greater proportion of vertical stems versus rounds, like in Armenian), that would act to increase the internal white as well - and vice versa.   \n   \nThe tricky thing, however, is how to make the differentiation non-hoaky. I think it was John who said/claimed that Quadraat-Cyrillic\\* isn't just \"divergent\", it's inauthentic. I might have to take his word for that, but I can't help but remember a standard disclaimer of mine: what most type designers consider inauthentic might be just fine in the eyes of the reader. In any case, it clearly takes a greater-than-otherwise cultural sensitivity - when you opt not to copy the establishment, you're deeper in the forest.   \n   \n\\*   \nHere's an image I used during my presentation in Thessaloniki:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/quadraat\\_cyr.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/quadraat_cyr.gif)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

And to my non-Russian eyes, some of those letters look awfully snug.   \n   \nBut then how about the same writing system for a different language, like Ukranian or Serbian? They use Cyrillic characters, but add a few letters that have ascenders (or dots) that fill some of the space above the lower case.   \n   \nThe Quadraat Cyrillic Italic does look a bit affected in places. I think the gaps in letters like the zhe and kah are distracting for a lower case, and the descending zeh?! Is that what that is? Looks like it was just borrowed from the old-style three?   \n   \nIf John Hudson is around to chime in, that would be great. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nAlan\n\n"

      "content": "I can't comment on the individual letter issues you mention (I'm simply not familiar with them), but in terms of relative apparent size, it is in fact the proportion of extenders (mostly ascenders, yes) that causes the difference, assuming the color is equivalent. Interestingly, any difference in width (noting that the Cyrillic letters have much greater average width) seems not to matter - and I think I know why: lines are set horizonally, and line breaks \"absorb\" the width difference. But the Cyrillic text will generally run longer (especially since English is a very terse language), and you could say that's where the greater width makes itself felt.   \n   \nIt's also interesting to note that the Ukranian/Serbian factor affects Latin as well, in fact more so! I once did a study of the relative vertical span of 6 Latinate languages, and the two extremes (English and Polish) were pretty far apart. Ergo: Polish needs to be a set a little bit smaller than any parallel English! But to do this sort of thing you need to look closely at letter frequencies, not just the alphabet. The Greek alphabet for example has a greater proportion of extending characters than English, but in real text it's even more confined to the x-height!   \n   \nBTW, Maxim Zhukov & George Sadek's \"Typographia polyglotta\" is a great resource for developing some linguistic sensitivity towards mixed typesetting. Just try not to squirm when you read the last paragraph on page xvi... to me it almost ruins the whole point of the book! But that slip of \"fundamentalism\" notwithstanding, it's really a great little gem.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

My suspicion is that Russian-style Cyrillic is perfectly acceptable to Bulgarian readers just as the Bulgarian-style forms, while the opposite isn't true: the Russian-style forms are the only ones acceptable for Russian readers.   \n   \nSerbian-style Cyrillic:   \n   \nSimilarly, there are some particular letterforms that are distinct in Serbian-style Cyrillic -- especially in italic style. These include \"ge\", \"de\", \"pe\" and \"te\" that tend to be more influenced by calligraphy than in the Russian-style Cyrillic. Helvetica Linotype implements this in the OpenType \"locl\" feature.   \n   \nPlease note that, for example, Jovica Veljovic's Cyrillic designs tend to be slightly more of Serbian style than of Russian style.   \n   \nThere are good samples of Cyrillic and Western character sets of fonts designed or adapted by ParaType designers and other Russian designers (especially the work by Vladimir Yefimov and Tagir Safayev is worth checking).   \n   \nFor example, check out Vladimir Yefimov's Octava. Pay special attention to the Latin and Cyrillic K, and then to the Zhe.   \n [http://www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT\\_OCT55&refcode=123495](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT_OCT55&refcode=123495)   \n [http://www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT\\_OCT55&codingList=11&refcode=123495](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT_OCT55&codingList=11&refcode=123495)  \nAlso, check ITC Charter Cyrillic   \n [http://www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT\\_CHR55&refcode=123495](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT_CHR55&refcode=123495)  \n [http://www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT\\_CHR55&codingList=11&refcode=123495](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT_CHR55&codingList=11&refcode=123495)  \nITC New Baskerville   \n [http://www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT\\_NWB55&refcode=123495](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.paratype.ru/pstore/charset.asp?scode=PT_NWB55&refcode=123495)  \nand other serif designs   \n [http://www.paratype.ru/asearch/sresult.asp?ftype=SE&enclang=enc&fenc=1&ffoundry=PT&refcode=123495](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050725/http:/www.paratype.ru/asearch/sresult.asp?ftype=SE&enclang=enc&fenc=1&ffoundry=PT&refcode=123495)  \n   \nI consider Matthew Carter, John Hudson and Gary Munch as the designers who are most successful among non-natives in designing Cyrillic letterforms.

      "content": "Hi! I've run into this discussion by chance, and obviously, too late. A few things got mixed up here.   \n   \n1. That the small caps _exist_ in Cyrillic, is an indisputable fact, impossible to deny. Good typography is hardly possible without small caps, either in Western languages, or in Russian, or other languages using Cyrillic. Just have a look at the digital fonts offered by ParaType that feature 'SCOSF' character sets.   \n   \n2. That in multilingual typefaces that cover both Latin and Cyrillic scripts _the same x-height_ is used, is another fact. One can theorise ad infinitum whether this is the best solution but that's the way it is (challenging this practice has nothing to do with being 'anti-establishment': this is pure _coquetterie_).   \n   \n3. In designing multilingual typefaces that cover both Latin and Cyrillic scripts it is standard to use _identical shapes_ for different characters in both sets: for example, the capital A, B, C, E, H, I, J, [K], M, O, P, S, T, X, and the lower-case a, c, e, i, j, o, p, s, x, and y (in roman, and more in italic).   \n   \n4. Yes, Russian text _looks different_ from English when set in the same point size, on the same leading, track, with the same horizontal scale, etc. Of course, in the same typographic format English text looks different from Italian, Spanish text looks different from Danish, etc., despite they all use Latin script.   \n   \n5. Adam, I never told you that Cyrillic lowercase should be _designed_ with slightly larger x-height than Latin. What I shared with you was a _typesetting_, not a type design, tip. Manipulating the point size and the tracking is sometimes necessary for better visual balance of the Russian text with the text in English, or in any other language using Latin script.   \n   \n6. The design of **Quadraat** Cyrillic I find pretty amateurish, and the typeface unusable. As to **Minion** , that was the very first digital Cyrillic with a good pedigree, and one of the first typefaces the young Robert Slimbach did for Adobe; however, I am certain that to-day he could come up with a much better design.\n\n"

Aren't \"smart\" fonts good? The recent Whitman comes to mind: in the elaboration in Kent's PDF there are descriptions of many \"tricks\" he's incorporated that work _in spite_ of the typographer.   \n   \nIn fact, I see a good reason to move that feature (differing x-heights) \"deeper\", to the type design itself: if you take a font with Latin and Cyrillic components (where the color has been matched for the same point size, as it will always be if it's any good) and scale one slightly larger, it will look darker too.   \n   \nI'm not disputing what the standards are, I'm just pointing out functional problems with them.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The strongest side of the local cuisine are fish and sea fruits. You can get salmon in numerous incarnations. Also, since the Tatars and Armenians were and are present on Crimea, you get tasteful shasliks and other meat dishes mainly involving lamb. You also get various ravioli-like specialties such as pelmeni or vareniki. Crimea has fine wines and Champagne-like sparling wines.
