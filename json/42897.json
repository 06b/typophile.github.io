  "content": "Designing a series of Jazz book covers. They will have line art illustrations that reflect the bebop Jazz era. The three books will cover Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, and Dizzy Gillespie. I wanted to bring a little influence of the jazz records but since it is a 3 book series I need to bring them together with 1 or 2 typeface. One typeface for the headline or name of the Jazz player and the second typeface for the standard name of the book series that will be placed on all three books (author name, series name, publisher, etc). Any suggestions on typefaces and combination would help out. I'm out of ideas.\n\n",

So perhaps a little looseness/distress might work, e.g. my [Brown,](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221015813/http:/www.shinntype.com/brown.html) say Extra Bold Condensed, and paired with a gestural cursive script (Mistral comes to mind) to really capture the free flow.\n\nThe line illustrations sounds like a nice idea.\n\nIMO, Daddy-O is a bit crazy and lacks gravitas, those were serious dudes and very laid back. I never got to see Bird play, but I love on the youtube videos it's like he's so cool he's completely motionless, and yet there's this amazing stream of melody.\n\n"

But there is a sheeniness that most of the ECM recordings have that doesn't stand the test of time for me. I loved it when I first heard it, that's when I was a record producer and engineer and that was definitely a leap forward, especially the cymbals, which had a sparkle that I hadn't heard before. I will assume (although I could be very wrong) that some of those first engineers for ECM had cut their teeth on classical music, perhaps at Deutsche Gramophone, since classical music was the laboratory for recording acoustic instruments and DG LPs were the gold standard.  \nIt was a quantum leap in separation of sound, really amazing acoustic engineering, but for me the cleanness is antithetical to what I love about jazz.\n\npbc\n\n"

I am not per se, because once I started playing instead of practicing I was interested in my own music too much to be a fan anymore.\n\nThere's music I like but I am not passionate about it and I rarely listen.\n\nOne of my criteria for judging music is whether I think that the artist wants to be a star or not. So I don't listen to popular music or radio. I have a large collection of gypsy music from around the world and I like it both musically and theoretically because in these societies musicians are no more important than bread bakers, which is how it should be in my opinion. I also like the fact that the gypsies are another class of scorned people, who have always had the best music because that's one of the only things that couldn't be taken from them.\n\nMy last musical \"hero\" was Fred Frith, who I think is still one of the finest instrumentalists in the improvisational world.\n\nMy collection ranges from Mauricio Kagel to Romica Puceanu, the gypsy siren of Romania. I have more CDs of sound effects than anything else.\n\nMy favorite series of covers are for Faust.\n\nSo it's a complicated mix…\n\npbc\n\n"
