Intellifont fonts were hinted on a Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC) VAX mainframe computer.\n\nUsing DEC terminal computers, Design Engineers would enter command line instructions to launched programmes including the Intellifont hinting programme. This programme displayed [Ikarus](http://web.archive.org/web/20140814195058/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ikarus) [outlines](http://web.archive.org/web/20140814195058/http:/typophile.com/wiki/outlines) on a Vector Automation screen. With a [stylus](http://web.archive.org/web/20140814195058/http:/typophile.com/wiki/stylus) pen the Design Engineer placed [hints](http://web.archive.org/web/20140814195058/http:/typophile.com/wiki/hint) via graphical links on the Ikarus outlines. These links are similar to the ones now seen in Microsoft's [Visual TrueType](http://web.archive.org/web/20140814195058/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Visual%20TrueType) and other hinting programmes. Intellifont production included a model based autohinter (1990) which allowed faster hinting by transferring hints from a library of previously hinted characters of common design styles.\n\nIntellifont technology was shipped with the Hewlett-Packard Laserjet III and IV and was one of the rasterizers in Agfa's UFST.\n\n",
