  "content": "The master director and writer Wes Anderson has a new movie coming out in November called Darjeeling Limited. But this time Wes (or his team of creatives) have opted to not use Futura as their font. What is this mysterious font? The font seems to perfectly fit with the movie. The movie takes place in India and in India, I have noticed, they use western design and art but with a slight Indian remix, and the font of Darjeeling Limited does that exactly. Its really nice to see an artist like Wes Andersson have such great understanding of graphic design and typography. Much like another master of film known for his 2001 Odysseus.\n\n[http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox\\_searchlight/thedarjeelinglimited/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311184148/http:/www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/thedarjeelinglimited/ \"http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox\\_searchlight/thedarjeelinglimited/\")\n\n",

I do get the sense that ever aspect of Wes Anderson's work is so thought through that there is nothing organic left.\n\nI keep hoping Jason Schwartzman will have a larger personality. I didn't really like the character he played in Marie Antoinette. I get the feeling he didn't have to try very hard to fill those shoes. Or maybe he is such a great actor that he can do that. Either way that movie blew. I was soooooo disappointed. Sorry, I hope I've not derailed the thread. I can't imagine he can stand up next to Owen Wilson and Adrien Brody.\n\n"

I was eating brunch once in NY and Schwartzman and his girlfriend were leaning against the window, literally 3 feet away from me, sucking face. It was kinda hard to eat.\n\nI liked Anderson's first movie, Bottle Rocket, a lot but he has steadily lost me - absolutely hated Tennenbaums and couldn't bring myself to see the fish movie.\n\nMore thread derailing, sorry.\n\nThe G on that poster led me to Nobel, but other characters don't match, so I dunno what font we're looking at.\n\n"

Futura was widely acknowledged as Stanley Kubrick's 'favourite' typeface even though he used a wide variety of typefaces in his films and posters etc. Kubrick is beyond Wes Anderson in creativity and technical imagination.\n\nMy first impression of the poster/cover of Darjeeling Limited is that it's basically identical to 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou', they both use Futura... and the same color palette.\n\nDon't get me wrong I thought the The Royal Tenenbaums was hilarious, but didn't he use Futura on the cover for that too?\n\n"

I don't even know why I liked it, but I did!\n\nMore trivia: The production designer for the Wes Anderson movies up through Tenenbaums was David Wasco, the brother of Monotype's (and previously Adobe's) Jim Wasco. David Wasco has a great resume, having done production design for all of Quentin Tarantino's movies too.\n\n"

Every single sing in that movie is set in Futura, whether its the taxi company name on the side of a car or a bottle of milk, I have never heard any movie do that. And that perfectly is one piece of creating a world, which Wes Andersson does with Tennenbaums, he creates an imaginary world.\n\nI love Andersson movies because they are so visually stimulating, much like a Jean Pierre Jeunet or Michael Gondry movie is. Plus Wes Andersson movie have a unique humor to them.\n\nI first didnt actually like his movies but one it clicked and noticed the genius. Im not saying his as great as Kubrick but hes on his way up there.\n\n"

Plot is rarely that important, it seems. It's a feel I enjoy, but I can see how it's not for everyone.\n\n"
