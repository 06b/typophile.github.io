  "content": "In the processing of rehabing this sign that marks the infamous WRECK bar in Lake Elsinore, CA. The sign has been here since the early 1960's and pretty much matches the decor of the bar (which has also been the same since the 1960's.... I think there are customers who have been in here since the 1960's!..). Would like to see if matching font could be found to use in further fundraising media to go towards work being attempted in creating a mural on the facade and sides of the building depicting scenes of the historic Elsinore Grand Prix Motocycle Race (see the film \"On Any Sunday\") Thanks for any help or clues!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [WRECK Small.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011153644/http:/typophile.com/files/WRECK%20Small.jpg) | 94.54 KB |\n\n",
