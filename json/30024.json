In the 20th century, type designers were fond of chopping of serifs and simplifying forms, and also unifying the formal language of writing systems -- mostly by imitating the Latin forms. To me, modernism has always been an echo of the 19th-century fascination with the machine.\n\nMy idea for the 21st-century type design is a search for more natural, but also more ad hoc forms -- in all writing systems. Neither directly derived from the writing hand nor overly simplified. The technical limitations of type design are less and less existant, it's possible to draw thousands of glyphs, create glyphs made of components, engineer automatic, contextual substitutions. Typefaces need to find a balance between hand influences, mechanical influences and electronic influences.\n\nA.\n\n"

For non-Latin scripts, latinization was one of the aspects of \"modernismazation\".

It’s perfect in every sense.\n\nThe work done by [Tagir Safayev](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041250/http:/www.paratype.com/asearch/default.asp?search=safayev) and by [Vladimir Yefimov](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041250/http:/www.paratype.com/asearch/default.asp?search=yefimov) for ParaType is seminal.\n\nEspecially check Yefimov's own Octava, his Cyrillic renditions of ITC Charter (great!), Kis (great!) and Raleigh as well as Safayev's Rodchenko typeface and his Cyrillic versions of ITC Officina Sans (great!) and Serif and of ITC New Baskerville.\n\nLater check Yefimov's Cyrillic versions of Futura, Futura Futuris, New Standard, ITC Avant Garde, English 157, and Safayev's Cyrillic versions of ITC Kabel, Humanist 521 (Gill Kayo), FF OCR-F, FF Meta. The ParaType version of Humanist 531 (Syntax) is also very good, by Isay Slutsker and Manvel Shmavonyan.\n\nSome of the new Microsoft ClearType fonts that ship with Office 2007 (Calibri, Candara, Consolas, Corbel) have very decent Cyrillics. I’m not very fond of Constantia and Cambria as designs altogether, but I’d say their Cyrillics are also not worse than their Latins. However, in general, Luc(as) de Groot, Jeremy Tankard, Gary Munch and John Hudson have a fairly firm grip on designing Cyrillics, while Robert Slimbach’s Cyrillics (Minion, Garamond Premier Pro) are more controversial.\n\nThe work of Alexander Tarbeev and his students is also worth looking at.\n\nA.\n\n"

If we always base our design logic on this shifting sand, it will always stand the chance of missing the intension. Better to design in the present for the present and allow your new design to be fulfilled in its own terms. Whatever you do, there will certainly be those who decree, \"but it isn't...[siting the historical references which they most agree with]\" so why not just let it be its own cosmos. It is probably more efficient to design something and reflect on its plus and minus characteristics than to do nothing because of an endless debate that stops you from ever getting started. There are those who will say it does not follow tradition and there are those who will say it is the same old stuff as we always see. The world has an ample supply of critics.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I believe that the Russian type designers who would be able to do such a critique are far too polite and modest to actually publish anything that would criticize fellow type designers (who otherwise do excellent work, like Robert Slimbach). However, if you track Russian typographic publications, you will notice the trend that the work of certain designers is regularly praised and awarded, while others are left unmentioned. Also, typographic conferences such as ATypI are often a good occasion to sit down with some Russian designers and talk with them one-on-one.\n\nFor anyone interested in Cyrillic type design, I recommend the [**TDC Cyrillic Weekend**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041250/http:/www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/) which will be held on March 2-4, 2007 at the Type Directors Club in New York. Maxim Zhukov’s expertise in the field of Cyrillic type design is unquestionable, he was the consultant who helped Hudson, Carter, de Groot, Tankard, Munch and many other Western type designers to get their Cyrillics where they are now. Maxim’s approach on Cyrillic is quite orthodox, with certain rules and schemes. As with anything in typography, these rules are very practical to learn even if at some point, you decide to break them.\n\nAdam\n\n"

I don't think it's reasonable.\n\nMost ParaType cyrillizations, and most Cyrillic typefaces altogether, suffer from the fact that Latin and Cyrillic share the same letter proportions. I think the Cyrillic lowercase could be slightly taller, and have larger sidebearings -- that'd be the minimum. I don't see why some forms couldn't be a bit different altogether.\n\nThis is wonderfully proven with ITC Officina and FF Meta. Of both Spiekermann's typefaces (both adapted for Cyrillic by Tagir Safayev), Meta actually works better in Latin text, but for Cyrillic, Officina is far superior. Officina used to be very popular in the West but when Meta was released, it gradually replaced and suppressed Officina. But not in Russia. Officina Cyrillic is still one of the most popular modern sanserifs there, and Meta is hardly present.\n\nOfficina has looser spacing and a higher x-height than Meta: for Latin, it is a bit over the top. For Cyrillic, it works perfectly. I don't even think it's an ad-hoc hypothesis: I believe that the intuitive choice of typographers in both script rooms and their \"natural\" preference for Meta over Officina or the other way around, delivers actual proof.\n\nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "Nick,\n\nboth in Renaissance and in modern fonts, Latin and Greek differ noticeably, and there is no \"problem\". The Greeks had their latinization phase but they're over it now. The Russians don't necessarily have the confidence yet.\n\nAlso, nobody said that the letterforms have to differ \\*noticeably\\*. \"d\" looks like a \"p\" turned upside down, and the top \"B\" counter looks like it's the same size as the bottom, but we both know that neither of that is true. Harmonization of forms does not mean making them geometrically identical.\n\nIn fact, the current Cyrillic faces often suffer from the problem that if you set two columns of text, side-by-side, one in Russian and one in English, with the same point size and leading, then either the English is too tight or the Russian is too loose.\n\nIn my opinion, the principle of script harmonization within multilingual typefaces is simple: when set side-by-side in two columns \\*and\\* when mixed together within one column, the scripts should \\*look good\\*. Now, what \"look good\" exactly means is up to the type designer to decide. I'm sure you'll agree that it doesn't have to be simple geometric copy-pasteness.\n\nAs for the Cyrillic \"ef\" in New Standard, it fits. It is a reminiscent of the era, and is probably a way of reaching out to the \"greekness\" of some Cyrillic forms rather than following a Latin model. In Cyrillic, the double and the reverse letters (ef, zhe, ya, yu etc.) are among the most unorthodox ones.\n\nI recommend that you order a copy of Yuri Gordon's book ( [http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga\\_pro\\_bykvy/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041250/http:/store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga_pro_bykvy/ \"http://store.artlebedev.com/catalog/books/design/kniga\\_pro\\_bykvy/\") ). It shows some nice examples of Cyrillic letterforms in different writing styles, and also their extreme treatment in logos -- which can be helpful in exploring the \"acceptable\" borders for each character.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
