I’m strangely fascinated. What is your take, lettering experts? \n\n1. The ornate gold & red headine: Is “Watch Batteries” the name of the shop? Seems odd!\n\nWatch batteries, sinuous organic script, and climbing roses are things that usually would not go together, right?\n\nIs the owner saying: “I do mechanical work for a living, but at heart I’m a sentimental old-fashioned lover of beauty and art”?\n\n2. The second headline -“Fast Quality Repairs” - is in a completely different, equally ornate Art Nouveau style in small-caps lettering embellished with a wing and swashes, but the letters are oddly spaced and placed.\n\n3. The phone number doesn’t match the other lettering in color or style. A thick blue outline doesn’t enhance legibility, because of the low contrast with the green background.\n\n4. The (misspelled) phrase “Whole Sale Prices,” is squeezed right underneath the second phrase and overlaps the phone number, as if it was an afterthought. The snaky script does not match the headline style exactly (look at the W).\n\nThen there’s the huge flower, and the pocket watch perched on top of the headline script, containing a giant diamond. The whole thing is set in a rusty metal holder mended with duct tape.\n\nIs this a relic of the 60s? Was the sign painter stoned or tripping when he created this art? Or does it go back even further? Someday I’ll ask the owner\n\n",

      "content": "Folk art (and its eccentric sibling, visionary art) appeals to us because it displays imagination and manual dexterity in their raw state, unrefined by formal rules of composition or fitness for a practical purpose. Who’s to say that art nouveau flowers don’t go with watch batteries? Who cares if _Watch Batteries_ is the name if the shop? It’s really the only piece of information their customers need to know. Who cares if you can read the phone number? This looks like a place that gets more walk-ins than phone orders anyway.  \n_Watch Batteries_ and the phone number are almost certainly the work of the same hand (maybe the lettering artist for [this album](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134735/http:/www.bluebeat.com/albums/13513) ended up fixing watches in Seattle). The white lettering was done by a different, less skilled hand, probably at a later time (perhaps painted over something else that previously filled that space).\n\n"

At first glance, no frills...squeezing as many letters as possible, overlapping for maximum impact. But then I noticed the arched “jewelry” and the capital I with dainty dot added. It’s distinctive. Is this folk art also?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134735im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sign-freshfish_5698.jpg)\n  \nThis is in the multinational immigrant ’hood. They sell  \n“a Lot of sea food,” I see. “Freshfish” is one word......why U.S. catfish? Is foreign catfish suspect to their American customers? “Free cut and clean” sounds like a classified ad in a gay alternative rag. The sign DOES have a sense of neatness, style and proportion...yet looks like it’s speaking with an accent. What would you call this style of lettering?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134735im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sign-maharaja_5040.jpg)\n  \nThis restaurant is one of my favorites - but the sign hurts to look at it. The background illustration might’ve been peeled off a webpage. The word “Maharajah” is almost illegible. “Cuisine of India” has an outline so thick, the original font is almost submerged. The other text - what is that, Tiffany Heavy? Comments?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134735im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sign-adultstore_5256.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134735im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sign-taxservice_6668.jpg)\n  \nThe Adult Superstore adds a touch of class with the Peignot style of font. (“Stan” the adult superstore guy added a nativity scene to their window at Christmas.) The tax guy was thinking along the same lines. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI think Khmer lettering honestly does add beauty to the cheesiest surroundings.
