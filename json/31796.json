I understand there are numerous options using flash but that kerning and open type features are not supported. I also understand that their is:\n\nLettError LetterSetter\n\n[http://www.letterror.com/lettersetter/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072753/http:/www.letterror.com/lettersetter/index.html \"http://www.letterror.com/lettersetter/index.html\")\n\nwhich supports kerning and various features but are there any other options out there?\n\nHow important is font testing with online font stores?\n\nThanks,\n\nMike\n\n [‹ OT \\<hlig\\>, \\<hist\\> (historical ligatures & forms in OpenType)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072753/http:/typophile.com/node/31759 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Two more questions about nodes. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072753/http:/typophile.com/node/29613 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Just about every foundry’s website has a different spin on type testing. One that I found interesting (although I ultimately dislike it) is Wilton Foundry’s [FontGenerator](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072753/http:/www.fontselect.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Category_Code=cyan) (click on “View this font in FontGenerator), which displays the sample out of moving particles.\n\nFonts.com’s “Free Text,” while clunkily implemented, gives possibly the most flexibility I’ve seen, allowing you to specify any point size you want as well as the text and background color. It doesn’t seem to kern, though.\n\nEDIT: Reminding myself of your original question, for me, some way to see the letters up close and personal is extremely important, as I by typefaces for both their readability at normal sizes and their quirks at larger sizes. If a site doesn’t have a good type tester, I look for a PDF that I can zoom in on. Lacking both of those would make my decisions more protracted.\n\n"
