      "content": "Daniel: There are a lot of things I like about this font. My first reaction was that it would make an interesting mono spaced font. The characters are very boxy, and have the appearance of being modular.   \n   \nOverall, very nice. Things I would tweak: 1) the letter \"e\" seems awkward. It appears as if it could fall forward at any second. 2) the \"W\" seems too wide. 3) the tail on the \"y\" doesn't thrill me. 4) certain letters look \"weightier\" than others...although that could just be the screen.\n\n"

      "content": "This is a bit trendy, but attractive nonetheless.   \n   \nSome things:   \n- The caps are too big.   \n- The vertical proportions of the lc are good.   \n- I'd give the \"e\" a smaller eye.   \n- The dots of \"i\"/\"j\" are too small (and too low).   \n- I think the \"k\" could be more interesting.   \n- I'd make the \"t\" wider.   \n- The \"B\" is a bit wide.   \n- I'd give the \"I\" serifs.   \n- The \"K\" is imbalanced.   \n- The \"P\" seems to have a funny appendage... ;-)   \n- The \"Q\" needs a stronger tail.   \n- Yes, there seems to be a lot of weight imbalance.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you guys, that are some very good hints. I also think that the caps are too big and too strong. At the moment they are as high as the ascenders of the LC. I'll fix that. I'm not sure about the \"e\" i like as it is, but i try out what you suggested.   \n   \nI'll post a new image when its done, but feel free to post more suggestions.   \n   \nThanks\n\n"

Here Daniel Günther saw my type and even voted it in this forum for the best new typefaces of 2003:   \n [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22342.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013004922/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22342.html)   \n   \n The more i was suprised reading this thread about a new type designed by Daniel Günther which he acclaims to be his idea of a new sans serif. For my eyes its just a copy cat example par exellence. Sure, there are a few modifications but the overall idea is fully copied.   \n   \nWhy is somebody wasting his time instead of working on his own originality and ideas for stuff like that? Maybe somebody here has the answer. But most of all   \ni\n\n"

I believe this is the first time that I have even seen your font in any great detail.

I wonder if I could make something similar.\" That's ok as a learning   \nexperience. Extremely valuable in fact. One suggestion you might take from this is to disclose your   \nintent and any sources when you introduce the project. Not only does it save Frank the hernia, but we   \ncan also better critique and assist you.   \n   \nStick around at Typophile. You are obviously a lover of type, and more than welcome. Chalk this one   \nup to experience. I look forward to seeing your next contribution to the critique section.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
