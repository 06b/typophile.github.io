  "content": "I know this topic has come up before, but I think my question is a little different.\n\nRobert Bringhurst says the default Th ligature in many Adobe OpenType fonts is \"misclassified as basic\". In order to get InDesign to apply all basic ligatures but not Th, one has to either edit every single Adobe OpenType font using a tool such as FontLab or use some sort of script to \"undo\" all Th ligatures but not the other basic ones.\n\nI can write a little script, of course, but maybe somebody already has one, or can offer another simple solution to the problem (besides _find/change_)?\n\n",

However, if you take the complete Minion Pro, Myriad Pro and Cronos Pro families, right there you have almost 150 files to edit. A few more Adobe Pro families (if you do work for a firm that has Portfolio 10) and you've become a full-time font patcher. And that's if the firm has FontLab.\n\nOf course you can patch only the fonts you need to use (if that's a possibility), but I was hoping to find a simpler, less time-consuming solution. I think the bottom line is that such a solution doesn't exist.\n\n"

But I can't think of a tool that you can use. Perhaps [TTX](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020095758/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TTX).\n\n"
