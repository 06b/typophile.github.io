I have the first version of iWork. the new version- '06- has more stuff.\n\nBut this little collection isn't all that bad.  \nWhen I get my pizza place up and running I'll use Jenson Old Style or maybe if I'm feelin' really 'classy' I use Algerian.\n\nThe monospaced avant guard and souvenir is scandalous!\n\nOk for reals though... as mentioned Bodoni 72 Small Caps by sumner stone is great, Type Embellishments 1 is something we all should have in our libraries, Portago is very good, Academy is a fine classic, Braganza is nifty, and Mona Lisa now has old style figures- (it deserves some respect for having osf numerals right?\n\nNext on my list is extract the font in my ipod- oh wait- I don't have one.\n\nMikey\n\n"

I use combination color-coding and Fontbook. My main font management tool is Font Explorer, but I don't activate or de-activate fonts system fonts with it. I'll quit Font Explorer, open Fontbook disable the system fonts I need disabled, re-open FontBook and voilá, Font Explorer see it.\n\n(Fontbook)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415023027im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fbprev0131_3963.gif)\n\n(Font Explorer Pro)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415023027im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fexprev0131_3754.gif)\n\n"

I wrote the Wikipedia page that Dan Gayle refers to: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_fonts\\_in\\_Mac\\_OS\\_X](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415023027/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fonts_in_Mac_OS_X \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_fonts\\_in\\_Mac\\_OS\\_X\") which also mentions hidden fonts such as Apple Garamond and the ones at /Applications/iDVD.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts/\n\nMy main aim in doing this is to get as large a variety of fonts installed on end user's systems so that they can be used on websites. Braganza Small Caps looks wonderful for headings in the right setting, we just need it to be installed on a significant enough percentage of systems.\n\n"

There is not point to hidden fonts. Take apple casual: no one and their grandma knows that apple has made a nice alternative to comic sans but there it is.\n\nSo thank you and keep up the good work,\n\nMikey\n\nPS...

      "content": "I popped in my Mac OSX install cd and ran a program called Pacifist on it, and I was surprised by the results. Almost all of these typefaces are on it! Notable exceptions being the Braganza and Portago faces. I think there are even some extras not mentioned before. Some of them are hidden in the various installers on there, and of course there are the X11 fonts on there as well.\n\nPacifist is donationware, so if you're interested, just pop your install disk in. Then after about 5 minutes and a few disk exchanges, you can search through every single file that you can install. Even hidden ones!  \nI typed in a few searches such as .ttf, .dfont, and MM and it worked pretty well.\n\n"
