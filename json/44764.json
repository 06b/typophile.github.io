They are a company aimed at other media companies, aiming to get their music into adverts, films, games etc . . .\n\nI have tried to mess about forming basic letter shapes using equilateral triangles (the ’play’ symbol from mp3/dvd players etc), but it still needs some work.

I will be back soon, and will post my results . . thanks again:)\n\nMy thoughts in the meantime however . . .\n\nlorem ipsum - i tried building the letterforms out of more than one triangle, but it jsut seems confusing and the shapes loses their rhythm.\n\nnvhladek - The p is necessary, because there is a sister company called Boy Wonder Records, and they need to be differentiated between.\n\nRatbaggy - I have mentioned to the client about using similar concepts for both company logos, with small changes to identify, and he seems open to the idea. I like the idea of quality that comes with the ribbon shape, but not sure if it relates to the company too closely? Ive been experimenting with radio waves etc, and as stated will get back with the ideas:)\n\n"

So many of the most successful marks are non sequitors - a little girl with an umbrella for salt, a peacock for a TV news station, a shell for a gas station, a ribbon for flour, an apple for computers, the list goes on and on and on.\n\nWhen the name is not obvious and/or the concept is hard to grasp, then some kind of explanatory or illustrative logomark is definitely called for, but a music publisher is hardly a difficult concept.\n\nGood luck!\n\n—-  \neeblet.com\n\n"
