  "content": "Hi all,  \nDpes anyone know any method of turning off the \"font fallback\" routine in Windows 7 that substitutes unfilled glyphs with characters from other fonts?\n\nPerhaps I don't understand its purpose, but I can't really see why anyone would want this, especially since the chosen substitutions are rarely close in appearance or acceptable as a substitute. I find it gets in the way significantly of what I'm trying to do; I want to be able to see whether a certain font supports the characters I want, but I've yet to find a font manager for Windows that doesn't support the substitutions. Even Windows' standard font viewer does it.\n\nOnce I work with the font in an app like InDesign there's no problem, but largely (I beleive) because Adobe apps have their own internal way of dealing with fonts and glyphs. It's the issue of viewing the glyphs ina font that is screwed up.\n\nHave I missed or misunderstood something? I'm finding it very frustrating. How do other people cope with this?\n\nMore to the point: is there a way around it? ;-)\n\n",
