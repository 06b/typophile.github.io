  "content": "Hello,\n\nHere are some tests for my little company.  \nWe mainly imports products (most of them from italy). We do not sell directly to the final customer.\n\nAs you can see, I’m not especially a master designer (far away from that, I’m web developer) but this is going to passionate me more everyday. So I certainly made evident big mistakes but I don’t know them : every constructive critics are welcome !\n\nSo here is how I though:  \n- D L V letters can be the same character with 45° rotation if you delete the vertical bar from the ’D’.  \n- The 2.5D box made with these letters could represent the boxes we deal everyday with (not really inspired)  \n- The circle in the middle represent the company, which buy goods (vertical simple line) to supply its retailers (multiple dispersing lines)  \n- 1, 3 & 4 could represent an UP arrow, synonym of prosperity\n\nThe typo used is a classic Gill sans MS, at this stage I give priority to the logo itself.\n\nThanks in advance ;)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dlv-test.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826/http:/typophile.com/files/dlv-test.gif) | 10.43 KB |\n\n [‹ Upcoming Church Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43376 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Public Speaker identity ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43416 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nfor a web developer your work looks pretty good. (Actually, I am web developer too!)\n\nMaybe you are having too many thoughts about what the logo should represent. I think it’s best to pick one of the ideas/bullet points above and then develop it further. At the moment, I like logo #1 the most. The other ones may not scale down well, due to the many thin white lines.\n\nIf you say, you are mostly selling Italian products you might also want to consider using a colour scheme that feels more Italian, e.g. terracotta or light brown.\n\nGood luck!\n\n[Webdesign Portfolio](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"

To be honest, I noticed the “UP arrow” thing when completed so it can be forgotten.\n\nI got loslogos yesterday, I may find a revelation who knows :)\n\n"

Ducatti and Ferrari are both read. OK, enough about color.\n\nHere’s what I’d do :\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Pic1_4478.jpg)\n\nThis way I think you get to keep the whole one line/three lines thing. Maybe play around with the white lines (thicker), so it works on small sizes and when printed on boxes.\n\nAbout Gill Sans… not too sure. Maybe try an Italian typeface? One more dynamic?\n\nThat’s my two cents.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "I think TypoJunkie is right actually. Red may be a very “Italian” colour after all!\n\nIn fact I think your concept is so good that colour becomes a secondary issue here. Maybe you should carry on designing your logo in black and white and then add colour only at the very last stage. Sorry for confusing you in my first post :-)\n\nMy favourites are versions 1 and 3. Version 2 looks great too. Versions 4, 6 and 7 don’t tell me anything. I can’t see the letters D, L and V in there.\n\nGood luck!\n\n[Webdesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"

      "content": "TypoJunkie, you are not wrong. That red is quite dynamic and that’s good for the company. The simple line instead of the confusing 3 lines is a good compromise too.\n\nI just understood what you wanted to say by “inside of the box darker”. In fact I don’t see the cube as you do : for me it’s a 3D cube standing on a peak. You seem to see it from the inside, right ?\n\nBy the way I have been accommodated to the last one (brown-yellow).\n\nSo now I’m facing a dilemma :\n\nbackground or two-colors letters without background\nsplitted “V” or not\n\n[Aldo Novarese](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/person/novarese/aldo/?page=3) (italian font designer) has some interesting fonts but nothing that make me scream.\n\nHere is a quick mock-up, no major changes.  \nNotice the bridge between to P & O : glasses & motorcycle related.

      "content": "Hey,\n\nHere is the last update. I had different critics about the typo :\n\n1. eurostile & neuropol extended : “L” can be read as a “I”  \n2. microgramma : idem, weight too heavy  \n3. solaris : “V” can be read as a “U”, I had to make the font a little bolder\n\nWhat I think about that:  \n1. .. not sure, all letters are small case. But I’m not sure it’s a good idea to mix 2 different fonts. Maybe play with letter-spacing, etc.  \n2. For me it’s the more motorcycle related font of the three.  \n3. Not false, but there is something that I like in this font. “L” is readable.\n\nI’m satisfied with all fonts but I needed to show it to non designer people, to hear what they see.  \nYour designer point of view interest me much. What do you think ?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080921155826im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo-dlv_5112.gif)\n\n"
