      "content": "Hello Sulaf\n\nwelcome aboard! I loved your logo: it has harmony and style. Since you want people to remember the name correctly in their mind, I think you should alter the Seen which looks like Raa now. A hint of teeth may be one way, but probably best would be to have the pointy stem pointing south west!\n\n-Saad\n\n[http://arabetics.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424022321/http:/arabetics.com/ \"http://arabetics.com\")\n\n"
