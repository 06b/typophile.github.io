I'm pretty convinced this is no font but a custom lettering by [Anthony Forster](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.artbyforster.com/) himself.  \nReminds me of [Thalia](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/thalia) though. There are also [Mikado](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=mikado)/OPTI [Miyako](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=miyako)/Scriptorium [Cipango](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=cipango)/Solotype [Emperor](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=emperor) without being any of them of course... May be they inspired him to create this lettering...  \nAnother one: [Letterhead](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803055700/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead) by Coffee Bin\n\n"
