I pulled out the most distinctive glyphs (characteristic characters?) for viewing here in TP.\n\nI can't get a vector version of their logo for a sponsorship. I've got a huge gif, and, at its size, would work fine, but it's not anti-aliased, as you can see in the extraction.\n\nFYI, I already ran this through WTF in various ways, to no avail.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nRay\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022211101im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Yale-School-of-Medicine_5856.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022211101im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Yale-School-of-Medicine-full_5569.png)\n\n",
