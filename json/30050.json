I’m unsure of the exact differences, but I notice the Light version on my system looks like a pseudo-caps, where the cap letters are heavier than the rest. Ugly.\n\nAs an aside: Copperplate’s the typeface people [love to hate](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202144022/http:/typophile.com/node/20502). :-)\n\n"
