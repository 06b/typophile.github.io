  "content": "Hi there! I am not sure if I am in the right place, and if not, I apologize in advance. Its kind of an ID question, but the thing is, I am not even sure a typeface exists. I am looking for a typeface that looks like it was carved into a tree — as young lovers might do: “Robert [hearts] Betsy,” etc, … If you can help, that would be fantastic. Thanks so much!\n\n",

      "content": "Bethany, I would suggest not so much a font but a technique. Open Photoshop type some simple text or use a symbol (like a heart) and apply layer effects to create a cutout effect. Make the layer opacity 0% and you will have the layer effect with no fill. Find a tree image and apply.\n\n"
