To utilize this function, you must have the Flash 8 player installed. If you have an image to accompany your post, please ensure that it conforms to the following guidelines: do not exceed 600 px wide, save images as an RGB jpg/gif/png (tips: gifs are usually crisper for black and white type renderings and not all browsers support png). Also, make sure that your image has a unique name, otherwise typophile may call another image instead of the one you inteded to be displayed._\n\n"
