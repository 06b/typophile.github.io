Is there another way I get those characters to show up?\n\nThanks!  \nShana\n\n [‹ Typefaces with a system?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121060725/http:/typophile.com/node/20606 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Poliphilus and Blado: Survival of the Fattest? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121060725/http:/typophile.com/node/20604 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
