The font on the emblem on the inside of the car (quite possibly the same font, but kerned out a bit and used in small caps) seems more luxurious and a bit more suitable for such an application. I think the typography in the second image applied to the first would have been a much nicer treatment for the emblem design of a $50k car.\n\nIMHO.\n\n/mattjohn\n\n"

      "content": "What appears inside the car is the logo and logotype for the golf course and resort. Something that was probably not designed to be used as a special edition luxury car logo, but instead to evoke certain emotions related to the golf course—which I think it does rather successfully. I'm guessing then that the exterior badge was intended to look similar to the Pebble Beach logotype, except they failed at that. If the exterior tag was properly set like the logotype, I'd have no real problem with it (typographically at least).\n\n"

Another door badge from another lexus is different. Looks like they are not even consistent with their mistakes. Still does not match Pebble Beach Resorts logo. The embroidery on the mats should have been done differently. Another \"fail\"\n\n"
