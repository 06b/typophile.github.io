  "content": "Hey, I’m looking for a couple of sans serif faces that are or have very black weights. I’m thinking as black as Underware’s recent (custom) Fat Ed, Fedra Sans Display 2, Amplitude Ultra weights, etc. They shouldn’t be too funky.\n\nI’m leaning towards Fedra Sans Display 2, but I would like to look at other typefaces before I decide anything. Thanks in advance. :)\n\n [‹ (x) Serif face on AMD.com website - Alexandra {Justin}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081211152409/http:/typophile.com/node/34510 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) FinanceBox serif logo - Palatino {Marc O} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081211152409/http:/typophile.com/node/34507 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Or... ’optimistic’, so to speak. It’s for a poetrybook cover, and most poems have a slight dark undertone. I would like to give it a bold type treatment.\n\n"
