  "content": "Greetings for All Developing Typophiles  \nArabs unnecessarily do place Zamma before every Waw, Fatha before every Alif and Kasra before every Ya. And they use both tooth-like hamza + mark on or below Alif Though the mark alone indicates Hamza.  \nI have been battling the web so that Arab make the change, but the only answer I get is:  \nOur Fathers were on a course, and we are have to follow their footsteps?\n\nNow, it is the turn to the latin-oriented.  \nTriggered by the still-hot topic [Do ligatures improve readability?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016222945/http:/typophile.com/node/28777) that I have been monitoring from the very beginning, I would like to ask:  \nWhy is there a dot on i and j? Why not dotless and why not using one dot for ï..?  \nAt least the “fi” problem (if any) is half-solved?! Do dots improve readability? Any other reason?  \nThinking Aloud, Allowed?!\n\n [‹ COOL typography websites](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016222945/http:/typophile.com/node/531 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Best Font Sample Book creator ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016222945/http:/typophile.com/node/17721 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This evolved into the dot. The j was originally just a swashed i at the beginning of words. It was adopted in languages other than Latin, such as English, for a different sound than the i, and so became a separate letter.\n\n"
