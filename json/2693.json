It doesn't seem to affect anything, nor on screen or print, so I'm not sure what it means, but nonetheless it's a bit annoying:   \n   \nCould not embed font (FONT NAME). Protected fonts can not be embeded.   \n   \nI'm using Fontographer 4.14, and Illustrator 9 for PC.\n\n",

      "content": "The problem is that your fonts have a font embedding setting that is either nonsense/garbage or says they can't be embedded.   \n   \nMy first recommendation would be to get a real font editor, like FontLab, TypeTool or FontMaster. Fontographer hasn't been updated in about 7 years, so there's not much hope they'll fix this.   \n   \nFailing that, do a search on Macromedia's web site for a tech doc on font embedding settings. On the Mac version of Fontographer there is some sort of hack to fix this, and presumably there is on Windows as well.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

You can edit all \"font info\" with it and also change the level of embedding.   \n   \nHere's the link   \n   \n [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/property/property.htm?fname=%20&fsize=](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421064256/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/property/property.htm?fname=%20&fsize=)   \n   \nThere is also a tech doc on the macromedia website, but it tells you merely to use the tool from MS.   \n   \nServus   \n   \nDominik\n\n"
