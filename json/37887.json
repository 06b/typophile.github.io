  "content": "I've been using Gill Sans ultra bold lately.  \nI admire its peculiar aspect, founding it very legible in spite of its extraordinary weight. I am pretty sure Eric Gill took great fun in drawing some letters… do you agree?  \nI noticed a curious thing: the exclamation mark is made of a single form, the stem actually touching the dot.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131204204054im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gill-Sans-Std-Ultra-Bold_5231.gif)\n\nHas anyone in mind other fonts in which the exclamation mark is made of a single shape? I'm very curious about this.\n\n",
