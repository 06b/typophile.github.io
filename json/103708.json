It has a vintage industrial feel, yet I'm almost certain it was a tad modified to give it a worn look. Feedback and help is highly appreciated, thank you.\n\n",

But I doubt he'll answer as type choice is a main part of his design process...  \nI guess I could find more similars if you still need more options.\n\n"

I'm going to see if I can find other similar type faces to compare to United. I like that the typeface used by Beasley is not tall, but a tad short and compact.\n\n"

I guess you could find the right one for your project. I'll try today to help the cause posting some alternatives to United but remember they're not it. 2 at the moment: [Liberator](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115032/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=liberator) and [Haymaker](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115032/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=haymaker)\n\n"

      "content": "Ryuk, thank you for the information and your help. I think I will stick with United. I have Haymaker but don't care for the spurs (I think that's what they're called). I don't want to modify it either, but Liberator looks nice and I may consider it for future use.\n\nSide note: Do you know of a type face close to the one featured here: [http://jenbpeters.com/Billabong](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115032/http:/jenbpeters.com/Billabong \"http://jenbpeters.com/Billabong\")  \nIs it custom/hand drawn or a commercial font? I'm interested in that for a side project, just unsure of the name. I may email a request to the designer, but thought I'd ask here first.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n"

A long while back I was looking for one that Oakley was using on some campaigns and I think it was a custom handwritten font, possibly.\n\n"
