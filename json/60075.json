  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am working on logos (long and abbreviated) for my new website. The website is pixelsift.com. There isn't anything there right now (I'm looking to settle on a logo to move forward with the site design) but I would like to put my portfolio together. The website is meant to promote my work as a freelance web developer/designer and I prefer a clean, professional look.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201030059im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logos_4865.png)\n\nAny comments or criticisms would be appreciated. The logos in the right column differ subtly from those in the left in that the pixels have slightly rounded corners. What do you think?\n\nThanks,  \nDavid\n\n",

      "content": "Agree with Bert on that. Not sure what the box/colors add to your concept, except make this look like FontShop. Consider a version that becomes more pixelated, perhaps it becomes more pixelated top to bottom? Also, the pixel grid is not really a grid, which is making the curves look strange. On one hand smoother, but at small size/ low resolution, it looks odd to me. Maybe if they were dots it would be less noticeable?\n\n"
