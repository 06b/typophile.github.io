  "content": "Hi.  \nIm not very experienced in font building, and hope on somebodies help.  \nThe goal was to prepare national (abkhazinan)fonts based on modern technological principles - Unicode and Open Type. So I make a font and indicates all glyphs according their unicode indexes (abkhazian characters are part of cyrrilic coderange and complitely regestered in Basic Multilingual Plan of Unicode Concorcium). After generating font file and installing in Windows XP system (I use MKLC for national keyboard layout) almost everything is OK in MS Office - I can see and type all abkhazian characters but when I use Photoshop or Illustrator or Corel Draw I can type only cyrillic characters and one more abkhazian letter Dje (040F, 045F) which is ocasionaly the part of 1251 cyrillic codepage.  \nThe same situation win Adobe CS applications but I dont use CS2.  \nWhy.  \nThanks, Akhra.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi, Si.  \nTahoma like Palatino has some characters which used in abkhazian but not all.  \nAnyway, when I type that (Tahoma abkhaz) characters in Word 2003 everything is OK, but when I try to do so in Photoshop CS I see only ? marks. But when I insert same Tahoma or Palatino characters from character table they work in Photoshop.  \nBy the way I prepare abkhaz keyboard layout using Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator.\n\nThanks, Akhra\n\n"
