  "content": "Hi there  \nI’m trying to make a a MM font in Fontlab 5. I have one weight axis. I build the MM I’m working on from two endpoints, a thin and a black. The problem is that if I now try to delete a glyph, say the black ’m’, and then paste a replacement in it’s place, Fontlab replaces both the thin and the black ’m’. I can’t find any mention of that in the manual – is it impossible to do?\n\nAnother thing is the kerning. How can I (can I at all?) import metrics and kerning from other files into the MM font? I’m using identical kerning classes in the thin and the black, but I would like to take the metrics and kerning from the two start designs, thin and black, and put them in the MM version. How to do?\n\n [‹ Missing kerning in Multiple Master / Fontlab](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219010018/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34256 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontLab Error: invalid first character in name (text was \".null\") ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219010018/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34230 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Normally I copy the new glyph to the mask and move the points of the Master to align with the mask.  \nOR  \nmaking to single master fonts and blend them and copy the glyph to the original MM font.\n\nif you import metrics in the metrics window, they apply the the selected master. So you can select the Thin master, import the thin afm file, switch to Black and import the black afm file.\n\nGeorg\n\n[www.reets.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219010018/http:/www.reets.de/ \"www.reets.de\")  \n [www.schriftgestaltung.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219010018/http:/www.schriftgestaltung.de/ \"www.schriftgestaltung.de\")\n\n"
