      "content": "Lovely typeface, i love the details in the symbols. Very interesting business model. It's like a mix between a donation only model and a service plan model. There is some kind of reward for those who pay the 50 or 100 dollars, like in Kickstarter?\n\nI think is very difficult to pay more for the same product i can get with much less money ($100 vs $8). But if I could get an extra value (like T-Shirt or a specimen book) I really would like to pay more money.\n\n"
