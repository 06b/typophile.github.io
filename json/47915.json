You can go to the Adobe web store, find the specific family, and there’s a downloadable PDF right there.\n\nFor example, [http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1737.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081021154326/http:/store1.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1737.pdf \"http://store1.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1737.pdf\")\n\nI’ve been working on rationalizing and extending Adobe’s various extended Latin character sets, and will be publishing some “final draft” specs later this month on my blog, for review and comment.\n\nIn Adobe’s nomenclature, a western font with “Pro” in the name does have a certain minimum language coverage. See: [http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/info/charsets.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081021154326/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/info/charsets.html \"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/info/charsets.html\")\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
