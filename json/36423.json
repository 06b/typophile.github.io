Most faces I see in this category, regardless of how new they are, scream of some past era, usually in the vein of late 70s-early 80s arcade cabinet letting.\n\nThere’s something about the dots on i and ! that distract me every time I see this face. I don’t see a similar juxtaposition of squared and rounded corners in the letters, so I just can’t keep my eyes off of the dots. In the second same, the strings of majuscules without round corners look like they’re part of a different font than the minuscules. Being really nitpicky, the horizontal part of the counter in e looks wider than all of the other counters, which appear to be the same size.\n\n"

      "content": "Fat Squeeze looks pretty well thought out. The y is an especially nice (and unique) touch for this genre. The left side join looks a little week though. maybe a more abrupt curve in to add weight? The W used he same solution, but less succesfully for me. What if the two counters angled the same way instead of both pulling to the center (more like 2 V's)?\n\nThe dot on the i and explamation seems out of place. Seems like it should be either a rectangular, or rounded rectangular, or fully rounded.\n\nI also wonder if the cap height shouldn't be the same as the assenders for something like this which will be used 100% (hopefully) in display settings. I'd lower the ascenders rather than raising the caps.\n\nThe trouble with dense and tight fonts like this (to me at least) is the varying density inherent in roman letters. Some letters present a very dense presence like the HIME, but letters like T and L break that up and look weak. It's a constant battle between desity and conistency.\n\nWhat do the A. Xx and Jj look like?\n\nRandy\n\n"

They have been denuded of some small details that would help you to identify glyphs more rapidly despite heir enormous girth. Let begin with a positive example : the lc t retains it's tail. That makes the letter for me. The z too has great detail & feeling. But the lc a in contrast seems to me to be in need of a notch cut out of it so it can have a tail again too. Similar things might be done to the u & n. It may be that this kind of thing is besides the point or takes you in a direction you don't want; in which case that's fine. But that's what occurs to me. Add in some small identifying detail to joust with the mechanical/modular heaviness.\n\n"

The K isn't bad, but isn't as great as the others. The M looks awkward. I think part of the problem is that the middle stroke is thicker than the two outside ones. Maybe try making this thinner, rather than thicker, if you haven't already tried this. The N doesn't work, whereas the Z does. As Tiffany said, maybe with shorter cut in strokes?\n\nHave you considered also rounding the outside corners of the spurs on the EFT? The top inside corners on the M?\n\nThe 1 needs a new solution; it looks out of place. Should the right stroke on the 4 go to the top? Should the spur on the 7 be bigger?\n\nGreat Work!\n\n"

Much of the lower case (see i m q r h, etc.) has this theme of a curve corner and a sharp corner.  \nThis was my building concept, mixing soft and hard with very linear counters the sharpest feature.

But I still worry about those diagonal cuts on the new M's and N being a little out of character with the rest of the face, and thus distracting.\n\nI would try thinning the diagonal of the N and having no cut, and thinning the middle stroke of the original M--you'd probably have to adjust the depth of the 'v' cut at the top, too. Another way would be to go with #2 and shorten the diagonal cuts in both. Wow, the M and N are tough!\n\nRandy's y idea is a definite improvement.
