It resembles [T-26 Flux](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124531/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/flux/) and also their [Leger](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124531/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/leger/), but neither is exactly right. It also resembles DIN, but the stemless bowl on Telenor's 'b' does not match.   \n   \nIt seems to be a Sans I have not catalogued, so I'm curious about it too.\n\n"
