What's \"blueberry\" in Hungarian?   \n   \nIn terms of texture, it's jumpy - but that's to be expected - it's a natural part of the design - just tighten it up though, it might make it all suddenly take hold.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

That way, at least in the specimen where the i and j are next to each other, the \"leftmost\" stem is tapered, and the \"other\" stem is flat. I hope that makes sense.)\n\n"
