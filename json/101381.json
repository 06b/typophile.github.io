So you can export the AFM for a font, generate a \\*.fea file and import that back into your font development software. It's Windows only at the moment, but I have plans to make it available as a web-based tool as well.\n\nPlease let me know if you encounter any issues with this release or have any other feedback. Thanks!\n\n-t\n\n",
