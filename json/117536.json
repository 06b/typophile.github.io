  "content": "Looking for a place to stay in DC, preferably from Tuesday the 29th thru Sunday the 3rd. I'm a student, light traveler, and Couchsurfing friendly. My budget's not high, so couchsurfing is preferred, but I might be able to split a hotel room for a few days if necessary.\n\nHere's my couchsurfing profile, if you'd more info about me: [https://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=YJQ60P5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114604/https:/www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=YJQ60P5 \"https://www.couchsurfing.org/profile.html?id=YJQ60P5\")\n\n",

Long story why it ended up that way. Anyway if you chip in $75 per night for whichever of those four nights you'd like, I'm game. It's not cheap like couchsurfing, but the comfort and convenience of being _right there_ is hard to overstate.\n\nhhp\n\n"
