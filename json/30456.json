I already have Silentina, which is rather different from what I'm looking for, and which came into heavy use with all studios in the mid-to-late '20s.\n\nThanks for pointing me to Eutheric Bold. It is sorta close; kinda reminds me of a cross between bookman and silentina. It's possible if I try using Eutheric Bold and stretching it a wee bit I might get close.\n\nAnyone else have some suggestions to match the typeface I'm looking for would be much appreciated.\n\nBen\n\n"

There's also Fleisch & apostrophe's [Colwell](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019193025/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/lab_colwell.htm) from her earlier (1916) work - but that's even further afield from the type sought.\n\nThanks, Mark, for catching this ID.\n\nOh, and props to [Ray Larabie](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019193025/http:/www.typodermic.com/) for the nice work on Silentina. Mark, perhaps you could answer a question about the Silentina pair that's been nagging at me. I've got a 1925 BB&S Catalog, so I know that Silentina Movie, including the alternates, was made from Pastel. Any idea where Silentina Film's different capitals come from?\n\n"

It turned out to be Pastel, but in some of the samples he had, the caps looked more like Della Robbia.\n\nI did a rough digitization of Pastel for him, but he really wanted the other caps. I said I would see what I could do, but got too busy with other projects and I ended up never finishing it.\n\nFast-forward two years and Ray Larabie releases Silentina. It turns out that Rodney gave up waiting for me and went to Ray. In the end I think Ray did a decent job of it and I tip my hat to him.\n\n"
