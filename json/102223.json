      "content": "This is a designed logotype either based on [Akkurat](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107224313/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/), [Neuzeit S](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107224313/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neuzeit-s/neuzeits-bookheavy/) or Helvetica Neue. If it is Helvetica, the designer compressed the lowercase e’s slightly and corrected the s shape. But I think the letters s, e and r fit with Akkurat. The dots on the i were drawn and the letter t was modified to fit with the design.\n\n"
