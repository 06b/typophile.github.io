Well designed manuals would be appreciated by your customers and would reflect well on your company.\n\n"

And if your software will allow this type of font. (Madcap Flare does not work with OpenType Postscript flavor fonts.)\n\nWhat software are you using and what outputs do you envision?\n\n"

To name three: [Linux Libertine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416052748/http:/www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=1&L=1), [TeX Gyre Schola](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416052748/http:/www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/schola/index_html) (a version of Century Schoolbook), or [Bitstream Charter](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416052748/http:/www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/charter/). I imagine any one of those would do well.\n\nGeorgia might work well too, although if your manual makes heavy use of tabular numbers you might find the old-style figures awkward.
