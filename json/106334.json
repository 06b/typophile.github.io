  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nWe are happy to release our latest typeface, we hope you like it.  \nBaton is a sans serif typeface with narrow proportions combining eccentric shapes inspired by french vernacular typography with the simplicity of modern sans serifs. Peculiar details and a low contrast make the design slightly strange yet elegant, but it is the exaggerated high and low midline in the uppercase and the small x-height which give Baton its distinctive flair. Relatively wider and more toned down, the lowercase allow Baton to function not only as a display typeface, but also for short texts such as leads in magazine.  \nBaton comes in 10 styles with an extended language support and a wide range of OpenType features such as ligatures, alternate letters, tabular and lowercase figures, fractions, and a stylistic set of uppercase with thin accents for headlines with tight leading.  \nDesigned by Yassin Baggar and Anton Koovit. Originally commissioned by Yorgo Tloupas and Paul Chemetoff for the redesign of GQ France magazine.\n\nBaton is available exclusively at [www.fatype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916/http:/www.fatype.com/ \"www.fatype.com\")  \nYou can get the free trial fonts from our homepage (Try button) and test the typeface directly in your design.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_1.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_2.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_3.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_4.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_5.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_6.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_7.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_8.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_9.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_10.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_11.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_12.jpg)  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043916im_/http:/www.fatype.com/img/fonts/Baton_13.jpg)\n\n",
