  "content": "Hello Everybody,\n\nFirst of all, I apologize in advance if this is an inappropriate post on this board. I don't know where else to find a designer of such high caliber as the ones on this forum. (If I should be posting this elsewhere, just let me know.)\n\nI have a great illustration/caricature that was professionally created. I had it made so I could use it as part of a logo. Problem is, I don't have a font to go with the illustration.\n\nSo I need someone to give me some ideas on different font styles/samples that would be congruent with the \"theme\" of the illustration and what the company does, as well as complete the logo. Also, I presume the blending of the company name with the illustration will require some sort of additional visual element -- maybe a colored background, screen, border, etc. Basically, I need you to take the illustration and seamlessly weld the name of the company to create the logo.\n\nOf course, I will pay for your services.\n\nIf you would like to respond to this post privately, please email me at: [naesquire@aol.com](mailto:naesquire@aol.com).\n\nOnce you respond, I will give you further details and show you the illustration.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNader\n\n",
