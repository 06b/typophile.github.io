  "content": "So, I keep seeing different price notations on posters at the metro stations and they often frustrate me. Now I just want to verify that there is logic behind my frustrations, in that I want to verify whether the other notations are simply incorrect or perhaps the rules to the notations differ per country, but I suppose all the same I shouldn't be seeing different notations in the same country. Here's an image to illustrate the different things I've seen:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414191046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Price%20notation_5993.jpg)\n\nThe first notation frustrates me because a hyphen is used, the second frustrates me even more because the hyphen is spaced in such a way that from a distance it looks like a semicolon; the third is correct and the fourth frustrates me because I just don't understand why the dash needs to be spaced over the comma. I suppose it's not necessarily a rational objection but an emotional one.\n\n",

      "content": "Maybe it's an issue of not understanding the history of the notation? As a child, it took me ages to realise that the Swedish equivalent of this (75:–) was a shorthand for 75:00, and I'm guessing it's even more opaque now that the subdivisions of the krona no longer come in coins.\n\nAm I wrong to think it's sort of exciting, the different variants? Hand drawn shorthands are, after all, the source of a lot of interesting symbols, not least the amersand; I can well imagine the last variant turning into a ligature at some point, especially as subdivisions grow rarer with inflation.\n\n"

      "content": "Traditionally, an em dash (or two en dashes) was used to replace zeros in printed price lists:  \n10,— for 10,00  \n—,90 for&nbsp; 0,90  \nIn metal fonts, (tabular) figures typically were half an em in width.\n\nJürgen is right in that the modern (German) practice uses en dashes. Price notation styles are different from country to country, though.
