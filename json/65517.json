I'm taking about scripts with swishy swash script caps where words in all caps will look terrible anyway. Right sidebearings are easy to do because they can be tested against lowercase in words. But what about the left?\n\nIn the past I've used sentence endings to gauge the spacing. For example:\n\nYeah. Apes attacked.\n\nI adjust the left sidebearing on the A so the word space after the period feels right. Whaddya think?\n\n",
