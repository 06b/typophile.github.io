[Antique Condensed Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009103200/http:/www.woodentypefonts.com/Pages/antcb.html) is pretty much spot on. Are you also looking for digital alternatives? Fontbureau has an [Antique Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009103200/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AntiqueCondensed), [Wooden Type Font’s version](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009103200/http:/www.fonthaus.com/fonts/woodentype/antique/wo10100) is quirkier.  \nF\n\n"
