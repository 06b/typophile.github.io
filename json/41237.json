  "content": "I am the typographer who came in from the cold (forum member for almost six years).\n\nI work at a church where Giovanni is used for most communications, and so I'm tied to using it or something that complements it.\n\nI'm tempted just to go with Myriad – it was designed by the same typographer, and I have it installed. But it strikes me as too easy. In the past I've seen Myriad overused not because it's a fantastic face (it is) but because it's packaged with Adobe software.\n\nShould I just quit complaining and go with Myriad or go with something more interesting (like Cronos, also by Slimbach). It's quite touchy-feely, which I think works well for a church.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
