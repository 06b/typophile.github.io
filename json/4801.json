Closest fonts I know are [Frieze](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115073930/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/club_21/frieze_ot/) and [Sassoon Dotted](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115073930/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/sassoon_infant_by_linotype_dotted/), but these don't have the rigid structure of the Care logo. If you want a similar look, I'd follow the midline of a linear serif with dots.\n\n"
