I even went to the PSYOPS site yesterday...   \n   \nAnother thing Yves, there was once a link to a font/foundry that wasn't available for sale (I think the authors are on these foruns too). Can't find the link on my bookmarks... The name of the font is \"something\" sans ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000809im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) There was even a topic where someone refered to it as NOT AGAIN.

My memory holes are strange I know.   \n   \nThe topic on typophile was a font id where that fonts was sugested but the \"author\" replied that only 2 or 3 persons had it and no way it was used. It's not Beta Sans also.\n\n"
