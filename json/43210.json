During this year I’ll be making various stuff for them like a calendar, website, posters and a magazine.\n\nSo I need to find a serif companion to use in the magazine and on the posters to get some variation.\n\nAny and all suggestions appreciated  \nPeter\n\n [‹ New typophile web design awful!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031522/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43762 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [guilty simpson hip hop video ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031522/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43782 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There are lost of resources where you can see typefaces in action. Just hold your sample of Dax Wide next to those — see if you like it and you’re all set. Right?\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

      "content": "Being a kind of indeterminate round/square face, Dax will mix well with other faces that have that quality.  \nFor instance, in a headline type, something with slightly smoothed corners might be interesting.\n\nAnother thought: the “Venetian” angle of the crossbar in e suggests that Dax might pair well with Giovanni (which also has similar “ascenders taller than caps”), or my own [Goodchild.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907031522/http:/www.shinntype.com/goodchild.html)\n\nDax’s extremely short capitals suggest using another face with drastic short capitals, e.g. something by Les Usherwood such as Leawood.\n\nThe trick is to identify thematic features of the typeface and, as Bert suggests, look through type catalogues, or the FontBook, to find other faces with similar qualities.\n\n"

I just wanted some suggestions, you never know, someone here might have found something that works great with Dax Wide.\n\nThe problem is going to try and convince them to buy a specific font. They do have a budget but we haven’t discussed that part yet.\n\npeter\n\n"
