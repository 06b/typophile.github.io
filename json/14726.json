I have no image of it and I have seen the character N only so short that I was not able to determine if it was the font I was looking for. Before my TV-network put on the commercials at the end of the show I have seen a glimps of the credits and that looked the same, but slightly more ‘ellegant’ than the one I need…  \nAll help is still welcome.\n\n"
