Like that double l in 'Will'. It's like the music stopped. :-(\n\nMaybe scripting for Contextual alteration for 2nd & 3rd duplicate letters is what's needed. Now that would be Super Sweet!\n\nI like your 'n' But your should be more different from it I think. I am not loving the 'r'. Maybe pitch the arm higher and start it lower.\n\n"

Or maybe ( I am crossing my fingers for ya here) if a foundry picks it up they could handle it. BTW the old fontopgrapher or the new one re-released by fontlab? In any event, the thing to do is to take as far as you can before you take that step. If you get utterly stuck & want to do it I might be able to help.\n\n"
