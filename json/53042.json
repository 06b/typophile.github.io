There are a number of differences, and in the main they are down to me aiming for this to be a contemporary typeface, rather than a 70s throw-back.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011113610im_/http:/typophile.com/files/london1970_5025.jpg)\n\nIt is actually only the lower-case that are really similar, I aim for my upper-case set to be much more angular.
