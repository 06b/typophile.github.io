  "content": "Hi. Computer Modern may not be typographically perfect, but it's a good font for displaying maths (and has the most extensive support for LaTeX, as far as I know). For text, it's not the best choice, in my view. I think that Sabon (I'm using the Monotype version) is a good font to be used together with Computer Modern for math content. (Garamond is too \"round\", in my opinion, although I would prefer it - Garamond Stempel - for text without math content. Note: For texts that need a more personal style, I'd use other fonts, however.) What do you think about the choice?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cmr-sabon-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001947/http:/typophile.com/files/cmr-sabon-1.jpg) | 54.32 KB |\n\n",

Namely, a ‘Garamond’ that is based on the work of Jean Jannon, such as Monotype _‘Garamond’_ or Simonicini _‘Garamond’?_\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SimoniciniGaramond_ComputerModern_5803.png)\n\nFinally, have you considering using Hermann Zapf's _Euler_? That would allow you to select among Zapf's other designs, such as _Aldus_ or _Palatino,_ for a companion face.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120416001947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Zaph-Aldus-Euler_specimen_5220.png)\n\nThe glyph coverage of Euler might not be as large as Computer Modern, but it is an eminently more handsome face.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for your advice, Christopher! Your observation on Computer Modern not sitting well with any other font is quite to the point. If the CM parts would not be limited to single letters, this would be probably an unsolvable problem.\n\nSimoncini Garamond and Computer Modern looks like a reasonable combination, I'll check that out. (There might be problems with the relative weight of the fonts, difficult to say by just looking at the screen images.)\n\nGaramond Monotype is too \"lively\" (too much difference in stroke widths, I guess, but I'm not familiar with how to verbalize the technical details). Aldus and Palatino have the same problem. (If you have too write rather ugly prose, and math-related texts tend not to allow excessive creativity, a lively font contrasts too much with the dry nature of the content.)\n\nAs for the Euler math fonts, the glyph coverage (extensible math characters, specialized symbols) is not as comprehensive as for the Computer Modern, so it would be a risky choice.\n\nPlantagenet is a very interesting font, but much too heavy for Computer Modern, as far as I can see.\n\n"

It's possible to use a different font for titles, of course.

Zapf International's serifs probably don't fit well with CM, but the font is a very interesting combination of \"calm\" and \"lively\" elements.\n\nI have to do some other stuff at the moment, so I'll come back to this later.

The difference in weight between Computer Modern and almost anything else is just too jarring to me. Of course, a beautiful mathematician once said to me, \"Oh, Computer Modern---it's so spindly.\" After that, I could never go back.\n\nPersonally, I like looking at the Palatino/Euler pairing, especially for dry mathematics, but it is a bit informal-looking. The Minion packages look very nice to me.\n\nst\n\n"
