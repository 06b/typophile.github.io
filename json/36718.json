      "content": "I interview designers regularly. I look for a few things.\n\nFirst, they need to be able to do great work. Even if you are just out of school - we don’t expect you to be at your peak, but we need to see great problem solving skills, strong typography skills ..etc. All the building blocks necessary for you to grow into a great designer.\n\nSecond, we look for people that will fit our culture. We like intelligent, productive and talented designers who have a nice dose of humility. We don’t care too much for egos and arrogance. We are all proud of the work we do and we know we do good work. But, we are good people and we like to keep it that way.\n\nThird, we look for people who understand the business side of what we are doing. Many designers are just looking to design, but they have no idea how they fit into the over scheme of the biz - what they cost the business and what kind of value they need to create for the business to continue and to justify their salary.\n\nA designer who exhibits the above traits will get a job with us every time. In fact, I’ll make room for them, because they are a great investment and I would not want them to end-up down the street with my competition.\n\nHope this is helpful.\n\n—  \nMike\n\n"

If you invite someone out for lunch or dinner to pick their brain, remember to pay the bill. Don’t even suggest you split it.\n\nDo not get the reputation as someone who never pays for anything. Believe me, people may not remember all the times you pick up the tab, but they do remember the people who NEVER pick up the tab.\n\n"
