For instance, given an output device with 3000 dpi resolution (typical high resolution), a 10-inch tall character would be rasterized to no more than 30,000 pixels, less than 1/20th of the available resolution in your font. You would not reach a one-to-one ratio until the character was over 20 inches tall. Go ahead and use 610,000 if you can, but 30,000 will probably be enough, and well within FontLab’s limits. I seriously doubt whether the difference will be visible, or even measurable, on typical output devices.\n\n"
