  "content": "Ek Type is a collective of type designers focused on designing contemporary Indian Typefaces.\n\nEk Type is a collaborative type foundry based in India that specializes in developing fonts across Indian languages, many of which will be multi-script. Giving adequate importance to script grammar and script tradition, it produces standardized and compatible fonts in multiple weights, supporting all platforms for print and screen.\n\nEk Type comprises of experienced type designers, researchers and academicians spanning a wide age group with different skill sets which help complement each other. Apart from developing and selling fonts, Ek Type will create documentation and awareness about Indian typography. In addition to this, it will mentor upcoming type designers by engaging with them in the process of design development and providing a platform to showcase their work.\n\nIn several Indian languages, ‘Ek’ is synonymous to 'one'. Ek type exemplifies what it means by providing a roof, under 'one' umbrella and serving as an open collaborative platform to develop and sell fonts, inviting others to be a part of it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ek%20Type%20Logo_5471.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ek Type Logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Ek%20Type%20Logo.png) | 8.87 KB |\n| [Ek Latin.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Ek%20Latin.png) | 35.06 KB |\n| [Ek Devanagari.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Ek%20Devanagari.png) | 31.85 KB |\n| [Ek Gujarati.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Ek%20Gujarati.png) | 34.42 KB |\n| [Painter Suhail.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Painter%20Suhail_0.png) | 402.34 KB |\n| [Painter Kafeel.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Painter%20Kafeel.png) | 181.91 KB |\n| [Ektype.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070344/http:/typophile.com/files/Ektype.png) | 16.94 KB |\n\n",
