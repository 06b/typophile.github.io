One of the hits came back from the [ABAA (Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023171320/http:/search.abaa.org/dbp2/catalogues.php?catnr=2266&membernr=1608) and I suddenly found myself thinking about my checking account. Sheesh! Temptation at this hour is not such a good thing.\n\nIf anyone _does_ happen to remember the name of the bookseller, please tell me as I'm really struggling to remember.\n\n",
