Inspired by the work of Argentinean writer Roberto Arlt, it is a contemporary, versatile and expressive family of types in 25 different styles for text, display and decorative use. Arlt has the advantages of OpenType technology such as style alternates, ligatures, and all sets of figures. Due to both its comfortable readability and the ’spicy’ atmosphere that it gains in text, Arlt is ideal for composing literature.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ArltE1_3686.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ArltE2_4994.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ArltE3_5516.jpg)\n\n",
