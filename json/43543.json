Isn't it two-storeyed in Gill Sans? The numeral '1' also looks wrong.\n\n(Edit: Just managed to find a sample of Gill Sans Schoolbook. The 'a' and '1' are indeed correct.

But i might be wrong.\n\nI think the lc a is slightly different, so this is most likely an altered version of the original Gill Sans.\n\n@SuperUltraFabulous: [http://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/fyti/typography+for+children.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030072242/http:/www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/fyti/typography+for+children.htm \"http://www.fonts.com/aboutfonts/articles/fyti/typography+for+children.htm\")\n\n(e.g. AG Schulbuch / Schoolbook wd be another “infant font”)\n\nCheers,  \nGünni G.\n\n"
