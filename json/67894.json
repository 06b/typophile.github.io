On March 1, we will publish all of them.\n\nMarch 1 – March 15 – submit the Letter B. On March 16, we will publish all of them.\n\nAnd we’ll continue posting the dates as we progress.\n\nGUIDELINES\n\n• Submit a 600 pixel wide file (flattened, jpg, tif, gif) to lettercult [at](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414150048/http:/typophile.com/wiki/at) gmail.com. You can also upload to the Alphabattle Flickr 2.0 group. And while you’re at it, you can upload your letters to Nate’s LetterPlayground.\n\n• Include a link to your site, if you’d like us to link.\n\n• One submission per person per letter.\n\n• You can make your letters however you choose, with one exception: Don’t use a font as a starting point…this is a site about letters you build from scratch. (wink)\n\n• Keep it safe for work.\n\n• Try to be original, in some way, shape, or form.\n\n• Have fun.\n\n• You can submit a letter after any deadline. We’ll still add it to the group.\n\n",

It hinted at black letter forms in my eyes, but retained strict geometry created by a grid of smaller shapes. The O could easily be 1 color, filled, but I liked seeing the different pieces make up the final form in an optical illusion of sorts.\n\n"
