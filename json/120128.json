  "content": "Firstly, I realise that this is an Arabic subforum. But, I cannot find an appropriate place to post this.\n\nI work with translators. There is a Punjabi poem that one wishes to be typeset in both the English translation and original Punjabi form (that is using Gurmukhi script). I would welcome any recommendations for any typefaces that cater to both conventional models and typesetting requirements of Gurmukhi script. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
