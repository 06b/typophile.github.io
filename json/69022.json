It looks like it has some echoes of Optima. Or was it a serif face once upon a time and has had the serifs sloughed off?\n\nNJ\n\n",

      "content": "Well, you said you thought it had echoes of Optima and I agree. To me it seems interesting how few stressed sans seem original. It's hard to fault Optima -- it's been around a long time and it is beautifully elegant -- but you would think more designers would tackle a new take on stressed sans faces. There must be more than I think, but offhand the only other similar style I can think of that I like a lot is Monotype's [Strayhorn](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320223116/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=243318&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=37056&query=STRAYHORN&SCOPE=Fonts) by Michael Harvey. I know it's a sans version of Ellington, but it's more than that in my opinion. Harvey shows wonderful skill with the letters, and I assume it comes from his stone cutting experience. At larger sizes (or in print), I think it's a beautiful typeface.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
