[Fresco 2 OT](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022083701/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fresco_2_ot/) ($210) includes roman and italic with small caps, and both lining and oldstyle figure sets for each. Add [Bold and Bold Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022083701/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fresco_4_ot/) for another $210 or get [all five weights](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022083701/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/ourtype/fresco_family_ot/) for $737.\n\n"
