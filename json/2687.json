Not exactly a unicase but still a font that let me play in big display words ... or better you can call it pure trendy, stilysh, etc...   \nI began with a few letters and I think that now I m almost satisfied with the result. That is why i put my font here, because you will destroy my illusions ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185759im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)))   \nSeriously, the idea is to complete a set with some more weights.   \nPlease feel free to help me to finish the work.   \nI know that some forms (Hrant pointed me) are more humanistics than the others but I m trying to equilibrate the situation and maybe it results in a strange mix way.   \nSorry for my poor english.\n\n<!--attachment: Kautiva-23961.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*7.4*Kautiva*Kautiva%2eswf --><!--attachment: Kautiva-23961.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*7.4*Kautiva*Kautiva%2eswf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185759im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">Kautiva<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131013185759/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Kautiva-23961.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Kautiva.swf</b></a> (7.4 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",

The mix of influences is well balanced and it gives a very lively appearance. I'd balance the lowercase s and add lowercase numerals, then re-check all the metrics, that's what comes to my mind, but in general it seems to work very good.\n\n"
