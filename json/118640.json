      "content": "Jared, I find the logo great and hope there is no intention to change it. You've done a good job! How long ago it was designed?  \nBecause of black and white colour, I think the red should stay somehow (twitter instead of temp?). It is more lively this way and adds a nice touch to the logo.  \nForgive my ignorance, but what is \"temp\"? Of course, I should have asked myself a long time ago this question!...  \nAnd Kevin, thanks for opening this topic. I thought the logo was custom made. I didn't know there is a whole font behind it, and a beautiful one, by the way!\n\n"
