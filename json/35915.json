  "content": "I recently started some projects for a company that until recently have been using a very cheap font (dont' remember the name, but I believe it was free) for most of their body copy. They use a lot of caps & numbers that look really bad because of the lack of small caps and proportional numbering in the cheap font.\n\nThey are technology/web based, so I'm looking for something modern looking, yet professional. I would prefer a sans serif, but I might be able to convince them into a semi-sans as long as it has that \"modern\" touch. Of course it would be nice to have small caps, and a large family to choose from.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions, I'm pretty much open to anything.\n\n",

I ask this because these are currently the only foundries/collections the owner knows of and already has a decent collection going.\n\n"

Klavika and Etelka do offer some of what Mike seems to be asking for: Modern.\n\nFor web use, Storm's Vida might be useful; it's made for low-res situations and has the square shapes that may telegraph \"modern\" to your client. Very large family with 3 widths and Mono versions.\n\nFor something more typographic (less screen-tuned) try the new Mundo Pro family. Good for all purposes, at all sizes.\n\n"
