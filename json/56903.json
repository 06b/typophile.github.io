I do recall Borges lapsing into a very old fashioned way of thinking when it came to nationality eg that he was willing to generalize, albeit in a witty way. Also, I think holding position seriously in this sense was maybe outside of his interests\\*. But people are sloppy and it could well be that it is not his or that a character of his says it.\n\nI don't have my Library here in Reading, and the Uni is closed for a while now, so finding those references is not going to happen quickly.\n\nFor example, \"Borges: I think that the meanings are more or less irrelevant. What is important, or the two important facts I should say, are emotion, and then words arising from emotion. I don't think you can write in an emotionless way. If you attempt it, the result is artificial. I don't like that kind of writing. I think that if a poem is really great, you should think of it as having written itself despite the author. It should flow.\" [http://www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107173636/http:/www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm \"http://www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm\")\n\n"

I’m only familiar with a handfull of his interviews._\n\nHey, guifa, Eben has provided a link to an interesting-looking interview (above):\n\n[http://www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107173636/http:/www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm \"http://www.wooster.edu/artfuldodge/interviews/borges.htm\")\n\nFor instance, at one point Borges says of Federico García Lorca, \"And then, it was a lucky think [sic] for him to be executed. Best thing to happen for a poet.\" A somewhat poor translation, but that quote is pure evil, and pure Georgie. ;-D\n\nBut also check out his comparison of languages:\n\n\"I don't think languages are essentially synonymous. In Spanish it is very difficult to make things flow, because words are over-long. But in English, you have light words. For example, if you say _slowly, quickly_, in English, what you hear is the meaningful part of the word: _slow-ly, quick-ly_. You hear _slow_ and _quick_. But in Spanish you say _lentamente, rapidamente_, and what you hear is the _-mente_. That is gratis, so to say. A friend of mine translated Shakespeare's sonnets into Spanish. I said that he needed two Spanish sonnets to a single English one, since English words are short and to the point, but Spanish words are over-long. And English also has a physical quality to it. Well, in English, you can say: _to explain away_. In Kipling's _Ballad of East and West_, an English officer is pursuing an Afgan horse thief. They're both on horseback. And Kipling writes: 'They have ridden the low moon out of the sky./ Their hooves drum up the dawn.' Now you can't _ride the low moon out of the sky_ in Spanish, and you can't _drum up the dawn_. It can't be done. Even such simple sentences as _he fell down_ or _he picked himself up_, you can't do in Spanish. You have to say _he got up the best he could_ or some lame paraphrase. But in English you can do much with verbs and positions. You can write: _dream away your life; live up to; something you have to live down_. Those things are impossible in Spanish. They cannot be done. Then you have compound words. For example you have _wordsmith_. It would be in Spanish _un herrero de palabras_, rather stilted, rather uncouth. But it can be done in German you can make up words all the time, but not in English. You are not allowed the freedom that the Anglo-Saxons had. For example, you have _sigefolc_, or _victorious people_. Now in Old English, you don't think of these words as being artificial, but in Spanish it can't be done. But of course, you have what I think is beautiful in Spanish: the sounds are very clear. But in English you have lost your open vowels.\"\n\n"
