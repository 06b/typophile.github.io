      "content": "At first glance it seems very close. Since the font design is pre-20th century, there is a high possibility it was DeVinne or a variation of it.\n\nUpdate: after researching a bit, I am even more conviced it is De Vinne, since Gustav Schroeder was born in Berlin (even though he worked in the USA while designing De Vinne), where Der Sturm was published, and the typeface was really popular at the end of the 19th century, which was \"the look\" Der Sturm was going for at the beggining of its' publication in 1910 (a regular newspaper, rather than a \"glossy\" art magazine).\n\nThank you very much, Ryuk.\n\n"
