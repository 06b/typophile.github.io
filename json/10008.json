      "content": "Much better. I prefer the top one now, as well. Tap the 'S' on each just a hair closer to the 'T', or loosen the space in the 'TAM' just a tad to compensate (this may be the best way). The rule when kerning is to find the most difficult spacing pair and match the rest to that. This is a minor thing, but will get exaggerated on signage.   \n   \nThe rule you're using is a bit heavy (1pt, right?) Maybe try a .5pt rule. But it may just be too much. See what happens. I agree with Daniel on font in the all caps version, too. The 'S' and 'T' are odd, which is why I prefer the top one now. The 'T' seems to stand too tall with its vertical serifs.   \n   \nAnother suggestion, which may or may not pan out: try using the small caps for the 'attorneys at law' with no full caps. Right now, I'm guessing that you're using the full caps version of the regular weight, and the forms are getting very thin. This isn't necessarily bad, but you might be able to get a sturdier logo with the SC and still preserve hierarchical contrast (you should track it slightly to compensate for the additional color from the heavier strokes). But, it could end up being too similar and look bad, or lose the fine, austere feeling.\n\n"

And although oldfashioned type can implay longevity and trustworthyness, I'm afraid this one is beyond that point and plain stale. Moreover the caps are almost twice the height of the small caps, which is visually disturbing to me. I think the \"ATTORNEYS etc\" has become too small in relation to the name and thus too light in color. In the all casp version the ampersand seems a little too light, in the small caps version the name looks a bit 'fat', unelegant, unclassical. I hope you understand this is all meant to get you ahead. Hopefully you can out it to good use...\n\n"

But I think that the second line needs a bit more letter spacing. You could also try other Caslons, if you have any.   \n   \nDiederik, American design is much more \"traditional\" that contemporary European typography. I once did a logo for a DC firm, and really, really tried to get them to sign off on Mrs. Eaves or Matrix Script Inline. I will never try that again.   \n   \nThe dashes in Attorneys-at-Law do not bother me. In fact, I think that they might \"belong\" to real legalese. My father is a lawyer, and his business card (not designed by me) has the title written out \"ATTORNEY-AT-LAW\"   \n   \nI admit that Daniel's color suggestion is spot on.
