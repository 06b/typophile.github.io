But that is because we are trained to look for them, just as typewriter quotes bother us, and slow down our reading. But to most people, these typographic niceties are not recognized, and would not cause them to \"stop short.\"\n\nI see it as a case, like so many other things, where good typography can give good color to a page, and that can improve reading. Will Harris makes some good points in his article (linked above). I will insist that good color does improve readibility, at least until someone shows me a study that refutes it.\n\nBad color ... the worst case being the use of bold words sprinkled within text ... means that the eye is attracted to the (bold) words, breaking the normal flow of the text. This has to decrease readability as the eye is jumping about unnecessarily.\n\nLining figures, fake small caps, full cap acronyms, and other bumps in the road to good color will all do the same thing, although not as badly as bold text.\n\n"

It might be hard to make a blanket statement about ligatures without measuring the difference between the good ones and the not-so-good ones.  \nThe main job of the lig is to avoid the crash and the hole. To me, it makes sense that a crash and a hole can cause a brief moment to sort out slowing down the reading a tiny amount. Context solves most of it but I find when I am looking at text in a foreign language, the absence of ligs seems most jarring--I have no context to help me there.  \nThe other issue is with typography that is readable enough as words and language but whose meaning becomes enhanced by typographic effects including ligatures. This is probably not the case for emersive reading but might hold true for the things we might dwell over reading a bit longer--covers, ads, menus, art books, display material...\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Ideally the two should be married & if you listen to some beauty should precede or fuction should as they prefer. But my question is how did you come to decide this. That is what I mean by basis. You can still count me as sympathetic just skeptical of either point of view having been made in a some kind of solid way.\n\n\"The other difficulty is that some sets of ligs are done better than...\" Chris that's a very good point and while it clouds the issue somewhat - that's just too frickin' bad. That's reality!\n\nActually the only really strong arguement I have heard so far against ligatures is that they can make spacing look odd when the basic letter spacing is screwed with. This is Will Harris' aregument. See the link above. But his point of view is overly practical in my view. He is advocating safer type. Not better type if you see what I mean. He is seeking the robust over the perfect and somewhat brittle. I see his point even if I am not completely taken with it.\n\nReading over everybody's posts the final thing that I am reminded of ( again one of Will's arguements or obsevations ) is that it is possible to simply design letters differently to avoid the problems that would have occured. An f can be made more narrow so collision is avoided.\n\n[http://www.will-harris.com/ligatures.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107115156/http:/www.will-harris.com/ligatures.htm \"http://www.will-harris.com/ligatures.htm\")\n\nSo I suppose I aught to reframe the question ( without expecting a solid answer per se ) is it better to redesign the forms or to use ligatures for immersive reading. I bet they wash out as more or less equal. And other issues such as 'is it a revival?' etc. must trump any kind of absolute decision you could make.\n\nOf course now I am think about it I am starting to see other redesigned elements in typefaces which are not ligature related but are related to robustness in spacing such as the seemingly shrinking arm on the 'r' glyph. Anybody care to mention other examples?\n\n"

I think it's especially difficult for young type designers to come around to the idea that ligatures aren't always better -- because they are so fun to make and look at.\n\nAs mentioned above, if the ligature itself doesn't match the overall letterspacing, it's trouble.\n\nOnce again, I can cite some changes between the old Type 1 version of Utopia and the newer OpenType version to show how two different approaches to ligatures compare. (I always thought the old ligatures were a little obtrusive, despite my liking the design of them. I think especially the first f in the ffi \"reaches\" a little too much.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107115156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture3_5452.png)\n\n"

What are commonly referred to as ligatures are strictly aesthetic forms, most exist to avoid awkward collisions between characters (or text kerned glyph systems as tradition has it that ligatures should not be used in display type). They have no phonetic or syntactical roles (some editors dislike ‘&’)----they are strictly typographic constructs.\n\nRegarding the point whether it is possible to “simply design letters differently to avoid the problems that would have occured” I would say that italics should be set only with the default designed spacing, as for the Roman, I expect old and young type designers to come around to the idea that there are new possiblities in forms but lettering is a precise art and strictly subject to tradition -- you can’t make letters any shape you like, you can’t make houses any shapes you like, unless you live all by yourself on a desert island.\n\nEben, I am glad I can count you as sympathetic and skeptical, I have my knowledge, my know-how and my physical being as basis, I'd like to quote Buckminster Fuller for you, “When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty.

They either fix the problem with adjustments to the outlines or with font metrics--fixed or kerning based. If this fails, ligatures may be a solution. I don't think these decisions are based so much on the aaesthetics of the type as they are on what the type designer feels is the function of the type.

Experienced type designers have an intuitive grasp of this, or so I think.\n\nChris's 'crash and hole' create areas of proportionally higher visual salience in areas of the word map, and this disproportion exacts a neural computation cost. The word 'measure' was a bit unfortunate. I meant it in the sense of gauge, or 'thought of in terms of'. I'm introducing a set of heuristics that have a perceptual processing signature--a framework for acting, a system of constructs convenient for gauging efforts and channelling action.\n\nYou don't need a nueralcomputationcostometer to practice mindfulness of computation costs / saliency / cue value in action.

So yes, I think they improve legibility._\n\nMy reply would be, \"Well, yes, but that's because you're a type nut, like the rest of us.\"\n\nPeople who have lived their whole lives in places with little or no typographic tradition (like Brazil) are not at all unlikely to never have laid eyes on a 'standard' ligature. Couldn't it be that ligatures cause more of an imbalance to the word image that those people expect to see than so-called 'crashes'? After all, one can only process ligatures without any conscious effort if one is intimately familiar with them.

It's true that familiarity ( culture) has it's effects. Culture is not a minor aspect. It's a big deal. It is however, just one part of the puzzle. I ( and I suspect most of us here - correct me if I err) think that there is such a thing as better & worse design. I would be willing to bet that a well designed ligature will beat crashing & holes in what ever population you toss it into. And a poorly designed one will not. Assuming you are not stressing the font out with heavy spacing as Will harris ( see above) points out. Also, all the ligatures pairs and triples are different. an fi is not a ct. I would argue that the ct is more significantly an artifact of the chrographic origin of the lower case. It's more vestigal and has less obvious visual utility. Where as the fi ( when it is designed well) has quite alot of visual utility.\n\n"

It isn't clear to me what you mean by better design.\n\nSo let's take that apart: I think a design can be said to be good if it does something very specific - very well. But it's really complex.\n\n( BTW- you might want to search Typophile for threads about legibility and readability. They are different too. )\n\nEven just speaking about legibility is complex. Legibility should probably be considered in the context of culture as you pointed out, on what paper, with or accomodating what feeling or style, and at what size, and.... many more things. With type there are many many many somethings that could be done well and some of the specifics are not compatible.\n\nFor instance: Type that works wonderfully well looking just at legibility at 72 point we know does not work well at 9. And vice versa. It would be silly to expect one design to do both.\n\nI suspect when you say good design you might mean good style or maybe beauty. That's complex too. Style by definition has to coexist with other attributes. Some attributes of style like weight or serifs can impact legibility positively or not depending on how they are handeled. But you are certainly right to think that sometimes a design can be beautiful at the expense of legibility. Is that your point? If so, keep in mind that Beauty is not just one relevant measure in some cases - it may be the primary one depending on the purpose of the face or the design in which it is used.\n\nThis doesn't mean that there are no generalities that can be noticed and which support legibility. They exist, but in a very provisional or contextual way rather than absolute one.\n\nBut coming back to a pervious point of yours (if I understand it). I agree that people who design type don't have nearly enough hard data to work with yet. That may change. And to be sure some of what we do is probably neither helping nor hurting legibility. But that's not necessarily the problem that it may sound like; legibility being just one way to measure the success of a typeface.\n\nBut even in our relatively impovrished state (from a hard data point of view); there is quite alot that intuition, cultivated sensitivity, and awareness of context can offer in the persuit of legibilty. Pehaps you will be one those folks who will chew on the data! Or create the data. That would be great!\n\nHowever I don't think that proof is what will emerge from testing or that 'proof' will help anyone, but rather I hope that testing will illumminate the way that characteristics of type can be traded off against each other to differing and hopefully increasingly deliberate effect. No matter what the test results may show - a prescription for Bodoni ( or any other face ) will never be 'the right one'. But I do think testing may eventualy help us to know more precisely what a type design is likely to be able to do. I put it that way because then there is the question of use. That's a whole additional area!\n\nThis is way too long. Sorry about that. I hope it is helpful and not a pain.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

Here the distinction didn't seem important, since no contrast is being made between one and the other. In any event, I've edited my posts so that the word 'readability' is now used throughout.\n\n_I suspect when you say good design you might mean good style or maybe beauty. That’s complex too._\n\nHmm... Not really, no. I mean, designers usually strive for style and beauty, yes, but that shouldn't be their ultimate goal. After all, a designer has a problem to solve: finding the best possible way to communicate a certain message or messages.\n\nBut what is the best way to communicate a message? Doing it in such a way that the reader will be able to process the verbal message with maximum efficiency? Or finding the most effective solution to convey a certain mood? Or trying to strike a balance between one and the other? That all depends on the designer's goal, of course: sometimes it's mostly about being as clear and matter-of-fact as possible, sometimes it's mostly about creating a certain atmosphere, sometimes both are important.\n\n_But even in our relatively impovrished state (from a hard data point of view); there is quite alot that intuition, cultivated sensitivity, and awareness of context can offer in the persuit of legibilty.

My point is that even if research proves your cultivation and intuition to be 'wrong', I don't think you should give them up. 'Better design' will _never_ be entirely objective, even if you do make a conscious effort to solve a problem rather than just 'make things pretty'. Besides, you can always try to educate the audience a little.\n\n_This doesn’t mean that there are no generalities that can be noticed and which support legibility. They exist, but in a very provisional or contextual way rather than absolute one._\n\nI completely agree. That's why, in my opinion, looking for universally applicable generalizations can be a thankless job. Rather than ask whether ligatures improve legility/readability -- a 'universal' question -- perhaps it would be more to the point to ask whether that is true for, say, French baby boomers that read Le Monde.\n\n_But I do think testing may eventualy help us to know more precisely what a type design is likely to be able to do._\n\nIf you're talking about general guidelines, I agree. But not even those general guidelines will be universal; you'll always need to try your design on a focus group if you want to determine how well it works in comparison to something else.\n\nIn the end, though, no tradition is absolute and universal, but that doesn't mean you should abandon tradition. It's a little like religion: keep doing it, but never hold it to be a universal truth.\n\nBy the way, if anyone thinks all I've said here is a load of c\\*\\*\\* or that I've disrupted the discussion that was going on without being knowledgeable enough about the subject, feel free to say so.\n\n"

      "content": "Eric, I'm long on hypotheses but short on methodologies. One approach might be to see how the magnitude of the Word Superiority Effect varies with spacing, ligatures in fonts that need them, and style of stroke termination. Another might be to measure the responsiveness of the Visual Word Form Area under conditions of 'priming' with these variations. The best thing would be to develop a criterial test for what I refer to as 'letter-wise slot processing' verses the more direct and supercessionary pattern-based recognition style of visual word-form resolution that I claim emerges when reading becomes fluent.\n\nEben, 1) I misused and miss-spelled the latin phrase _mutatis mutundis_, thinking it meant something like 'in the nature of the case.' 2) Expanding on 'facility at visual wordform resolution,’ ‘adequate discrimination affordances of role architectural particulars,’ ‘proper saliency of criterial features’ and ‘response bias collapse’:\n\n'facility at visual wordform resolution,’  \nI use this instead of 'word recognition' because the term 'word recognition' doesn't isolate and reference clearly enough the foundational _perceptual_ processing moment' of the sense-following mechanisms in reading. It can mislead us into thinking that the interesting and important part of what we are dealing with in reading is mainly a cognitive letter-assembly mechanism.\n\nIn my scheme, facility at visual wordform resolution is a learned perceptual skill which develops of its own accord, without conscious effort because of the optical-grammatical structure of writing and, once solidified, proceeds automatically and under the radar of consciousness. It becomes the 'response bias' of the visual system when it is confronted with separated written or printed text. It begins to supercede the letter-wise routine we must master to become skilled readers. The visual binding forces of serifs and rhythmic spacing make breaking the system's learned bias toward a kind of wholistic processing an effort-intensive process neuro-mechanically. These visual binding forces broker or catalyze the perceptual learning that must occur. Bad spacing and the abscence of serifs may make breaking the wholistic respones bias less difficult. They may threaten it, or they may actually privilege a more letter-wise neuro-mechanical routine. When the more letter-wise neuro-mechanical routine is induced or privileged by the typographic realization of the text, I speak of 'wholistic response bias collapse\".\n\n‘adequate discrimination affordances of role architectural particulars,’  \nVisual wordform resolution requires that the visual system be able to 'make out'--and the visual cortex register and integrate--the shapes of visual components of the word at least up to the level of letter parts and counters. My word for letter parts is 'role architectural particulars'; my word for things like counters is 'role architecturally evoke form'. I use them because we need a set of generic terms for things like bowls and stems and shoulders and counters. Because the stems and counters 'afford' or lend themselves to being 'made out' by the visual sytem, I use 'discrimination affordance'. When the lighting is too dim or the contrast with the ground too low, or the type too small for role architectural components to be registered or connected with effectively or made out, the 'discrimination affordances' or 'discrimination affordance quotients' of the font's component letters are inadequate for the condition of use. The discrimination affordances of some fonts are greater at threshlds of size or illumiation or degradation than others.\n\n‘proper saliency of criterial features’  \nEven if the discrimination affordances are optimal for a given condition of use, the type may not perform well, because certain parts of the visual wordform that are perhaps marginal to perceptually resolving it's identity are given too much visual weight by idiosyncracies in the shaping of the letters. The forms have to be balanced against eachother so that all the parts that are collectively important to resolving the perceptual identity of the stimulus have equal visual weight. In these contexts I speak of 'proper saliency' and 'cue value'. And it is important that salient holes and crashes not draw neural processing attention away from areas that are criterial for visual resolution of the identity of the stimulus. This mucks up processing from the retinal receptors up through the visual cortex. Salient here means salient for the visual system _at a receptor and neurological level_--not necessarily salient for conscious vision)\n\n‘response bias collapse’  \n[see above]\n\nHope this helps!\n\n"
