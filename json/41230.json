The digital type retailer worked with 14 international foundries to compile 29 brand new OpenType fonts and offer them on a single disc. Never before have the world’s most successful new releases been available in one foundry-independent product.\n\nLead by German type expert Jürgen Siebert, FontShop sought to create a compilation with no filler fonts. Only useful, relevant typefaces of the highest technical quality were considered. Versatility was also a key goal in selecting fonts for the product. FontStars 2007 includes multiple styles from three sans serif families, including FF Clan™ and Seravek™; three serif families, including Amalia™ and the TDC2 Award winning Greta™ Text by Peter Bil’ak; and several scripts and display fonts for creating dynamic headlines and advertising.\n\nThanks to their relationships with the foundries involved, FontShop was able to negotiate licensing fees that are far lower than the standard price per font. This makes the FontStars collection a very affordable way to add several new fonts to a type library.\n\nEvery typeface on the FontStars 2007 CD comes in OpenType® format for portability and ease of use. Each font’s single file works on both Mac® and Windows® machines. The license for each font varies according to the foundry that manufactured it. The fonts in FontStars 2007 are licensed for 1-5 users, varying by foundries represented on the CD. Contact FontShop for information on extending any license for more users.\n\nFontStars 2007 is available for purchase at [www.fontshop.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080127150543/http:/www.fontshop.com/products/fontcds/fontstars/). The collection includes the following fonts. A printable PDF sample sheet is available.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080127150543im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FontStars-fonts_6441.gif)\n\n**About FontShop**  \nFounded by Erik Spiekermann and Neville Brody in 1990, FontShop is the original independent retailer of digital type with locations around the world.
