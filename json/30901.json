In fact, I met many of you at TypeCon in Boston (I was a volunteer); you guys are like celebrities to me.\n\nWith that said, what inspired me to post was this logo for Milton Hospital. I just think that it's a brilliant design and deserved to be shared.\n\n-Scott\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090322im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Milton-Hospital-logo_5148.gif)\n\n",

And just so you know, you're the one that inspired me to finally join Typophile because I thought of you the other day: At TypeCon I worked in the bookstore with you and I remember you remaking a sign because the kerning was off. The other day at work, I did the exact same thing. :)\n\n-Scott\n\n"
