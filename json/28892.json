      "content": "I’ve gone back and read, not scanned, the new site with the two readme pages dedicated to the new design. While I still think the contrast is too low and it does making reading not-so-fun (for me anyway), the concept is mind-blowing and very, very cool.\n\nI actually do like the size of the type as I’m sick-to-death of type so small it hurts to focus. (ergo: I’m loving the trend for large type.) Until the WC3 can find a way to embed fonts without violating the EULA, I won’t complain about Helvetica or Arial or Georgia or (insert), because they could be using something worse. His attention to line-length and line-spacing is good, I think. Scrolling comes with the territory. I’d rather scroll than click to get the next page.\n\nHe mentions that he’s still working on the alogrithms for the color, so I hope the contrast is increased (at least a little more).\n\n"
