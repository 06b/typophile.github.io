Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\nPS-after reading all,(most of), the posts in the \"Type ID Board\" am sure that if any one can help, you guys can.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214011305/http:/typophile.com/files/font_40.jpg) | 4.77 KB |\n\n",
