Anyway looks like I was completely wrong...\n\n\"the original Intel “dropped-e” logo, which was created by Silicon Valley pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore 37 years ago as they were forming their new “integrated electronics” company.\"\n\nvia - [http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060103corp.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150327015033/http:/www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060103corp.htm \"http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20060103corp.htm\")\n\nSo the logo was created by a pair of engineers in 1969. As to the dropped e maybe they know - seems like a geeky gimmick to me ;-)\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"
