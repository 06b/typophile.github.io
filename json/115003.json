Well executed--differences between repeating letters are not obvious and treatment of serifs etc is very consistent.  \n\"Barthelemy Ferrer Fils.\" is in a style that probably looked a little old fashioned in 1911.  \nExcept for the shadow line it is not very different from a narrow 19th century \"Latin.\" Here are a few -- mostly too wide and with differences in details -- Latin CT [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/latin-ct/\") Spike [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/quadrat/spike/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/quadrat/spike/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/quadrat/spike/\") Etienne [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/etienne/ITC](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/etienne/ITC \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/etienne/ITC\") Barcelona [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/barcelona/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/barcelona/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/barcelona/\") or More digging might find something closer.  \nDon\n\n"

They have fewer big latin serifs but, to me, match the upright, more squared-off appearance better.

      "content": "Hi Mike, Asteroid Primo Two by Jim Spiece is a good addition to the list of possible substitutes, although Latin CT still seems the best one so far. Jim Spiece is not very forthcoming as to his source for the design,. Asteroid Primo Two seems to be a simplified and conventionalized version of Asteroid Primo One. As for Asteroid Primo One, it is very similar to Ambrosia LHF [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-ambrosia/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-ambrosia/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-ambrosia/\") and [http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ambrosia.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ambrosia.php \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ambrosia.php\") Perhaps Ambrosia is the 1900ca name for this design? Dan X. Solo used the term Asteroid, but he was known for renaming old typefaces. May be in one of the old type specimen books. Whatever it was called, here it is in an engraved version used in a Brooklyn liquor license from about the 1890s\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724184738im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BrooklynLiquorLicense1890caTypophile101844_6363.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
