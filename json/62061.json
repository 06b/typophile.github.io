  "content": "Hi. I just started using Fontlab Studio 5. I have two questions:\n\n1. How do you delete anchor points? I select the anchor point and hit delete and it only deletes the point, not the accompanying line(s). In other words, it keeps the shape closed, just gets rid of the point.\n\n2. Where is the help section? It's not on the top right like other programs. And when I go to find the manual in the applications folder, all that is there is the icon for FS5. I did purchase the software. Maybe it's on their site?\n\nThanks in advance,  \nPablo\n\n",

      "content": "There are two operations:\n\n1. Removing a node while keeping a contour as close as possible to the previous shape.  \n2. Breaking a contour.\n\nYou can use the Eraser tool to remove a node keeping a contour as close as possible to the previous shape, and you can use the Knife tool to break a contour. You can also right-click on a node and choose Break contour.\n\nAnd then, there is the operation of deleting a node. Depending on the settings in the preferences, it behaves like the Eraser tool or like the Knife tool (plus actually deleting the node).\n\nI think it might be useful in **FontLab Studio 6** if hitting Delete behaved the way it does right now (according to the Preferences setting), but that there would be two modifier keys, e.g. Alt+Delete always deletes the node while keeping the contour, while Shift+Delete always deletes the node and breaks the contour. Do you think it would be useful?\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"
