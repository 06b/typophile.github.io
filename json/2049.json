Flatten that, and give yourself a proper terminal on the 'g' and you've got a nice readable pixel serif.   \n   \nbut why nitpick when pixel fonts are quirky by nature.   \n [http://en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317125930/http:/en2.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirinus)\n\n"
