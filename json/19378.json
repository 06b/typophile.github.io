This is the problem I'm facing at the moment.\n\nI **LOVE** [Whitney](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052748/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/whitney/index.html), I licensed the entire package, and have used it in different projects, but suddenly find that I cannot use it because of the potentially cost-prohibitive need for extended licensing. I want to cry because I cannot afford it.\n\nI've replaced it with Myriad, for now, because I do have that and it didn't create too much of a switch-a-roo hassle. But, it isn't as interesting. Boohoo.\n\nAnyway, if anyone has suggestions for a super-family--condensed, compressed, regular plus all the weights--which also has a EULA that allows for embedding in PDF and Flash (presentations) which can be posted on the web I'd be curious to see it.\n\n",

      "content": "I personally think that embedding in things like Flash or PDF is okay. Sure, there are ways to extract some possibly useful font data, but the same can be said of output from a printer.\n\nIn the case of Flash, the data is not super useful--each character is stored as a shape symbol using Flash's internal graphic format. This is why Flash is not a great format for font samples--the shapes it creates are approximations optimized to take up as little space as possible. At actual size it usually looks okay, but if you zoom in, you can see that it's not an exact copy. I've played around with some of these Flash decompilers and what you get is these shape symbols, not fonts.\n\nAnother way to think about it: Every time a font is reproduced on paper is an opportunity for piracy. A magazine has a new exclusive custom typeface. If someone really badly wanted to use it, they could clip up issues of the magazine until they had all the characters, make high-res scans, piece together words... you get the idea. The only way to prevent this kind of piracy is to not allow the font to be used at all by anyone. Font development is not a good career for the paranoid.\n\nIn my opinion, terms of usage should allow anything that doesn't directly interfere with the font developer's means of support--the big one for me is redistribution. The risks associated with embedding are tiny and almost academic compared with, say, casual sharing and borrowing of fonts. I really think that overly restrictive licenses hurt efforts to get people to take EULAs seriously.\n\n"

For one, it's a real font, not just shapes, largely because they want to be able to support editable text in it. As such, it's got stuff like kerning data included.\n\nEven for Flash 7, it's important to distinguish the file _format_ from the tool. And Macromedia's conversion to (Flash 7 and earlier) outlines is quite lossy. I'm sure you're right that they're much more concerned with file size than quality (they've never seen Flash as a print format).\n\nTechnical quibbles aside, I entirely agree with your argument about paranoia.\n\nOne last point. If people are wanting to be careful about coloring inside the lines, and need to do things that would not be allowed by an ordinary EULA, maybe take a look at one of the [Good Libre Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052748/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Good%20Libre%20Fonts), released under a free software license.
