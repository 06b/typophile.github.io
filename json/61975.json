The homeless more likely. I'm pretty close to finalizing but can't decide on the following font weights. Your feedback is much appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130615060034im_/http:/typophile.com/files/7331_Soap4Hope_logo4_6027.jpg)\n\n",

Against that solid backdrop, the bubbles ought to read nicely. Bolder typeface is better, but feels tired. I agree, something round, but maybe with overstuffed curves - something like Cadena Black ( [http://latinotype.com/espanol/fonts/CadenaBlack/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130615060034/http:/latinotype.com/espanol/fonts/CadenaBlack/ \"http://latinotype.com/espanol/fonts/CadenaBlack/\")).\n\nAnother idea would be to minimize the number of soap bubbles to the bottom mask, and inside the counters of o's and maybe p. Using a geometric sans, the bubbles could be slightly off center in the counter.\n\nAnyhoo, good name for a good cause. Nice project!\n\n"
