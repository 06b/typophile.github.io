However, I could not identify the font on several websites. I am hoping one of you knows what font this is!\n\n[http://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/interiors/hipster-home-trends/washi-tape](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416140304/http:/www.houseandgarden.co.uk/interiors/hipster-home-trends/washi-tape \"http://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/interiors/hipster-home-trends/washi-tape\")\n\nI am not sure if the text \"20 HIPSTER HOME TRENDS WE LOVE\" and the text below the image \"The £3 magic decorating tape from Japan. If you're a hipster, you use it to create your moodboard - you know, \" are the same... But I want to know :)\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n",
