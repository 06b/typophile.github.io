  "content": "When it comes to fonts that remind me of family, nothing fancy or exciting comes to mind. I tend to picture and see in my mind a typewriter font, as though every certificate and letter from or about my family has been created on a typewriter. I do not see this as a bad thing but I feel it does not inspire or give inspiration. Maybe it is this constant bombardment of plain jane typewriter font that I tend to be okay with plain jane fonts as well or maybe that is the reason why I choose big elaborate fonts to represent me, to be better remembered.\n\n",
