Can you post a list of serif fonts you have, or tell us what libraries you are using? It seems pointless for us to try to name 'similar' fonts, if we have no idea what you might have.\n\nFor example, I would say that DSType's ['Aquila'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234117/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/aquila/) and ['Cultura'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234117/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/cultura/) have basic letterforms that are similar to Gulliver; and ['Collis'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234117/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_c/collis_roman_full.gif) from TEFF is also rather similar in weight and letter shapes; or ['Fedra Serif B'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234117/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_fg/fedra_serif_b_full.gif) is visually similar looking on a page and has a wide range of weights.\n\nDo you have any of those?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
