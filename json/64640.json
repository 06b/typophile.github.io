I've been reading up on type for my studies and I would really appreciate some help with the following.\n\nWhat is the technique or style called when you lay out the a word of several titles and adjust the leading of the words so that all the edges aline. For example,\n\nTHIS IS MY  \nT I T L E  \nEXAMPLE\n\nI have seen this style of layout many times. What are your expert views on it? I like it but my taste and understanding of type lacks, erm, sophistication at times. I am wondering how do you best go about adjusting the kerning and line height to achieve such an effect. Again, disclaimer, please go easy on me, we all had to learn somewhere eh. Please throw me some links and help me expand my knowledge, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nB\n\n",
