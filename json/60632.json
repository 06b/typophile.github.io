      "content": "It's a really clever treatment, and it interacts well with the other characters. It's in really good shape right now, so my criticisms are a little nit-picky:\n\nYou should work on cleaning up your curves a little; some of the bulginess and awkward curves can be attributed to attempting to force an n and a u into a foot. However, you should make it look either like a very realistic foot outline or abstract and stylized. I'd lean towards the latter — you should have smooth curves but still be able to make the foot recognizable.\n\nI'm not so sure about the placement of the period — I'm still reading it as \"runningguru.com,\" because my brain is trained to read it that way, but when I look at the \".com\" independently I'm confused to see the dot just kind of floating there.\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah, solve the '.com' treatment and you've got yourself a nice little concept here.\n\nThe letters of the logotype are a bit too modular for my tastes. They don't seem to mesh well with the roughness of the shoe track. Their basic shape works well with the shape of the footprint, but there's something about the simplicity of the 'r' and the 'u's that get to me.\n\npenn\n\n"

      "content": "I echo the dot com problem. The dot seems too tiny in comparison with the thicker type. Definitely gets lost. I also think the foot, while nice, is too narrow in comparison to the larger blue type. Those shapes sit wider and the foot feels a little diminutive amongst the rest. Just a little though. I like the tread of the foot and the execution is nice.\n\nw|m\n\n"
