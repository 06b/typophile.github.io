I have Cabarge's book (Logo,Font & Lettering Bible) and he suggests staring with a skeleton stroke then building from there using diamonds to create a faceted face.\n\nI was wondering if there are other styles or ways to do this? Since Zine has these nice thick slab serifs, the technique Cabarge gives doesn't really work, not to mention I don't have a skeleton stroke of the letter.\n\nHere is the base:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FAST_3612.gif)\n\n",

[note the roughness of curves is only because I did this quickly, you could be as accurate as you'd like.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Graphic1_5722.jpg)\n\n"
