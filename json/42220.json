I hear that he is in Scandinavia now ? !\n\nCould someone contact him who knows his e-mail address and see  \nwhether he is available for a short dialogue.\n\nThanks  \nRichard Bidwell\n\n [‹ Weiss as a text font in a novel?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907034255/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42193 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Cut and then curved ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907034255/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41687 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
