So, a font generated today would be \"Fontname-Test2006020301\". I also change the version number, and make sure that all of the name fields in all of the many FontLab windows are updated with the right name.\n\nCache-clearing is a good idea. Also, delete all of your AdobeFntXX.lst files, and Log Out and In, or restart. (Every once in a while. You don't need to restart every time...)\n\nIf you're working with OT, make sure that you don't have conflicting kerns; it could be that you have a kern feature which is battling with a kern table.\n\n"

I created some unicode fonts in fontlab, made kerning pairs, and after reading all the entries on this topic, and trying it all, my custom kerning pairs still don't come up in indesign or photoshop. I'd go back to fontographer but it doesn't support unicode!  \nI hope someone reads this and can help!  \nCivi\n\n"
