I would like to share their response with you.\n\nDear Jackie,\n\nWe do get asked that a lot. Officially, the letters “D&AD” stand for nothing at all. When it was founded in 1962, D&AD was called the British Designers & Art Directors Association. That name was dropped in favour of D&AD about 5 or 6 years ago for two reasons:\n\n1) Over the years, the awards have become increasingly international - these days 70% of our entries come from outside of the UK - our second biggest entrant nation is the US.\n\n2) We now support such a wide range of creative disciplines that ’designers and art directors’ seemed an inaccurate title. We cover 30 different categories in the awards alone, and run education & professional development programmes across disciplines.\n\nWe’ve been known informally as D&AD since our founding, so although we regularly hear the question you’ve just asked, we felt it was the best route to take.\n\nI hope that clears things up - let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nRegards,\n\nMaeve\n\n—  \nMaeve O’Sullivan  \nSenior Communications Manager  \nD&AD  \n9 Graphite Square, Vauxhall Walk, London SE11 5EE, United Kingdom  \nDirect Line - +44 (0)20 7840 1125\n\nD&AD Awards 2008 - Call for Entries - But is it a Pencil?  \nVisit [http://www.dandad.org/awards08](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704154842/http:/www.dandad.org/awards08 \"http://www.dandad.org/awards08\") for information or to enter.  \nFinal deadline Wednesday 16 January 2008.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nOn another note:  \nMiss Giggles - have you graduated yet?\n\n"
