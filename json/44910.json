Look at the forums at [http://www.dpreview.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907165801/http:/www.dpreview.com/ \"http://www.dpreview.com\") (Photo website) Images are previewed at a certain width but can be expanded if you click on it, so you don’t have a scroll bar. I think this would be the cats pajamas. I don’t know what that means but I think it’s good.\n\n [‹ Which Stempel Garamond?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907165801/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44367 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Newspaper font size? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907165801/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44734 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
