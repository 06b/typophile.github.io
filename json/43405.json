  "content": "Hi all, my first post here.\n\nI'd like to find a font that reflects the typographic style often used in 1940-1950 european advertising, such as phillips and electrolux. I'm looking at somthing between Gotham and Matinee, Gotham being too sharp and Matinee to smooth and Matinee-like (naturally). Also found in American aviation/war-like prints from the 1940's.\n\nCould anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nThanks  \nDavid\n\n",
