  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am currently in a job which is primarily a PA for a finance company. However I have taken on a new role of redesigning Powerpoint tutorials which are converted into online tutorials.\n\nDoes anyone have any good links about designing in Powerpoint or online tutorials. I would like to avoid the usual cheesy clip art and hope to redesign these learning materials in an attractive and modern way.\n\n",

Colours should be high-contrast, and the text should be in a font that is readable on-screen. Graphics should be relevant to the text.\n\nAs for avoiding cheesy clip art, avoid cheesy clip art.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
