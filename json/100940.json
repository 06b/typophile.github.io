As usual, looks like it has been started from [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20130303020640/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/futura). Some suggestions: [Diamonds](http://web.archive.org/web/20130303020640/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/diamonds/), [Evolette A](http://web.archive.org/web/20130303020640/http:/26plus-zeichen.de/en/fonts/tj-evolette-a/), [Lightyears](http://web.archive.org/web/20130303020640/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/matchandkerosene/lightyears), many ones at [TenDollarFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130303020640/http:/www.tendollarfonts.com/) (TWOFACED, Echelon, Rathe, Parqa, Fonecian, Finding 57, Harf 77, Labieno, Positano, Marina, Alumia...)  \nMore inspiration: [I Am So Tired With Your Experimental Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20130303020640/http:/experimentalsans.tumblr.com/)\n\n"
