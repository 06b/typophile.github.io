  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nBeen a bit since I posted here but thought I would check out what was going on in the world of Type. I have been working a lot on type lately and have 5 or so faces to release. I also will be at TypeCon so if you are there too, hit me up.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071318im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile_tap_5565.jpg)\n  \nThis typeface is called Tapscott and has a jazz feel to it. I incorporated a lot of alternate letters and character combinations so it feels fresh if you are wanting a custom type feel. We have been doing a lot of hand-drawn faces lately at the YWFT offices and we normally do at least one alternate for every letter to keep it fresh. I basically took a sans look and added some ligature options to be used sparingly. \n\nMore info here:  \n [http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0178](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071318/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0178 \"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0178\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071318im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile_neigh_5252.jpg)\n  \nThis is Neighborhood, designed by YWFT's Travis Stearns. This is his first working typeface and think he did a good job on it. The font contains tons of extra characters as well and took him a bit to complete. He reworked it a lot and think the final output is a unique hand-drawn serif. \n\nMore info here:  \n [http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0169](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071318/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0169 \"http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0169\")\n\nWell just thought I would put these out there and show what we have been doing lately! :)\n\n",
