  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a signage designer (know a little about typefaces but not an expert) doing a favor for a friend in redesigning their very bland name-style, which at the moment is simply the word iLAB set in Helvetica Neue. They like the no-nonsense/simplicity/straightforwardness of HN, and i don't think they'll move far from this baseline. I was hoping to suggest something to them with a little more style to it - they are after all (lighting) designers. Any suggestions would be most welcome, thanks.\n\n",
