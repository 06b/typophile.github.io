Been trying for ages with my name, but to no avail. Getting a bit frustrated now.\n\nAnyone want to lend a little hand here?

Given the many different ways to approach them, and an infinity of lettering styles to draw from, it’s just a matter of ingenuity.\n\nYou could also post your name and let the Typophiles take a swing at designing some for you. Could be fun all around. I love playing with ambigrams.\n\n"

It’s just a matter of how good it can be. Sometimes it will necessarily be bad.\n\nAnd one never stops learning new tricks with practice; there are requests that, had I received them only a few years ago, I would have turned away saying “it’s not going to be remotely legible or attractive,” but are within my ability to make them so now. The last time I actually said “I’ll understand if you just want a refund” was for BOOXTER, and even then they picked a sketch they liked enough to approve for completion.\n\nFeel free to look through [my ambigram gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225338/http:/ceruleanstimuli.com/ambigram/) for inspiration (or to commission me if you’ve given up, as I am still madly cheap).\n\n(new url. I didn’t realize editing the reply would drop it to the end.)\n\n"
