  "content": "How much headache am I causing by ignoring some of the FLS “nodes at extrema needed here” beasty red arrows in an italic typeface? With a condensed italic typeface in particular, I notice that close proximity nodes can make hinky little curve kinks when complying with the little red arrow beastie and inserting the requested node. The curves look better without it on screen and on laser prints so what the hell is the point? I understand in upright fonts where nodes align nicely for hinting but in italic, what the hell good are they?\n\nDesperately trying to remain Hinkyless in Virginia,\n\nChrisL\n\n",

FontBook would not validate the font and would not display all characters. This setting in preferences makes correcting easier without too many distortions, but still requires lots of manual fiddling:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203084412im_/http:/typophile.com/files/simpl_5709.png)\n\n"

I see the same thing you do and I'm just going my merry with all those red arrows, whenever putting an extremum makes stuff look worse.\n\nHopefully a hinting maven can enlighten us. I was encouraged by hearing Matthew Carter say he breaks the \"rules\" regularly.\n\n"
