With several letters trying to impose on the rest, and a set of unexpected design choices in some of its puncuation marks, BPimperial is a display font that literally stands out! Give it a try!\n\nDon't forget to download BPimperial's accompanying pdf. It includes works from a few friends that kindly responded to my invitation to try the font and design something (anything) with it. Thanks a million to all of you (Christos Tsoleridis + Christos Papatheodorou from [togetherdesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122314/http:/www.togetherdesign.gr/), Giannis Kouroudis from [K2design](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122314/http:/www.k2design.gr/) and Michail Semoglou from [cannotnot design](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015122314/http:/www.cannotnot.net/) together with Emirihanna Litsa)\n\n",
