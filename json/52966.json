      "content": "I would have said a custom font as well. My first instinct was baskerville of some kind, although some of the serifs are reminiscent of a Bodoni. That might reflect one of the older JP Morgan wordmarks that was based on Bodoni.\n\nGood to see them try to differentiate themselves from the Chase retail banking side.\n\n"
