What The Font can't ID it, Identifont wasn't much help, and I can't trace the original designer or get a text version to extract the font. A design group said this font was supposed to be 'Garow' but they didn't have a copy of that font. I've searched all the normal foundries and found no reference to the Garow typeface, even after trying numerous spelling variations.\n\nA fellow designer recommended Perpetua as a close match, which it is, but it's not identical.\n\nI'd like to find the exact match. Any help?\n\nCheers,\n\nKK\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014002600im_/http:/typophile.com/files/prem-logo_3779.jpg)\n\n",
