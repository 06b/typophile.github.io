Their aim is to help graphic designers to forget their fears and start working on types.  \nTypies is a very didactic blog, and the topics it deals with, are unusually mentioned on typographic books. You will note that the information in this blog is very useful and easy to understand.  \nIdeal for newer typographic designers.  \n.  \n [http://typies.blogspot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011015757/http:/typies.blogspot.com/ \"http://typies.blogspot.com\")\n\n.\n\n",
