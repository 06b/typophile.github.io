  "content": "Hello everybody. I have a question for you.   \nI'm using Office XP and Adobe Acrobat to create my pdf's. They are mostly text documents, created for online reading. I would like to know, for reasons of legibility, what fonts I should use. So far I like Adabi MT and Gill Sans as sans serif fonts. As for the serifs I saw a pdf that used Bembo (I don't know much about this font) that I liked. In fact I hardly found any serif font which looks nice in the pdf at small sizes (10-14 points).   \nI think you can help me. Thank you in advance.\n\n",
