He briefly attended the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology but found the academic focus too stifling even for pretend consideration.\n\nJames has worked as a photographer, art director, graphic designer, audio engineer, publicist and creative consultant. He is presently a freelance advertising creative specializing in copy writing and brand development. \"Combining a permanent interest in monumental sculpture with written forms and semantics, I'm a philosophical artist who finds typography an ideal medium for the expression of abstract ideas.\"\n\nSince 2003 he has designed 11 retail typefaces and 4 proprietary typefaces, receiving commissions from major players in U.K. videogames industry and a specialty motion picture post-production house. Retailing under the &nbsp;s e n t i n e l&nbsp; t y p e&nbsp; brand, James' early type designs reflect a deeply-felt passion for blackletters, the gothic even-width principle, and fractured letterforms. Recent designs cover a wider range of styles. His original contributions to typeface design include the \"super-modular\" phonetic character shaping of Rhodaelian, and the variable structure and shape contrast of the unreleased Angel of the Odd.\n\n**Retail fonts**  \nAmity  \nDeLouisville  \nEuphonia  \nGanymede  \nJellybrush  \nMaus  \nMidnight Kernboy  \nPrimex  \nRhodealian  \nSibyl  \nSten\n\nJames lives and works in Melbourne, Australia.
