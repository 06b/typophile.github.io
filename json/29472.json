They want a an upscale/quality feel, not a traditional agricultural look.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks,\n\nEdgardo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205033737im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/4_6345.jpg)\n\n [‹ Prelim.

      "content": "Yeah, the colors represent agriculture. What I ment by agricultural-feel was to avoid traditional elements like obvious leaves, rivers, mountains, trees, crops, etc.\n\nThe main concept is the environment of the Hacienda. The “levels” you feel when you go there, the soil, the mountains around and the sky. The circle put it all together and represents the products. Using the star to represent the sun also segments the circle which produces pieces similar to what you find when you cut an orange/tangerines or other tropical fruit.\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n\nE.\n\n"

As for the background pattern, it seems a little too linear or digital. Maybe along with humanizing the logotype, you can humanize the pattern a bit. I guess it depends on what you’re trying to accomplish.\n\nAloha!\n\n"

Maybe a bit neutral.\n\n\\>I worry that changing the font might make the product feel too upscale/luxury related\n\nI think the guys ment, that you can give it some more human touch with a serif/slab. Your use of the chosen font, which is an extended weight and all written in caps, goes in the upscale etc. direction already. I would try a slab, to check out how far i could go, for example with a slab-serif. Standards like PMN Caecilia, Scala Serif, to see how it works together.\n\nWhat you could try otherwise, following “the more human” direction, but stay “clean”:  \nI like the combination Avenir, Scala Serif a lot. Avenir has this slightly constructed feel and still being friendly. And Scala Serif for text. Both works good together, has nice contrast.\n\nJust my 2cents\n\n"
