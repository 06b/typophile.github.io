Goudy set it large as a text face, about 14pt, with only an extra point of leading and a 27 pica column width.\n\nGosh but it’s beautiful. I’ve noticed it on a couple of jobs lately – perhaps it’s coming back into fashion?\n\n"

I can’t figure out how to post images to this thread  \nb. The nuances between the two faces get really mangled by the filetype and size restrictions for submitted images  \nc. I think I might be breaching copyright if I scan from the book and shove it on here  \nd. If you already have a version of Berkeley and there’s a budget consideration that excludes buying another version, then why post the topic?\n\n(I know, you’re looking for inspiration); FYI, it doesn’t look bad as a text face; Goudy set it justified with very tight word spacing and not a lot of extra lead, as I said earlier. When it’s up at display sizes of course it requires letterspacing in the capitals.\n\nThe whole thing about this is that the original quirkiness in the design – traits of Goudys intimacy with mediaevalism and blackletter influences – got ironed out when ITC recut it, and the ’feminine’ character you refer to is just anaemic by comparison.\n\n"

Is the original as feminine as ITC’s?\n\nBringhurst’s _[Elements of Typographic Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905061547/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Elements%252Bof%252BTypographic%252BStyle)_ compares ITC Berkeley and [FB Californian](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905061547/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/CalifornianFB) at large sizes. If you follow this link, you can download a PDF and see how it prints for yourself. Lanston also has a version of [Californian](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905061547/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/californian.html). I prefer Californian to Berkeley because it has more character and Berkeley has some real whaked out characters (that beautiful Goudy Q was just mangled!) If you want clean and crip, you may prefer Berkeley, but if you want warm and friendly I’d choose Californian.\n\n"
