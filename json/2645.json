      "content": "The fact that something is everywhere makes it more bland by definition, less unique and in my opinion less functional for the purpose of expert branding. One aspect of branding where this is critical is in the area of developing a unique visual identity, that differentiates the branded company from it's competitors. This can well be enhanced by designing unique a corporate typeface. Since this is not in the budget of many redesigns, or not offered as a solution, the next best thing is to choose a typeface that is legible, not overused (as in the case of eurostyle, Times Roman or Helvetica for that matter), and embodies the values the company embraces typographically. Is eurostyle displeasing to the eye. No it is in fact a very nice design, the same goes for Helvetica and Gill   \nas well as Novarese. In my opinion you fail to do your best when you do not explore such options. For all the Monolines out there, there are 100's of similar designs that do not measure up cosmetically, technically or functionality wise.   \nI do not expect everybody to be an expert at matching type for projects but then again this is typophile and this is about critique.\n\n"
