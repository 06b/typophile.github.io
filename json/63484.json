Before I begin, I was curious to see if it was an actual font, or personally designed for Kenmore Lanes.\n\nAs I was doing some sketches I found it has a similarity to Futura, but the r, k, and e tell me it's not.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419145110im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kenmoretwo_6384.jpg)\n\n",
