  "content": "I am currently working on my dissertation that is exploring the relationship that Jan Tschichold and Peter Saville have/had with society. The main sources I have read for Tschichold are The New Typography and Kinross' Modern Typography.   \n   \nDoes anyone have any ideas for books and articles that I could locate on the Internet or Art School library. I can find many contemporary sources on Saville however these are slightly lacking with Tschichold.   \n   \nAll help is greatly appreciated.   \n   \nKind Regards   \n   \nStephen\n\n",
