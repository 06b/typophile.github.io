How many typefaces did he fashion with or without Tom Carnase?\n\nFind a rough list of his work : _Avant Garde Gothic, Lubalin Graph, Serif Gothic, Ronda, Didi_.  \nAre there anymore typefaces?\n\n3. How do you define the style of Herb Lubalin and what's his artistical leaning?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "There’s this story about Alexandre Wollner visiting Herb Lubalin in New York. He says:\n\n_H. Lubalin had this three-ﬂoor office in N.Y. The main room was as big as Alexandre Wollner’s house with tables covered with sweets and chocolates. Wollner asked him what the room was for and how he managed all the luxury when he (Wollner) back in Sao Paulo couldn’t even dream of having such an adequate room. He replied: “I’m going to tell you a secret: on the ﬁrst ﬂoor there’s a room full of people working, but they only do retail down there, which I don’t show to anyone and which doesn’t appear in any book. We make a lot of money there. On the 2nd ﬂoor we produce publications of a slightly higher level: some adverts, but mostly magazine page spreads, medical pamphletes, and these make reasonable money. I don’t publish this stuff anywhere either. Then there is this room here where I do the things you see; the Avant Garde alphabet, Eros magazine etc. These don’t bring in a dime, they just cost money. It’s the ﬁrst ﬂoor that sustains the other two.”_\n\nThe story is from Alexandre Wollner published by CosacNaify in Brazil (a project by Andre Stolarski)\n\n"
