When I generate font file and try it in Illustrator, on smaller size (8,10,12...till 20pt) some characters seem like they have too much points.\n\nThis is what do I get:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203095513im_/http:/typophile.com/files/linije_3493.jpg)\n\nIn every other program, when I type something with this fonts - same problem. When I convert to outline text in this font, those lines disappear.\n\nThan I go in FontLab and open some character with problem and it seems to be OK, I can't figure out what are problematic points that make those lines. I tried with:  \nCorrect Connections, Join Broken Contous, Close Open Contours, Nodes at extreme and Optimize, but without any result. Also, I tried to copy back from FontLab to Illustrator and do again \"unite\" option, but still nothing happens.\n\nCan someone tell me what should I do?  \nDo I need to clear every character step by step, or there is some less complicated solution?\n\nThanks\n\n",
