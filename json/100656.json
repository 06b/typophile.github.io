  "content": "Hello,\n\nAfter generating my font I try it in MS Word and all of descenders and ascenders of font are cut off.  \nThis strange effect have place in big sizes as 72pt etc.  \nAs I understand the problem goes to font info but... settings is standart. Maybe the cause is font unicase and something wrong with value of Cap-height or x-height?..\n\nBest regards,  \nR.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810050322im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_19_3695.02.13,_0_58-2.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810050322im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8_%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_19_4606.02.13,_1_59.jpg)\n\n",
