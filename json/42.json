Just an brainwave - maybe I'm making so sense [in this context].   \n   \nTrying to think more lucidly: The \"E\" and \"S\" seem to have a particular rare charm.   \n   \nOne other thing: I like the separation in the \"G\" - maybe implement that more.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Maybe Scoles can find a similar font that does it.   \n   \nSomewhere out there, there's a font based on the McDonald's Golden Arches. While executed okay, it maintains a gimmicky feel.   \n   \nGimmicks are fun. Uh, I use gimmicks. But sometimes the end result is not highly usable as I have learned. ![:(](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416055216im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \n   \n(Emigre's OutWest comes to mind)   \n   \nHow do you see Cronus being used? The answer to that might tell you which direction to take it.   \n   \nBTW, Cronos is also the name of an Adobe font.\\*   \n   \nI enjoyed some of the other faces on your site more than Cronus + the design- and type-related content is a good read for Typophiles.   \n   \n   \nwww.famished.org   \n   \ngood luck,   \n   \nbj   \n   \n\\*do a search on this site to learn more about Cronos.\n\n"

I also like the numeral 2 a lot.   \n   \nGood idea on the \"G\"   \n   \nTo answer BJ's question, I really didn't have a use for the font. I'm strictly a hobbyist when it comes to fonts. I have to say, though, that the comparison to OutWest is an unsettling one because I had always mocked OW for its unusability.   \n   \nCronus seems to me to be a concept font, kind of like in the fashion industry where they have bizzare outfits on the runway but end up using just a couple of elements in their next mainstream clothing line.   \n   \nThanks again guys and I will put my thinking cap on to see where to take this font...\n\n"

I think every typeface should have surprises.   \n   \nThe letters that for me don't fit now are O and S (the rounder S, not the elongated diagonal S). The O seems too modern. I have yet to fit on a curve that seems right for the face. I was thinking maybe a geometric O, but it's a narrow face....\n\n"
