They have identified all sorts, except this one—it is the last one! Does anyone have any ideas? It will make a lot of retired letterpress enthusiasts very, very happy.\n\n—K\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505022833im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Swashy_6030.gif)\n\n [‹ Wig-01](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505022833/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27799 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Michael Graves Design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080505022833/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27734 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The sample in the book appears to show that some of the letters in your posted sample (A, K and N) were alternate characters in the typeface.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

(Goudy 38 is also called Goudy Oldstyle Light) I digitized this as Goudy Oldstyle Cursive. The Lanston version of Goudy Oldstyle and Oldstyle Bold have all the alternates in the Pro versions of the italic fonts.\n\n"
