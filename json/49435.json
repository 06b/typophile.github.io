  "content": "Hello, I’m trying to find out if this logo uses any existing font? It is a french manufacturer of mobile homes. Obviously the ’o’ character couldn’t be part of the font; that is a sub-logo of theirs. But the rest, is it anything you recognize? I’ve tried the WTF checker and and some questions-based guides, but no luck. The image is from their website, [http://www.pilote.fr](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123313/http:/www.pilote.fr/ \"http://www.pilote.fr\") . They have been around for quite some time, so I doubt it is a recent font.\n\nThank you in advance for any hints.  \nMartin Persson, Sweden\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_acc\\_en.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123313/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_acc_en.gif) | 4.54 KB |\n\n [‹ PLS HELP](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123313/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49805 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Embroidery text- can get same or similar font name, ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123313/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49804 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
