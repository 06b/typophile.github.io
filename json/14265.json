It spews out pretentious things to say at type conferences. I was hoping to release this before/at TypeCon but ended up being too busy running to and fro to get it out there.\n\n2. Typophile RSS reader. This aggregates all feeds into one stream, but flip it over and you can set it to focus in one any particular group (General Discussions, wiki, etc)\n\nWhat would be the killer widget?
