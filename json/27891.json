Is one set the parents of the bride and the other for the groom? Technically you could put the bride's parents on top of the groom's, or if it is a culture issue vice versa.\n\nI am not sure I'd use a dagger to symbolize the cross.\n\nThe placement of the names below the optical center is making it feel bottom heavy.\n\nI think the lack of caps at the beginning of sentences seem like a mistake as you did capitalize the couple's names.\n\n"

But I think two are redundant, I'd eliminate the top one, move the type up, and enlarge the ornament at the bottom.\n\nI'm not loving the way you broke up that one line (convidam...) into three - preferred it as one.\n\nI'm also slightly bothered by the centering of the two families' names - can you nudge the pair on the right a bit to the right? The entire block of names, as is, looks off center to the left.\n\nBy 'set in stone' I think Tiffany meant is that some sort of standard wedding invitation size/shape (the square) or is there some flexibility about it.\n\nI'd also add more leading overall - both to the family names and to the text, open it up vertically a bit.\n\n"

      "content": "Rafael,\n\nSeveral thoughts:\n\n1. I think the \"funeral\" responses may have had to do with two things: the dagger and the static symmetry. The dagger is often used to represent the end of a text, or more symbolically, death. And the square bordered layout in which type is centered and spread out over the whole area evokes the layouts of gravestones....\n\n2. The border: these kinds of printed black lines that are usually coupled thick/thin like this one are devices used by printers to fool people into thinking that there is spatial depth to the page. Expensive invitations often use embossing to create multiple levels of impression into the page, but when someone doesn't want to spend the money on engraving embossed pages, they can fake it by printing 'shadow lines'....hence the overuse of borders. They become hackneyed and make things look cheap......\n\n3. It seems to me you could improve the type by clarifying when and why you use certain cases. The parents are in all-lowercase small caps (no larger capitals), the main message is in lower case, but the bride and groom are in title case (script italic), and the proper nouns in the last paragraph are also in title case.....\n\nWhen poets like e.e. cummings used lower case exclusively in their texts, they did it for a reason. They were eschewing established rules of grammar and punctuation they thought were too staid and musty. They wanted to strip all that out and focus purely on the content, insofar as words are capable of accurately conveying content.\n\nI'll stick my neck out and say that, roughly speaking:  \nupper case = 'stately, rigid, engraved, permanent, chiseled'  \ntitle case = 'formal, corporate, presentational, polished'  \nmixed case = 'conversational, flowing, normal, direct'  \nlower case = 'personal, intimate, humble, unassuming'\n\nIt could then be inferred that the use of small caps is probably a hybrid between upper and title cases.\n\nTwo more things: script and italic. The switch from separately formed letters to script indicates the sudden presence of the HAND (i.e., a calligraphic touch....personal, custom, elegant). And, the use of italics indicates the sudden presence of the VOICE (i.e. spoken conversation or a quotation, emphasis).\n\nDecide how you want to portray the tone of this event in the type and stick with it. Use the cases judiciously to support that decision. Right now, it's kind of scattershot: too much pepper in the chili.\n\n4. You could also get more out of the use of the script by using its \"swashy\" nature to connect the two names physically. Right now, there is a lot of space between the names and ampersand.....it looks a little like they're already sleeping on opposite sides of the bed! Perhaps put them closer together and draw some additional swashes that connect all three elements with a flourish...? This might also help the ornament at the bottom to not seem so merely decorative and gratuitous, but rather an echo of what's happening above.\n\nCheers and Good Luck with it! And remember that people are going to be delighted to receive the message if it's good news to them, no matter how you set it.\n\n"
