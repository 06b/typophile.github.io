      "content": "> Relatively speaking of course. :-)\n\nAgree. I'd rather have said \"free legal fonts\" even if I really consider many of them as quality ones. For the rest, everybody has his own expectations and standards. To me, any original (legitimate) work deserve respect, free or not, (technically) bad or not. And I don't want to start again the endless discussion about what's \"good\" what's not :) Quoting yourself from a recent discussion, don't forget \"[...] one man's nice is another man's goddam dog's breakfast.\"\n\n"
