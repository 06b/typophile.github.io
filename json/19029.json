Someone with a much longer font history than I told me once that the Bright Ideas fonts were pretty much all highly derivative of precursors.\n\nMost of those precursors, though, were not digital or aren’t around any more. I really like Sebastian. It and Shardee, at least, are floating around on the Web.\n\n"
