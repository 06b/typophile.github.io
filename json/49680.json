Unfortunately, a screen grab of the video just gives me a mysterious black rectangle, so you'll need to check out the clip yourself:\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJteBqThugg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120501042348/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJteBqThugg \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJteBqThugg\")\n\nAnyone recognize it?\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the ID! They still use Klavika. I can't be sure, but I think Klavika is used in promos where they leave a show's logo intact, and Antenna is used when they replace logos with a cohesive font. I think single-show promotions mostly use Klavika, and there may be a distinction made for dramas vs comedies. During the summer, Avant Garde was filling the role of Antenna during their \"All-American Summer\" campaign.\n\n"
