They are the most difficult, I think Even though they may fit with each other (and with the V, too), they have so little to do with the other 21 letters of the alphabet.\n\nOr am I wrong? Does anyone else ever feel this way? I'm working on a small family, and these letters are worst, in every weight!\n\nOK, I'm done with my rant now.
