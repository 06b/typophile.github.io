Seb Lester\n\nElectrik Sheep is proud to be hosting Seb Lester’s first solo show  \nof exclusive prints and originals.\n\nSneak preview: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVhP1J2BA5M](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071135/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVhP1J2BA5M \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVhP1J2BA5M\")\n\nThe Electrik Sheep Gallery, Newcastle will be showing a full body of work from  \nSeb Lester this August including a number of new limited edition prints and  \noriginals exclusive to Electrik Sheep. These will complement a selection of  \nhis well known back catalogue of work which documents his recent foray  \ninto the world of art.\n\nSeb is \"passionate about letterforms\" which form the basis for his pieces.  \nHe brings letters to life with his innovative approach and bold sense  \nof humour. Often drawing on racy subject matter and a dazzling array of  \nlettering styles he manages to produce thoroughly modern work that  \nwould look as good on the wall of a New York loft apartment as it would  \nin an English country house.\n\nSeb was trained at the renowned Central Saint Martins School of art  \nand is internationally known for his typeface designs and illustrations  \nwhich have been used by many of the world’s biggest companies  \nand publications including Intel, The New York Times, The Sunday Times,  \nPenguin, Faber & Faber and GQ Magazine.\n\nFollowing on from other exclusive solo shows from Faile, Eelus, Eine  \nto name a few the show will open on August 6th at 6pm with one  \nof Electrik Sheep's infamous street parties and an after party at  \nthe Forth Hotel. All pieces will also be released online at the same  \ntime for those of you unable to make the trip.\n\nSee you there!\n\nElectrik Sheep Presents..
