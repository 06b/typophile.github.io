  "content": "Hello,\n\nI recently did some typesetting at Jarrolds Print Museum, in Norwich, England.\n\nI printed with a wood letter typeface, called 'Sans Bold \"34\". I've created a logo out of this font, and now want to use it for the rest of the identity. Is anyone familiar with this typeface, and could you recommend a computerised version?\n\nThanks,\n\nHarry Hepburn\n\n",
