The clipping from a photo seen in today's Heidelberg newspaper shows that the font for typesetting \"Pfizer\" was forged too.\n\nsee [www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/viagra.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041608/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/viagra.jpg \"www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/viagra.jpg\")\n\n(to the left: original, to the right: forgery)\n\nBy the way: The word \"Viagra\" is a \"forgery\" of the Sanskrit word \"vyaghra\", which originally denoted \"he who smells scents by opening his jaws\" (Manfred Mayrhofer).\n\n",
