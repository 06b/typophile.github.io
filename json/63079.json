You may want to lengthen that and see where it goes from there.\n\nThe spacings need looking into as well. The e-l and y-l look tight.\n\nnagfa\n\n"

I see \"modern\", \"friendly\", \"slightly techno\", \"systematic yet playful\".  \nI like the stacked version. I also enjoy the n-i pair and how your \"a\" is the reverse of your \"e\".
