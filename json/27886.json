Is one version better than another? this said, should i go back and change other characters that are called things like sigma1, phi1, &c.?\n\n [‹ Kerning in a Dynamic Text box in Flash MX 2004](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200931/http:/typophile.com/node/27381 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Weight Order ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200931/http:/typophile.com/node/27963 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Of course, you could include a redundant glyph in your font and use both names, which would be very Adobe-like.\n\n"

      "content": "_...does it matter if this alternate form maps back to pi? is this simply a stylistic alternate?_\n\nHistorically, yes, it is just a stylistic alternate, one of many. Some of the Greek stylistic alternates have been used in modern times as symbols in mathematics and the sciences, which is why some of them are separately encoded in Unicode. The scribal pi is one of these.\n\nI think in the majority of cases, unless specifically making a font for use in scientific documents, you would probably this glyph to map back to the regular pi, and not to U+03D6.\n\nConsider: a user creates a document in Greek and uses OpenType Layout features to access stylistic alternates including the scribal pi. Through some chain of circumstances, a PDF is created that contains only raw glyph IDs, no Unicode strings. Acrobat parses the glyph IDs to try to reconstruct the text for searching and copy/paste operations. If the scribal pi is mapped back to U+03D6, the text is no longer in Greek, and cannot be reliably searched.\n\nOf course, if you are creating a scientific document and are using the character U+03D6 in your text to signify something with a semantic difference to pi, then you have the opposite problem if the scribal pi gets mapped back to the regular pi by Acrobat.\n\nThis is why Adobe’s glyph redundancy model isn’t really crazy after all.\n\n"

This omega with a swoosh might have even became a modern tradition in itself, even though it has no greek scribal roots.\n\n"

This occurs in quickly written text, not a carefully written scribal book hand. I don’t think it is an ideal form for a typeface.\n\n"
