  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm playing with my new personal logo and I would like to use my initials of PH and transform them into the cube which I'm almost there I think (Cube like a basic 3d object - I want to focus on 3d design :) ). But there is still something what I don't see what's wrong. I would like to have same width on the top and bottom and between P and H. Technically the P is same like H but optically the H looks wider. Also I tried some grid....\n\nI'll be happy if you can suggest any opinions and ideas what to fix.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ph-sketch.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317131336/http:/typophile.com/files/ph-sketch.png) | 34.53 KB |\n\n",
