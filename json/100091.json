I guess they used the same typeface for \"DINNER\", we just can't see the small flare serifs at this size.  \nUnfortunately and part of remininding me of Bookman Italic Swash (mainly because of swashes), I don't know any typeface, even loosely similar to \"RESTAURANT FRANCAIS\". What I've learn from this place is signages are most likely always hand-painted/lettered. There's no digital version of it.\n\n"
