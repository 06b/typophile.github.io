Since a tombstone is a unique production, both in terms of being a singular material object and containing text that is relevant only to the individual there interred, typography strikes me as an inappropriately generic and industrial technology.\n\nAlaskan: _You be surprised at how strict graveyards are about tombstone design._\n\nThis is certainly true in large urban and suburban cemeteries. In North America, many places allow only flat, cast memorial plaques on concrete bases, so as to make it easier to cut the grass.\n\nThankfully, my local cemetery isn't like that.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005411im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gabcem_4718.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Correction: They’re called monuments or memorials. It’s only a tombstone if it is on a tomb, which is a large vault, which is different from a grave. Also, the correct word is “cemetery,” not “graveyard.”\n\nI may be an enthusiastic computer nerd amateur in the world of typography and design, but I was a professional in the world of monuments. I spent four summers of my youth working at my family’s funeral home, installing them in cemeteries (along with many other kinds of chores that you probably don’t want to read about here). And my brother is a regional manager for a major Canadian memorials company. And I live half a block from one of the biggest cemeteries in Calgary.\n\nMy brother used to have his own firm, before he (happily) sold it to the company he now works for. He used software called “MonuCAD” for the designs. Letters are (generally) sandblasted into the rock, not carved. Monument production is quite, quite industrial.\n\nCould you have guessed that I’m a member of the Facebook group “You know you grew up in a Funeral Home if....”?\n\nJim Tubman  \nCalgary, Alberta, Canada  \n\"The Stampede City\"\n\nP.S.

      "content": "I make my living entirely from commissioned lettering and calligraphic work in Wales, UK and in recent years the request for hand carved headstones has increased enormously. The reason is that more and more people are getting fed up with the cold typographical approach of most monumental masons and they want to have something more personal and unique.  \nI can carve any typeface but type faces for 2D rarely work on stone due the influence and direction of light on the v-cut incision and most are not sympathetic to the chisel, wrist movement nor to the stone.  \nLetters suitable for carving are usually too heavy for typefaces as the horizontal lines in particular need to be heavier as the shadow reduces their weight. The weight of the letters will depend on which direction the stone faces and how much light falls on them and if there are any trees or buildings around that would prevent enough light to come through.  \nEvery headstone I design and carve is individually considered for the needs of the family and its location and often I need to personalize the letters and working with typefaces would restrict creativity and individuality.\n\nIf you are interested to see some of my headstones and other work please visit my web site:\n\n[www.ieuanreeslettering.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217005411/http:/www.ieuanreeslettering.co.uk/ \"www.ieuanreeslettering.co.uk\")\n\nIeuan Rees\n\n"
