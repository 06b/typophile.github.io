  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is my first attempt to get competent critique about my font. So please, Don’t beat me up too hard :)  \nI will be very appreciated about any critics and comments.  \nMy first serif typeface I am trying to make a little bit retro, fashy, but contemporary.  \nIt has 5 different serif shapes depending on the position of prominent parts of letters (maybe a little bit too complicated, but I like it).  \nI know there are still many things to work on and improve, but the main parts I am really not sure about are sharp ends of stems. The stems are the only parts without any serifs and I guess it makes the whole face unusual.  \nPlease look at PDF files attached below.  \nI made the stems a little bit out of the baseline to prevent them to look shorter than next letters, but I think it still looks wired at large points. At sample \"i\" looks longer than next \"l\" and so on.. . May be I made them too sharp or too long? Is there any way to do not change the shape? Or may be I need to make the bottom parts of letters more consequent? Or it is Okay?  \nI need your opinions.\n\nThank you for your time and responce!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416111710im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Half_Serif_3_sm_4955.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Unique.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416111710/http:/typophile.com/files/Unique.pdf) | 767.08 KB |\n\n",
