It covered the whole process of designing the press - probably based upon wine presses of the time, as Gutenberg lived in the world’s largest wine producing area, to the casting of the lead type, the making of the paper and finally the printing. The first mass-production in the world - ever. Zero to 20 million books in 50 years is some going!\n\nAn interesting fact: If the Bible were to be printed on vellum 140 calves would be needed. I assume vegetarians only bought the paper versions.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
