It has since become a rich forum for discussing found type and lettering. I invite you to take a look through the posts and possibly become contributors (I am particularly looking for contributors outside of my place of residence, Toronto, to broaden the spectrum).\n\nNow that the holidays are coming to an end, I will be adding more and more content daily and working on some of the villatype projects.\n\n [‹ [Random Request] FFFFOUND Invites??](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103005423/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40378 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Kerning Rule Question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103005423/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40329 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In Union Station in the VIA arrivals corridors as you would be leaving the trains, there are hand panted signs, quite possibly dating from 1919, that say “To City” with lovely long arrows underneath. Should be got before they do too much damage with the renovations.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
