  "content": "Hi,\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for a typeface for use in a logo for a community called ’booze free’? Its for young(ish) ’hip’ people who want to live life without alcohol. One idea I had was to use a font popular with the brewery / alcohol industry in a subversive stylee ;-)\n\nany ideas?\n\nthanks,\n\nLuke.\n\n [‹ A Caslon to call home?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122185746/http:/typophile.com/node/20893 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Thin Slab Serif & Stencil font-Editorial ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122185746/http:/typophile.com/node/40753 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

An homage to a particular label would be more likely to work visually.\n\nWhat I don’t get, in general, is defining a group in relation to something they don’t participate in. By the time you’ve named the group, and then strapped the members with a mark that recalls some alcohol product it would seem that you’ve put an almost obsessive emphasis on something you don’t have in common and maybe don’t want to emphasize.\n\nThere is a Pabst font that you might consider.\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for the replies! I appreciate the point regarding putting emphasis on something you don’t have in common so that is useful in itself. I should also point out that this is not a commercial project. The point of calling it booze-free was just so that it sounded a bit less stiff like ’the anti-alcohol group’ or the ’we are no fun at all and prefer knitting to having a good time’ group.\n\nthanks again.\n\n"
