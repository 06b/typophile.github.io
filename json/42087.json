  "content": "I work for a company called Uppercase Living, and we would like to find some type designers that would design fonts specifically for us. We would buy them outright, and use them to design our products with. We have already done two custom fonts, but would like to do more. If you are interested email me at [daveu@uppercaseliving.com](mailto:daveu@uppercaseliving.com). Also check out our website at [www.uppercaseliving.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010003630/http:/www.uppercaseliving.com/ \"www.uppercaseliving.com\"). Lets see if your font can outsell some of our customer favorites!\n\nDave\n\n [‹ Titles of the pre-1912 ATF Catalogs](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010003630/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42184 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Max Miedinger ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010003630/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27380 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
