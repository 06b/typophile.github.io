Or should I just create the frame on the first real page of the document? The Indesign help sort of dances around in discussing this stuff, but keeping the text frame off the master page seems sensible to me.\n\n [‹ Generating Type 1 in Fontlab](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007185744/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36522 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Class based kerning not showing up. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007185744/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36482 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
