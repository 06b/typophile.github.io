I would first appreciate some feedback on the \"tg\" symbol (since I'm not too happy about the font for the name yet anyway.)   \nI am not sure if the execution of the ink drop is good enough. what about the colour? w/ or w/o the dot?   \n   \nthanks for your comments,   \ns   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023123432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48027.gif)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023123432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48028.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Samann:   \n   \nI like this concept a lot. There seems to be a little disharmony between the \"t\" and \"g\" caused by the extremely organic feel that the squiggly, ink drop and ear create in the \"g\". The \"g\" is a living creature, but the \"t\" is not. I don't really have any suggestions to remedy it at this point\n\n"

      "content": "Samann cool stuff I like the concept. I aggree with what Scott has stated.   \n   \nPerhaps you can use the entire 'g' and make the ear appear to be an ink drop.   \nAlso what kind of inks are being used? I ask this because it might help you choose a color better suited for this design. For example, if soy inks (a more environment friedly ink) are being used maybe you can choose a color that reflects that idea.   \n   \nIM\n\n"

Do they have a 4 or 2 color press, or a digital output device? The name Technographic also implies \"precision\", Why not use properties of advaced printing technology to determine the logo.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello there,   \n   \nthanks everyone for all your valuable comments. I have taken especially Daniel's opinion to heart in that the first proposal with the ink drop might look like sloppy printing.   \n   \nSome more information on the company:   \nThe company started about 20 years ago and did mainly technical drawings (hence the name). Although the name has stayed, the company sees itself now more as an advertising agency. They can handle both the design and production side of the project.   \nProduction wise they do offset printing, digital (laser, plotter), etc. but they also have creatives who design layouts, invitations, brochures, annual books, etc. They also have a new collection with specially designed+produced cards (e.g. for weddings).   \n   \nSo, as you can see they are technical but (what they want to stress) very creative. Therefore the company name probably does no justice to their full skills (but they don't want to change it for now.) Therefore I also tried to create a symbol that shows a little more of their creativity, rather than \"precision\" and technicality.   \n   \nHere's a quick look at the current logo:   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023123432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48348.gif)   \n   \n   \nI have now gone away from the first idea with the drop and tried to create something that is more resembling the idea of the old whilst at the same time modernising it and implying more creative freedom.   \nHere's what I came up with so far:   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023123432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48349.gif)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023123432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48350.gif)   \n   \nI tried to stick to the same concept and by using a simplified geometric figure that is hand-drawn I tried to signify the dual nature of the company. Before I worry about vectorising this (if at all possible?!) I wanted to get your input.   \n   \nDoes it work? Is it practical? Can it be implemented with vectors?   \n   \nthanks for your comments,   \ns\n\n"
