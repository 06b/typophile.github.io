Orange means very little symbolically (this can be a good thing or a bad thing) and is very popular these days. I think it will stick around for 2 years more before it becomes passé.

Brands and logos stem from something more than \"because it just appeals to me\" else they fail miserably as a platform to expand the identity of a company.   \n   \nI couldn't have said this better myself. I recently took a job for a non-profit lit/arts journal here in Minneapolis. I was given the prospectus to review, and it seemed like it would be a really fun job. The magazine made it seem like a real cutting-edge, modern, no holds barred, breaking all the rules publication. I was all set to start planning this really modern looking site, and you can imagine my disappointment when i received this:   \n   \n ![achelogo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417055635im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1210.gif)   \n   \nMaybe it's just me, but Apple Chancery just doesn't do the great idea of this wonderful magazine justice. And what is the purpose of that rounded square, you ask. I asked the designer the same thing. The answer I got was \"well, I think it looks nice, and the calligraphic type is representative of 'writing'.\"   \n   \nI offered to create something, for free even, but the editors thought it was too late. It's really too bad.\n\n"
