Hasan worked very hard on these fonts in the past year and half in blockaded, electricity deprived, Gaza. He is a self-taught, talented, typographer and a hardworking family man. His third baby was born few months ago. Here is what he wrote us on Christmas eve, 2008:\n\nHappy Holidays to ALL.  \nPlease pray for me (us) in my terrible situation here in GAZA.  \nHasan\n\nPlease visit his \"Hiba Studio\" website to appreciate his hard work and dedication to Arabic typography on the occasion of the new year. We are sure this can help alleviate some of his suffering in Gaza today:\n\n[http://hibastudio.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414214014/http:/hibastudio.com/ \"http://hibastudio.com/\")\n\nHasan's typography friends.\n\n",

Hasan's Arabic is translated within square brackets. I answered in English or transliterated Arabic because of my slowness to type Arabic. Hasan's often-repeated refrain لا زلنا نقرع جدران الخزان that \"‫we still knock on the walls of the water tank\" refers to the novel _Men in the Sun_ by Ghassan Kanafani (available from Amazon) where a group of Palestinians try to cross the desert smuggled inside the tank of a water truck to seek work in the Gulf. Before they perish from the heat of the sun they pound the walls of the tank to call for help.\n\nHere is the chat, initiated by Hasan. The text formatting is garbled in places because of the difficulty of alternating right-to left Arabic lines with English left to right ones. I apologize to Hasan for publishing his private remarks, but they show his gentle poetic spirit and the ironic humor that help him survive impossible conditions:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414214014im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hasan_4732.jpg)\n\n8:24 PM  \n me: hello dear Hasan how are you?  \n Hasan: Thanks  \n I am fine  \n and you  \n me: and the situation?  \n tamam elhamdillah [fine, thank God]  \n Hasan: Very Good  \n me: good  \nHasan:  \n ‫لا زلنا نقرع جدران الخزان‬  \n ‫الحمد لله اتبعنا النصيحة‬  \n8:25 PM  \n ‫وصرنا ننام بكير‬\n\nWe still knock on the walls of the water tank.

The first reaction to Zionism in 1948 was to show daggers dripping with blood when it was Sten guns that were being used against us.

It is good to know that he is personally safe and in good morale, though the news of his cousin's family is devastating.\n\nSaad: _Appeasing wrong only make more wrong._\n\nOne aspect of the overall tragedy of the situation in Palestine is that 'hawks' -- those who want war -- on both sides characterise any compromise as 'appeasement'. So, the hawks in the Israeli Likud party called it appeasement when Sharon withdrew from Gaza and from south Lebanon. And they said that Hezbollah and Hamas would exploit this withdrawal to bring in more weapons, longer range rockets, to strike at Israeli towns and cities. And sadly, they were right: this is exactly what Hezbollah and Hamas did, just as they have always exploited every period of 'ceasefire' for the same purpose. [Although in the case of Gaza, Hamas not only used the withdrawal to prepare for more rocket attacks on Israel but also to launch an internal war against Fatah.]\n\nSo the vicious circle goes around again: the hawks on both sides feed each other's desire for war. Any compromise is seen as a weakness to be exploited and characterised as appeasement when the exploitation is realised.\n\n"

The Israelis know they have to get out of the occupied territories; Sharon's aggressive and destructive fantasies are over--even Sharon knew that. But the fanatics on the Arab side who want to destroy the Israeli state still rage, and have a huge following.\n\nYesterday, on Shabbat I had a memorable experience when I saw the old retired Rabbi at our synagogue. He teased me, saying \"Praying today? something must be weighing on your mind?\" --He knows I like to study more than pray.\n\nAnd I told him about this and the other thread, and those suffering in Gaza. He replied,\n\n\"I was there when we had no bullets. And I saw what happened.\"\n\nHe was referring to when he arrived at Auschwitz, and was separated from part of his family. He saw ovens across the fence, and said to another young man \"That must be a bakery.\" And other young man, from Poland, said \"No they are burning our families in those ovens.\" He couldn't believe it, and said to his friends from his small town: \"Don't talk to those Poles; they are depressing.\" But he very soon found out that it was all too true. Most of his family, and Jews from his town, perished in those ovens.\n\nHe went on to say, \"Do I grieve for the mothers who have lost children? Yes, absolutely. Do I grieve for Hamas? No. To defend yourself is a good thing.\" By the way, he has 40 relatives who have been running from Hamas rockets in southern Israel, for years.\n\nThe demand here that Israeli Jews give up their bullets--which is what the demand to give up control of a state amounts to--is not going to happen willingly. Land can and will be compromised, but not that. Too many remember what happened when we didn't have any bullets.\n\n"

They were forced out after 20 years of bloody occupation that included a lot of massacres. As for Gaza, Israel did not really withdraw, they had a plan: leave the area as a large prison/Ghetto and blockade it until they surrender and accept the reality of loosing their homeland. Could Gaza, a great port from Biblical times, use its shores to trade with the world after that so-called withdrawal? How about the west bank, why haven't they make peace there?\n\n\\>\\>Hamas not only used the withdrawal to prepare for more rocket attacks on Israel but also to launch an internal war against Fatah.\n\nHamas won the election that Israel put as a condition to proceed with peace negotiation. Immediately after that election, Israel announced that they would not talk peace until Hamas is forced out, then pressured and supported Fatah to overthrow them by force. Unfortunately Fatah cooperated. There are Zulus in all nations!\n\nJohn, I do not deny there are extreme Palestinian elements who would not accept less than expelling all Zionists, but the absolute majority of the Palestinians (including Hamas) are not extremest. They have accepted the hard reality, and only want to live with dignity in the homeland where they have lived for long centuries. There is really no room for hawkish politics here.

I had never called for the the expulsion of the Israeli people and would criticize extremists who adapt such ideology. On the contrary, I believe all world Jews have a legitimate human need to live in Palestine as their \"promised\" land.

On another level you are partly right, they lost-'they' the Palestinians, the Israelis, the Americans and all of us in this world that will have to pay the price of this madness for generations to come.\n\nJohn wrote _So the vicious circle goes around again: the hawks on both sides feed each other’s desire for war.

I think it is more than warmongers who block a solution. The Israelis in power have never undertook a realistic self-examination of the cost to the Palestinians of the creation of Israel and taken steps to reach a really just compromise solution. Having the military might of their own and of the US they felt entitled to overlook our just need for nationhood, sovereignty over our land including Jerusalem as granted by countless UN resolutions, many vetoed by the US alone. Not to mention the many other issues that are side swept by yet another Israeli military adventure. Yes the Arabs have their hawks and warmongers and the stupids, to coin a word, but all our doves have been discredited by the lack of a basic collective Israeli wish to make amends for their crimes against the Palestinians as a people and nation.\n\nWilliam wrote _And I told [my rabbi] about this and the other thread, and those suffering in Gaza.

I do not want to go into the military balance of Israel vs. Gaza, such as it is, but it is a question of history repeating itself. The children of the Holocaust have now become the new Nazis of the Middle East, But while the victims of the Holocaust are justly honored in films, museums, and countless other ways, it is disingenuous of you to try to present their case to us Arabs at a time when the blood of the thousands of innocent victims of Israeli power, a third of them children, has hardly dried. The Palestinians are not responsible for the Holocaust in Europe and knew nothing of it till it was over. But anyway it is an ill wind that blows no good. Welcome to this thread of the Arabic special Interest group of Typophile. One day through dialogue a solution to this mess will be found and the sooner the better. By the way some time ago I looked at your website and noticed you have a problem because the beautiful illuminated border does not expand properly to fit the page at all resolutions. I had an idea how it might be fixed, but for a Palestinian question of the expansion of borders is not such an easy matter! :)\n\n"
