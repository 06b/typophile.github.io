TypeCon’s over for now. Who’s going to ATypI?”](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122755/http:/typophile.com/node/36064) thread, I (we?) will be organizing a Typophile Meet’n’Greet in Brighton. This as a reaction to the recurring complaints after every conference that fellow Typophiles didn’t get the chance to meet, often because they even didn’t know they were there.\n\nI propose that the gathering takes place on Friday night after the ATypI Auction which starts at 18h45. I don’t know yet where we’ll have it, especially since I haven’t got a clue how many will want to join us. Maybe it would be an idea to have some registration. What does everyone think?\n\n",
