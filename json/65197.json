An owl and a mask to represent the \"normal\" student and the \"theatre\" student. Thinking of making the mask in a \"painted\" feel maybe. Also trying to add some hair to represent the six years that the students are there. First idea was to use direct objects like a spotlight, pen, brush, ladder and so on but it didin't really work out. The objects become too small and detailed for it to work at small sizes. I am now trying a more abstract approach to the hair.\n\nAny feedback appreciated  \npeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424013050im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_koncept_v4_4694.2.jpg)\n\n"
