The company that I am doing this for is somewhat divided on the logo and many of them feel it is too much of a \"SUPER P\". Any thoughts?\n\n",

Do they specialize in pizza?   \n   \nOf the posted designs, I also prefer #2.   \n   \nHave you explored any concepts with the winged P starting the word P+remier? I think having one \"fast\" read, rather than two (icon + title) might work well here. It might also allow for a streak, or flowing line, or some other graphic element to keep the P from looking like a stand alone \"super P\"�You would just have to be careful to maintain a sense of unity between the P and whatever other element you used.   \n   \nYou've made a good start.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

The thing that seems to be missing in all of these is a sense of being \"Premier\". Your \"P\" indicates fast movement, or transport, but there needs to be some element in their identity/brand that indicates that this is a premier company. Maybe it will come in the application treatments (metallic inks, elegant sophistication in type treatments, etc.). For starters, IMO, I don't think the green is contributing to this.\n\n"

It's off balance�heavy on the right (weight + motion). I think the \"P\" that you had before, with the tail on the last feather extending past the P-stem was more balanced. Also, the dot over the \"i\" is a little flat. It probably needs either less of an arc on the round/right side, or it just needs to be taller.   \n   \nOverall, I really like it.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"
