  "content": "Hello\n\nI am looking for an advice, or just your opinion:  \nI use the font \"Flexo\" ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/flexo/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022848/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/flexo/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/flexo/\") ) for all of my business-stuff (print and online), but I'm not completely satisfied with my online-pages look.\n\nIt's there: [http://davidbraun.ch](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022848/http:/davidbraun.ch/ \"http://davidbraun.ch\") and [http://davidbraun.ch/werkstatt](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022848/http:/davidbraun.ch/werkstatt \"http://davidbraun.ch/werkstatt\")\n\nShould I use a different font for the headlines? or rather the body? (My feeling is that flexo is better kept small...)  \nWhat would you recommend?  \nI once was very tempted to use emigre's vendetta, but my designer steered me away of this...  \nAnd a bit later, I stumbled upon a font that was looking very much like flex, but it was a font of its own, and it had an italic-variant... (but totally cannot remember what it was...)\n\nThanks very much for your time and insights\n\ndavid\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Flexo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022848/http:/typophile.com/files/Flexo.gif) | 12.13 KB |\n| [11997.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022848/http:/typophile.com/files/11997.png) | 26.09 KB |\n\n",
