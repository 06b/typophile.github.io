  "content": "I am doing another logo for a sleep testing company. The icon illustrates a girl asleep and laying against the moon. Her hair is wrapped around the moon to become the blanket when it comes back around. The logo is due Monday (I haven't had much time) so I can't do any major changes such as starting from scratch. Any suggestions would be appreciated.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205226im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35987.gif)   \n   \nAlso I have included my first idea for a logo. I went with the above idea because I felt the logo below was too abstract and just not very good.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205226im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35988.gif)\n\n",

I suspect she will go with the girl. She is the same client as Sleep Testing Solutions, a logo I did awhile back. I think she would dislike the abstract logo more than the other. Thank you for the compliment on the logos. My clients do rock.\n\n"
