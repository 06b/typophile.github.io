  "content": "Recently I was working on a project for a client, and realised that they used different fonts for their East Asian markets. I was looking in proposing one gothic CJK font for the whole region, but had to realise that that'snot so easy.\n\nI know there are Mircosoft fontswhich offer a complete CJK set, but looking for fonts with a good variety of weights, to mach them with the latin house-type, was not easy at all.\n\nFor the time we kept the 3 different fonts for C, J & K.\n\nDid anyone else have the same problem?\n\nj.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103114347im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cjk_5023.jpg)\n\n",

This is a topic of one of my IUC33 presentations that will take place in about two weeks.

But unfortunately I will not be able to come to San Jose.\n\nIt looks like there is no easy fix to my problem.\n\nI wonder how designers in the region deal with it? Are there foundries of fonts (i guess 4 localised versions) that match up?\n\n---  \nJH, London\n\n"

They went with the TTC approach, meaning that four separate font instances, one for each of the CJK locales (Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), are advertised. Send to me an email in a couple of weeks, after IUC33 is over, and I'll send to you my presentation about this topic.
