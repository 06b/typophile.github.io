  "content": "I'm new to type design but not typography. I'm a designer based in the UK and have always wanted to design a typeface. My first effort is for my company Distil hence Distil Sans. So far I've only done the light version and the lowercase letters using a combination of Iluustrator CS2 and Fontlab Studio 4.6. The other weights are mocked up using a stroke in illustrator but are close to what I would like the finished weights to be.\n\nI'd be grateful for any feedback at this point\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030627im_/http:/typophile.com/files/distil_5895.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [distil.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012030627/http:/typophile.com/files/distil.pdf) | 54.61 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "cheers, I know what you mean about the darker corners but i wanted it to stand out slightly but have a modern feel like Neo Sans or Neo Tech.\n\nJust finishing the other letterforms and adding some more weights, then I'll get the holding page changed. Cheers for the reminder. Then move on to designing the site itself!\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not a type designer, but rather a typographer/graphic  \ndesigner, but I will try and help you out.\n\nI'm not too sure about the dark areas either. Although I think  \nit does work in certain letters such as 'u' 'q' 'y' and 'g'. For me  \nit definately doesn't work in 'm' 'k' 'e' 'a' 'r' and 'h'. Try and  \nthink where such clotting might occur more naturally within  \nthe letters, as it does seem over forced.\n\nI don't like the shape of the 'w', 'x' or 'k'. Perhaps look at more  \nconventional shapes. It seems like you're trying too hard to  \nmake it stand out and seem original, probably because it's your  \nfirst design. Don't be scared of really nice, but simple letters. I  \nthink that a lot of peoples first type designs are quite gimmicky.\n\nThe bar on the 't' and 'f' needs to be stronger I feel.\n\nThe 'z' looks like it's leaning to the right. Perhaps extend he  \nbaseline stroke to the right a little to balance it out more.\n\nThe 's' looks upside down.\n\nThe 'a' doesn't look right. Perhaps avoid the completely flat base.  \nThe bowl also seems a little small and squashed vertically.\n\nThe 'e' looks a little awkward to me. Try extending the bottom  \nstroke and making that left side more curved.\n\nA good start though, and good luck!\n\nPhil\n\n"

It should feel more different from your a - maybe grab a curce from the upper left side of your o.\n\nFor this face to look even it can't be litterally even. There are illusions at work. The problem becomes more & more obvious as the weight gets heavier. See it? If you do some searching on the web you will find references as to the why & how of this.\n\n"

I'm working on the other weights and discovering themes and shapes which I may work back into the lighter weight. I hope you understand what I mean. The face is still work in progress.\n\nI was going to buy the book Designing Type by, I think its Carol Chan? Are there any other good books or websites which can help me with the basics?\n\nJerome\n\n"
