  "content": "If you're in or near London, the exhibition at the Royal Academy of pre-raphaelite paintings owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber has a nice surprise in the last room: a glass case containing eight or nine Kelmscott Press books. These haven't been mentioned in any review I read, and most of the people there didn't seem terribly interested in them, but having waded through all the stuff in the previous rooms (like one of ALW's musicals, the show is too long, very repetitive and left me feeling slightly nauseous), they were like a long cold drink.\n\n",
