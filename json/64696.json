      "content": "I subscribed to _U&lc_ in the 1980s. What vestige of memory I retain is not so much of any particular feature's design, illustration or content (although they were indispensable to the magazine's glamour), but the experience of receiving a very large foundry specimen of new typefaces, regularly, with paragraph showings of multiple weights in various sizes. That was the essence of the publication. (It was backed up by specimen booklets for each typeface, which I, as an agency art director, was given by my type house sales rep on his weekly visits.)\n\nAs a legacy, _U&lc_ is a convenient typographic archive that cements and enhances the importance of ITC and its faces during the foundry's heyday, despite their spotty reputation subsequently. However, the design work featured is not representative of typical design work of the era, or any other era--it is exceptional, \"creative\" work (see above) that appeals to the professional metaculture. So with regards to its content, the magazine's role in history will be myth-making.\n\nAdobe's _Font & Function_ and Emigre's _Emigre_, in the 1990s, could be compared.\n\n"

The design is a creative playground, not necessarily a mirror of its era. But a nice showcase of Ed Benguiatâ€™s work, especially in the early issues.\n\n"

We can now safely assume that the Secret Service has finally taken an interest in type. Or has the habit of fowling in dustbins spread to the other inhabitants of [Pullach](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228161032/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesnachrichtendienst), too?\n\nSCNR  \nAndreas ;-)\n\n"
