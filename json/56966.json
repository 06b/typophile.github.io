I'm new to FontLab and can't find answers on the web...\n\nI'm wondering how to connect two points that are on different paths. Every time I try to the program won't allow it, but will only on the same path. See attached image, I'm trying to join the two top points, and the lower 2 points. Any thoughts?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203084016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/B_5185.jpg)\n\n",
