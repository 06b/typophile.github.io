The reconfigured interface now includes a rollover list that quickly previews each font in the Sudtipos collection.\n\nAnother important addition to the site is the Sudtipos Probador™, our fully interactive type tester that allows users of the site to try any Sudtipos font on screen before licensing.\n\nTwo new sections were added, one to showcase the use of Sudtipos fonts by the general public, and one to preview upcoming fonts and projects in development.\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new Sudtipos web experience. Please direct any feedback to [sudtipos@sudtipos.com](mailto:sudtipos@sudtipos.com)\n\n",
