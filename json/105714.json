  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been designing my first typeface for the last few weeks and I run into a question:\n\n**How do you know the proper width for each glyph?**\n\nI'm worrying that, for instance, the width of my \"A\" is too long compared to other letters. Is there a mathematical way or something like that, other than just the naked eye to figure out the correct proportions?\n\nI'm mainly having this issue with the Caps.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "Well, some Italian renaissance artists believed that an accurate, geometric construction of letters according to the golden ratio, or divine proportion, was the correct way to go about it. Others like Giovanni Cresci believed that using the naked eye and one's own discretion was better. So there isn't one way in making it “proper”, but I'm sure there are guidelines I don't know about that could help you improve your typeface.\n\n"
