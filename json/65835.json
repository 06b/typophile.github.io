When Blippo originally was digitised only the basic character set was included.\n\nWhich is a shame, because there are a large number of popular display faces from the phototype era that had lots of interesting alternative shapes in their character sets, and those are lost until somebody has the brilliant idea to include them in a digital version. One of the classic examples is ITC Serif Gothic.\n\n"
