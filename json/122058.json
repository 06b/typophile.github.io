  "content": "Hi everyone!  \nI'm trying to identify what font(s) were used on this dial plate for a Watterson Radio that my dad is working on restoring, and having a hard time pinning down the exact font. It seemed similar to Futura with a few differences here and there. The radio was produced around the 1940's before the US entered World War II, so there weren't many of them made:  \n [http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/watterson\\_78.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053946/http:/www.radiomuseum.org/r/watterson_78.html \"http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/watterson\\_78.html\")\n\nI have the dial plate scanned if that helps out with identifying what font(s) was used on it. You can click on the image to see its full size:  \n [![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053946im_/http:/i.imgur.com/44lCUv2.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053946/http:/i.imgur.com/44lCUv2.jpg)\n\nIn the event that it's actually made specifically for those radios, is there something similar that could be used? Thanks for your time!\n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053946/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
