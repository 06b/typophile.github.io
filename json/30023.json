They have been Calligraphied in mirror symmetry by:  \n1 Transforming and manipulating the main letters and Ligatures.  \n2 Welding Last letter of the 1st word (Ba) with its mirror and Combining their Nuktas (dots) into one.  \n3 Combing First letter of the 2nd word (ALif) with its mirror into a down-arrow to stand for Male.  \n4 Duplicating and scaling Last letter of the 2nd (Ta) to form a circle with the 2 dots to stand for Female.  \n5 Distributing Nuktas (dots) where space allows without sacrificing readability.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124005843im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IranKhat3_4795.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124005843im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IranKhat1_5958.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124005843im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IranKhat2_5955.JPG)\n  \nHappy Exploring with [Flowers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124005843/http:/www.crauswords.com/flowers/WFlowers.htm)\n"

But I made a mistake in my explanation to that masterpiece of art, though it is a possible workaround. There, the 1st letter of the 2nd word (ALif) and its mirror have been combined into a slit-arrow to stand for Male as well as female. The Nukta (dot) centered above the said slit adds more meaning to the female dimension.\n\nSorry for the Confusion.\n\n"

Option needs to be open to gurantee survival. Any use of a font is a very legitimate use.\n\nThe grandfathers of Arabic calligraphy and scripts succeeded because they believed fully in this \"open entry\". The varieties and styles are so different and endless. Why anyone should close the curtain now?\n\nAziz wrote:\n\n\\>\\>That’s why people like these can claim simplifying the complex! and the fact of the matter, they are complicating the simplex.\n\nPersonally I do not like to use the words \"simple\", \"simplified\", or \"complex\". They are relative terms anyway. I one should look at it in term of open design and options. Thousands of Latin types today are so \"weird\" and \"complex\" when compared to mainstream types. Are there complicating Latin? No. It is about removing \"any and all\" artificial and arbitrary design limitations.\n\n-Saad\n\n"

And a lot of old scripts have overlaps and complex forms just like Arabic calligraphy. Did You think about comparing an old Latin calligraphic script with an old Arabic calligraphic script? However, Calligraphy and Typography are just different, and as the Arabic has been rich in Calligraphy, it has to be rich in typography too, and both have different values of quality. At least if Calligraphy is about the beauty of the sign's form, typography is about the readability and legibility of sign's form.. and excuse me, so far I fail to see the type of font in our Arabic world that really cares about \" readability\" yet, they mostly are a poor or clever transforming of a calligraphic font, or just an ugly/pretty display font.\n\nA.\n\n"
