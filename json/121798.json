I tried to add a gap on lowercase for a child-like appearance.\n\nI would appreciate any comments.  \nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317121431im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kari_font_01_3589.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I like it - it has a clean gentle Beatrix Potter feel. The extremely small x-height does not hinder legibility . The |f| is incongruous with its prominent capital-F-like stroke. The irregularity of the shapes is pleasing and gives a hand-made effect .. it reminded me somewhat of the new font being promoted for easy reading by dyslexics who cannot recognise symmetrical shape like q,p,b,d, so the glyphs are made irregular. The gaps are OK and might well serve another purpose - someone on typophile was recently looking for a font without closed counters for laser cutting. Good luck.\n\n"
