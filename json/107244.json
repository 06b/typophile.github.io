I edited it to look like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831111328im_/http:/typophile.com/files/UnknownStencil107244_3502.jpg)\n  \nI looked at various stencil fonts and none were a good match either for a base font or choice of where to make the stencil gaps.  \nI suspect this is custom logo work.  \nAnyway the base font is close to Helvetica Neue Black.  \nI did some cuts and minor further editing of A and the result looks like this:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831111328im_/http:/typophile.com/files/HelveticaNeueBlackStencil_5283.jpg)\n  \nPretty close.  \nYou could do the same to reproduce this part of the logo.  \nDon \n"
