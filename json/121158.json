This is a commercial project with the potential for Wide Distribution so I want to as clear about the legality as possible. Otherwise, I (with a bit of shame) would not really worry about it, but agin this is not that...\n\nI Heavily modified the font, not just computationally through interpolation, but also in more nuanced and pre-meditated ways that literally alter the letter forms at a fundemental level i.e. serifs, bowls, shoulders, etc.\n\nI have attached sample of the original I used and then the altered version(at 3/4 complete).\n\nOriginal\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317161656im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TNR_4978.png)\n\nDisplay\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317161656im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NTNR_3854.png)\n\n",

You should have started from scratch, not from altering someone else's font. However, for the final say, check the end user licence agreement or contact the originating foundry.\n\n"

Times New Roman is clunky so I made it not that or at least curbed it a bit. This is purely for the design of a book that maybe distributed commercially. Again I have no intentions in selling or distributing the font software, but merely to use what I created in an academic project, nonetheless I have sent monotype an email.\n\nDoes anyone know how URW++ and their numerous derivatives are able to be sold commercially?\n\nThanks,  \nDavid\n\n"
