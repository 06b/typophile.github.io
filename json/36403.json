  "content": "So I have received a BFA in graphic design at a school with a minimal type course selection. Typography has always been a small interest of mine, but its so easy to get demoralized by the depth of people’s knowledge of typefaces and their sometimes bizarre tastes and hatreds of specific families. I, technically, understand a decent amount of information about typefaces, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions if I want to get into it more.\n\nI can recognize the “big” type families, but whats the best way to get to know type better? Should I pick up some specimen books and spend hours studying them?\n\nI understand that the more I use type the more I’ll know about them, and be able to recognize faces. But you gotta start somewhere. What do you guys think, is there any wisdom you can bestow on me?\n\nI’m in Boston, MA if there is any regional specific wisdom you can provide.\n\n [‹ Choose Five Typefaces to use for a Year](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202183342/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36307 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Where to find MetaPlus font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202183342/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1885 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
