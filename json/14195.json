The heads of Linotype, FontShop, E+F, URW++, TypeBox, Porchez Typofonderie, etc. all give interviews for publications on a regular basis, so I’m sure that they would respond favorably to your book if you would ask them.\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20080205035117/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"
