  "content": "Last week, the typography team at Target was asked to give a presentation to a segment of the corporation. We had a lot of fun and wonderful feedback from our co-workers. It was a great way to show the unitiated what a real-life typesetter/typographer does. I thought I'd share just a portion of our presentation here. We took our lead from Ellen Lupton's \"Type Crimes\" concept from her [Thinking with Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424141053/http:/www.papress.com/thinkingwithtype/index.htm) book.\n\nYou can see some of the slides we created [**here**](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424141053/http:/ravenmn-typographypowerpoint.buzznet.com/user/photos/)\n\n",

(whores' children & cobblers' apprentices). I don't remember which was which, but you can use your imagination!\n\n"
