Looking which characters  \nuse to change from one style to the other I found in Adobe Jenson the next ones:\n\nnumbersign dollar percent zero one two three four five six seven eight nine cent sterling yen florin perthousand colonmonetary Euro\n\nBut I thought that probably there are some more characters  \nthat should change at least in the vertical position, for example:\n\nMinus multiply less greater etc.\n\nMy questions are:  \n. which is the recommended characters you should change in form or position  \nto make a complete OsF font style?  \n. is there any recommended link or tutorial for the correct way to write the otf replacement?\n\nthanks in advance for your answers.\n\nBest regards,  \nDarío\n\n",
