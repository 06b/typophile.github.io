      "content": "I did a bunch of searching for school scripts and other handwriting. The most similar ones I found were Monotype's [School Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074244/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/school-script/) and [Tension](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074244/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/tenison/) by Nicholas Garner. The latter would need to be bolded to look closer, but many of the letterforms seemed close, although better formed than your sample.\n\nDafont was not much help. This font connects rather well, and I suspect it is a commercial font from a small independent source.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
