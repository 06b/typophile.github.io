Designed by [Hardy Seiler](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/hardyseiler.de/) for [MINT Collective](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.mintcollective.de/), it is somehow similar to [Flower](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/flower), [Albertus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/albertus), [Quorum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/quorum), [Dragon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/dragon), [Memo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/memo) or [Amerigo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/amerigo). A [Copperplate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/copperplate) would work also nicely as base font ( [Copperplate Classic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/copperplate-classic) for instance).  \nYou may also be interested in [Tautz](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419224048/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/tautz).\n\n"
