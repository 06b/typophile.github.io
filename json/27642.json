If you'd like to exhibit some cultural cross-pollination in type, you need to be very subtle (like in this case you might use a Latin font with reverse stroke contrast, a really nice one being FF Balance). Unfortunately, subtlety tends to be a lost cause among most people these days... especially among those who insist on not paying for fonts. :-/\n\nhhp\n\n"
