Furthermore, SOTA is committed to sponsoring relevant topics in pursuit of these goals. SOTA pursues these goals through an annual conference, [TypeCon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeCon), held in a different host city each year.\n\nSOTA was formed in 1998 by typophile [Bob Colby](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bob%20Colby), with the mission to increase public awareness and appreciation of the art and history of typography and its function in creating beautiful and successful communications. In keeping with these goals, SOTA is defined as a cultural (rather than a business) organization.\n\n**Executive Officers** (2014)  \nChristopher Slye, [Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe) Systems — _Chair_  \nJuliet Shen, [Shen Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/www.shendesign.com/) & [School of Visual Concepts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/www.svcseattle.com/) — _Vice Chair & Secretary_  \nNeil Summerour, [Positype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Positype) — _Treasurer_\n\n**Members of the Board** (2014)  \nCorey Holms, [Corey Holms Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/coreyholms.com/)  \n [Grant Hutchinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Grant%20Hutchinson), [Typostrophe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/typostrophe.com/) & [Butter Label](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102951/http:/butterlabel.com/)  \nFrank J.
