  "content": "From ATypI-Rome, quickly:   \nAfter guarding the details exceptionally well, ATypI announced the awarding of the coveted Prix Charles Peignot to none other than Jonathan Hoefler - well deserved. And to think he's only 32.   \n   \nBTW, the conference this year is the best one I've been to yet, mostly because everybody is being particularly nice, but also because last night we were a party of 10 for dinner, we had 9 bottles of wine, and two of us didn't drink. Panadol to the rescue.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",
