  "content": "This font is in a new Acura commercial called \"Drive like a boss.\" It flashed for a few seconds on screen. I also found a \"making of video\" released by Acura on Youtube and it also has the same font with even more characters. I included all the possible text from the videos in the image.\n\nPlease help me identify this font. And if you know of similar fonts, please suggest those as well.\n\nHere is the \"making of video\" on youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jZOJDupNIw](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053639/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8jZOJDupNIw)\n\nThanks.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Acura Bespoke \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053639/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [boss.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053639/http:/typophile.com/files/boss_0.jpg) | 210.26 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Can't agree more with Kevin, very \"Avant-Gard-ish\" or rather Futura with some earmarks of Avant-Garde Gothic (open /R, /G...). Wasn't able to spot a match either so maybe it'd be not so hazardous to conclude it is bespoke and exclusive for Acura which could make sense when talking about (high-end) car manufacturing.\n\nEDIT: confirmed. Embedded as webfont on their [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053639/http:/www.acura.com/FutureVehiclesILX.aspx) under the name of 'Acura bespoke'.\n\nEDIT2: should have been designed by half of VoidWreck [Karl Nawrot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053639/http:/www.voidwreck.com/) for [Mullen](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053639/http:/www.mullen.com/tag/acura)\n\n"
