The font name will be shown on the right-hand side in the panel at the bottom of the screen. You might want to click on the tab ‘Fonts’ in Firefox or ‘Computed’ in Chrome for a neater overview.\n\nOther handy options: Chrome [WhatFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416180953/http:/chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html) app by Chengyin Liu and [Fontface Ninja](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416180953/http:/fontface.ninja/)\n\n"
