Was given this animated gif and told to create another.  \nPretty straight forward project except client wants everything recreated exaclty as the first version except for a change in pics.They do not have the source file for the original. Got everything done except animating the text.\n\nAppreciate if anyone can tell me what font was use in the animated text.  \nTHANKS!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [banner\\_seek1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109021524/http:/typophile.com/files/banner_seek1.gif) | 15.97 KB |\n\n",
