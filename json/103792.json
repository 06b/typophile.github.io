  "content": "Hi typopohile!\n\nI am working on a display block typeface that I started because I believe that no block-display type exists with full functionality. For example baby teeth, the letters are great but the numbers arent so good, like the 7, in my opinion of course.\n\nSeeing this I decided to propose a new system where I though it would be a good idea to make it mono-spaced, so it blocks even more, however it doesnt work with the Hebrew and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nThe pdf that is attached shows what i have so far.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [combo.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317192349/http:/typophile.com/files/combo.pdf) | 426.22 KB |\n\n",

I agree with the other comments.\n\nOn the Hebrew: I think it is very angular and much less bold compared to the Latin and Cyrillic. You could try to be more elaborate with the shapes I think. I have no idea how readable this is, but I had toyed with the idea of Hebrew letter shapes like this a year or two ago.\n\nHere's an old sketch I did. You probably want to make sure to keep it heavy like the other scripts and also make sure you can read the letters. (My example my be a bit exaggerated here...)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317192349im_/http:/typophile.com/files/early_hebrew_sketch_3927.JPG)\n\n"

Its really hard to get them into a system+make them readable.  \nAlso I coudnt find any reference, do you know any?\n\nThanks for your sketch :)  \nNow that i see yours, I realise what is missing in my type. It really need some more thinking.\n\nThank you again Bryan, you are really supportive!\n\n"
