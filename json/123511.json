      "content": "Definitely based on Stratum 1 (this /W and those numerals can't lie) and massively used on their [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/realalebrewing.com/) with [Vonness](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Vonness) Condensed. I also don't know any \"Stratum-like with flare serifs\" like they did. You may like some fonts by Mattox Shuller of [Fort Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Fort_Foundry) like Industry, Industry Inc. and Gin (some sort of \"condensed Stratum-like with latin serifs\") that looks pretty appropriated for such branding identity.  \nSome more but far less close: [Boucherie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/boucherie)/ [Charcuterie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/charcuterie) Block, [Burford](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/creativemarket.com/KimmyDesign/153940-Burford), [Brothers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/brothers-ot), [Dealers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fcreativemarket.com/Gumpita/49869-Dealers), [Braingelt](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/braingelt), LHF's [Roebuck](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/roebuck.php), [Antique Half Block](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/antiquehalfblock.php) and [Old Stock](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/letterheadfonts.com/fonts/oldstock.php), [Reidfork](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/creativemarket.com/swistblnk/75323-Reidfork), [Wooderson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/creativemarket.com/sirmon/155210-Wooderson), [Page Ephesian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/page-ephesian-nf), [Companion League](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426172402/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fcreativemarket.com/Gumpita/9482-Companion-League)\n\n"
