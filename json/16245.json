At first I fell for this, and started thinking of candidates.\n\n\\> _i am working on a client who has requested that his book be set in a ‘new’ typeface, something made since 1980_\n\nDid he give you a reason why? Is it related to the content of his book? Does he have a “thing” for type or for type designers? And why does this designer HAVE to be living? There have been excellent designers who have passed on since the 80s. Are their designs elimated just because they are dead?\n\n\\> _for his last book, he used a face from a young dutch designer_\n\nI’m curious who. Can you tell us who?\n\n\\> _now is interested in working with an american typographer’s work._\n\nAgain, what relevance does this have? Why the “best” designer? Why not the “best” typeface. Many of the great designers have also created a doggie doo face or two. Selecting the “best” living type designer will not necessarily get you the “best” or most relevant typeface for his book.\n\nAlso, using the “best” designer’s “best” typeface is not going to make his book a “best” seller. Plus, it’s not JUST the selection of type, it’s HOW the type is used, and WHY it integrates with the design of the book.\n\nSo in summary, it’s the right type for the right job.  \nAnd any “great” designer or typographer who is not conceited will tell you that.\n\n"
