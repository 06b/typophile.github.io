Many of them are revivals of older, metal typefaces, but are based on a model size that's much larger (12pt or 14pt) than the size at which they'll actually get used. The result is fine, light, wispy text type, instead of the solid, easily-read black type of classical book printing.</cite>\n\nSimilarly, we hear a lot of complaints about too many light anemic-looking typefaces being used in books. Would it help to come up with an introductory list that people can refer to see what their options are to overcome this problem?\n\n1. MVB Verdigris  \n2. ?  \n3. ?\n\nRahim\n\n",

The three basic fractions have been written into a {frac} substitution; the three basic superiors are in a {sups} substitution; and the two basic ordinals are in a {ordn} substitution.\n\nBut, for instance, no attempt has been made yet to integrate SC fonts with their Romans. That will have to wait for the development of ProOT fonts. AFAIK, the FB ProOT standard is still being finalized. I would imagine that Miller would be high on the list of FB fonts for re-development, but I have no specific knowledge.\n\nBTW, simple OT fonts are the same price point as the other formats. And I believe that if you already have a license for FB fonts in PS or TT format, you can get the equivalent sOT by request. But don't quote me on that.

It was built to withstand the worst printing conditions: low quality papers, high printing speed with web presses and variations in the ink level of the printing press. More…\n\nSome of Karmina’s most representative features are the rather large serifs, intended to work perfectly in small reproduction sizes, the sharpness of the shapes, including some calligraphic reminiscences, and the large and yet graceful ink traps in the acute connections. Structurally, Karmina combines a significantly large x-height with relatively compressed letterforms. The result of these features grants Karmina outstanding legibility and economy.\"\n\nDo you think Iowan Oldstyle's large x-height and dark color give it similar advantages when used in small sizes and bad printing conditions, leaving aside that it is not economically compact as Karmina?\n\nJust trying to learn,  \nRahim\n\n"

One needs to take care with the specs, but it can work fine. It's large x-height and proportions give it a particularly approachable feeling that is not appropriate for all settings, but works well in certain others.

So I'm going to go out a limb and see what you all make of a few ideas; there'll probably be some words that are \"non-tech,\" but I'll try to make the point.\n\nOne: Perhaps the \"busy\" and the redundancy Nick spoke of are essential to what so many of us want in book faces because they break up the uniformity of letter shapes and thus help them form into specific units (words) more easily. Maybe they also impart some basically recognizable features to specific letters. Some \"g-ness\" or \"q-ness.\" & those nesses help readers put them together into words.\n\nTwo: Perhaps there is some cultural familiarity at work here also. Perhaps readers come to \"know\" book faces (which are faces with these redundancies and busy parts) from early days of reading, and so these become established as \"book faces.\"\n\nThat's as far as I am able to go now. I'm already feeling over my head. But behind it I'm sure are some of the factors that have made me accept some faces and reject others for the work I do. I'm sure–I hope–there is something more to it than \"I don't like this type.\"\n\nTo Hrant and my original question to him: Perhaps in my general inclination to agree with you I am just echoing what I was told as a kid compositor. But there's some basis for it. Some years ago I learned that the Monotype house I used had TNR with long descenders. So we designed a quarterly newsletter with those descenders, and the thing did look notably better (letterpress). At this remove I cannot say if it read any better.\n\nI cited a few weeks ago in another thread the 900 pages I recently read in ITC Garamond. It was easy as pie, easy on my eyes. The most recent tome was 700 pages in Adobe Caslon, which I found more difficult to read. What gives there?\n\nBack to work for me.\n\npowers\n\n"

My take on it is that different aspects have different advantages.\n\nSerifs have four advantages:  \n1. Help the eye hold the line.  \n2. Make the ends of strokes easier to detect. Tests have shown that the extremes in a glyph are more salient for reading.  \n3. I think serifs also help to get even color while having wide enough spacing to relieve crowding.  \n4. They also probably contribute to a distinctive \"word image\" better than sans. For example, a \"b\" and \"d\" are more different in a serif than a sans.\n\nSome variations in design help evenness of color--for example, making the end of the r heavier than the end of the s.\n\nSome variations help break up the \"picket fence\"--the tendency of too much vertical emphasis and a dazzle, which is always threatening in roman type, and is bad for text.\n\n"

Both verged a bit too much toward hagiography, but that's always a danger of biography.\n\nCaslon types have never pleased me very much.
