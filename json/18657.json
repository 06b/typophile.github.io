Just similar and it looks a lot like [Memina](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106112305/http:/www.type-o-tones.com/p_fonts/p_memi.htm).

As such, it’s not exactly a digital knockoff, but not a responsible design either. Though we disagree on the ethics, [Luc Devroye](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106112305/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/westwind.html) basically proves its similarity to MeMima on his site.\n\n"
