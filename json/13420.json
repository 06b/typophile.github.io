At the time he started, I  \nwould guess Caslon was probably the most used typeface in books. I  \nbelieve he continued the practice. So you are receiving a tradition.\n\nHistorically, probably [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20131221004412/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garamond) should be the one, as it really seems  \nto be the architype of printed letters following it.\n\nCaslon has through the centuries been probably the most widely used  \ntypeface for the English language, but also controversial. Some say  \nit is a collection of mistakes, and others that it has a great  \nharmony and readability as a whole. Perhaps the controversies over it  \nmake it still a good place to start.\n\n"

I came up with much the same information that William posted — and a little bit more. I thought I would share this with you, in case you were interested, too.:\n\n\"Despite the many hundreds of text faces designed since 1460, the original old style faces (Garamond, Plantin, Janson, Caslon, etc.) are still considered to be among the most readable ever designed and therefore, are commonly used in publications where an abundance of continuous text is necessary. The essential humanistic qualities of this type style (a sense of rhythm, strong horizontal stress, with a flowing, easy interaction between characters) are commonly strived for in contemporary typeface design even, occasionally, in sans serif.\"  \n— taken from [David Jury's](http://web.archive.org/web/20131221004412/http:/typophile.com/wiki/David%20Jury) [About Face: Reviving the rules of typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20131221004412/http:/typophile.com/wiki/About%20Face%3A%20Reviving%20the%20rules%20of%20typography)\n\n[D.B. Updike](http://web.archive.org/web/20131221004412/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.B.%20Updike) explains the popularity of Caslon's type thus: \"While Caslon modelled his letters on Dutch types, they were much better; for he introduced into his fonts a quality of interest, a variety of design, and a delicacy of modelling, which few Dutch types possessed. Dutch fonts were monotonous, but Caslon's fonts were not so. His letters, when analyzed, especially in the smaller sizes, are not perfect, individually; but in mass their effect is agreeable\". Caslon does not have the elegance of Garamond's letters but their 'defects' are recognized as being typically Anglo-Saxon and as such have come to represent perfectly the sturdy English tradition in typography.\n\nThanks!\n\n"

Not a big Bodoni fan.\n\nSo, from your point of view, it would probably be more straightforward to render a Didone, but perhaps the idea is that there's more to learn from something that's not so predictable. Also, it has a trace of the angled pen, which is interesting.\n\nIf you're lettering it by hand, it's probably quite forgiving, so not a bad place to start.\n\n"

On the other hand, anybody who's been to Spain might excuse that. :-)\n\nIn the case of Caslon, frankly I think that to some degree at least sloppiness has been mistaken for creative flair. A certain \"warmth\" in the forms is great (everybody knows I'm not exactly the biggest fan of Bodoni...) but there's a difference between that and just not caring for consistency, which can only harm the unity of the design. Which is not to say that such consistency should preclude good craft - and to me the high point of Caslon is in fact the tricks he pulls in the Italic UC \"Q\":\n\n[http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/caslon\\_q.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131221004412/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/caslon_q.gif \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/caslon\\_q.gif\")\n\nNot only is it non-linear, there's even topological variance, all brilliantly done.

I don't know that we'd have seen William Morris' humanist revivals, let alone the work of Morison or Benton or Griffith, had it not been for the renewed interested in Caslon.\n\nCaslon was in sufficient use for the next hundred years that the \"Caslon\" name underwent the usual dilution in the marketplace. Every American foundry that had a Caslon type that bore some resemblence to the types of William Caslon had a greater number of \"Caslon\" types that didn't -- \"Caslon Antique\" and \"Caslon Open\" are two that survive today, real canards that have nothing to do with any of the Caslons. The 1923 ATF book is full of antiques (!) and moderns (!!) named \"Caslon.\"\n\nIt's possible that anyone picking Caslon for a freshman assignment is doing so because thirty years ago, it was one of the designs most readily accessible in a variety of media (from Presstype to Linotronic output.)
