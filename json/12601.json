  "content": "Today, James completed this totally amazing nameplate for a custom bass guitar. The mother of pearl shell is .060\" thick and he used a jeweller's saw to cut the letters completely through the shell. Then the sawn out sections are filled with a mixture of epoxy and ebony dust.\n\nThe plate is to be installed on a fingerboard with a twelve inch radius, so the form will distort a little after shaping. On the next one, I'll correct the artwork to allow for this final step.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [flax\\_direwolftext.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106070203/http:/typophile.com/files/flax_direwolftext.jpg) | 81.5 KB |\n\n",

The next one will be \"Scooter\" inlaid with the same technique, but with a different font, something to pay tribute to his recently deceased cat.\n\n"
