I tried to leave everything else alone. The characters themselves appear fine, but there seems to be a glitch (stray point? reversed curve?) in one of the fonts because the line spacing gets expanded, even during a FontBook preview.\n\nI am using FontForge, and it doesn't seem to indicate any particular problem.\n\nCould someone take a look at these and see if the error jumps out at them? Even narrowing it down to which variant is the troublemaker would be helpful.\n\n_[Link removed by me]_\n\nThanks!\n\n",

(I only see horizontal in the menu?) That could have been automatically set somehow? At one point I tried connecting an open path with an arc during edits, and it created a big loop out into the netherworld. I think I successfully undid that change, but maybe it altered that vertical setting in the process.\n\nI also did save them once with a stray point, and maybe that altered things?\n\nReally appreciate it!\n\n-Steve\n\n"

When we have a more final cover design for the book, I'll definitely post it here for critique.\n\n"
