Most of what he said was on the theme of conservation, which is an interesting angle. Though he admitted it was a talk he often gives with Frere-Jones (who wasn’t there) it still seemed quite relevant. I suppose it’s quite difficult to dislike the man anyway.\n\nI was amazed that one bloke got up and got Hoefler to sign an autograph!\n\nAs for Froelich, well, I shoudn’t say too much. I thought the magazine she art directs for the NY Times that she talked about was quite mediocre. In fact, don’t get me started on the fractur T!\n\nI wondered if anyone else had any thoughts?\n\n [‹ ScrollBar on Typophile home page?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412011637/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44109 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Forge ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412011637/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42915 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
