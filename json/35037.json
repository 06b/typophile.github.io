I just opened up all my Berthold fonts in Type Tool and discovered, much to my dismay, that their fonts seem sloppily drawn: baselines and cap heights consistently don't match one another between letters or even in the same letter. None of my other fonts seem to do this. Is it normal, or are they optical adjustments that I don't understand?\n\nMany thanks for your input!\n\n",

So while the outlines of Berthold's Futura might be inconsistent, I'd bet that Berthold's own designs were digitized to an extremely high level of precision. Berthold allowed Adobe to produce and distribute PS versions of their fonts only after Adobe proved that they could match Berthold's data exactly. Check one of the BQ originals like Formata, Comenius or Pontifex.\n\n"

The entire collection had been hastily scanned and converted to raw fonts in PS font format, but the finishing of the raw fonts was not possible due to the sudden liquidation of the company by the Berlin court.\n\nIn my documentation \"The mentally deranged graphic designer as font buyer\" I proved for another font collection that not all, but most font buyers are mentally deranged graphic designers. For the Berthold \"Quality\" collection it can be proved too that not all, but most font buyers are mentally deranged graphic designers.\n\nSeveral years after the liquidation of the H. Berthold AG, an American confidence trickster couple declared themselves to be the legal successors of the defunct H. Berthold AG stock corporation, and after appropriating the raw fonts, they declared themselves to be the copyright owners. For the past 10 years this couple has been selling these raw fonts in order to cheat mentally deranged graphic designers, who have not been mentally able to notice that the \"Quality\" fonts are the raw, unfinished font files.\n\nDuring these past 10 years, it seems that Mr. Yoshiki Waterhouse is the first to notice that there is something wrong with the Berthold \"Quality\" fonts. This proves that not all font buyers are mentally deranged.\n\n"
