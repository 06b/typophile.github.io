  "content": "Hello.   \n   \nI've been playing around with connecting script. I see already that it can be a serious pain in the panini to space these things (getting the connections AND the spacing to work). Anyone have some practical advice for the construction phase that would help ease the heartburn in the spacing process?   \n   \nSeems like maybe you want to do all your spacing at the glyph-shape level and set the sidebearings at the connections. Make sense? If so, what should be going through my head as I draw up the glyphs (practical checks)?   \n   \nThanks.   \nRandy\n\n",
