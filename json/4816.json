This is of some concern, but probably only to me, so thanks.   \n   \nI'd agree with you that the hand punchcutter would not have been concerned with optical scaling as it would have been a natural organic process to them. As it is for a calligrapher. Calligraphers don't change to a fatter brush or pen when they are working with different sizes of letterforms. These restrictions have been forced on us by the mechanical.   \n   \nSometimes, perhaps, it is best to look at the origins and rationalize forward from there, rather than backward from here. The virtual, and the mechanical, have a naughty tendency to cloud the way.   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant,   \n   \n_Which makes the results inferior to typography, of course._  \n   \nI am sure you mean \"different\" rather than \"inferior\". The comparison points to the painter vs the photographer. The comparison does not stand the test of scrutiny. A deft hand can not be termed inferior to _playing on the see�saw of bezier points._ More precision is involved in the activity of motion, there is no eraser. Or, Undo button. Remove those functions from your computer and see if your type is any match.   \n   \nDigital typography is a band aid of errors. Imagine if all errors were preserved for the customer to see. Calligraphers have to be pretty precise. You can see what they are up against including unfair comparisons.   \n   \n\"Zen precise\" in craftsmanship is not a bad thing.   \n   \n������������������   \n   \nSorry, soon but not yet I will look to see if I can find our optical scaling software. I will also look for ATF's software, we were given that for review when we entertained purchasing the company.   \n   \nI am not sure if I will sell those books but if you are still interested I could make up a list of what I can find. There is a substantial library of typographical books, type catalogues, books on the trade, historical books, books on founding, and examples of fine printing.   \n   \nOne is an extremely rare mechanical examination of the history of the type mould. A very interesting read. This work in included in a much larger work of multiple topics which is why no one has ever heard of it. The other materials are about the history of China and the history of coins. I have no idea as to why they would include the history of the type mould within. The book is a set of three volumes, and is in itself, very beautiful. But the material on the mould is exceptional. Including a printing of 2 1/2 point hand set type. A marvel to see, a marvel to set, and a marvel of presswork. The setting is a book page. You may need better glasses.   \n   \nYou will forever after see Gutenberg's Bible in a very different light. This book leads you to conclude that Gutenberg did not print from movable type. Possible that it was set in wood and most likely cast in slugs.   \n   \nAlthough the author does not state such. You have to look at his page yourself to draw your own conclusions. Certainly Gutenberg printed in a method other than what most think.   \n   \nYou ask?   \n   \n_1) Does/will your Californian have optical scaling?_   \n   \nNo, not until you and I determine the best way to go with optical scaling. I am not a big supporter of many different fonts representing point sizes. At least not ones that you have to pick and choose. User friendly would be nice, you know, a Beatrice Warde kind of thing.   \n   \nSense has to be driven into those OpenType donkies.   \n   \nLanston's Californian is the most authentic vesion of Goudy's Californian. These lead patterns are depicted in in Goudy's book _Typologia._ These patterns survived the fire by the off chance that Lanston had them for cutting punches for composition. Other wise they would have melted along with his others.   \n   \nAlthough we have not yet decided we may include 1 lead pattern for each of the first buyers.\n\n"

Uncomfortable letterspacing caused by the very limited ability to kern letters easily, especially noticable at large sizes._   \n      \n   \nThese traits do not apply to Monotype therefor not to Monotype Bembo.

In other words, do you feel your digital versions of his types live up to his (Goudy's) expectations of his metal types? And please, this is no attack--I just want to know your opinion._   \n   \n(1.) The patterns were very lightly inked, proofs were pulled on a Vandercook #4.   \n   \n [http://lanstontype.com/GiampaProofPress.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051322/http:/lanstontype.com/GiampaProofPress.html)   \n   \n(2.) The inked proofs were hand digitized on a very high resolution tablet. The software is Ikarus, 15,000 units vs Fontographer 1000 units.   \n   \n(3.) The digitized outlines were laser output on onion skin paper at _\"exact\" same size_ as the inked proofs.   \n   \n [http://lanstontype.com/PatternIkarus.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051322/http:/lanstontype.com/PatternIkarus.html)   \n   \n(4.) Laser output positioned over the inked proofs would illustrate clearly the minutest deviance allowing for easy perfection.   \n   \nIf Goudy was happy with his own lead master patterns certainly he would be equally happy with the _digital mastering._   \n   \nAs objects he may prefer lead to polymer, I know I do.   \n   \nAs far as his opinion of desktop publishing goes I can not speak to that matter.   \n   \nGerald Lange has spoken of Goudy's welcoming Photocomp with open arms. I wonder how happy he really was \"without\" drawn small caps, ligatures and tied characters.   \n   \nI suspect he was greatly disappointed.   \n   \nWould Goudy be happy with digital type? Well, if he liked Photocomp I see no reason he would not like digital type. I don't, but that's just me.   \n   \nI believe Goudy would have continued drawing letterforms with pen and paper. He would prefer, I predict, Ikarus over Fontographer or FontLab for outlining.   \n   \nI know I do, I know Jim does. Ikarus is the finest method for digitizing paper artwork. Not so for originating typefaces. Ikarus is not a drawing tool.\n\n"

I suspect though that Goudy's interest in designing was at the forefront over other concerns he had and most likely he would have gladly participated in the digital world. Especially so because of the residuals!!!   \n   \nThanks for the step by step on how you digitized the patterns. There were some Monotype patterns up on eBay a while back (Felicity). $360, no reserve, and they went unsold. Hard to believe. By the way, don't give away those Californians. You asked me a while back about an institutional home. I believe I now have found one. This will have to be offlist.   \n   \nI gave up completely on metal about five or six years ago. Partly I was quite enthused about the direction of digital type, of which you were an inspirational factor, and partly I found the process eliminated a lot of the restrictions imposed by metal type technology. Not a bad thing to have learned those restrictions mind you. But, more importantly, had I not fully gone over to photopolymer, I would be plumb out of business. You more than most, would understand the problems that maintaining a shop of metal type related technology imposes in this regard.   \n   \nYes, photopolymer as a type form does not have the je ne sais quoi of metal, but my concern has always been the printed page rather than idle homage to technology. I'd rather be stirring the cauldron than watching from the cheering and/or jeering crowd.   \n   \nGerald L.\n\n"

I never said calligraphy is _easier_ than type design - that's moot. I'm looking at it from the viewpoint of the user/reader, who could care less what tools you enjoy fondling and what your childhood was like.   \n   \nIn calligraphy, the lack of variance in stroke thickness with respect to size is a problem when it comes to optimal letterform quality. Because type design is non-instantaneous, it allows for the considered, conscious control of things like weight (and its ideal distribution).

Lanston Monotype produced the comp sizes for the University's use, and Goudy cut the 14 to 36 point display at his workshop.   \n   \nYou are aware since you own the patterns that the fce when it was done ws named Univerist of California Old Style. Goudy had wanted to name it simply University, but the directors of the school felt the name to be too generic.   \n   \nIn the mid fifties Lanston revised the design for its own purposes of production and sold the design under the current name, Californian.   \n   \nIf you dig out your original \"Typologia\" (mine went astray years ago on a loan to an unprincipled-book-non-returner- bugger!) you can search out just what Goudy cut. I believe that at the time all the sizes made for the University were done by Goudy at his workshop, and the type cast by him. I seem to recall that he cut 14, 18 and 24, with few sorts for titling cut in 36.   \n   \nYou can tell from Typologia just how much he did. I do know that all the early sizes and cast types were done by Goudy.   \n   \nIncidentally, and for what it's worth, I have been involved in letterpress since I was a kid, and I will always like it. It feels good and it suits me. I Have no negative opinions about printing with polymer plates. If that feels good to the person doing it, then that's a good enough reason for them to do it; and they will make a buck much easier into the bargain.   \n   \nI don't give a rat's butt about all of letterpress's perceived drawbacks mentioned by others on this thread. Most of the problems noted were the result of poor craftsmanship and are hardly the fault of the craft. About the \"bad\" fitting of Linotype: it was one of the best ways of getting type set quickly and economically in acommercial world, and refinement mats were made to overcome all of the problem pairs. The refinement matrices had to be placed in the assembler by the operator by hand, and if was not done it was simply for lack of caring or for lack of the special refinement mats. Much work done on the Linotype was good by any standard. If there were a few inherent weaknesses in the technology, there seems little to be gained in lamenting it now. The Linotype, like other composing machines that preceded was the result of a gradual progression toward excellence and production.   \n   \nI am certain that 30 years from now the same kind of stuff will be said about the very best of what is available to us today in typography.   \n   \nWithout Buddy Bolden there would have been no popular music as we know it now.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

      "content": "My comments were not intended to be an attack on letterpress at all. Done well, letterpress was and remains great. I too have a great affection for it: we had a little Adana hand press at school were we used to produce much of the jobbing work (letterheads, business cards etc) the school needed, and I loved it and all that went with it. Needless to say, our efforts were terrible.   \n   \nMy only point: sometimes letterpress is over-romanticized. There is a tendency to compare the average mediocre of today with the best letterpress of yesterday. That is not a fair comparison. Getting letterpress right was hard. It required taste and judgment at every stage: in design, in composition, in printing. It also had (at least in some forms of the technology) some real drawbacks typographically -- poorly fitted Linotype italics being, one.   \n   \nPrinting has always had its nostalgic element. In the early 20th century, people looked back on handsetting, hand presswork, dampened paper and so on. \"Machine typesetting and high-volume printing,\" they said to themselves, \"what a falling away from the glories of the past.\" No doubt there were people who sadly lamented the decline of calligraphy in the face of movable type.   \n   \nAnd of course, they were in one sense right. But I cannot help feeling that there is another story to tell. For with each technological change, though something has been lost, there has also been something gained.   \n   \nSo far as the move from metal typesetting to \"flat\" typesetting is concerned, of course there are losses. But they are not all to be regretted, especially if one looks at the quality of the average printed item, not the very best or worst.   \n   \nThe really important thing is to work out what the important losses are, and whether they are really necessary. Many of the losses that have been made in the move from letterpress to litho, and in digitization, are not inevitable. With experience, designers of type for photographic composition can produce good designs. It is hardly surprising that in the infancy of that particular art some poor digitization took place, and some noble faces (Centaur, Bembo, Baskerville) were -- perhaps only temporarily -- vastly diminished. The real pity now is that with so much that is good and designed specifically for digital setting, the pallid ghosts of these old faces continue to haunt so many pages. Optical sizing (where it matters: I suspect it is now being overdone; a sceptic like Hrant might like to note that it is very much in the economic interests of digital foundries to push optical variants) can be recovered. Ligatures have always been there to be used, and only laziness or ignorance limits their proper use.   \n   \n   \nThe real loss may be the loss of craft. Digitization democratizes type. It blurs the distinction between the amateur and the professional, and between the trained and experienced professional and the novice. As software becomes more skilful in saving us from the mistakes of ignorance, the value of craft knowledge is reduced. Mr Rimmer is right to say: \"Those errors you point to are failures of technique\". So they are. And in saying that, he has behind him the legitimate pride of the craftsman who has had to learn that technique and who feels, however dimly, the massed generations of those by whom the technique was developed and handed down. Digitization threatens to cut that link with the past, and reduced (not, of course, eliminated--by no means) the significance of craft training and skills.   \n   \nIt is this, which is a cultural and human question, that seems to me to be the core issue digitization poses -- not the mere \"loss\" of a few old typefaces, or optical sizes, or faked small capitals. Those are problems that can easily enough be solved. But craft skills (which are learned but not taught, largely unwritten, and largely incommunicable in writing) once lost are hard to recover.   \n   \n(This, of course, is not a new problem. It is the constant problem posed by industrialization. It is no less real for that, even if I do sound like William Morris.)\n\n"

I read a technical report where it was suggested as 5%. \"   \n   \nGerald--I was wondering where you might have read this? While I have noticed that different types of plate material seem to gain differently during platemaking (case in point, a Printight plate I processed recently seemed to gain a lot more than a Jet plate I made from the same neg), it would seem to me hard to hold fine line screens on material that gains 5% in platemaking. 5% seems like the \"Mac Truck\" that G. Giampa was talking about! At 200 lpi I can't imagine these plates holding a reverse dot.   \n   \nAnd if this indeed happens, I wonder if offset plates have the same sort of gain during platemaking. I've never read anything about this phenomenon before, but since it's also a film-based platemaking process I have to wonder.   \n   \nBut I have to admit I'm a skeptic that the platemaking is the root of letterpress's gain. Pulling a plate with minimal ink on a coated piece of paper shows minimal gain. Placing the neg overtop this proof shows very little difference between the neg and the plate. Print that same plate with enough ink to transfer well to an uncoated book paper, and a lot of gain occurs--enough to be visible, anyway. While gain might occur during platemaking, I still think that more occurs from the printing process.   \n   \nAnother reason that thin typefaces might appear more substantial when printed by letterpress from photopolymer is the thicker ink film that transfers to the paper on press. I believe I've read that the ink film is four times as thick as the ink film transfered during offset printing. This extra density gives weight and, when properly printed, a sparkle to the type.   \n   \nOkay, sorry to be talkin' shop here. This has been an interesting read so far and I hope I'm not deadening it.   \n   \nHarold\n\n"

It takes quite a bit of practice to get it right so that the type is defined and crisp.   \n   \nMy approach, after screwing up a lot in the beginning, is to start piece with almost no ink. Next a pleasing amount of impression, without the extreme crushing of the paper so popular with some.

It is absolutely necessary to print onto hard packing and not into a soft base.   \n   \nUnder-impressed, overinked type was what was aimed for in the trade in the fifties, in a bid to \"immitate\" litho and its planographic look.

Some of the mistakes can be excused, as the inevitable birth pangs of a new technology. Some was just sloppiness -- and often as much on the part of users as on the part of the foundries. Use, say, Centaur without using oldstyle figures and ff ligatures, or with faked small capitals, when all are available, and you get what you deserve.   \n   \nBut I do think letterpress is misunderstood, and to some extent, if I may use the word, idolised. It, too, had its limitations. There are some things that digital type can (or could) do easily (kerning; justification which is best for the paragraph as a whole, not just the line; hanging punctuation) which were hard to do with movable type. And, I willingly grant, other freedoms that are less welcome (such as messing with tracking, slanting, the creation of fake sorts and so on). Unfortunately, the good points have perhaps been too little developed, and the bad points remain. But hopefully that is a matter of time. It does not seem inherent in the technology.

Despite the absence of any physical 'body', we are still essentially treating type as sequences of rectangles, rather than as sequences of letterforms. This paradigm is particularly obvious in our discussions about spacing: we talk about sidebearings and kerning as if this were the normal way to space letterforms, when any scribe or stonecutter would look at you funny if you suggested that he imagine a rectangle behind every letter and shift these rectangles and overlap or space them out. We talk solemnly about how the design of white space between and within letters is as important as the design of the letters themselves, but we continue to work with a paradigm that massively limits the ability to actually design the space between letters without the perverse explosion of thousands of kern pair adjustments to overcome the limitation of the rectangle.   \n   \nA few years ago, on the comp.fonts newsgroup I believe, Laurence Penney described a possible spacing model for digital type that involved designing the invisible, non-rectangular envelope that every letter should occupy regardless of its neighbours. Sequences of letters would be spaced by butting the envelopes of the letters against one another. Intrigued by this notion, I made some tests, first with unitised strips of spacing material because it was easiest, and then trying to actually design the ideal envelopes for each letter. It is difficult, but probably only because one isn't used to thinking in this way, but it works and is by far the best spacing model I've seen (and that includes the legendary Kindersley Optical Character Spacing system). However, I think the likelihood of the software industry en masse dumping the existing paradigm of digital type is very unlikely.   \n   \n   \nWhile I tend to agree with Gerald that our humanity needs a physical connection to the past, I think we should also be aware that the manufacturing of metal type also compromised that humanity because of the nature of the material: we're not made of metal, and much as I love good letterpress printing and admire the craftsmanship that it represents, I'm not sure it represents a sufficiently deep past in which to locate our humanity. My work on Arabic and, to a lesser extent, Hebrew has made me much more senstitive to pre-typographic ideas of spacing and layout, and I think there is a particular humanity in the freedom of arrangement that precedes the rectangle of the 'body'.\n\n"

I hear this word softness of letterpress. Letterpress is the opposite. It exudes a sharpness lacking in lithography. Remember you do not look at type through microscopes. The sharpeness of letterpress comes from reflection of light from the impression.   \n�������������   \n   \nI heard \"speak\" of size limitations. Well I care to differ. For setting books there was 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,16,22,24,30,36,42,48, and so forth up to 72 point. Sometimes even larger. Wood type went \"Paul Bunyan large\". Sometimes letterspaced with \"lumber\".   \n   \nBut if you are not satisfied with those sizes run them through again with 6 on 7, 7 on 8. Do no assume they are merely cast on larger point sizes. 11on 12 point Caslon is not the same size of type as 12 on 12 pt.   \n   \nTry 2.5 pt, where an entire book page could be set on a postage stamp. That size is not included in any page layout program I know of.   \n   \nFor that matter letterpress invented points and picas.   \n   \nIf you can't \"make do with that\" the limitations are your own.   \n   \nLimitations in hot metal technology! What was missing? Nothing important. Take a look at even the earliest work and tell me what was wrong with the product. They were beautiful. Which in my opinion is one of \"the\" objectives of design. And in my own case, \"my singular interest\".   \n   \nKerning was easy with Monotypes.   \n   \nThe evidence leads away from the conclusions of judge and jury.   \n   \nSo what are we going to do with digital typography? Not learn, pretend letterpress never happened?   \n   \nBut still like chess, every peice from pawn through king has limitations. Does that mean you can't play the game.   \n   \nIt \"is\" the game.   \n   \nFrom the very beginning letterpress type had optical scaling. According to Hrant they even had ink traps in the 16th century.   \n   \nMaybe we should make \"imitations\" of these so called \"limitations\".   \n   \nAnd for God's sake, you are not in the world of Gulliver's travels. That is a fantasy. Take a book and look at it with the naked eye.   \n   \nThe naked eye, or even with corrected lenses is where the \"rubber actually meets the road\".\n\n"

I am saying that there is no logical reason why digital typographic technology should be based on a metal type paradigm (whether handset or mechanical); the fact that today's digital font technology is based on such a paradigm is due to historical exigence: it is easier to model an existing technology than to invent new ways of doing things in a new technology, especially when existing companies have a massive collection of design and metrics data that they want to leverage. But when the paradigm of the existing technology is based on the properties of a particular material -- in this case, metal -- does it really make sense to carry that paradigm over to a new technology from which that material is absent? Historical exigence is important in understanding why things are the way they are, but it should not be accepted as the way things must be, let alone as the best way things can be.   \n   \nWhy does digital type have sidebearings? Why is spacing based on a combination of glyph metrics and kerning? What other paradigms can we find in earlier technologies (including handwriting)?

It is a shape that works reasonably well for the Latin script, and if you are working with metal and don't have an easy means of changing the shape of the mould relative to individual letterforms a rectangle is not a bad choice.   \n   \nAll I'm suggesting is that the 'digital mould' should be more easily adjusted to correspond more closely to the shape of the letterforms, to correspond better, for example, to diagonal forms and to overhanging forms. This is what I mean by 'envelope', a kind of bubble that defines the space on which a letter sits (and note that the letterform may, in some cases, extend beyond the bubble, e.g. at the extremes of the serifs on v). It serves the same function as the rectangular 'face', but is tailored to the letterforms. So rather than butting two rectangles up against each other and _then_ making a secondary adjustment (kerning) to improve the spacing of particular pairs, one would butt the spacing envelopes against each other and, because they correspond more truly to the letterforms, no secondary adjustment would be necessary. Does that make sense?\n\n"

While still locked into the rectangle concept, didn't PS3 allow for over extensions of the rectangle? All those \"your own handwriting\" font offers and the randomized fonts were/are possible in PS3, correct?   \n   \nMaybe the attempt to standardize, PS1, OT, are movements away from where we would ideally like to be?   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not sure what you mean by 'over extensions of the rectangle'. Do you mean simply parts of the letter extending beyond the edges of the notional rectangle of vertical em height and horizontal advance width? This is possible in any digital outline font format (it is problematic for bitmaps). Indeed, the fact that the outline is no actually bound by the rectangle, that the rectangle is invisible and non constraining, is one of the reasons I think the rectangle is an anachronism: a virtual hold-over from a previous technology.   \n   \nNow, having said this, I should add that actually trying to design spacing envelopes that correspond to letter shapes is much harder than making rectangles. One solution is that spacing could be done simply by adjusting the position of letters relative to each other in an algorithmic series of contexts, and let the computer calculate the appropriate shape of the envelope to achieve the desired spacing. The number of steps you would need to go through for each letter would depend on the shape. Diagonals and overhangs would be the most complicated, but they are already and require the most kerning.\n\n"

For that matter never did. I view the product on the paper. When grids irritated I worked to escape them and found it possible even with single unit quad units. See: [http://lanstontype.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051322/http:/lanstontype.com/)   \n   \nOr this: [http://lanstontype.com/Granjon.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051322/http:/lanstontype.com/Granjon.html) this example has evidence of grid only on the outer corners. Those would be elimated in a further step and repeat performance.   \n   \nLinotype is not a rectangle but a long slug, or for those not familiar with the term, a bar of metal.   \n   \nBut as far as grids go, or retangles as you put them, they never to be limitations for hot metal types, at least not often, when they were, such as \"script types\", particularly the extremes from German and Dutch foundries you can view some very peculiar looking type bodies. Other faces, not even scripts, but Caslon Oldstyle Italic Swash was cast in a most unusual fashion. But wait, think about the obvious, why should we search for such extreme examples? Lower case italic y, j, overhanging f's, ligatures. Solutions, not limitiations. That's what I see, not rectangles and prisons.   \n   \nAlso, no matter how you look at it, the objectives are the same even when the solutions are not�to make types look right to the naked eye.   \n   \nHebrew was cast in a most confusing fashion with moulds that opened like dragons in a Chinese nightmare. Delivery systems made you think you were watching a hockey game. So peculiarities were handled in different ways. As to the success of Lanston Monotype Hebrew from a cultural point of view I am in no position to offer comment. All foundries fail Finland.   \n   \nI suggest for Latin types there _should be no \"radical\" change in the results, or expectations_ to the reading public, and if there were, I trust it will not be well received.   \n   \nSo my expectation are that results would be in conformity to the universal acceptance of historical hot metal \"limitations\". (not my word) Along with leading, pts and picas, the word type, kern, letter spacing, digital foundries and all the wannabe things that digital type folk wish to identify with�the noble history of hot metal typography.   \n   \nExcept for some.   \n   \nAs I said, I don't see \"the rectangle\" therefor have little sympathy with this problem\". So for me your solutions will be based on one thing, results. Since I have such an open mind your chance to please is rather good.   \n   \nMay I suggest, where you fear�imaginary rectangles are damaging, I fear, unguided computerized spacing augmented by kerning without humans in the driving seat is alarmingly. I can envision wearing seat belts reading modern books.   \n   \nBut I base this unfairly on my opinion of the results from the Ikarus team. Perhaps they did not use the bubble theory but rather a measuring, or balancing of black and whites in their auto kern procedures.   \n   \nThe results were not a charming as the proponents had wished.   \n   \nI believe the real answer to the kerning problem is to let the typesetter do his or her job. After all, why should we have all the fun?\n\n"
