  "content": "hey,\n\nI’m just looking for some well designed labels, I’ve just been asked to create the label/logo for a new sandwich brand called ’Now that’s a Sandwich’ the brand values quality and all sandwiches are handmade, the bread used is stone oven baked (also handmade) and fully Irish owned using only Irish products.\n\nIt’s a gourmet, quality sandwich so the design solution obviously needs to be reflective of those qualities. Any suggestions on possible typefaces or any samples of similar products would be greatly appreciated. This is my first job since graduating a few weeks ago so really want it to be effective.\n\n [‹ Project overhaul advice requested...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907012428/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46153 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Good \"square\" font. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907012428/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46481 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’ll have a look for hand-rendered type on food products but if anyone knows of any other good samples I’d love to see them. Thanks guys! I love this site your all so helpful;)\n\n"
