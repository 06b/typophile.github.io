I have had a bit of a try on hotoshop only at mo, and it’s hard...the building is Bewick court in Newcastle, if you google the block, you can see lots of images... I can;t really find a way for a B etc... Also at mo I can only get four letters on the side of the buidling, so fonts that could be made using less windows would be great..thanks in advance for any help as feel a bit lost in it all.. anton\n\n [‹ Just one more novel question](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045819/http:/typophile.com/node/50667 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font help for Interiors/Homes magazine ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045819/http:/typophile.com/node/44291 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
