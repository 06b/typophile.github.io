  "content": "Hola, folks. I'd appreciate a little assistance in trying to identify a certain font.   \n   \n [http://www.shunn.net/mormon/terror/img/nametag.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018063353/http:/www.shunn.net/mormon/terror/img/nametag.gif)   \n   \nThe first line, not the serifed font below.   \n   \nI've looked it up on a font identifier, which told me Avenir and Arial Curved Bold, neither of which can actually work for this font, as their O's are round and larger than the average letter. I don't think it's monospaced, but I could be wrong. Here's another sample:   \n   \n [http://mikeli.image.pbase.com/u6/jhales/small/981811.John11701003.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018063353/http:/mikeli.image.pbase.com/u6/jhales/small/981811.John11701003.jpg)   \n   \nThanks in advance.\n\n",
