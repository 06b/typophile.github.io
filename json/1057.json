  "content": "I was listening to the radio the other night. A musician   \nwas talking about making music. He sounded a little out   \n of it, he was rambling a little, but had a good point to   \n make. He mentioned the state of pop music, the rigidly   \n enforced planned obsolesence of it and how his music   \nwas trying to be as honest as possible. Authentic. He   \nthen said (bear with me) something like this: \"I mean, it   \nshouldn't be about the money, the profile, the cd   \npackaging marketing and cool music videos. It is about   \nthe art, because at the end of it all, it is all we leave   \nbehind. Honest art.\"   \n   \nI thought immediately of type, specifically of type   \ndesign. What is the attraction of a largely thankless   \ntask appreciated by few yet exposed to many? I think I   \nam hooked because it can be honest. Other people   \ncan use your type, and something very real and   \nuseable is 'left behind'. It is inherently narcissistic. It   \nwould be nice to know for everyone else: why?\n\n",

He fought in the First World War, about which he wrote _In Parentheses_, and was one of the many British converts to Catholicism in the 1920s. He spent time at a couple of Eric Gill's guild communes, and was for a time engaged to Gill's daughter Petra, but found the solitary life better suited to his temperment.

The \"no money\" in this case may be just be shorthand for, \"not a fortune\". Many people (understably so) start businesses for the sole purpose of accumulating the most amount of money into a single location (traditional view).   \nType design, as you might guess, doesn't fit nicely into this category.

But I am realistic enough to know, that if I wanted to make bucket full of it, I'd have to change a lot. Not only in the way my type should look like, but also structural. I mean, at the end, wether you sell type or graphic, you'll need to find a way to get to your potential customer. You can sit and wait till everyone notices how supperb your designs are, but this might take a while. But you can also try to get anyones attention by any means like advertisement, lobby, connections, internet, whatever. (Having peoples attention doesn't mean your good in making faces, but it might mean you're good in getting attention, which is a gift) You'll need a lot of energy to do this as well. And time.   \n   \nBecause mostly, you won't make big money with type when you start, you probably will do something else for a living. So you will do your type thing during in those late nightly hours and weekends.   \n   \nI think, the biggest issue is time. To make a decent typeface, you need time. To make more, you more time.

I originally got into type wanting to be a full-time type designer. I contacted a couple of eminent folks to ask where one could go to learn about type. Both Chuck Bigelow and Robert Brunghurst were kind enough to carry on a bit of correspondence. Both of them suggested that there was little likelihood of making a living at type design. Now, I ignored that part of their advice, but I took it to heart as well, and it made me work that much harder.   \n   \nI should add that today I agree with them. I know quite a few type designers, and except for the very biggest names, and some employed by the large type foundries, most don't make a living at type design. They teach, or do graphic design, or other stuff to make money, and do type design because they love it.   \n   \nI'm lucky enough to work for Adobe, and get to do fun type stuff and get paid quite well. Once in a very rare while I've even gotten to do some type design. But there are few jobs like this, and even fewer that involve actual type design, that like Bigelow and Bringhurst I find it hard to encourage people.   \n   \nMy actual advice is this:   \n   \n- Decide if you could be happy doing stuff other than original type design per se. If so, there are about 5x as many opportunities. I didn't go in with this intent, but it worked out pretty well for me.   \n   \n- Make your own luck. This means three things: working hard as heck at your craft; going out of your way to pick up related specialized skills; spotting and exploring potential opportunities. This was a big part of how I ended up with a real paying job in type.   \n   \n- Learn programming. Somebody with a BSc in computer science who is also heavily into type is probably more likely to find a decent-paying type job than somebody with an MFA in design. (At least, that's my perspective.) It will also give you skills that will be incredibly useful in type production.   \n   \nAnyway, that's my two cents.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
