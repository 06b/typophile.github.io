Words in Spanish such as dif�cil (difficult) and f�sica (physics) are quite common, but I have never seen such a thing as a f+� ligature, but then again I�m just a newbie. Any comments will be greatly appreciated. Many thanks in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "I've seen them occasionally -- sorry can't remember the names of any typefaces off-hand -- but they are uncommon and, typically, of little use. The problem is that in an fi ligature it is typical for the overhang of the f to replace the dot of the i. The only way to have sufficient space for an accent above the i is to either move the i further from the f or to retract the overhang of the f; in either case, you usually cease to have a need for a ligature.\n\n"

[Storm](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818112727/http:/www.stormtype.com/) sells at least [one package](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818112727/http:/www.pismolijna.cz/pdf/Walbaum.pdf) with f-ligatures for f next to an umlauted (dieresis) vowel. [Helzel's version of Wilhelm Klingspor-Schrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818112727/http:/www.romana-hamburg.de/fraktur7.htm) includes some long-s ligatures with the dieresis compressed and shifted over somewhat.
