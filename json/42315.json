  "content": "I've been hopelessly attached to Terminal Design's Alfon as a body font for many of my book, magazine and newsletter projects for the past couple years. I tend to get hooked on a font & use it to excess, before moving on. I still love Alfon, but am looking for something new for a new book project. Would like something with a similar feel, readability, and versatility.\n\nMy only gripe with Alfon is that the Regular weight seems just a hair too light, and the medium is much too bold to use as an alternate.\n\nI looked at TD's Enclave font, but it seems like it might be too condensed.\n\nCan anyone offer some suggestions to check out?\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "Well on Alfon, something just a hair heavier than the regular would be nice. Some of my clients think it tends to print a little light.\n\nBut right now I'm also just looking for another font that I like as much as your Alfon for a book job I'm about to start. I've used Alfon so much over the last two years, I just want to try something else.\n\nI have always been pretty good at choosing and working with display fonts, but I always thought I was weak on choosing body fonts. Tended to use all the basics, or whatever I had on hand. I designed a magazine using Alfon a couple years ago, and felt I hit it right on. So I've used it for just about everything else since.\n\nBody fonts to me are like wine. I know what i like when I see (or taste) it, but I am overwhelmed by the details and choices available, and am usually too busy with my million projects, to actually focus on the details of choosing new typefaces.\n\nSo just looking for new recommendations. I think it was someone on here who first recommended Alfon.\n\n"

Just match up all of the features, and see if you can get alternate matches. If you don't, change one variable at a time until you get a match.\n\n"
