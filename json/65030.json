  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI have purchased a fount of the Temple script metal typeface (for my amateurish attempts at letterpress) and am wondering if this exists in a digital version? I have looked through Mike Yanega's script guide but I confess I got lost in the bewildering array of formal script typefaces there.\n\nAttached is a sample from the Riscatype catalogue. Many thanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [temple.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820094319/http:/typophile.com/files/temple.jpg) | 116.52 KB |\n\n",
