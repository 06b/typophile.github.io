  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI'm working on a logo at the moment and I'm looking for some nice g's. It will have to be a double storey g preferably a minimalistic look. But any double story g will do as long as it's one that is a bit different or has something quirky.\n\nI'm looking to adapt a double storey g to a mark for the company so that's why I'm just curious about g's that are out there. It's just one idea and already have a few little sketches for other logo styles to propose, but I'd like to see some more g's and perhaps I can make something nice of that.\n\ncheers,  \ndav.\n\nbtw. I just found another thread about the double storey g at typophile.  \n [http://www.typophile.com/node/17647](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014223441/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17647 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/17647\")\n\n",
