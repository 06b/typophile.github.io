Do I understand a font manager will let you preview and use a font without actually installing it ... just indicated the font and leave the font manager running?  \nThanks!\n\n",

I suggest you take a look at Extensis' Suitcase and Adobe's ATM, which can be found in Support -\\> Downloads at their website. ATMLight is free, but I'm not sure it does what you want.\n\nOh, and I'm sure other people can point other good software and/or companies. I point these two because they're the ones I'm more familiar with.\n\n"

Considering this thread is almost 5 years old now , is there anything currently on the market that you guys could suggest in the way of font management?\n\nI'm looking to invest in something that's easy to use , and one that provides a little flexibility in both Windows 2000 & Windows xp , as these are my two primary operating systems.\n\nAny help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\n"

It allows you to create different sets of fonts for different projects and activate fonts as and when required. By activate I mean temporarily install. On restarting the computer or closing the software, the font is deactivated. So its slightly bothersome having to keep fontsuit open while working with its fonts.\n\n"
