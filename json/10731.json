      "content": "With InDesign, btw, you can just copy the Word-Table into the document. It will look exactly like it does in Word (if you didn't do too much fancy stuff in Word) and you can still fully edit it. If you work a lot with tables and would like to get around this a bit quicker, I'd recommend Smart Styles from Woodwing, a tool any InDesign user should give a look, it's quite productive.\n\n"
