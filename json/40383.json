  "content": "My name is Steven Skaggs. I'm a calligrapher and type lover. Used to be in a group called Typocrafters, and am certainly familiar with Typophiles from the chapbooks of the 30s 40s 50s. The lettering artist Charles E. Skaggs, long a NYC book designer and letterist, and found in Typophile Chapbooks in late 40s is a distant relation. Glad to be a part of this crowd. I'm pretty good at drawing an alphabet, but have had less success at getting it completely digitized and into the keyboard. I've designed three typefaces: Florencia (purchased by World Typeface Center - Tom Carnase's old operation), and two not yet keyboard ready. I'll lurk awhile, then maybe have some things to say. Hermann Zapf is my main hero, but many others.\n\n",
