Grouch and the recently ID'd Grizzly are among the ITC fonts which were available at one time only from Bitstream, but no more. Somebody should give ITC a good talking to. If they're going to go around revoking distribution rights, at least they should offer it themselves.\n\nEdit: Actually the k is an alternate that was part of the original design. It included a few other alternate characters (which were not included in the Bitstream version).\n\n"

Stats are most commonly used in mechanicals to indicate size, cropping, and position of continuous tone copy. the original copy is photographed by a special cam,era and produces a paper negative.

Never regretted it -- terrific value for money, better digitisations than most of the \"official\" Linotype and Adobe versions, and it allowed me to license loads of typefaces I was very reluctant to spend any money on but had to own licenses for due to the reality of the marketplace.\n\n"
