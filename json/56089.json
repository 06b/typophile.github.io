It seems like as the kerning involves glyphs, in which I added anchors to build their accented versions, FL adds an @ glyph before the underscore. Is the @ glyph necessary in the code? I guess it is?\n\nI also realized that all the kerning classes I had defined previously disapeared from the classes window, it seems that the information has been transfered in the open type kern feature since the @ glyph is placed before all glyphs containing anchors. The thing is that I don't know how this happens\n\nAs I'm not familiar with Open Type encoding, I don't understand what \"pos\" stands for before both kerned glyphs. I don't get either what \"enum pos\" stands for.\n\nHope this will help\n\n"
