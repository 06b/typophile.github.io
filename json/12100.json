This new book is part of a series and the publishers want to stick with Optima as the headline style but is willing to consider another body face. Does anyone have any suggestions for me to explore? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTammy\n\n [‹ RED, WHITE & BLACK True colors?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005112904/http:/www.typophile.com/node/8702 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Bitmap Fonts for Mobile Phones ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005112904/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12509 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
