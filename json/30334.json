      "content": "Are these the only letter samples for this font? Except possibly the S, it would be hard to pick letters that are less helpful for ID purposes. I think we could name dozens of sans serif faces that would be hard to tell from this sample. We need letters like G, J, K, M, C, W and R. The shape of the O, for example, can be easily changed with a little compression or widening, so it hardly matters unless we know there has been no distortion. The other letters I mentioned are structurally more distinctive, and not so easily altered by width distortions.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
