  "content": "I'm working on a manual using Neo Sans for the headers, call-outs etc... and need something to pair with it for body copy. I can't purchase any new faces so preferably I need something from the adobe library.\n\nCurrently I'm using serifa but I don't think it works with lots of copy.\n\nThe manual is for the healthcare industry and has an \"elegant science\" sort of feel. (think macro shots of viruses against black backgrounds)\n\nAny help is appreciated, Thanks\n\n",
