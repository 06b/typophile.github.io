  "content": "In a thread today I wanted to refer to John Downer's ideas about revivals etc which are available here:\n\n[http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204131846/http:/www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2 \"http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2\")\n\nBut before I found them there I went looking in the wiki for some shorter possibly more general treatement of the ideas ( many of which were in use before his article) in some form there. I could not find anything at all. Which seems really silly. I started to think about working on it myself but then I realized I aught to chat with the many & sundry about it before I tried.\n\nSo here is my proposal : It seems like some set of categories ( heavily indebted I suspect to John Downer) would be reall useful to have in the wiki. I am not keen on using his categories 'as is' in part because that seems like stealing, but also because that would be lazy. We aught to come to a consensus of our own. This does not preculude using his work as a point to jump off from. To that end here is his list:\n\nRevivals/Recuttings/Reclamations  \nAnthologies/Surveys/Remixes  \nKnockoffs/Clones/Counterfeits  \nReconsiderations/Reevaluations/Reinterpretations  \nHomages/Tributes/Paeans  \nEncores/Sequels/Reprises  \nExtensions/Spinoffs/Variations  \nCaricatures/Parodies/Burlesques\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n",

But you're right to ask Typophiles to agree on our own set of terms since this is such a controversial topic.\n\nIf you're willing to wade through some unrelated bits, there was some [discussion on Downer's piece at Typographica](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204131846/http:/typographi.com/000511.php).\n\n"

My own preferences would probably be:  \nrevivals  \nanthologies  \nclones  \nreinterpretations  \nhomages  \n???  \nextensions (variations seems to me to belong more with reinterpretations)  \nparodies\n\nthis may still be too many, for example, aren't parodies simply exaggerated reinterpretations, for example would Farnham be a reinterp or a caricature of Fleischman?\n\njust 2 cents to get the ball rolling...\n\nfunny thing, i was just thinking today of going back to some of the classification pages in the wiki and adding terms pages so that browsers could find typefaces based on different descriptions. i wish our wiki was more dynamic with categories as is wikipedia, that would make doing something like this much easier. \\*sigh\\*\n\n"

Reproductions are an attempt to faithfully revive a typeface in a different medium. With every other kind of interpretation or adaptation, I find it most useful to understand what was the purpose of the designer was. That goes beyond categories, and gets to the individual typeface design.\n\n"

      "content": "I guess what I was getting at here ( or trying to ) is that typeface design exists outside of John's categories too. One area outside of John categories is novel design. Admttedly there isn't much of it & some might argue that even a novel design is only just so novel if it can be read... but I think it's a valid construct for the purposes of discussion. I also think that an area unexplored by John's categories is with the how aware the designer is of type already and specifically with the form they are working in. For example Template Gothic was basically a new design but the designer was ( I supect) grounded in some type history. But if you have for instance a student & they start making type out of squares & half circles they may or may not be aware of the hitorical prescedents - and assuming they are not; they may make what is essentially a naive design which looks derivative but is non-historical in conception. As I say these are rare instances for the most part but it we are building a hierarchy of categories maybe these aspects should have a place in it. Maybe not.\n\n<cite> might move revivals up one level </cite>\n\nMaybe so. I was imbivalent about creating a category with subcats. Maybe the Super catgory 'Interpretive' isn't helpful.\n\n"

Maybe the most useful, accurate thing to do would be to create an entry on: 'John Downer's type classification from his article \"Call it what it is\" ' and then paste in what he wrote. Then the attribution is there. Or simply link to the article.

(This is the case with Carol Twombly's Adobe Caslon also.) In contrast, the later Garamond Premier is Slimbach's return to the same source material with the intention of a much more faithful revival of specific sizes of Garamond's fonts.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
