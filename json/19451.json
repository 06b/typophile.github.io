I notice on this forum that a lot of people use Firefox and wonder why. Are there any advantages to Firefox that should make me consider using it instead of Safari?\n\n [‹ Hrant 1, Chirography 0?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929202932/http:/typophile.com/node/19396 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A couple questions... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929202932/http:/typophile.com/node/19252 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "There are many philosophical reasons for using Firefox, but when it comes to a web browser, I’m not such an idealist. I’ve used Firefox and Safari extensively and will tell you that, especially on the Mac, Firefox isn’t nearly as polished. IMHO, Safari feels like more of a professional product. I prefer Safari for type rendering, ColorSync, Bookmark syncing with iSync and the highly usable SnapBack feature. If you prefer the Mozilla/Gecko layout engine that Firefox uses, I recommend [Camino](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929202932/http:/www.caminobrowser.org/), which is much more Mac-like and professional feeling than Firefox.\n\nSome practical reasons for using Firefox might include:  \n1. Better compatibility with crumby banking websites and such.  \n2. More extensible features with plugins. However, for every Firefox plugin that’s well-written, there are at least ten that are poorly written.\n\nI’m not trying to start a war here – these are just my personal preferences.\n\n"

Yup, there is every possibility that I will be using anywhere from four different machines in a day, so portability is key.\n\n-nic\n\n"

When moving from Safari to Firefox, I found it really weird that the close-tab button was not on the tab. The cross-platform compatability and the extensions are very important to me.\n\n"
