Now there is a larger choice of typefaces that have all the bells and whistles.   \n   \nAlso, my list was for an educational establishment, and as you say William, individuals should personalize more.   \n   \nI've been using Adobe Garamond since it came out. It was the first digital font with all the typographic goodies, and I loved it. As I say in my article, it restored the diginity of the Garamond line.   \n   \nHowever, I recently received a book of poetry from a friend (the designer) who had set it in Adobe Garamond, and it has become so overexposed it just looked so bland and like a corporate brochure, I couldn't bring myself to read it.   \n   \nMyriad I recommended as the most affordable extended-family sans, which was true. However, I have become increasingly anti-Adobe recently (primarily for their marketing policies, and that tends to color my feelings towards their type designs), and sensitive to plagiarism, and am now very critical of Myriad (along with FF Transit and Prima) as a knock-off of Frutiger.   \n   \nSo, in my list of recommendations, I compromised for affordability. Damn, it's so easy to get corrupted by money.   \n   \nOK, you're right, Thomas did identify his bias, but he went ahead and used the phrase \"amazing deal\" anyway, as if identifying one's bias makes it then OK to be a total hypemeister.   \n   \nThe Display and Novelty fonts in the Adobe Type Classics for Learning are a terrible collection of cliches. Did Adobe actually consult with anyone in Education before putting together this collection? I doubt it.   \n   \nWhile I'm on this hobby horse, many of the Type Classics are not even remotely classic! Chapparal, Warnock, Cronos, Nueva? Perhaps Myriad, Minion can be considered to have become classics recently, but in general the name of this package is somewaht misleading -- hardly the way to package a product for education.   \n   \nIn fact, some of the only classics here are those that Adobe elsewhere identifies as Adobe Originals -- Caslon, Jenson, Garamond.

The only other major vendor with a library in OpenType format is Elsner+Flake. That leaves a lot of mighty usable, popular, and desireable non-OT faces out there, don't you agree? Not every library is going to be OpenType right away - if ever. Even the bulk of the converted Adobe doesn't take advantage of the really cool features and glyph substitution that OpenType has to offer. There are countless smaller productions shops alongside large in-house agencies which simply cannot afford to simply change over to using another type format (as good as it is).

What I said is that the _format_ is obsolete, but which I mean it a) has been superceded by a superior format (superior in all the ways that TT has always been superior, and also smaller and more efficient, a single cross-platform binary, etc.), b) is inherently limited to 8-bit codepage support in an increasingly Unicode text processing environment, c) fails to take advantage of new features in major applications and systems. Continued support for the Type 1 format must be understood as backwards-compatibility support. When I said Type 1's days were numbered, I meant that this backwards-compatibility support is not going to continue indefinitely. My guess is that MS will be the first to stop offering system support for Type 1. Then either Adobe will have to restart the ATM programme (unlikely, since they want to kill off Type 1), or some third party will provide a user-installable Type 1 rasteriser (FreeType?), or Type 1 simply won't be useable on Windows. The history of type is littered with dead font formats, many of which were once the dominant formats for entire industries.

Opentype .otf files are T1 outlines inside of an Opentype wrapper.

PS-flavoured OpenType fonts contain CFF format font data, not Type 1. Yes, the two are related and both use the same kind of cubic bezier outlines -- although expressed in a different way in the binary --, but CFF is a different font format. This is really obvious when you consider that CFF and Type 1 require different rasterisers. This is why I suspect MS will be the first to ditch Type 1 support: they don't want to maintain three different system rasterisers, one of which is for a format that they consider inferior and obsolete.   \n   \nOne of the key things that made TT superior to Type 1 from the beginning is the extensibility of the sfnt font structure. The table structure of the sfnt format is what makes OT fonts possible; without it, we wouldn't be able to have a single binary format capable of containing different outline types. Type 1 fonts were a developmental dead end.\n\n"

The actual quality of the curve depends on how many points you want to use and, indeed, what kind of curve you want. The main advantage of cubic beziers is that they are easier to design with, but that has always struck me as a tool issue. It is possible to conceive of a native TT outline editor that would allow you to assign editing properties to points in the same way as you can specify a PS node as being smooth or tangent. Of course, the advantage of the TT quadratic b-spline outline is that both on- and off-curve points can be addressed in hinting.\n\n"

And if you count the total number of points (on- and off-curve), the two schemes use the exact same number of points!   \n   \n--   \n   \n\\> Storm   \n   \nWhat I liked most from Storm is gone - not a font, but a bit of explanation: in his explanation of Biblon he used to have a heated lambasting of ITC for requiring that he iron out all the wonderful idiosyncracies, otherwise they wouldn't release it - _after_ he had signed a contract. The only trace of the lambasting left is this: \"Their pastime is giving other people's type faces more decent look.\"   \n   \nAs for the fonts, Biblon still has an ingenue charm, but Tyfa and Serapion are more versatile. And among the sans designs I like Farao, Lexon and Sebastian.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "_I thought CFF was a form of compression?_   \n   \nIt is compact -- hence the name, Compact Font Format --, but it is not simply a compression of a Type 1 font. CFF uses Type 2 charstrings.   \n   \n_And doesn't Fontlab let you edit in native truetype?_   \n   \nYes, but you work directly with the TT outline format, which doesn't include any ability to assign properties to on-curve points such as one has in PS editing. My point is that it would be possible to design an editing layer on top of the native outline that would make it easier to work with TT outlines. For example, at the moment if you want a smooth transition through an on-curve point on a diagonal you have to put in a guideline and manually make sure that appropriate points are aligned along it; there is no way to define a point as a smooth transition in the TT format, but that doesn't necessarily mean that one shouldn't be able to for editing purposes. I was discussing this a couple of years ago with Sampo Kaasila, the inventor of TrueType, and he expressed surprised that no one had made a really good and easy to use TT editing environment.\n\n"
