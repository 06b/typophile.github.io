I am of the opinion that a good logotype needs more than just typing the company name in a font you conveniently had installed, and that it is equally important how it relates to the other material in terms of colour, composition and type choice. However, there are many designers in the business that doesn’t.\n\nIn this case, I’m doing a website job were the logo is set in tightly spaced all caps FB Antenna. I’ve been looking at Etelka as an option, but I’m not really sure if I should abandon Antenna, even though I have my reasons to do so.\n\n",
