  "content": "this great type is called \"Hadassah\", designed in israel by Henry Friedlander.  \nwhen i turned one of the letters on it's side, i noticed it's interesting \"okatsim\"\\* that are similar or were inspired by latin serifs.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130213040111im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_6223.jpg)\n\n\\* \"oketz\" is the hebrew term for something like serifs, only in the upper end of the letter, as seen in this picture:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130213040111im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-11_3591.jpg)\n\nmy question is something like this:  \nwhat kind of fonts(english i mean) have these kind of serifs?\n\n",

      "content": "I read somewhere that Friedlaender was consciously trying to get the feeling of Jenson in his type, so it's not surprising that there's some echo in the shapes, and the modulation of line. So the answer to your question I think is: Jenson.\n\nThe story of Hadassah, which is as you say one of the great Hebrew types, is incredibly moving. He was a student of the great Rudolph Koch in Germany, but moved to Holland when the Nazis took over in Germany. He started work on what would become Hadassah in Holland. When the Nazis took over, he buried his drawings, but continued to work on it in hiding for nearly three years in an attic, while fed and protected by his non-Jewish wife. He survived and after the war he dug up the drawings, emigrated to Israel and completed it there.  \nInfluential type teacher Gerrit Noordzij says he was responsible for making what became KABK \"letter friendly\" and so to hire Noordzij.\n\n[Here's an extensive description of the development of Hadassah](http://web.archive.org/web/20130213040111/http:/www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1991/LB-N91-Fontaine.html), with a nice bibliography at the end. You should be able to get a hold of his book in Hebrew in Israel, where he also taught.\n\nOne of the heroes of type, in my book.\n\nps, I edited this to add the link, so it got out of order.\n\n"
