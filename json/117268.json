  "content": "Hello,\n\nThe problem is it is very hard to find any viable information on old printing press(not letter press though). A search of antique printing press forums, produces no sites with forums. The printing press museums don't do any actually printing of the antique machines. Here is the problem.\n\nWe are interested in having some Prints made from book art, about 2000 prints in total. What we are doing; Dan Maitz, Dave Seeley, Stephen Youll , Stephan Martiniere \"The Kings of Fantasy Art\" and I, Mr. T. Stout are trying to collaborate on a project from a novel, that involves each artist doing a piece of art inspired by the book The Vampire and The Rainbow. We wanted to make 500 copies of each artists work to be autographed. We also wanted to print to be something special, very unique, or something very unusual.\n\nWhat we would like to know is, what are some special, unique, or very unusual printing processes ( printing by direct electricity or on metal sheets, etc.... Not just antique print(unless very rare) we want something special for the fans. Also if anyone can direct us to any forums, persons, or companies that could help us to complete this printing project.\n\nThank in advance for any help.\n\n",

Photographs?\n\nYou'll want to pick a method that reproduces the art accurately, or at least inform the artists before they make the artwork about the printing method. Otherwise you'll get a lot of angry artists.\n\n"
