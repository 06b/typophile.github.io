I've found a similar font family with the name \"To Be Continued\" but the pictures & that font don't seem to match up quite exactly.~~\n\nP.S. ughh.. didnt know how to move a forum since I posted this in the wrong one. :/  \nanyways I'm new here and I think this place is a great way to learn about different fonts & discover new ones. :))  \nooh..& sorry about the big pic size, dont know how to resize..EEk!!\n\n",
