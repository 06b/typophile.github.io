That should be long enough for us to spot the years trends and make predictions!\n\n1. “Helvetica” the film will get an Academy award;\n\n2. Meta Serif will become the most used new typeface of the year;\n\n3. Microsoft will debut a new multi-language typeface for screen/web use and bundle it with Office.\n\n4. A typography “Hall of Fame” will open in the Netherlands (the first inductee will be “Mr. ’T’ but TO will be rejected due to excessive celebrations);\n\n5. Apple will FINALLY release an opentype friendly OS;\n\n6. Adobe will release a new typeface designed by Miguel Sousa;\n\n7. The Consortium will finally figure out a way to get kerning to work on screen.\n\nFeel free to add or detract,\n\nChrisL\n\n [‹ Font Advice Sought!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080109145254/http:/typophile.com/node/40548 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Software Tutor Required ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080109145254/http:/typophile.com/node/40167 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Miss G. is so eloquent in its defense that a small Pacific island, with one typophiler, recruits her as Queen. Shortly thereafter, she declares war against Canada, because it booted Typophile off the internet. Hrant tried to tell her that was Typographi.ca, and it’s all OK now, but it’s too late. Japan says the island, hitherto unknown, actually belongs to it, and that Miss G is not Queen. China responds that it belongs to them, and the whole thing spins out of control and threatens to create WW III.\n\nAlso a young intern snaps her underwear at a randy President. She blabs to her friends, and it gets in the press, and the whole thing spins out of control. His as a result the Vice President fails to be elected, and a dunce is elected instead—who goes to war with the wrong country.\n\nOops that already happened.\n\nAnd you thought I was making this up :)\n\n"
