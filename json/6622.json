BTW, I'll be selling my entire collection (almost 30 issues, some extremely rare - almost all in mint condition) on eBay soon. It certainly was and is a great magazine, but I let my subscription lapse, and don't want to be stuck with a partial collection. My reserve price won't be too low, so start saving up, or get a rich spouse/mate to buy it for you for xmas or something... :-)   \n   \nRamiro, yes, that was an amazing article!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
