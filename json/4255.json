I was hoping someone else would...   \n   \nHrant,   \nI'll admit that Adobe Garamond is a well-made font family, but I've always thought it was kind of, well, plain (I don't know what problems APHA found). Stempel Garamond has more character in my opinion, which I know can be a bad thing in some cases. George Abram's Augereau--which I like--was missed by many, but when the digital version came out, I never heard a peep. I also thought Tiro's Garamond was nice, but I never heard much about it either. I wonder how this one will be received...\n\n"

      "content": "Well, I'll admit to knowing a fair bit about it, though I can't comment on much of it.   \n   \nThe new Garamond is more closely modeled on historical masters, including having optical sizes. I don't know whether Rob was influenced by or even aware of the critique in the APHA Journal (knowing him, I'd be inclined to guess not on both counts!), but I believe that every typeface he has done since 1991 has had optical size variants.   \n   \nIn the new Garamond, each optical size is a completely distinct. Combining that with the extensive multilingual support (CE, Greek and Cyrillic), and an extensive set of added typographic functionality, it is one of the most ambitious typefaces Rob has ever done. Personally, I also think it's one of the best, from what I've seen so far.   \n   \nPartly because it hews closer to the Garamond originals, and partly because Rob had different objectives on this one, I think the new Garamond is also more \"flavorful\" than Adobe Garamond (or Minion, for that matter).   \n   \nOn the side, I find it interesting that some of the Typophiles on this board criticize Adobe Garamond and Minion for having insufficient \"flavor\" or distinctiveness. I subscribe to the \"crystal goblet\" theory of typography, which suggests that the goal of typography ought to be to show off and subtly enhance the message, without drawing attention to itself. I think workhorse typefaces like Minion and Adobe Garamond do that extremely well, while some of the typefaces that are put forward as superior alternatives have more flavor, but as a result are simply not as versatile.   \n   \nIn my personal point of view, what will be really interesting to see in the new Garamond is how well Rob is able to make it more flavorful without much reduction in versatility.   \n   \nRob's recent work seems to me to explore the boundaries of the possibilities in flavor versus versatility (kind of like a production possibilities frontier curve in economics). Good examples of pretty masterful stabs at this in his recent work are Warnock and Brioso. They take different spots on the flavor/versatility curve, but they both seem to me to be pretty much at the maximum bounds for combining the two. That is, neither could have more of one without a reduction in the other.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

Secondly, Adobe Garamond is a very readable, workhorse of a font family and I have great respect for it. My downfall in typography is that, currently, I prefer types with some quirkiness which, I'll admit, is not preferable in book typography. Adobe Garamond is kind of vanilla to me, but that is probably one of its greates attributes according to the \"crystal goblet\" theory (you're right Mr. Phinney).   \n   \nMr. Phinney, thanks for the teaser. I have great respect for Mr. Slimbach and his work -- I wouldn't expect my opinion to mean a hill of beans to him. Jenson and Warnock are two of my favorites along with Cronos, which I think is a beautiful humanist sans. Much of the feeling about Garamond and Minion may be due to their frequent appearance in books, magazines, annual reports, ads, and so on and so forth, but that probably only reinforces how usable they are. I certainly look forward to the new Garamond -- that's why I started this thread.   \n   \nThanks,   \nAddison\n\n"

      "content": "From what I know, Slimbach was not only aware of the APHA review, but it actually affected him deeply, and directly motivated him to start working on an improved interpretation. As for casting him as some sort of hermit who doesn't pay attention to what's going on outside: yes, he virtually never shares any of his insight, but many (maybe most) of his designs are clearly based -even motivated- by what _other people_ have thought and felt. \"Dzour nsdink, shidag khosink\" - let's sit crooked but talk straight.   \n   \nThe Crystal Goblet business: I think it should be pretty obvious by now that -at least in this dimension- Warde was being a cheerleader for Morison's blind ideology. There can be no crystal goblet as long as a human being is involved in the making of something. And there _should_ be no crystal goblet as long as the point of making something is other humans.   \n   \nThat said, I do agree that versatility and individuality are largely opposed, and Slimbach has often struck the balance well. But not any more. At the moment, and for the forseeable future, we simply don't need any more blandness, please.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

To be fair, Warnock does have a bit of this (it's very clearly Slimbach's best work), but all the other fonts Slimbach has ever made (with the possible exception of ITC Slimbach - a design that I think he should consider taking another look at, to see what he might have lost since making it), including Brioso\\*, are simply too polished\\*\\* - not enough humanity in them, heck, not enough Robert Slimbach in them!

The one by Mark Argetsinger is quite critical, as Hrant notes. The one by Jerry Kelly is quite complimentary. After some minor criticisms, Kelly says that \"nonetheless, Adobe Garamond is the most accurate derivation of Claude Garamond's types done to date, and a significant addition to the world's typographical resources. In fact, some of the face's less immediately obvious features contribute substantially to its beauty, and bear discussion.\" The summation at the end of his review is in a similar vein.   \n   \nAs for the Argetsinger review, it is quite interesting as well. His main criticisms of Adobe Garamond are that it:   \n   \n- diverges more than needed from the original, particularly in areas of regularization   \n   \n- is based on Garamond's punches without regard for their impression on paper (the latter being the way the types appeared in actual use)   \n   \n- lacks optical size variants   \n   \nSome time next week I'll comment more on the origins of Slimbach's new Garamond.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

I have to wonder if Kelly really knew the field, either in terms of what Garamonds have been made and what \"accuracy\" in type design really can be. Like what about Stempel Garamond? Wouldn't you say that the \"roughness\" in the Stempel makes it more authentic = accurate?   \n   \nI think Slimbach's efforts towards making a \"real\" digital Garamond are highly commendable.

In fact, I would say that having more rounded shapes is \"more accurate\" in that sense. That's why I brought it up in response to your question.

He says it only \"affected him deeply\" to the extent that it irked him. He mostly paid attention to the criticism of the lack of optical size, and that was something that he was already aware of and had been continuing to do more with in his newer designs.   \n   \nIf one looks at the chronology, in 1989 Adobe Garamond was released. It included a set of titling caps. In 1991, Minion was released, including a full \"display\" font. At the same time, Minion MM was under development, which further extended the optical sizes to cover everything in the typeface from 6 pt to 72 pt.   \n   \nI'm not sure if Minion MM had shipped yet, but this was the context in which Robert read Argetsinger's review, which appears to have come out in early 1992. So from Rob's point of view, it was just jumping on the bandwagon of what was already happening in Rob's design in the intervening several years since Adobe Garamond had come out. There were no new insights for him.   \n   \nRobert does acknowledge a major outside influence on his new Garamond, but it's not that article. Instead, it's an optical size experiment Stephen Harvard put together in 1989. Harvard was on the Adobe type review board at the time, and was a big Garamond fan. He did an experiment with a lower-case Garamond \"a\" interpolating from a small size to a display size. Rob thought this was very interesting. But the temporal and technical constraints Rob was working with made it impractical to do anything with this idea at the time.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
