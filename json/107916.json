That isn't how I have understood font licenses to work.\n\nAlso,\n\n\"The user of this House Industries font software agrees to credit House Industries as the trademark and copyright owner of the House Industries fonts and list the font names, wherever and whenever design, production, or any other credits are shown.\"\n\nThis seems a little absurd. Does this mean whenever the font is used, it must be identified/credited at the bottom of the design or something? I know that Old Navy uses Eames in their in-store displays, website, and even on their apparel, and I didn't see the font 'credited'.\n\n",
