In this case, exploring Typophile using the Google search would've given you the thread he linked to. In that thread the Duvel logo has been dealt with.\n\nIf you want something similar to the actual neon sign though, take a look at [Linotype Auferstehung](http://web.archive.org/web/20110302213256/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/linotype_auferstehung_virtual/).\n\n"
