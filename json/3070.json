  "content": "Hi,   \n   \ndoing a job for a travel co offering holidays to Romania.   \n   \nThe website is live ( [www.festivaltravel.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803015705/http:/www.festivaltravel.co.uk/)) and the logo is nailed (not here for a crit, certain many here could slaughter my feebleness!) rather I'm here for some much needed deadline slamming into me help...   \n   \nI'm using Drescher Grotesk throughout but the client has asked for cedillas and accents. I can see them in the Character Palette (I'm using Panther BTW) and I can double-click in there to get them to appear as unicode in Tidetext/textedit but of course not in illustrator (10) or InDesign (2).   \n   \nI cannot purchase the font/s as Opentype (I guess that would solve the issue?!) and here in London it's 3.15am and I've lost the will to live trying to fathom this out.   \n   \nAnyone able to solve this or say for certain it's impossible? Can't even find how to get the accent for a la carte ATM.   \n   \nMany thanks for any help offered!\n\n",

This should work in any version of InDesign; you may need Illustrator CS, as this is the only version of Illustrator that supports Unicode.   \n   \nNote that you can also use the InDesign glyph palette, accessible from the Type menu.   \n   \nBy the way, if you have Romanian text, the typographically correct form for the 'cedilla' is actually a kind of small, unattached comma-like mark under the S and T. This may be encoded  or T with _cedilla_ because this is the codepoint used in the old Romanian 8-bit codepages. In Unicode, the Romanian diacritics were disunified from the cedilla forms, and given their own codepoints. You will, of course, be limited by what your font supports.\n\n"

      "content": "I could be wrong, John, but there might be a simpler solution to Marc's dilemma.   \n   \nDepending on which characters you need, you may be able to type them directly from the keyboard. The tricky part is knowing which keys or key combinations to type.   \n   \nBefore Panther, you could just check the Key Caps utility. In Panther, Apple kind of hid hid it. [here is a page](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803015705/http:/www.maccritic.com/tips/article/294_0_12_0_M/) that tells how to get it out of hiding. It's called the Keyboard Viewer now. Once you have it open on your screen, you can find the characters you want easily by trying different shift and option combinations.   \n   \nAlternatively, there are charts showing the standard key combinations, such as [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803015705/http:/www.idiomware.com/accents.html).   \n   \nIt may also be that the font you have does not have the exact accented characters you need. In that case, if you look in the Keyboard Viewer, you will see that there are also accents by themselves. These can be combined with any character using kerning to position them.\n\n"

Insert Glyphs is the kiddie!   \n   \nJust need a way to crack that in AI and I'm cool (I assume that I can do that in AI CS?).   \n   \nMany thanks.   \n   \nI knew someone here would crack this. Consider me happy ;-)   \n   \nI'll be back here to educate and enjoy when I kill this deadline!   \n   \nThanks. One and all... \\*retires busy but happy\n\n"
