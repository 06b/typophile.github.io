With this upgrade comes oodles more of those lovely ligatures we have come to expect from Jean François Porchez. This time around there are 906 glyphs, 40,000 kerning pairs, and 4 Stylistic Sets. For those of you doing the math in your head, that is 15 possible paragraph style sheets for use.\n\nThere is a limited time only discount for those who have previously licensed Parisine Plus from Typofonderie. [Check the site](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808072831/http:/www.typofonderie.com/) for details.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808072831im_/http:/typophile.com/files/parisineplusptf_launch_1.gif)\n\n· | · | · | · | · | · | ·\n\n",
