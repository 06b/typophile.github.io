Looks like some of the lines grew rounded caps when I converted this to a .swf, but you get the basic idea.   \n   \nI was thinking of trying out a sort of rounded hexagon theme for the lowercase letters, to make it more like blackletter.   \n   \nYou can see it at [http://www.oogby.com/oberto.swf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419215835/http:/www.oogby.com/oberto.swf)   \n   \nThanks,   \n   \nBrian\n\n",
