      "content": "\"Fashion\" is such a weasel word. A cool logo for a target clientele of 50+ with about $100,000 disposable income per year could be quite different from one for 25 year olds with $30,000. Also it could be quite different for a new line of dressy shoes, tailored suits, or Lolita look outfits, to name only a few. If it's to cover a wide range of categories, this might push the logo towards those that already exist.  \nAnyway these sort of deals can only work where there is a clear understanding of what the client wants to achieve. Only then can someone say I have what it takes to make this work, or nah, I'll pass on this one.  \nDon\n\n"

You might also want to post your notice at graphic design sites, and also check with some of the local design firms in your city.\n\nIn my opinion, two weeks to design a logo is rushing it if you want to do a proper job. You may go through several rounds of concepts and several rounds of revisions.\n\n"
