  "content": "I'm new here and had a question about designing type. First off, I'm an artist and designer. I like to create/design every aspect of my projects and I've now gotten into type design. My question is: what are some basics I should keep in mind when designing type? For example, as far as I know, you are supposed to start with certain letters and then design the rest of the alphabet? Anyway, any suggestions will be very helpful! Thanks!\n\n",
