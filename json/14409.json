  "content": "—  \nWe’re pleased to announce the arrival of our latest typeface Maple.  \nA distinct departure from our recent releases, Maple is a warm grotesque  \nwith modern sensibilities and historical influences from the 19th and  \nearly 20th centuries. Suited for both text and display settings, the  \ncomplete family contains four weights, companion italics, rugged charm  \nand ostentatious flair.\n\nMaple is available for license as a complete family, in packages  \ncontaining two weights each, or as single weights. Both Mac and Windows  \npurchasers will receive two formats: OpenType (which includes extended  \nlanguage support) and traditional PostScript Type 1.\n\n—  \nSee more of Maple:  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/](http://web.archive.org/web/20051127124917/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/)\n\n",
