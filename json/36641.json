  "content": "Hi  \nI’m looking for a display serif, it needs to be strong, sharp and modern (something like Mercury from HFJ). It would be used for headlines in a newspaper. Farnham is also pretty close, but these feel a bit overused around here. I have always liked the fonts of Gerard Unger, but clients don’t seem to understand him around here.  \nIt would need at least Regular and Bold, but a Light would be great.\n\n [‹ Enlightenment](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36488 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Movie Poster Type; Horror Genre ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36650 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In Sweden it has also been used for several highly ranked tabloids. In Scandinavia everyone looks at everyone, and it’s always nice to find new type. Mercury is more used in Finland in magazines, in Sweden both newspapers and magazines use it a lot.  \nFreight Display was on the top of my list. Now I have to check all these options. Greta does look good.  \nSo does Newzald Kris, but for this project it might not cut the deadline.  \nI’ll go through this as soon as possible. Thanks a lot!\n\nPS.

If not, and you’re open to other contemporary serif styles, then you might consider the Whitman Display family for newspaper headlines. Font Bureau should be announcing the retail release any day now.\n\nWhitman Display is currently used in the [Minneapolis Star Tribune](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002364.php), [Tacoma News Tribune](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=WA_NT&ref_pge=lst), [Idaho Statesman](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=ID_IS&ref_pge=lst), and [New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.newsdesigner.com/archives/002617.php).\n\nThere are some publications in Sweden and Norway that have picked up a few styles of the Display also, but I haven’t seen them in use yet — Ulricehamns Tidning in Sweden, and Firda in Norway.\n\nBTW, Whitman is used for serif text in Finland’s Trendi magazine. This would give you some idea how the typeface works in the Finnish language. But they aren’t using any Display.\n\nI posted some pre-release review samples of the expanded family in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/typophile.com/node/33419) a while back.\n\nWe should have [FB’s website](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Whitman), and [my own](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202193121/http:/www.kentlew.com/Type.html), updated by next week with PDF samples and everything.\n\n— K.\n\n"
