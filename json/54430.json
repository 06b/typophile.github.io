      "content": "Some observations, which may or may not be worth addressing:\n\nI agree with Thomas on the A, think it needs narrowing quite a bit.\n\nB looks a bit dark, the top bowl could be bigger to give more counterspace and lighten the glyph?\n\nE and F are really interesting shapes.\n\nC, G, O, Q and S definitely need some overshoot. C and D and G look a bit light.\n\nThe vertical stem on G looks a bit tall.\n\nThe flared serifs on I and L are not the same as other characters.\n\nThere's something odd happening on the join of K and the lower leg could start a tiny bit nearer the join?\n\nM is interesting too. You might need some overshoot at the top. The flared feet should be curved to match other letters.\n\nThat's a really nice tail on the Q.\n\nMake the spine of S a bit heavier?\n\nTighten the inner counter of the U, the curve looks a little loose.\n\nVWXYZ need curves I think.\n\nLowercase:\n\nGenerally, you need overshoot on the bowl characters, and some of the curves will need smoothing. The joins also.\n\nThe ear of g needs to be more sure of itself and more flowing from the bowl, perhaps with a curve somewhere.\n\nI just noticed your tittles! I think on the exclamation mark the dot should be inverted.\n\nt looks out of character and I think the top needs reviewing.\n\nv looks like the point is too far left.\n\nAre you working on the numerals?\n\nIt'll be very interesting to see how this develops. I think your strongest glyphs are EFMNQS and acfgsy. You could use them to preview other letters against, in order to harmonise the curves more.\n\nHope that's helpful! :)\n\n"

If not, I'll try to show a larger size sample soon.\n\nBendy:\n\nThis absolutely useful, in fact, now I can see many more details and think better how can improve it. I'm taking note.

      "content": "I liked the general feel of it at first glance, but there are a lot of stuff that need attention here.\n\nI would advice against breaking the connection (crossbar) in lowercase æ. A better solution would be a diagonal connection. Also, your å/Å is sloppy. The ring should not touch the letter — it should be centered above it. The ring would also benefit from a shape more like your o in terms of contrast and axis. I also don’t think the slash in Ø/ø is working: It’s to long, not centered and in need of some optical correction.\n\nIn general I think most of your diacritics and a lot of the glyphs listed under “other” need more work. I especially noticed your ogoneks. We had a thread on that topic a short while ago. Do a search for more information.\n\nThorn (uc) and eth (lc) should sit on the baseline with the other glyphs.  \nI’m uncertain about your p descender.  \nO and o don’t have the same contrast or axis.  \nC, G, c and e are leaning left.  \nr needs work.  \nThe eye of g is optically lighter than the tail.  \nI think u might be too wide.  \ny does not look balanced to me.  \nSome of the numbers look sqoushed.  \ns too narrow?  \nHairlines in x/X need optical adjustments.\n\nThere are optical problems all over the place: the x-height isn’t consistent, a lot of the connections between curves and stems get very heavy and what’s with the lowered Ñ? And why is the tilde so different from the lc version?\n\nThat’s my two cents. Forgive me for the lack of proper terminology — I’m not a professional type designer quite yet, so please take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\n"

(The out of center on ‘Å’ was a mistake, now is centered yet)  \n- I’m not sure if ‘Ø, ø’ leave right or not, but not it’s longless and centered, I really don’t know so much about using of this symbol.  \n- The ogonek for me is almost a mistery yet cuz, actually I follow a topic about this before, but yes, I see that I need review for more info.  \n- I try to correct ‘Þ’ height and ‘ð’ position, but I’m still working about.  \n- Now Descenders lenght are balanced to Ascenders height (This happened cuz the ascenders size was changed for increase the x-height before but I forgot change the descenders too, anyway)  \n- ‘O, o’ follow the same contrast and axis now.  \n- Well you mention there “leaning left”, in fact, I tried to put a little bit of calligrafic touch of that kind of leaning specially on that gliphs, but again it was out of the generall system of the alphabeth.  \n- I was work ‘r’ using a “Root five proportion” now (a geometrical greek proportion taken from TRAJAN LETTERING patterns).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425155142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Legan_proportions_6699.png)\n  \n- I also tried to balance optical weights between ‘g’ eye and its tail now.  \n- I need a better trainnig for my eyes in ‘y’ but I test it beside to a Garamond and a Baskerville ‘y’ for get a couple of best references, still is uncertain, so, I decided to go for optical feels.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425155142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/y_LEGAN_6247.png)\n  \n- Numbers still not reviewed.  \n- ‘X, x’ hairlines corrected and proportionated according geometrical greek patterns.  \n- In fact ‘s, S’ is narrowed cuz are following the same pattern based on the “root five” of greek geometrical proportion.  \n- On 'Ñ' I made a such different beside lowercase one cuz actually my native tounge is spanish, and we use this kind, is not so commom but sometimes we have a special version of that, it's just an alternative, done specially for spanish language, I don't know if other cultures or languages need a ‘Ñ’ with a traditional tilde as ‘ñ’.\n\nThank you so much dear mate Frode I appreciate your very useful advices, really.  \nDetails, corrections or any just notice me please, are so welcomed!  \nThank you again and Best regards!\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/Legan\\_1.007\\_0.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425155142/http:/typophile.com/files/Legan_1.007_0.pdf \"http://typophile.com/files/Legan\\_1.007\\_0.pdf\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425155142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Legan_1_4612.007_texto.png)\n\n"

I can forget the /T/ effect resulting from the distance of dieresis and body of /I/ I take a wide value to avoid the \"T\" effect on smallsizes inline /Ï/ so I can fix now the distance of the rest /Ä/Ö/ nearest.  \nI got it better now on hungarian umlauts and doubleacutes about, I'll add this advices to my next review and lookup again my documentation.  \nthank you a lot.\n\n"
