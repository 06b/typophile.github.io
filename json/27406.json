Here I made one, in some variations:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415235753im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typographyyesterday_4274.jpg)\n\nAll critique is welcome.\n\nbtw: I tried to find some info on the Silom typeface, but I couldn't find too much. Only thing I know, is that it's standard on Mac, though not used too often. (Or am I completely wrong with that?)  \nAnyway, I like to play with it.\n\n",
