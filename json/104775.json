  "content": "Hi guys/gals,\n\nThis is my very first post here and let me just say I really enjoy the site! I have a new found love for type, but still have much to learn.  \nI have a million questions, but I will start slow and steady :)\n\nAny tips for combining typefaces? I have read as much info as the internet and books can offer and thought I would ask here. From what I can understand, they should obviously match mood and provide enough contrast. Also, the x-heights and glyph widths should be similar. However, when searching for fonts to purchase or in your own library what is the best way to make those comparisons?\n\nThe art of combining typefaces beyond the traditional pairings I come across amazes me.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n",
