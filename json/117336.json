That's something close to [DIN Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725042400/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/din+condensed)/ [DIN Engschrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725042400/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/engschrift), the main differences for these letters being on /R leg, /2 design and some angled cut finials. For what it's worth, I'd probably start with [Garage Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725042400/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic), possibly the less work to get close of this lettering.\n\n"
