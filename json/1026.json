The Sans serif...Univers 55?????   \nThe source is taken from the new STEP inside design   \nmagazine, if that helps to know also.   \n   \nThanks in advance for the help!   \nLove this site! It's a must-read on weekly basis for me!   \nYou guys are really great!   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050528000037im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14681.jpg)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050528000037im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14682.jpg)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050528000037im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14683.jpg)\n\n",

I didn't like the redesign, either visually or editorially, and let my subscription lapse. (I like the types, though, just not the layout. And if you do manage to read through it all, the content isn't worth it, imho.)   \n   \nDC, my links above are updated to go directly to the Hoefler pages. And yes, the headline is Hoefler Titling. (I mistakenly wrote \"Text Titling\" before.)   \n   \nYves, if I recall correctly, Jonathan said he was more influenced by Granjon and the generation just after Garamond.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
