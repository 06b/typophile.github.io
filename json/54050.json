  "content": "I supposed this is a very novice question, but I was curious what the best font bundles are to buy. For example, I was on [Emigre's](http://web.archive.org/web/20130704055917/http:/www.emigre.com/) website and was looking at the Mrs. Eaves type bundles. Open type has everything from ligatures to numbers and beyond, but there's a smaller (and less expensive) one without all the ligatures, fractions, etc.\n\nI suppose the question I post is when purchasing a font should you purchase the Open type files or is it best to buy what you need and move forward from there?\n\n",
