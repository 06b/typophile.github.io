  "content": "I am a graphic design student at the University of Notre Dame and am doing a type specimen book on Adrian Frutiger's typeface Frutiger. I need to include the \"story\" of the typeface, its original intended purpose, examples of its use, its design characteristics, Frutiger's background, his design intent, and historical images and context.\n\nThe majority of the information I have been able to find online and in various books, but I still am in need of images of its use and just general information on the typeface.\n\nIf you know anything or have any images please let me know\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Only recently, I saw it at the [Leipzig public transport](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019091607/http:/www.lvb.de/).  \nF\n\n"
