  "content": "I am wondering if anyone has ever thought about porting fonts for jail-broken iPhones. What’s your stance on it? OK as long as you don’t sell it and you own the license? I feel like the risks for losses due to copyright infringement would be minimal, since all the metrics and UPM size are different for the iPhone, making them not viable for print or commercial use anymore.\n\n",

You purchased a license to use it as described in said license. Whether or violating the license harms the author is irrelevant. Whether or not it wouldn’t bother you to have someone format-shift your work is irrelevant to the license you agreed to. Don’t come around here looking for people to tell you it’s OK to otherwise just because _you’re_ cool with it.\n\n"

You asked for other people's opinions and proceeded to rationalize your own.\n\nHonestly, piracy on the iphone is a valid concern, there are a number of font hacks on Cydia that seem to include copies of commercial fonts. I've played around with porting my own fonts onto the iphone and you'd be surprised by how very few change need to be made.\n\nIf you're really into hacking and skinning your phone and actually do care about doing it \"correctly\" you should check your font  \ns EULA to see if it allows re-engineering and installing on additional devices. If it doesn't, contact the foundry, explain what you want to do, and ask for permission.\n\n"

You are correct about how easy it would be. I’m in the process of skinning my phone, and if I decide it’s worth changing the font, I will contact the foundry and explain my situation.\n\nMichel, thanks for sharing your research. However, I wonder if that license agreement allows for necessary modifications to font metrics to make it compatible with the device.\n\nOtherwise, I would have to agree with both you and aluminum. Especially if the license permits installation on 5 computers, it would be comparable to burning your songs to CD for your car.\n\n"
