The book is finished, and in the process of getting it out the door, we have noticed two places where changes we made reverted to their old versions, in one case the version it reverted to was weeks old. I know that this is not just my memory playing tricks on me because we confirmed it by going back and looking at printouts, and the printouts were fine, but at some point the content changed even though nobody was working on those pages.\n\nHas anyone else seen this happening?\n\n",

As soon as I used the book function the documents were saved again on the server, it took me quite a while until I realized this.\n\n"

'document102009.indd' so if you have to recover or compare it, you don't have to go on an archaeological expedition to see the differences.\n\nIn the spirit of unbridled creativity,\n\nTroy Vera  \nKingdom Graphics  \n [http://www.kingdomgraphics.biz](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203124738/http:/www.kingdomgraphics.biz/ \"http://www.kingdomgraphics.biz\")  \nYahoo IM: kingdom\\_graphics  \nSkype: kingdom\\_graphics\n\n"

The line breaking algorithm is revised for CS4, as the older versions (at least going back to CS) tended to kick out the last single word or syllable, leaving this more often on a last line than statistically likely.\n\nThe new line breaking routines are only applied to stories that are actually edited in CS4; if you don't edit something, it'll remain the same (and if you _do_ edit something, the line breaks will be better!).\n\nWhenever and whereever possible, I refrain from upgrading software across documents.\n\n"
