  "content": "Hello,\n\nCould someone please help me identify this font? My apologies for the poor quality of the image but it's the best I could find. The grey around the letters isn't part of the font just a distortion caused by me trying to increase the contrast to show it better. It is a solid, serifs font. I looks a little bit like \"Incised 901\" fonts but this font has Serifs while Incised does not.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks  \nEmma\n\n",
