I'd be curious to hear what you think of my piece, the visual interpretation of a poem entitled \"Outside the Slaughterhouse\" by Ted Genoways.   \n   \n [http://www.bornmag.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803100234/http:/www.bornmag.com/)   \n   \n//jared\n\n",

I enjoyed the cuts of meat metaphor.   \n   \nHowever, it would be nice if when you moused over the individual lines of the poem, there was more time to absorb the words before they faded away.   \n   \n-tim\n\n"

      "content": "I think your \"clinical\" treatment gives extra   \nsharpness to the poem. If the choppy delivery   \nof the text (where the reader is hastened and   \nsometimes forced to backtrack - like the poor   \nlivestock itself) is intentional, then that's   \ngreat. One idea: a subtle sound track (maybe   \nsomething like at snarg.net, or JMJ's Zoolook)   \nwould add to it, as long as it's in a very   \nmuffled, low-frequency range.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
