Why doesn’t Typophile’s favicon show up in my browser?”<br>\n</cite>\n\nIt did show up quite nicely until I visited this little French typography site, where this funny little “T” decided to off the Typophile favicon and to attach it’s self to the Typophile bookmark tab and now, it won’t go away. It just struck me as kind of an odd little quirk. or maybe... international intrigue. :-)\n\nDon, agreed. Sometimes a worrd is worth a thousand pictures. I thopught that funny lookin’ “T” would speak for it’s self.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
