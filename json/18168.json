I realize it could be custom but I'm hoping for a simpler explanation. By the way, note the Georgia italic with the custom \"y.\" Any help appreciated as always.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [peoplefont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141228173333/http:/typophile.com/files/peoplefont.jpg) | 99 KB |\n\n",
