If want to recreate the logo, all you need is the small caps/OSF font ($20), but if you want the full set of roman, italic, and SC/OSF, you'll have to shell out ~$57 on MyFonts (there's also an Italic Oldstyle Figures, for an additional $20, but if you're trying to save money I wouldn't buy that unless you find yourself with a specific need for the figures in italics)\n\n"
