These were often photo manipulated versions of various fonts.  \nPerhaps not digitized. Some checking of the photo lettering catalogs may produce a match.

As you both said, close to [Milano Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805100702/http:/e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/m/milano-roman.html) and the work of Tom Carnase. It mixes influences from [Tom's Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805100702/http:/e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/t/toms-roman.html) (Carnase's again), [Trooper Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805100702/http:/e-daylight.jp/design/fonts/type/t/trooper-roman.html) and **[PLINC Caslon Benguiat](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805100702/http:/www.photolettering.com/)**, Benguiat's version of Caslon, digitized by Christian Schwartz and available through House Industries Photo-Lettering catalog (possibly the closest shamelessly squooshing it).\n\n"
