  "content": "Hello one and all.\n\nI am sort of new here. I have posted a couple of times and never really introduced myself. My name is Joseph and Im a typoholic. I am a graphic designer from NYC, and have loved letters most of my life. Even in grade school my only A on my report card was in penmenship. It hasn't been untill recentley have I really focused my attention into the development of type, and have started to try and develop my own fonts. I started out drawing letters were they were always trying to be different, but not different were I would be actually breaking the rules, but by doing what I wanted without really knowing the rules. So from here I read, and I read, and I read everything I could get my hands on about type. Then I decided to start simpe, learn the rules and eventually I will be able to go back were I started. And that is what I wanted to do with this font. Right now it is only an uppercase font, and eventually I think I would like to add a small caps.\n\nPlease let me know what you think. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts.\n\nThanks.\n\njoseph\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124133659/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled.pdf) | 436.91 KB |\n\n",

I am going to work on it and hopefully have something up this weekend.\n\nDon, I am curious you say that the M should have a pointed vertex because it would work with the other slanted strokes. I'm not sure what that means. Is it because my slanted strokes do not rest on the baseline like my A or K? Would you have the tops of the M pointed as well like a futura M. Just want to make sure I fully understand.\n\nthanks again!\n\njoseph\n\n"
