  "content": "Yesterday I downloaded AFDKO for the first time. It seems like a useful tool, so I decided to give it a try. I've just got a couple of questions for those of you more experienced with it than me...\n\n1. When checkOutlines is run, I'm getting a few _\"Need to inspect for possible loop/inflection\"_ warnings. Nowhere can I find, however, what a loop/inflection is. I'm guessing that it might be reversed control points on a node causing the outline to loop back on itself, but I don't have any of those issues, nor can I find anything wrong with the flagged outline segments. Of course it's only a suggestion to check the glyph outline, so maybe there's nothing wrong at all. Even more likely, is that I don't understand the warning.\n\n2. The second mystery notice says variations of, _\"Need to fix point(s) outside triangle by 0 units in X and 1 units in Y.\"_ Again, I can take a wild guess that this might be telling me that both control points need to be on the same side of the curve. Again, I'm likely wrong, but if not, why does it matter? I see no particular reason why this would cause a problem as long as it doesn't cause any un-noded (is that a word) extreme points. FontLab has no warnings about this, and I've never run into any issues because of it.\n\nCan anyone shed a little light on this cryptic stuff?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
