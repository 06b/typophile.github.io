      "content": "In FontLab, when you create kerning pairs in the Metrics window, it only updates the kern table, not the kern feature. In order to bring the kern feature up to date with the kern table, you have to rebuild the kern feature. You can do this in the Kerning Assistance window. If you haven't done this, FontLab will remind you and give you the option to do it when you generate an OT font.\n\nNormally, if you're doing all your kerning within FontLab using the Metrics window, there's no harm in doing it when you generate an OT font.\n\nI don't know what's causing the freeze, but it's probably not related to rebuilding the kern feature.\n\n"

      "content": "BTW, the only time it's bad to rebuild the kern feature is if you've edited the kern feature code directly in the OT Panel or have generated it outside of FontLab (using something like Metrics Machine, for instance). Rebuilding the kern feature will wipe out whatever you've done, replacing it with whatever happens to be in the kern table.\n\n"
