There are some things I love about Zine, but to me it seems to lack some polish.   \n   \nAs for the body text, I think it didn't change with the recent redesign, but I forget what it is. I find it a bit mannered.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

You can see a sample here [http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=243431](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526221214/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=243431)   \nor in the Precision Type Reference Guide (5.0) if you have that at your disposal. The redesigned face is called _EcoType_; it's clearly a derivative of _Economist_, but is a little lighter and slightly more condensed in comparison.   \n   \nBut James is right: Erik is the source.   \n   \nJon\n\n"
