In most fonts, the less & greater glyphs may work OK with numbers, but look awful in text. It is easy enough to make up an alternative pair that work with such text.\n\nBUT:\n\nAs best I can tell, there are no greater or less characters in the Mathematical Operators portion of Unicode (2200-22FF), or in the supplement (2A00-2AFF) — or anywhere else. All we have are U+003C and U+003E, so that rules out using the ASCII greater and less for text, and another pair for math.\n\nNor can I think of a contextual substitution that is foolproof. You could switch them to less.alt and greater.alt when preceded by or followed by an alpha character or punctuation, but there are cases where alphas are a part of an expression that should take the mathematical form.\n\nMy current notion is to put them in a stylistic set, but that means the typesetter will have to remember to switch it on for such citations, and that too has its perils.\n\nAnybody have a better solution?\n\n [‹ Glyphname extension problems](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821131631/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44043 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [å showing up with “stroked” a ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821131631/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44167 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

As long as I have to manually search & replace a manuscript, I might as well draw up what is needed. As you know, the .alt will drop out, leaving the “greater” & “less”, which seems to be the actual character.\n\nThe right answer, I think, is that these are not a part of the URL, but are in fact delimiters.

I have never seen them look right. I would probably make do with something like this, though I would have to check for the weights on paper.

Really, not even the designer could decide this, it will take a combination of design & editorial acting in concert to get any change.\n\nWhat I finally came up — with for this time anyway — is modified greater & less symbols, to be used only with text. They are switched on by a stylistic set, and using InDesign paragraph styles, you can do this for the entire bibliography without having to manually search & replace.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821131631im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/less1_4143.gif)\n  \nFor a contextual substitution to work, we’d probably need to use regular expressions, and I don’t believe they can currently be used in OpenType features.\n"

I think both of Michaels examples work the best.</cite>\n\nHere, I have a problem. A book is frequently “repurposed.” It is important that the character names stay the same. For example, we just had an inquiry from a publisher who had bought the rights for a book from another publisher. To bring out the new edition, the text will either have to be rekeyed, or extracted from an exiting PDF file. This extraction isn’t an automatic process, and I guess you could argue that whoever is doing the work could be on the lookout for this sort of thing — angle brackets or guillemets that really should be greater/less. But it is best not to add to the problems of whoever is extracting the text (probably us in this case).\n\nI suppose by now I’m just back on my tired old horse of trying to inform the type design world that they cannot dictate things; that aside from any preferences of end users of type, editors <cite>really</cite> rule the roost.\n\nWhat I was looking for was a better way to code a features file, but I do thank you all for the suggestions.\n\nCharles\n\n"

All you need to do is define a macro at the top of the file, say \\starturl and \\endurl and then use the macro in the text. You are then free to change the shape of those characters at will. When you “reprocess” the text, you need only redefine the macro. Years ago, many math characters were done that way.\n\n"

That is still the case. The only thing we won’t cave on is when they also want the fonts. “Nope,” I say “not allowed with the font licenses.”\n\n"

There are any number of books that use simple “math” constructions with plus, minus, equals, greater/less, etc. I’ll use oldstyle numbers, and also make up a set of plus-minus-equal-divide-greater-less etc. glyphs to match them. With that set, the “greater” and”less have to match the other conjunctors, and are still too long for a good URL delimiter.\n\nBut when, as most of the time, we’re setting books designed by the publisher’s designer, they specify figure style. Some will use old style figs as above, some switch to lining as soon as they see an equal sign.\n\nMoreover, publishers have house rules, too. For example, one allows small caps in the text, but requires full caps in the back matter (notes & bibliography). There is a certain rationale to this, notes and bibliographical entries are almost by definition “interrupted.” Further, the editors don’t have to go through them & worry about GmbH, MoMA, etc. Frequently, when I design for this publisher, I switch to lining figures in the backmatter, so you don’t have citations from newspapers with a cap for the section coupled with an old-style number <cite>New York Times,</cite> C1.\n\nAgain, the point is the type designer can think up all sorts of neat tricks that work in some idealized world, but won’t work given the practices of publishers.\n\nThe beginning of a URL is http. You also see ftp & a few others — easy to identify. If you could somehow jump to the matching “greater than” from the beginning “less” in a OT feature, this is a solvable problem. Easy to do with regular expressions, but I don’t believe you can use them.\n\n"

Nevertheless, since true angle brackets are not available on a typical computer keyboard, the “less than” and “greater than” symbols are often used instead. These are often loosely referred to as angle brackets when used in this way. For example, the symbols &lt; and &gt; are often used to set apart URLs in text, such as “I found it on Example.com &lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;”. It may also often be found to indicate an e-mail address, such as “This photo is copyrighted by John Smith &lt;john@smith.com&gt;”, and is the computer-readable form for such in message headers as specified by <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080821131631/http:/tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822\">RFC 2822</a>.</cite>\n\nFrom the same entry we read:\n\n<cite>True angle brackets are available in Unicode at code points U+27E8 and U+27E9 (for mathematical use) and or U+3008 and U+300[9] (for East Asian languages). A third set of angle brackets are encoded at U+2329 and U+232A, but officially “discouraged for mathematical use”[5] because they are canonically equivalent to the CJK code points U+300… and thus likely to render as double-width symbols.</cite>\n\nContrary to “less than” and “greater than”, code points for angle brackets are thus numerous and the use of “less than” or “greater than” for URLs comes from our limited keyboards, or so it seems.\n\nMichel\n\n"
