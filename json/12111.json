I can't even squeak in tiny little .gif files) and can't link either :(\n\nAnyways, here are the links for anyone willing to cut and paste them:\n\n[http://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104164104/http:/studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography1.jpg \"http://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography1.jpg\")  \n [http://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104164104/http:/studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography2.jpg \"http://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography2.jpg\")  \n [http://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104164104/http:/studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography3.jpg \"http://studentpages.scad.edu/~jschul23/typography3.jpg\")\n\nThanks so much!\n\n",

Now here's synchronicity at work; regards the typography.3.jpg - last week a student called Minna Pesonen left samples reproduced from a 1906 newspaper featuring the very same typeface on my desk, with a request to please identify the headline type.\n\nAlthough I looked for it myself in various references (including the very Victorian Typographical Volume, Early Advertising Art by Clarence Hornung) to no avail, I also directed her to this site, but without realising this particular face was already under discussion.\n\nLooks like Columbus Bold/Beaumarchais is about to enjoy a resurgence in popularity...!\n\n"
