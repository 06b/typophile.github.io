Feel free to inform us about your method, inspiration, &c. but the best entries will speak for themselves.\n\n3- As with other type battles, this starts on a Monday and ends this Friday (which happens to be 2 days after Halloween, no points will be reduced with November entries).\n\n// **Judging & Prizes**  \nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\n",

They shouldn't be treated as mere food or amusement devices for unthinking people.\n\nDon't carve your pumpkin, talk to it ... it is -kin- after all.\n\n"
