I've browsed a number of square fonts but nothing that quite matches the shape and thinness.\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824092125im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1002992_551852768184715_1063285284_n_3683.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1002992\\_551852768184715\\_1063285284\\_n.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140824092125/http:/typophile.com/files/1002992_551852768184715_1063285284_n.png) | 434.69 KB |\n\n",
