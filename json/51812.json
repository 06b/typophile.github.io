The combination of customized bullets (custom font & color) and Indent to Here command keeps me stressed as it appeared in one printed book I design. I didn't notice the problem when checking PDF files. No I always doublecheck all pages where I use customized bullets and indent. The other solution is not to use Indent to Here and rather use negative values for first line indent.\n\n"
