The letter spacing is a little too tight I think. Try tracking it out a little. Or you could shrink the word space, though I think that would be more of a display setup.\n\nGood work!\n\n"

      "content": "You are welcome!\n\nAlso, most of the letters are relatively narrow, which is fine. But with that in mind, some of the letters seem a little wide (VWXYZ, and u).\n\nTop right of the K is low.\n\nS spine needs attention\n\nThe joins on your diagonals WVM etc seem too flat to me, but my preference is more of a point when possible.\n\nTake another look at your stem connections in letters like nmhbd etc. It seems like the arch stroke gets thick again before it joins the stem instead of tapering down until it joins.\n\nAnd yes, spacing is difficult. But like all parts of type design, it is mostly about training your eyes how to see. To see that something is wrong, and even harder to see what is making it wrong. It looks like you have good instincts for it, so keep going!\n\nRandy\n\n"
