  "content": "Hello!  \nI'm trying to find books or publications on dictionary design. I've found only a tiny amount of works on this subject, and only about contemporary redesigns. Can any of you help me on this?  \nI'm particularly interested on typography of old dictionaries and the organization of information in them... i've tried - with no sucess - to find anything close to this, but nothing on bookshops, nothing on libraries, nothing on the internet...  \nThank you for all the help you can \"post\" here :)\n\n(P.S. sorry for my rough english...)\n\n",
