I have to recreate the entire front page of The New York Times from 1960 and I'm wondering if anyone here might know what they used to typeset the following:\n\n– the main headlines  \n– the date & price etc in the masthead  \n– subheadings  \n– main body copy\n\nThank you for any advice!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725060756im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tmp1A156_3989.jpg)\n\n",
