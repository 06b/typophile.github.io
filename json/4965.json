That's skill. That's what I think a good typographer should do.   \nAnd that has been my experience.   \n   \nMy comment in the other thread may have sounded severe, but please note that this mainly concerns book typography. I have nothing against more expressive typography _per se_.   \n   \nAnd if you have some good examples where crazy typefaces enhance crazy content in sweet harmony, please allow me to make some exceptions to my rule.   \n   \n�\n\n",

      "content": "I don't think there is really a dichotomy here.   \n   \nI doubt whether we do _need_ more than a handful of functional typefaces (for book typography, at least). But the fact is, we _have_ more than a handful. Precisely because no one typeface stands head and shoulders above the others on any functional grounds (many work pretty well), we will continue to have a choice.   \n   \nIn these circumstances, to insist on using just one typeface for everything is itself a choice.   \n   \nAmong the many choices a designer makes, choice of typeface may well be relatively unimportant. But there is no reason in principle why a designer may not use a variety of different typefaces and use them all with sensitivity and care. Admittedly, excessive promiscuity may be a bad idea (because it often takes a while to get the \"hang\" of a particular typeface); but within reason choice may be good. If it helps the designer to keep fresh and enthusiastic, that may be good too.   \n   \nHow then to choose? For a whole range of reasons. Some technical (lots of information, little space; narrow columns; need oldstyle figures or not; need bold or not; need small caps or not); some personal (I like this type, not that). I see no reason why allusiveness and resonance to subject or period _should not_ form part of these considerations, if you want them to.   \n   \nIf there are no such resonances then, at worst, those who believe there are will be selecting usable type for the wrong reasons. They are deluding themselves in supposing that their careful allusiveness adds anything, but it is a harmless delusion. Rot only sets in if it leads to the choice of faces which are functionally poor; but I see no reason to suppose, given the range of acceptable faces available, why that should happen.\n\n"

However, it's hardly an argument to stop making new faces, redundant or not, nor an argument to stop paying attention to finer details when circumstances allow. But that's another discussion.   \n   \nAs for crazy content, I believe I've posted about this novel on Typophile before, but I'll bring it up again: Mark Z. Danielewski's _[House of Leaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825105005/http:/search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=AQv1v3Mqi6&isbn=0375703764&itm=1)_ is, in my direct experience, a great example of a variety of typefaces (most of which are quite common and non-crazy) used in a crazy way, along with one more expressive (read as: distressed) typeface used for content generated by a character who is literally going crazy.   \n   \nThe effects are not necessary for communication, but really add a lot. I recommend checking it out in a bookstore if you have the opportunity. The more standard book typesetting leaves something to be desired, but the layout acrobatics required to deal with the literally and intentionally labrynthian narrative are impressive in their own right. It's a good example of fine book typography taking a back seat to just about every other consideration while not damaging the experience too dramatically as a result. The reading experience is so broken up by physical and narrative jumps that it becomes quite minor, in fact (not much extended, continous reading).   \n   \nIt's hard to explain what I mean without the book on hand, but it's a very interesting special case in book typography.\n\n"

      "content": "In the realm of display type, few would doubt that \"expression\" is valuable in a font, which means we can never have enough of them. In the text realm there is indeed reason to doubt the usefulness of more than a handful of fonts, because immersive reading precludes conscious aesthetic impressions. In fact it might seem that the only good reason to make a new text fonts is to solve emerging technical issues.   \n   \nBut when you take into account that the _subconscious_ is also open to being \"impressed\" (albeit in a very different way than the consciousness), you realize that it's really mostly a matter of subtlety, not exclusion, of features. This is why everything has to be toned down in a text font: first it has to \"go below the radar\" of the consciousness, for it to have any hope of marking its effect in immersive reading.   \n   \nIn the subsoncious, more \"primal\" things matter. For example, sharp corners say something and soft coners say something else, no matter that the reader can't verbalize -or even realize- the difference. This is what makes text design such a black art.   \n   \nSo choosing Garamond for a SciFi novel isn't bad because it will ruin readability (it won't), it's bad because it wastes the opportunity to _gently amplify_ the content.

It requires more typographic skill to work with a new face and discover/invent the setting that is right for the job and not intrusive (i.e. \"expressive\").

It is no more expressive than a change between roman and italic to indicate a foreign word. When someone speaks of 'expressive typography', I take this to mean typography that is somehow emotive, that draws on conventional cultural or subcultural associations to suggest a particular mood. Changing from a renaissance typeface to a romantic typeface (romantic in the art historical sense, not the emotive sense) does not seem to me particularly expressive.   \n   \nThere is relatively little typography of the kind shown in the example for the simple reason that most authors use language to establish narrative point of view, not naff typographic tricks.\n\n"

And Aldus' mark even represented progress (a steady progress.)   \n   \nThe italic though of course was based on handwriting, but Griffo seemed to be more interested in how it saved space - technical progress. But typographic progress shouldn't be constrained to technical progress, and in Aldus' case, it even became cultural progress.   \n   \nHowever, isn't using the same \"reliable\" type comparable to looking at the same style of paintings over and over? Should we be content to keep seeing the same exhibit century after century? While most of us I think would agree to use as few typefaces as possible in a single book, for a whole country to use a handful of typefaces is something different and more extreme.   \n   \nAt the same time, with all of my ranting for progress, I have to say this.. I have been using Sabon lately in semi-lengthy amounts of childrens' book reading, for more than one book. Mainly because of its legibility, but also because I want to stay away from ligatures and the short f's look great next to the i's without using ligatures. The more I use it, the harder I think it's going to be for me to break away from it...not because of stubborness, but because I feel like I am learning how to really use it, and I appreciate something different each time..Which might seem anti-progress, since I've been looking at the same painting for the last few books.. ha. At the same time, I'm always looking out for something that might convey my message better.. either through functionality or...By the way, are there any other types of progress that I'm missing out? Communication, cultural.. functional/technical... ?   \n   \nSo perhaps, progress is just as important in the designer as it is in the typeface. (Ah.. okay. So I think, then, Fredrik, that you are saying \"more so\".) ? And if a designer's progress is more important to the reader than typographic progress.. the two should work more closely together than the current process of: type designer makes it in one country and designer buys it and uses it in another. I personally think the relationships need to be tighter, but designing brochures is faster than designing a typeface, so the two will probably never meet up perfectly. But it's so important for designers to have a good knowledge of type. I think I have more favorite type designers than I have graphic designers.. hmm..   \n   \nI'm seeing both sides, but there's a side effect to not caring if a typeface sheds light onto a text. It's the whole.. not caring. Good design comes in part from having layers of meaning. The page proportions, paper selection, cover design, choice of typeface, etc. can affect the atmosphere of the book and help tell the story. Why would you want to pass up this opportunity?

Here's another way of looking at it:   \n   \nPoggio invented the humanist script c.1400. It has been described by Donald M. Anderson as \"plodding\" and \"sober\". This is the writing style that Jenson's definitive Roman face interprets.   \n   \nDuring the Incunabula, in the later 1400s, the work of the Italian writing masters (eg Sanvito, Sinibaldi) had become more stylishly cursive, no doubt to distinguish itself from printed text.   \n   \nThe era saw a swan song for the manuscript writer, before the profession morphed into a smaller number of Writing Masters (Instructors), the best of whom published how-to manuals.   \n   \nSinibaldi designed pages that were predominantly his cursive (ie Italic), mixed with \"small caps\".   \n   \nIt is this look which Aldus captured in type.   \n   \nSo, the origin of the Italic type style is caused by the swan song virtuosity of the manuscript hand, itself a reaction to the plainness of the original Roman typefaces.   \n   \nLots of interplay between old and new media -- exploited by artists looking for new forms, supported by a progressive marketplace.\n\n"
