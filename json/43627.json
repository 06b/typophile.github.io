A couple of thoughts occur to me -- pure speculation and probably completely fanciful:\n\n1) Perhaps the wide punch was cut and the matrix struck; and then the punch was reworked, trimming the upper terminal, and a new matrix struck.\n\n2) At the very least, I can imagine that the same counterpunch would have been utilized.\n\n3) Perhaps it is all in our imagination and the one that seems narrower has simply worn down at the top.\n\nI suppose you've examined this closely enough to clearly identify a pattern of narrow variants and can rule out number three.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

He then designed his own typefaces, cut by the great Charles Malin. Try to find specimens of Mardersteig’s Griffo, Dante, Zeno, Fontana, Pacioli, etc. they’re incredibly beautiful. There’s [quite a bit of information here on Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047/http:/www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=mardersteig+site:typophile.com&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), too.\n\nHe was a friend of Stanley Morison and produced extensive, scholarly research on Francesco Griffo da Bologna, Felice Feliciano, Aldo Manuzio, Leon Battista Alberti, calligraphers from the Renaissance and roman inscription in Italy and abroad, among other subjects.\n\nIn a word, he’s a legend.\n\nRe-reading my earlier post now, maybe it might have sounded as if I was talking about Jenson’s type being mixed in the case, but I was still referring to the De Aetna type, which I think might share some of the traits of Jenson’s Eusebius type concerning the presence/use of alternates.\n\n"

This is his redrawing of them, taken from Nicolas Barker’s reproduction in his essay of 1974 on the Aldine types in Paris.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/De%20Aetna%20type%20-%20variant%20sorts%20-%20Barker%20after%20Mardersteig%20500_3600.jpg)\n\nThe _De Aetna_ is printed from newly cast type and it has been called a kind of type specimen. But it is an odd piece of setting. There are several examples of u used upside down for n, and the other way round too I think, so maybe the caster was still at work and had not produced enough sorts to be used for the page in hand. It seems an odd thing to say about a book and a type that have been so endlessly discussed, but someone should really look at both of them more carefully.\n\nI am not sure I fully accept all Mardersteig’s variants as being derived from different punches rather than variations caused by the casting and handling of the type. He redrew them to emphasise the variations he undoubtedly believed that he saw. But an actual example, like the image below, is more ambiguous.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Aldus%20-%20De%20Aetna%20-%20det%203%20500_6405.jpg)\n\nThere is not much doubt, I suppose, about the variant m and n (not shown here), and c too, but are the examples of different-looking a and e and u all really from different punches and intended as alternative forms? Still, the example shows some alternative sorts that are not in Mardersteig’s examples: a swash form of e that seems to be intended for the end of a word (there was a swash m too). But what is the long-tailed a doing in the middle of a word? And what was the function of the two p’s? Was the ‘majuscule’ style an experimental new form that might have replaced the other? More investigation needed.\n\nOne needs to remember that the e with its horizontal crossbar was equally experimental. We accept it as the normal form because of the prestige of the French imitations of the _De Aetna_ type of over thirty years later.\n\nThere are plenty of ligatured sorts in Griffo’s italic for Aldus. But are there variant forms of single letters? I remain to be convinced.\n\n"

In the case of Aldus I think there is less intention involved in the use of varients except in the ra, although I am not utterly settled about this. In the case of the Jenson it is looking more & more deliberate to me. The Aldine seems to have far more varients than the Jenson. In both cases it was the lightest inkings that seemed most useful. they look less good but as evidence they seem great. I will post the photos I took through a loupe soon.

That makes this much harder, when I have some time after graduation I’ll get the library to do some macro shots.\n\nThe books I looked at were the _Biblia Latina_, _Naturalis Historia_, and _De Evangelica Praeparatione_. The bible turned out to be set in blackletter, and is very butch with studded leather covers and straps, but not especially applicable as the heavy impression and chunky letters make spotting alternates a nightmare. But there did appear to be at least two versions of **a** , distinguished by their upper counters, one appearing narrower and more geometric, the other slightly wider and rounded. The narrower version often appears at the beginnings of, and after t and r. Again, the type design, heavy imprint and thick paper make it hard to discern if these differences are intentional.\n\nIn the other two books I focused on the letter **a** after **t** , **r** , and **g**. I noticed the same patterns as Eben— **a** is often a narrower sort after t and r, as well as at the beginning of words. There is a very narrow, effete **a** that sometimes appears after **g** , the difference is so strong it is obvious without magnification. What stood out to me was that the use of the alternates appeared inconsistent—it does not occur everywhere, but not random. I don’t know latin, so I cannot tell if this is somehow related to the grammar.\n\nAnd now for a tangent: the next time you feel bad about shipping a book with a nasty error, remember that Nicholas Jenson shipped at least one without checking to be sure that the rubricators filled in all of the drop caps!\n\n"

Partly this was for the reason Fry gives but partly it was because in order to look like a book and to make a text that people would recognize as a legitimate text you simply had to have them. Think about how fancy pants typophiles feel about f ligatures and bump it up 12+ notches or so!\n\nThe thing is, when you read about the Bremer Presse the reason for their sorts ( as given) is the same - to make a more even page. But if you actually look at how they are used it doesn't 100% totally wash. What is true though is that if you have a tight line of text where you wish you had more space it is easy to swap those narrow r shapes & narrow s shapes in - and they do work reasonably well.\n\nWhat is certain is that the letter culture of the day in which Jenson made his letters was one where having more than one r would be seen as traditional/natural/obvious etc. The other thing is that what Jenson as was doing was high craft - like - well it's hard to say now because we don't have places to go buy custom made stuff much anymore. But they definitely did. 99% of everything you could buy would have been. Standardization would have been the novel notion - not custom design. Standardizing on 5 or 6 r shapes might have seemed like a big leap!\n\nI think Alan May is a good source for Fry. ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "I got a new sample today from Vassar. They say it's 1470. And... It seems to lack the features I had seen elsewhere. There do seem to be two \"a\" shapes but their differences are subtle and their use does not seem to follow a pattern. One \"a\" has a spring tail and the other is lightLook at the word \"natura\" on the 3rd line. I would have expected a variant \"a\" after the r there. I don't see one. It may be that at this size casting differences obliterate any possibility of detective work.\n\nThe font is is quite small I think. I have included some paper texture and some brushwork next to the sample to give you some idea. The sample didn't have a ruler but I think I can draw some inferences.\n\nI am still looking at the r. In general the r used is the one with the flat (vertical) end. But there is the word \"inferre\" at the bottom of this sample. The second r seems like a variant to me.\n\nThe diamond shaped colon \":\" is pretty cool isn't it?\n\nThe long serif under the r's arm is great.\n\nSorry you have to scroll.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jenson_4906.1470.vassar.sample.jpg)\n\n"

Still, if anybody can take additional images or has them I would be grateful for the help.\n\nEven though it does look a little like there could be a pattern in the \"r\"s in this sample it's pretty weak I think.\n\nThe fact that this image doesn't show paper fiber is also a strike against trying to use it.\n\n"

When all’s said and done I’m still impressed by Jenson’s achievement and letters, but there’s some nasty stuff in there that leaves me wondering why people label his letters the most beautiful Romans ever printed.\n\n"

This positioning simply prevents collisions with the terminals of the forenamed two letters.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jenson_accents_5587.jpg)\n\nYou also will have noticed that in Jenson’s type the ‘long’ s shares the width with the f, which creates a gap to the next letter. The f and ‘long’ s in the type for the _Aetna_, which Griffo clearly based on Jenson’s model, show shorter terminals and a ı (dotless i) is used after these letters. I have seen a ı erroneously used upside down in the _Aetna_, but unfortunately at the moment I don’t recall where.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Griffo_kerning_3803.jpg)\n\nThe two following examples (of which one is taken from this topic) show that Jenson for instance also applied alternatively kerned T-capitals.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jenson_kerning_5469.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803031047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jenson_kerning_2_4404.jpg)\n\nFEB\n\n"
