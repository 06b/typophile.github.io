      "content": "Taschen did a series of books under the heading “All-American Ads” for every decade from from the 1900s up to the 1980s. They’re cheap and commonly found in libraries, so even if your local library doesn’t have them you can just use an inter-library loan to get them sent over. Use these books to find corporations that went to Helvetica, and from there you can start tracking down non-advertising pieces.\n\nThere are several good books on Vignelli that will have a lot of “after” images, and for the high-profile identities like American Airlines you should be able to track down “before” images with help from librarians. You should also contact the Knoll furniture company and see if there is somewhere in England that you can look over a collection of their identity materials pre and post Vignelli.\n\n"
