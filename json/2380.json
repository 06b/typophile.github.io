Attacks within Israel have been Arafat's biggest bargaining chip: they brought the weary Israelis to the negotiating table at Oslo to offer land in return for peace. Arafat promised peace, but never delivered, and the Israelis didn't deliver the land -- because neither side trusts the other --, so there has been a violent stalemate for the past two years. The Fence changes the whole equation, because if Palestinian militants can't launch attacks within Israel anymore, then Arafat has nothing left to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is justifiably worried, and the idea of 'pushing for a one-state solution' just shows how desperate they are. On what basis are they going to push? Blowing up civilians in Israel is the only card in their hand, the offer of peace their only negotiating tool. If Israel makes it impossible for Palestinian militants to operate within Israel, Arafat will be left sitting outside the fence with a lot of angry Hamas members on his hands, probably wishing that he'd cracked down on them like he promised to do at the Oslo peace talks.   \n   \nAnd I write this in full sympathy for the ordinary Palestinian people who, once again, will be the victims of both Israeli policy _and their own corrupt and strategically-blind leadership._\n\n"

Don't be surprised if one day even a \"dirty bomb\" goes off in the heart of Jerusalem, when the time is right (read: when the Palestinians are desparate enough). BTW, I'm not condoning such acts, in fact I'd like them prevented. But not at the cost of Palestinian slavery.   \n2) You're ignoring the true function of The Fence - its protective role is secondary - its true role is to draw borders and make it much harder to dismantle the illegal settlements in the future. The UN cartographers have seen what's really going on, and once Israel is judged to be an apartheid state by the international court, hopefully some international sanctions will kick in. The sanctions won't be huge (since the servile US would never participate), but they might be enough to finally cause the Israeli populace to cross over to the light.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

New political organisations have formed specifically to challenge Arafat and his cronies on anti-corruption platforms. As for the Nobel Peace prize, Arafat was given the peace prize for saying that he would put an end to terrorist attacks and commit to a peaceful solution: but he has not actually done these things.   \n   \nI have nothing to say about Hamodia. As noted earlier in this discussion, there are fanatical extremists on both sides. What you quote from Hamodia to back up your comments about 'the profound Ethnoism and Religious Discrimination of the Jewish peoples' are not opinions held by any Jews who I know.   \n   \nThe Jews are peoples (several ethnicities, multiple cultures, numerous languages) with a religion, and they look after each other because they've noted, over the centuries, that very few other people want to look after them. And now they have a country to which any Jew can go and be free from persecution by non-Jews. That was the whole idea behind the UN creation of Israel back in 1948, remember? And if the Arabs had accepted the UN partition then, the Palestinians would have had their own state for the past 55 years -- one very much larger than anything they can seriously hope to gain now --, and Jews and Arabs could have spent half a century building mutual prosperity instead of killing each other. Instead, we have Hamas militants dedicated to turning all of Israel into an Islamist theocracy, a corrupt secular Palestinian Authority that is either unwilling or incapable of implementing what it promises at the negotiating table, a self-professed war criminal running Israel, Arab states that maintain their Palestinian brothers and sisters in misery to keep them as a thorn in Israel's side, and people spouting antisemitic hatred on the Internet to question the very basis for the existence of Israel. In all of this, only one thing is perfectly clear to me: the reasons for the existence of Israel are as valid today as they were when the concentration camps were liberated.\n\n"

On the contrary the most often repeated commandment in the Torah is to love the stranger - 'ger', the resident foreigner - for we were strangers in the land of Egypt.   \n   \nThe point is that that your first responsibility is to those near to you before those far away.

Gerald's quote from Hamodia includes the sentence 'The sacred book Zohar has taught us that Israel is linked to rationalism.' I believe many Jews would question the application of the adjective 'sacred' to the Zohar, except insofar as it is a book that concerns itself with sacred things. The Zohar is certainly not scriptural: it is a Kabbalistic text, and Kabbalism is a post-diaspora adjunct to Judaism, culturally and intellectually important but not central or even necessary to the Jewish religion. And of course, you shouldn't assume that Hamodia's interpretation of the Zohar in any way reflects mainstream Jewish thought.   \n   \nBy the way, Gerald, where did you find that quote? Perhaps it was at this [flagrantly antisemitic website](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018072726/http:/www.jewishtribalreview.org/thisweek.htm)?

I do not think, however, that blowing up busloads of children, or civilians standing in line at nightclubs, going to the market or in eating restaurants constitutes either defence or legitimate resistance. These are acts of aggression, and we should also pay attention to the stated aims of the people carrying out these attacks. Hamas, for instance, is dedicated to the destruction of Israel, not to an independent, parallel Palestinian state or to resistance in the occupied territories. When Palestinian militants shoot at IDF troops in Nablus, Jenin, etc., that too is tragic -- not least for the Palestinian civilians in the middle --, but it may be legitimately described as resisting the occupation. Going into Israeli cities and murdering civilians is something else. This is a classic case of two wrongs not even remotely making a right.   \n   \nYour mention of Gandhi has me thinking... Gandhi and his followers ended 200 years of British rule in India with _non-violent_ resistance.\\* After 55 years of alternating open warfare, guerilla warfare and terrorism, the Palestinians are in a worse situation than when they started. Maybe they should try non-violence for a change?   \n   \n   \n\\* Of course, Gandhi's campaign didn't result in _peace._ It resulted in partition, massive sectarian violence, the murder of hundreds of thousands of people on a scale that makes the West Bank and Gaza look pacific, the massacre of thousands in the Indian annexation of Hyderabad, half a century of intermittent wars between India and Pakistan, etc. But I suppose we can agree that his heart was in the right place.\n\n"

Racism is where you discriminate against an individual based on his ethnicity. This is bad because it's not fair to the individual. However, thinking -as I and many others do- that Jews as a whole -and in particular as their presence as the state of Israel, the Jewish State- are currently causing way too much misery in the world (not the same at all as saying that individual Jews are \"bad people\") is not racism at all - it's just a personal critical judgment borne of observation and a desire for fairness.

Your main fault John is that you're siding with the current oppressors (unwittingly or not) and you use all their rhetorical devices.

Many insists on showing how the Coran, for example, contents some horrible sentences about death and war. While you can virtually see the same things in all the others religious books. Because the other religions have succeed in considering the war and hate part of their books not to be valid now. Where as some like to consider Islam is a religion of hate, because some hateful persons bear the Coran to prove they act good by quoting sentences.   \nIt helps to say that though theses books can be considered to be holly by the ones who believe, litteraly approach is always wrong, that it suited to a different time, and now has to change.

Peace requires a solid political and territorial settlement that protects both parties and within which trust can develop, differences can be realistically resolved by negotiation, and mutual dependence and prosperity build a new relationship. The post-WWII peace between France and Germany is a good example of how to build a solid, lasting peace.   \n   \nIs this even remotely possible in the Middle East?

That really is a very powerful phrase, and it is the reason I do not (yet? hopefully never) accept the accusation of genocide against Israel. I am not convinced that the 'intent to destroy' is there, so while I am willing to acknowledge and condemn the very great crimes committed by the Israeli government, army and settlers against Palestinians, I don't think this term is appropriate. The sin of many members of the Israeli government is that they do not care about the Palestinians: they do not care whether they live or die and so hold their lives cheaply. This is a very bad thing. But genocide requires this 'intent to destroy': it is not lack of care, but an obsession. Apart from anything else, actual genocidal intent would seem to make any hope of peace or justice impossible. I really don't want to draw that conclusion.   \n   \nRegarding Sabra and Shatila, yes this is why I call Ariel Sharon a war criminal. He should be tried and punished for allowing the Phalangist militia into the camps to commit the massacre. But what happened at Sabra and Shatila was not Israeli government policy, was not sanctioned by the Israeli state, is not permitted by Israeli law, does not indicate systemic, institutional genocidal intent. It is worth noting that it was an Israeli commission that found Sharon responsible, and that forced him to resign as Defence Minister.

If you read the report of the [Kahan Commission](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018072726/http:/www.us-israel.org/jsource/History/kahan.html) on the massacres at Sabra and Shatila, I think you will get a good impression of that lack of care to which I referred above. Sharon allowed the massacres to happen because he did not care enough about the Palestinians in the camps to consider their safety in permitting the revenge-hungry Phalangists into the camps. As the commission wrote in its final report:   \n   \n_It is our view that responsibility is to be imputed to the Minister of Defense for having disregarded the danger of acts of vengeance and bloodshed by the Phalangists against the population of the refugee camps, and having failed to take this danger into account when he decided to have the Phalangists enter the camps. In addition, responsibility is to be imputed to the Minister of Defense for not ordering appropriate measures for preventing or reducing the danger of massacre as a condition for the Phalangists' entry into the camps. These blunders constitute the non-fulfillment of a duty with which the Defense Minister was charged._   \n   \nI certainly think the Phalangist militia had genocidal intent, and that as the competent controlling military force in West Beirut at the time, the Israelis had a responsibility to be aware of that intent and to prevent it from being acted on. Their failure does not imply that they shared that genocidal intent, only that they did not do their duty. The Kahan Commission, in insisting that 'indirect responsibility' be considered, makes the case based on the Jews' own experience as victims of massacres and atrocities:   \n   \n_The Jewish public's stand has always been that the responsibility for such deeds falls not only on those who rioted and committed the atrocities, but also on those who were responsible for safety and public order, who could have prevented the disturbances and did not fulfill their obligations in this respect._\n\n"
