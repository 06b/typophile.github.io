And possibly if his commision was to make something \\*arrestingly\\* ugly, then the customer definitely got his money’s worth. So maybe I’ll have to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOf course, I’d love a customer like that, because I’m pretty sure I could be cutting edge for ugly if I was getting paid.  \n: )\n\n"

The reason I don’t post all of my work is because I feel that if I’m going to be asking others’ opinions I should put some time into evaluating other work on the forum. Often, I just don’t have that time.\n\n\\> Which is sad.\n\n“Established” designers seek criticism, no? Just that it’s not on forums but through employees. I work on my own but show everything I do to a group of people whose opinion I value. That’s probably a reason many people don’t post on forums—one often doesn’t know the credibility of the audience. Now, this can sound like a good thing, but I’ve seen it just be annoying.\n\n"

Though the critique section has a lot more logo critiques than typeface critiques, so I was thinking about graphic designers.

I just spent a couple hours trying to make something truly ugly and discovered there must be a technique to it.
