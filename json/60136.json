  "content": "The most peculiar thing happened to me this past May.\n\nI was reading Brad Land's <cite>Goat: a memoir</cite>, an autobiographical entry about Mr. Land's experience with the Kappa Alpha fraternity at Clemson University. Interesting and engaging. Unique style of writing as well.\n\nBut what was the most interesting part of the book was when after I turned the final page, to my surprise I found a page that discussed and explained the choice of type! The choice was Sabon, and it was a tiny little paragraph explaining the type, as well the reason it was used. For the highly curious: I have the book. I can scan in the spread if you desire.\n\nCan anyone here fathom why this was done? I'd actually like to see it more often, as I found it interesting, and a great way to expose the layperson to type. But it's the first—and only time—I've seen such attention given to the choice of typeface.\n\n",

      "content": "Often the use of colophons in 20th-century American books is credited to book and type designer William Addison Dwiggins (WAD). Among large American publishers, the house of Alfred Knopf has most frequently included colophons in their books, with info about the type, the name of the book designer, and the name of the printing company.\n\nBut if you want to see some colophons, go to a library that has a good collection of American \"fine printing\" of the 60s, 70s, 80s. Colophons in these books often ramble on, telling who made the paper, who designed and cut and cast the type, who set the type, what press the book was printed on, when the press was made, what the weather was like, when the cat died. On and on. & I'm not joking about the cat; I cannot recall book or publisher, but the colophon told about the cat's passing. Some are like short stories. Some are pretentious as hell. Some have useful info.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nIn our era, when everyone has or \"knows about\" \"fonts,\" more people are taking notice at least of typeface mention in colophons.\n\nAt this press, we put colophons in most of our books. This helps our freelance designers get their names out into the world, and thus get more jobs. I can attest that happens. It also allows, us when appropriate, to note anything special about the paper we use.\n\nMany people think colophons are pretentious, glorifying matters no one cares about. I feel they help acknowledge good work.\n\npowers\n\n"
