It was later redigitized for the studio's own communications, then licensed to [FontShop International](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321085945/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop%20International) and exploded into one of the best selling and most used typefaces of the 1990s. It is still the best-selling font in the [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321085945/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) library.\n\nURL: [http://www.metadesign.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321085945/http:/www.metadesign.com/ \"http://www.metadesign.com/\")\n\n",
