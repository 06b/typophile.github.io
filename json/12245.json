He runs his type business via the [Micro Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/www.microfoundry.com/) website.\n\nRegarding some of his theories on latinization and the mixing of scripts, see his article in the fourth issue of [Spatium](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Spatium).\n\nPapazian teaches \"Introduction to Typeface Design\" at [Art Center College of Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Art%20Center%20College%20of%20Design) in Pasadena, California.\n\nHrant is by all measures the most prolific forum poster on matters regarding typography and type design (as well as sharing his thoughts on hosts of other topics) on the Internet.\n\nSee the [Daidala](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Daidala) [interview](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/www.daidala.com/25apr2004.html) or \"The Bouma Supremacy\" in [Typo Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typo%20Magazine).\n\nNot to be confused with [Shram H Paparazian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043124/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Shram%20H%20Paparazian).\n\n",
