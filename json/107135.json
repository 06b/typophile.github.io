Also note that ‘Afrikaan’ is correctly written as ‘Afrikaans’. Some of the round letterforms in the italic seem to tilt more than the others. ‘c’ looks all right, but ‘o’ tilts too kick I think.\n\n"

      "content": "Very nice. I remember using Quicksand for a big event years ago. The typeface was quite nice but the spacing was very bad. I think I just applied optical kerning to fix that. It's nice to see an update where the kerning has been fixed and a lot of features added. LU could be kerned tighter though. Same goes for HE in the non-unicase SWATCHES.\n\n"
