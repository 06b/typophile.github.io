  "content": "OK, we practically rebuilt our home a few years ago, and I still haven't got round to getting enough pictures and artwork on the walls for my wife's tastes!\n\nI got thinking today about producing a large scale work based upon a single glyph - either as a 2D print of some sort, or as a 3D object... It occured to me that with type having such a rich history that it would be hard to choose any particular glyph. Do I choose one based simply on it's form, or perhaps one based upon it's political history, or one that was simply part of an important event in the history of civilisation?\n\nI expect there are as many choices as there are reasons for making them.\n\nAlthough not my choice, consider the dollar sign? but in which typeface, and why?\n\nAny interesting ideas? It's really made me consider how poor is my knowledge of typographical history!\n\nSteve\n\n",
