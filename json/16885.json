There are two weights of Pericles Pro, Light and Regular, containing OpenType-enabled typographic features with alternative characters for creating eye-popping effects in headlines, book titles, banners, and greeting cards.\n\n“Pericles is a fun, yet versatile design”, said Steve Matteson, Ascender’s Type Director. “Users may pick and choose alternate letterforms to create graphic word-forms or simply use the normal characters depending on the effect they want to achieve. A little bit of playfulness goes a long way in creating unique, attention-getting messages”.\n\nPericles Pro is based on the work of Robert Foster who created the original for American Type Founders in 1934. Steve Matteson first saw Pericles in an old ATF specimen book with the description: ’combines the purity of the Greek with the virility of the modern’. The original included alternative designs for E, R and Q. Steve believed the design could be taken a great deal further by utilizing OpenType technology. In addition to the alternate letter designs, Pericles Pro also includes the accented characters necessary for setting languages supported by code pages Latin 1, 2 and 5.\n\nEach Pericles Pro font includes 433 glyphs. This includes 12 stylistic alternates and 17 ligatures to mix and match with a full set of capitals, small capitals, superscript, subscript and petite small capital letters. Pericles Pro was developed to take advantage of the rich typographic OpenType features of applications Adobe Creative Suite, as well as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and the forthcoming QuarkXPress 7. Each Pericles Pro font retails for $30.00 and is available for purchase and immediate download from the [http://www.ascenderfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813162838/http:/www.ascenderfonts.com/ \"http://www.ascenderfonts.com\") website.\n\nA PDF brochure of Pericles Pro can be viewed here: [http://www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/pericles.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813162838/http:/www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/pericles.pdf \"http://www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/pericles.pdf\")\n\n**About Ascender Corporation**  \nAscender Corporation is a leading provider of advanced font products specializing in font design, development and licensing.
