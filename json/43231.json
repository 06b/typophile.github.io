  "content": "I came across this site while googling for logos made up of certain typefaces. Needless to say, it was very helpful, searching through archived message boards. Thanks, Google and Typophile.\n\nI'm a first year student in the Visual Communications program at Chemeketa Community College in Oregon. This term I took Typography 1. Tomorrow is my final in the class. Everything that happened between registration and now is somewhat fuzzy...\n\nI've heard from many former students that Type 1 is the hardest class of the whole program. I don't know about the whole program, but it was the most intense class I've had yet. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not afraid of hard work, and I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I am one of the few students who really enjoyed the class. Going into the class I was unsure what it would even be about, let alone how there could be a whole class on just typefaces. Now I know better, and am glad there are more in-depth Typography classes further down the road in the program. I can now pretty accurately identify more fonts than I thought I could, or at least their classification. Most importantly, I got to design and actually print two big type book projects, consisting of only type, that I am actually proud of.\n\n",
