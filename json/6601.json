They should do some marketing anaylsis of current typeface pricing and make an adjustment to the realities of now. Maybe you can negotiate with them, like if you use there type in headlines in a publication they get a credit in the cofolon\n\n"

If you want one of the 'luxury' fonts or an alternative, I suggest e-mailing Christian Schwartz and asking him, and I expect you'll get a reasonable answer.\n\n"

Christian Schwartz does seem to have an impressive resume to back up actions that may seem eccentric. I suspect it will take an equally eccentric person to purchase such a font package and that even large corporations with the pocket change to do that have decision makers with more traditional views on spending.   \n   \nI'm curious to know if anyone has purchased it yet.   \n   \nAlso, I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find some resonably priced typefaces that are similar.\n\n"

I'd say that the pricing for licensing is just a tad out of reach of most clients. It's a great joke tho and even greater faces!\n\n"
