  "content": "For a very long time now I have been a great lover of magazines.\\* Upon   \nentering design school I obviously had new reasons (and excuses) to continue   \nwith this obsession, or if you like, fetish. Over the years since I have   \nwitnessed great magazines and/or great design, come and go with the tides.   \nRemember \\_Interview\\_ when Tibor Kalman was in charge? It was an amazing   \nexample of great magazine design. And what of \\_Rolling Stone\\_ before   \nPhotoshop and Illustrator made some things too easy? Or \\_Vogue\\_ during the   \nheight of Supermodeldom? Not to mention anything that Fabian Baron touched,   \nor so it seemed, in the nineties?   \n   \nPerhaps my references show my love of a more traditional time, but I really   \nhave many questions and I'll wager others would like to hear a serious   \ndiscussion about magazine design and typography. And perhaps while we're at   \nit we could list out favorites and least favorites. In view of the forum we   \nare on the list should include both creative director and the typefaces   \nused.\\*\\* This discussion, or my guilt, are born out of two recent redesigns   \nand one wish for involvement in a redesign.   \n   \nFirst, \\_Harper's Bazaar\\_. I love the magazine, I love Didot, but ... \\*\\*\\*   \n   \nSecond, \\_Fast Company\\_. I only just recv'd this issue in the mail today, but   \nTy' fa is gone The design IMO is still strong, the content not gotten weak.   \nI suppose when I saw the flag I was a little depressed. I like it, in an of   \nitself, but there are so many business magazines with sans serif screaming   \nfrom the top. I suppose I should hold judgement until I go the bookstore and   \nsee for myself.   \n   \nLast, what ever happened to \\_Vogue\\_?   \n   \nQUESTION: Do type foundries ever approach publication houses with the   \ndesire to change the look? Or is this considered arrogant? Is it any more   \narrogant than a design studio approaching them?   \n   \n\\*It is an addiction I picked up very early on in my life starting with my   \nstacks of \\_Seventeen\\_. \\*\\* Perhaps a pattern could be shown? \\*\\*\\* The word I   \nhave in mind is overkill.\n\n",

(doesn't hurt that Jude Law is on the cover. An amazing example of taking a face that perhaps is intended for body text and using it in a dynamic way for display purposes. Although it is a display version of the face. I also enjoy _Town & Country's_ use of Requiem. In general, this is a well thought out magazine.   \n   \nFor all of you helvetica nay-sayers. Does anyone remember Michael Koepke's work on _Creme_? He truly pushed that typeface into new directions.   \n   \n\\> Vince Frost   \n   \nThat's right. That magazine is so... refined, sterile, great judgment (pick a word).   \n   \n\\> try to utter the word BRODOVITCH to a bunch   \n\\> of snowboard-obsessed \"new media\" designers   \n   \n;) Right! Have you seen the Book? The book itself is a perfect addition to anyone's library. I've used it in publication design class to show great use of composition. Cipe Pineles is another example of great design BM (before macintosh). And you can't forget the work of Paul Rand either.   \n   \nDoes anyone remember _Details_ before it became a men's magazine? It was a who's who and what's what of Manhattan life. I coveted those. Why oh why did I throw them away? Does anyone know who designed those? Or what about _TAXI_? Sheesh my age is showing again. _Egg_ was pretty cool too. It had to have been one of the first magazines to try a square format. _Flaunt_ is really good for straight-forward (but with a wink) typography. Although I have a feeling it is more of a men's magazine. Hrant would like this one! ;) The latest issue is all about Italy, how timely for those of us going.   \n   \nAdmittedly I'm more old-school. But is this such a bad thing? Isn't design about discovery and re-discovery? Especially with type. I suppose the urge to design type comes from not wanting to use what is there already. But for magazine design this is not always feasible, therefore you find yourself on a road of discovery. Asking questions and looking for answers from what is there. But trying to take the answers and use them in new ways.   \n   \nMagazine design isn't so different from building a house. The structure's skeleton (grid) must be strong enough to hold the rest. If you have a wonky grid then everything else will never hold strong or make sense.\n\n"

Living in Milan, Italy, I have easy access to almost all American and European magazines. Being not only a magaholic, but a graphic designer also, I especially buy design publications, but also quite a few \"lifestyle\" magazines (and many more, not on a regular basis). After a few years of working mostly on web sites (I still work for the italian office of one of those very large - and very, very worried - web consultancy firms) I decided to get back to my first love, print, only this time I want to do things on my own terms.   \nSo, with the help of a journalist friend, I am currently working on my first magazine design project (a new title that we're starting from scratch and - hopefully - one day eventually publish, if we find the right financial backing). We plan to create a dummy issue and then show it around.   \nSo I will gladly participate in this discussion. I am currently asking myself so many magazine design questions working on this project, so I think it will be great to share my opinions with you guys!   \nMy flat has always been packed with old/new magazines, but as you can imagine, now that I am working on one, it's even worse.   \nSo, regarding your first posting: I also have fond memories for Baron, Woodward and Kalman at their creative peaks, and I rate their work like some of the best magazine design ever.It is still fresh today, which is NOT what could be said of a certain other magazine art director/surfer who once believed to be god and has currently been sucked in a black hole, apparently.   \nAre you guys aware of the work of Fernando Gutierrez, the spanish creative director behind Vanidad, Matador, Tentaciones and who is currently designing Colors Magazine? His work is fantastic, maybe you saw a great article about him on a not-so-recent issue of Eye Magazine? What do you guys think of him?   \nCiao a tutti, from Milan.\n\n"
