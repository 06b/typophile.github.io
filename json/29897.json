  "content": "Hello. I have a friend in Spain that started working for a new company there called Ip2-TV  \nwhich provides broadband services, telephone service and cable. She suggested I help them  \nby providing a visual / creative analysis of their branding and I thought perhaps posting the  \ncurrent logo here could be a good start. The work that is posted was created by their designer  \nin Spain, whose name I do not know.  \nA thorough honest critique would be much appreciated.  \nLinked are two versions of their logo.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018083449im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ip2-TV-Logo_6640.jpg)\n\nole\n\n",

      "content": "The orbital swoosh (I forget the technical term) is really out-of-date and cliche. The mouse on the end doesn't help either. I'm not sure I get the symbolism of the two interlocking TV screens - it would be clever if they spelled out the name of the company, but I can't see anything in them. What are they supposed to represent?\n\nOverall, the logo looks very \"Year 2000\".\n\n- Lex\n\n"
