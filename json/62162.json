Asturias might not be a perfect match, but I definately like it — so thanks for pointing me in its direction :)\n\nAndreas: I noticed that too! The way the letters connect seems unique; I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it in cursive writing/typography.\n\n...Anyway, in case you’re curious to see more of it, I scanned the other two instances of it being used in the magazine. It’s a shame if it indeed is a custom job; it seems to be a complete enough font, and it really is quite lovely.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091004032049im_/http:/typophile.com/files/airfont2_4915.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091004032049im_/http:/typophile.com/files/airfont3_5798.jpg)\n\n/Annette\n\n"
