  "content": "April 10, 2008, Bitstream Inc. released [Kloi BT](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014141714/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kloi-bt/?refby=alphabetdesign), a font designed by Oakville, Ontario-based Canadian designer Boris Mahovac R.G.D. of Alphabet-Design.com\n\nBoris Mahovac has adapted a friend's handwriting in this new font called Kloi (pronounced Chlo - ee). It has a very casual feel and includes _alternative swash glyphs_ of some key characters as well as some _extra ligatures_.\n\nTaking advantage of the ligature and contextual swash features in OpenType, the alternate glyphs automatically replace the standard glyphs when appropriate, creating a very unique look.\n\nKloi BT is Boris Mahovac's second font design released by Bitstream, after Tabita BT, another free-form display typeface was released in 2006.\n\nKloi BT is available in PostScript OpenType format. Kloi’s extended glyph set covers the Western and Central European, Baltic and Turkish languages.\n\n",
