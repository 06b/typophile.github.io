To my untrained eye it looks like a bespoke cut of Vag Rounded Light, but not sure. Feels a bit more elegant than Vag.\n\nAny ideas?  \nthanks,\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140509080804im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tate_3680.jpg)\n\n",

There are also, it seems, various people who have emulated the font itself, though in my opinion it needs some tweaking.  \nFor example: [http://fontzone.net/font-details/Tate-Regular/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140509080804/http:/fontzone.net/font-details/Tate-Regular/ \"http://fontzone.net/font-details/Tate-Regular/\")  \nthough in this one the lower case \"t\" needs to have its tail removed.\n\nI hope that's been a bit helpful!\n\n...and Marten Fischer should take his own advice next time and do a proper search.\n\n"
