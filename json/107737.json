  "content": "I'm trying to figure out what serif font Roots is using in their Holiday Gift Guide 2013 flyer. It seems like the typeface has some slight roughness/degradation but I'm not sure if this is because of the paper used. The uppercase 'P' also is similar to Palatino in that it does not touch. Can anyone figure this out or let me know which typeface might be close?\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n IM Fell English Roman \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [akira1975](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160506/http:/typophile.com/user/4504 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [roots-typeface.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160506/http:/typophile.com/files/roots-typeface.jpg) | 100.09 KB |\n| [roots-typeface-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160506/http:/typophile.com/files/roots-typeface-2.jpg) | 132.61 KB |\n\n",
