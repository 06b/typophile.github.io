Like we use a bold sans to contrast a regular serif face today.\n\nThe only form of contrast that Morris tolerated was between caps and U&lc -- had he addrressed typography earlier in his career, or lived longer, he might have developed a larger palette of typefaces and started to use them together.\n\n"

Although Morris wouldn't have thought much of the slab serifs you name, it's arguable that his Kelmscott Chaucer typeface is a slab serif. ITC Italia is a modern slab-serif which is a reasonably direct descendant from Morris' work, btw (being based on a rip-off of Morris overseen by a distant relative of mine).\n\nT\n\n"
