Over the years, he worked very closely with a number of lettering artists, calligraphers, [stone carvers](http://web.archive.org/web/20060526005819/http:/www.artnet.com/artwork/424497083/ian-hamilton-finlay-the-flageolets-surname--drum.html) and even [neon makers](http://web.archive.org/web/20060526005819/http:/www.artnet.com/artwork/424525270/ian-hamilton-finlay-je-vous-salue-marat.html) to realise his visions. At the ATypI conference in Copenhagen in 2002, Michael Harvey gave a delightful presentation showing the fruits of many years of collaboration with the often difficult and combatative Finlay.\n\n[NYT obituary](http://web.archive.org/web/20060526005819/http:/www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/arts/design/31finlay.htm)\n\nI’ll try to find some time over the next couple of days to upload a few images of Finlay’s work.\n\n",

It is a wonderful book and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone interested in lettering: almost every page includes photographs of the many carved inscriptions at Little Sparta. The only criticism I have is that the book does not identify the individual lettering artists who collaborated with Finlay on particular projects, although it is kind of fun to try to guess from the lettering style. I think I spotted a few Michael Harvey pieces I had not seen before.\n\n"
