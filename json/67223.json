  "content": "_Hello Respected Typohiles._\n\nRecently i tried to do an experiment of using too many typefaces in one single composition & try to make them sync together & create an interest.  \nI don't know did it really worked on not, but when i shared the composition with people i got a very two-sided response. Some viewers loved it in first go & agreed that this works perfectly & on the other side some viewers just totally discarded it & said its too confusing & bizarre for their eyes.\n\nWhat do you all think ?  \n_Critisim,feedback is much appreciated.Thanks!_\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [typo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013104021/http:/typophile.com/files/typo_12.jpg) | 20.3 KB |\n\n",
