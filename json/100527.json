  "content": "I have been loving the Benedictine face since I first saw it a few months ago on pages 30-31 of McGrew's _American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century_. I searched once and again for information about it on the Internet, and, apart from a couple of sample images, I could only find (naturally) an old but quite revealing [post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48585) on Typophile, and, of course, that wonderful manual on typography by Mergenthaler Linotype from 1923.\n\nGiven that no one seems to have carried the remarkable beauty of the Benedictine family (an apparently forgotten gem) into the modern OpenType world, I decided to do it myself ...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro1_4032.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro2_5260.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro3_3479.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro4_6067.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro5_5293.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro6_4267.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictinePro7_5283.png)\n\nThe Book weight (including small caps and italics) is almost finished, with Regular and Bold following (hopefully) shortly.

Answers to questions posted in this and other threads are as follows:\n\n1. \"Wordspace may be too big\" - I would be very grateful if you could confirm this by having a look at this sample.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145009im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BenedictineBook_3727.png)\n  \n2. \"Small caps look relatively too large\" - I tried several metrics starting from the original sources, out of which I only retained those for the Book weight. Most of the glyphs (including the small caps) in the Regular and Bold weights were derived mainly from the Book weight. Among other things, the original x-heights of the Regular and Bold seemed too small to me when compared between them and to the x-height of the Book.\n\n3. \"I assume the Italics are not uniwidth with the Romans, but are they uniwidth among themselves?\" - Yes, they will be. I will also try to make them uniwidth with the Romans. That would be nice, I believe. However, it is not possible to achieve that effect with the original sources (on which the current version of the Book Italics is based).\n\nThanks.\n\n"

      "content": "To me the 100% tracking looks good, when small caps are set separately as on your picture. But you should consider that the spacing of small caps also depends on the spacing of upper and lower case letters because they are often used in a context. For example small caps can be used among lower case text to attract attention to a certain word or paragraph (as means of selection) and here the more loosely spaced small caps (comparing to lowercase) will help the word to be distinguished. Also small caps can play the role of lowercase in mixed setting, when the word set in small caps starts with an uppercase letter and here the spacing of small caps should be identical to uppercase, because they stand together in the same word. Also small caps can be used among the uppercase text (for example in a book title) and it is a common practice to use some tracking in uppercase setting (which can be programmed in a font with the “cpsp” feature) so if you make such feature you should consider this too when deciding on the spacing of small caps (for the harmony between small caps and tracked uppercase). So there can be different situations and you can leave the spacing of your small caps as it is and let a designer who'll use your font to decide on tracking or try yourself find the spacing of small caps which will suit most of situations.\n\n"
