As on-screen work often lacks the finer nuances and detail of real printed work I am sure a lot of us would rather have the real thing (after all we can't bring our work stations with us to the bathroom) I realize that there is obviously issues of trust involved as well as the financial burden of mailing samples (especially to foreign countries) but I for one would like to share. I would in exchange expect the same of other.\n\n",
