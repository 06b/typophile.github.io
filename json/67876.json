Clearly these substitutions don't belong in either of these features, but they are the only features I am aware of that most OT-savvy applications call obligatorily. Is there another, more appropriate feature to use? (it would be nice if the OT spec defined some feature which was always active but which had no prescribed function)\n\nAndr√©\n\n",
