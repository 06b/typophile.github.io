(Franklin Gothic Demi? I don't think it must be Franklin Gothic Condensed, as the detail of the dots on the \"�\", \"�\", \"�\" and \"�\", these are circular, (unlike those on the \"i\" and the \"j\" which are square), and not square, as in Franklin Gothic Condensed... Also, looking particularly at the \"g\", it must either not be Franklin Gothic Demi Condensed, as the upper hole in the \"g\" is circular, and not oval, as in Franklin Gothic Demi Condensed...) Only the numbers indeed put me in doubt... I mean, unless, contrary to my first thought, the numbers and the letters aren't of the same font?   \n   \nYet, that third line, where it reads \"4 tysta mil\", that \"4\" there does bring up doubt again...   \n   \nAs does this other line:   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123949im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27810.gif)   \n   \nWell, it is at least odd that a font has been chosen for the letters, and an other for the numbers, if that is to be the case, no?   \n   \nOnce again, I thank you, for all help.   \n   \nP.S. Sorry that I started a new post for including each of the images but I don't know whether it is possible/allowed to include (upload) more than one image per post? :P\n\n"
