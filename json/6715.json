  "content": "I need to make a typographic statement for this neophilic question: \"Is Scarlett (Johansson) the new Marilyn Monroe?\". I am trying to capture some of the speculation how people are hailing this actress the new Marilyn, especially as she bares more than a passing resemblance to her: the hair, full lips, curvy figure, glamour beyond her 19 years. When she wore a white satin dress to the Bafta awards, she was on the cover of many newspapers who put their pictures next to each other and made comparisons.   \nThis is not for commercial use, I am a student and would appreciate any advice on how to convey this using pure typography and/or images. I am just finding it difficult to start, and even though these designs wont be sold, I also feel wary about using existing photos of Marilyn (copyrights etc). The design will be screenprinted onto a large tea towel so any imagery I would use of Scarlett/Marilyn I would want to be 2 colours max, but iconic enough - her lips or a Warhol type print of her face/ use of silhouettes. I have been looking at her movie posters but don't merely want to rip one off. I do want to include some of that vintage Hollywood glamour, but also the question of whether Scarlett is the our answer to Marilyn for 2004?!   \nThere is the idea of clones and today's stars styling themselves as the older Hollywood legends - to increase their status perhaps?   \n   \nI could also do the statement \"Puppies are the new babies\" - using type or image. I am referring to the trend of mainly celebrities using puppies as the latest A-list accessory, think Paris Hilton, Legally Blonde. I would appreciate any thoughts or advice that might help, as it would be interesting to see how typographers would approach this brief. ..\n\n",

I saw her in the new ad campaign for Eternity Moment this weekend and had to have more so i went and rented The Girl with the Pearl Earring. (i guess she did look very marilyn in that ad!) I did like the type in the Eternity commericals. It seemed to be a very tall, skinny version of Optima??? If you like kitschy [Ribbon](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825223220/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ribbon-131/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Marilyn+Monroe) also called [Coronet](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825223220/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ribbon-131/morelikethis.html) came to mind when i was thinking of how to capture Marilyn Monroe.   \nAnyhow here's a bit of imagry (with type included) for ya...   \n   \n ![Marilynesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825223220im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/49362.jpg)\\</font\\>\n\n"

If you want a positive ID try the wizards at the type ID board. I am guessing because it is a logo they have taken some version of Britannic or Radiant and modified it.   \n   \nOptima, which I think is great, adds subtle flairs to the Britannica/Radiant precursors.\n\n"

Marilyn Monroe would usually look right at the camera, trying to seduce every man and boy on the other side, and succeeding. Scarlett, if that is her name, is not innocent looking, but compared to Marilyn, she is.\n\n"

I love those ads, I wish I could download it somewhere!   \n   \nThe design will be screen printed onto a tea towel (cotton) so do you think the fonts recommended will look eye catching enough, or should I buy a bolder font? Just asking before I go buying fonts blindly :D I bought \"Murray Hill\" though.   \n   \nIt is interesting reading your opinions - most people don't think she is \"the new Marilyn\" as such - well she is impossible to replace. I might design it as \"IS she the new Marilyn?\" rather than saying \"SHE IS!!!\" haha. At the moment I am not sure what to write without making it so obvious, you know?   \n   \nThanks for your help.\n\n"

Personally I think that Scarlett does not have the same look as Marilyn, less overt ( [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/12/17/images/scarlett\\_johansson\\_top.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825223220/http:/www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/12/17/images/scarlett_johansson_top.jpg)). Just because she is blonde, an actress and is the same gender, journos find it easy to pigeonhole her. So perhaps your answer to the question should be a resounding �No�. As for a typeface to represent Marilyn I would go for something like this [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/stilla/?PREFS\\_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&PREFS\\_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Marilyn+Scarlett](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825223220/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/stilla/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Marilyn+Scarlett)   \nTim\n\n"
