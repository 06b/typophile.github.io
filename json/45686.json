Is it right for relief agencies to compete with for-profit industry?\n\nI find this all a very sticky wicket, however, because of the good the American Red Cross does. Living in Katrina-land, and, counting down to a new hurricane season, I am reminded that the Red Cross is the ONLY American agency who, time and again, is called upon and does respond for disaster relief.\n\nSo, my question is, who is the grabby one? J&J for registering a universal symbol for commercial profit in the first place or the American Red Cross for overstepping past bounds?\n\nIt is my personal experience that in business, as with life, best practices need always to be evaluated periodically. Which is why I find this issue so interesting.\n\n"

I’ve made modest donations to the Red Cross myself, because I too believe that they actually do something in times of natural and man-made disasters.\n\nBut even non-profits have to find ways to raise money so that they can continue to exist and do good, and that’s where the sticky issues come up, I think. (I have mixed feelings about non-profits using for-profit methods, but that’s just me.)\n\nSlightly related: I remember that a few years ago, the band Red Kross had to change the way they spell their name due to a conflict with the Red Cross... I think the band The Postal Service had similar issues with the United States Postal Service.\n\nBut back to your original post. [This New York Times article](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110352/http:/www.nytimes.com/2007/08/09/business/09cross.html?em) gives dates for when the American Red Cross and Johnson and Johnson each started using the symbol.\n\nYou can read a history of the use of the red cross and red crescent symbols [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110352/http:/www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/emblem-history).\n\n"

I like the history of the cross and crescents.\n\nI believe that the Red Cross has had a lot of management difficulties recently, something like two or three presidents having to resign within a year. I know that that is not an assignment I would be interested in fulfilling, balancing budgets trying to do the right thing in the face of enormous challenge.\n\nBesides, I wouldn’t consider a major corporation any expert in moral leadership. So, I think what they did to try to make money in the same manner as companies who now appear to be competition, is okay.\n\nBut, that’s my opinion.\n\n"

I am not at all sure that it was a good business decision to shrink wrap and hand process a piece of junk mail that got mangled in their system. Well, at least the rates went up.\n\n"

I learned more I taught, well sort of.\n\nAnyway, please establish an account, you can use an alias. MySpace is the industry network for the entertainment industry, and, if you have been keeping up with the magazine, JUXTAPOS, art/design/(type) converge these days. Which is why I am using Typophile, Wordpress, UTube, the Loyola University New Orleans Blackboard platforms to structure and teach an experimental, online studio design course this summer.\n\nMySpace is pretty obnoxious but it is the industry standard for the music industry. So, although it was a real reach for me to make an account, I have. And now use it to teach from. (In the online course each student is required to post an item to their ’sketchbook’ once a day, five days a week by five p.m. for the duration–eight weeks.)\n\nI hope that you will logon.\n\n"
