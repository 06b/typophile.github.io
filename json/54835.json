I have been effectively blogging my font design projects in Typophile's Critique forum. Here are links to the ones I can remember, in no particular order:\n\n- [Effluent](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/51416)\n- [Palormak](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/28416)\n- [Agamemnon](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/41105)\n- [Cartmeign](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/28380)\n- [Rutaban](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/34370)\n- [CaliGrot](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/51081)\n- [Gohan](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/34899)\n- [Triangulor](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/28175)\n- [Gohan Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/39907)\n- [Posterony](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/39145)\n- [Antherton Cloister](http://web.archive.org/web/20130622071516/http:/typophile.com/node/28191)\n\nAnyway, here I am! I'll post here about my design work from time to time.\n\n",
