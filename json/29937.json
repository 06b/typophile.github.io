I recently finished version 1 of my website: [www.michaelkostal.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070125220921/http:/www.michaelkostal.com/) and was wondering and welcoming thoughts.\n\nThanks for looking!\n\nMike\n\n",

      "content": "Definitely agree with the last post. That problem could be solved by putting it at the top.\n\nI like your MK monogram a lot but don’t think it connects all that well with the font for your name (Helvetica?) on the site. Given what I’ve seen you can do, I think you could have more fun with your name - it’s the least interesting part of the site. Also the navigation at the top - have you tried a more interesting html font for that?\n\nWill you expand to the right or down as you add more work or will you keep it a small number to fit in your design?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the positive feedback everyone.\n\nI’m actually using thickbox for the portfolio bit, I liked lightbox but thickbox is a bit quicker and the next/prev buttons are always there (as opposed to lightbox which has hidden buttons that appear on mouseover). I’ll see if I can get them into a fixed position (moving it to the top is a good suggestion).\n\nMy name is set in AG Old Face - Shaded. I thought it worked well with the site but maybe I should reconsider if it’s considered too plain. Though I don’t necessarily want to use a real attention getting/loud font.\n\nPatty, when I get enough work I plan to categorize it into small galleries… but for the time being one page is better. Another way is keep the same format but when there’s more have a link to a next page.\n\nAlso, I have not tried any other fonts for the navigation— what do you mean by more interesting? Given the limited choices that is… would you say something like Verdana is more interesting? I’m not sure.\n\n"

      "content": "I meant perhaps either a simple sans like Verdana or a more modern looking pixel font like the one you use at the bottom.\n\nI don’t think moving it onto a ‘next’ page is so great - I prefer the idea of organizing it into galleries.\n\n"
