I have looked at [all of these grotesque sans serifs](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110211/http:/typophile.com/node/18671) but it seems that none of them are close. Are there other typefaces which are based on Stephenson Blake that are very similar to Maple?\n\n [‹ ID possible ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110211/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47003 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The font from \"The Kingdom\" movie title sequence ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110211/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46980 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
