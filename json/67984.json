  "content": "Hi all\n\nI'm looking for the identity of a font that was used for maintenance markings on German aircraft during WW2. I've tried seeing if the font is any of the DIN (Deutsche Industrie Norm, [German Industrial Standard]) set of typefaces but to no avail. I also checked it against the original Futura although very close it appears to be in between a condensed and a regular version of the typeface. Could it be a custom typeface designed for the Messerschmitt factory? My knowledge of Typography is slightly limited and I was wondering if any of you guys could assist? I've posted below some samples of the typeface taken from original factory documents.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\nWarm Regards\n\nClint Mitchell\n\n",

Apparently they completely digitized the typeface from the original sources of the Bauersche Giesserei, now held by FT Bauer in Barcelona. I had my suspicions that it was Futura but it is slightly wider than the condensed version but not as wide as the regular. Is there an inbetween version?\n\nThanks Again.\n\nClint\n\n"
