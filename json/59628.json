Generally we record conversations and interviews with type and graphic designers (previously on the show we've had Mark Simonson, John Boardley, Stephen Coles, Armin Vit, Aaron Draplin, Nick Sherman, Jason Santa Maria, and more), but we want to try a show of short \"design thoughts.\"\n\nIf you've got something to share, there are a few ways you can get us your audio clip:  \n1) You can call us and leave a messsage: 646-402-5686 extension 20248  \n2) You can record it on your computer with Garageband, Audacity, some audio program and email it to [readbetweentheleading@gmail.com](mailto:readbetweentheleading@gmail.com)  \n3) If you've got an iPhone, you can record a voice memo and email the memo to [readbetweentheleading@gmail.com](mailto:readbetweentheleading@gmail.com)\n\nIf you've got anything type or design related you'd like to get off your chest, please get it to us, we'd love to hear it. If you have absolutely no way to record audio, email us some text and we can probably find a way to slip it in at the end of the show.\n\nThanks so much in advance. I know Typophile is filled with talented designers, so I'd love to hear what everyone has to say.\n\n",
