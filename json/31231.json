There are many many ways of going from where you are but I think it's a fine start. I would try all this in pencil quickly rather than mucking about on screen.

Because you've taken it from another pair of letters, you need to make the joins look smoother and more natural, if you will, to the letters you are using. I second Eben's comments, adding that the way the curve joins the s looks especially unnatural (to me, that is).\n\n"

The word I'm working with is 'Acushla' (pronounced A-koosh-la), and my line of thought is that the sh ligature is a good way to finish off the second syllable 'koosh' and draws attention to the pleasant sounding 'sh'.\n\nI've tried a few more options (below) (number 1 is the same as the previous post, allowing you to see how it's developed) which gradually seem to gain more of a higher, rounder loop, ending in number 5 where I've slightly altered the end of the 's' by curving that sharp corner (don't know if typographiclly speaking, that's an acceptable thing to do?)\n\nLet me know your thoughts :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214062904im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sh_options_4249.jpg)\n\n"
