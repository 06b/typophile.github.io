  "content": "I'm struggling to find a font from the Futurism movement. Does anyone know any common typefaces from the 20th century that were used in futuristic works? (1909-1920s).\n\nAlso, I read somewhere that Studley is a font that was used. Does anyone know where I can download this, or if it is even available digitally?\n\nI greatly appreciate any help you can give me.\n\n",

(Il Futurismo is of course, but is more of a display type, rather than a body text type.)\n\nAlso, Futura is more of a Bauhaus and Constructivism typeface.\n\n"

      "content": "I don't think there really is a typical futurist (body) typeface. From what I've seen (so far) they used typefaces that were at hand (like Bauhaus or Art Deco or plain) and played with composition.\n\nBut I'm not an expert on the matter. I didn't mean to state things you already know, I was just intriged by your question. It's an interesting movement.\n\nHave you seen this book already?:  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/ad\\_symphoniam/2399701501/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322042441/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ad_symphoniam/2399701501/)\n\nIf you don't purchase it, I might ;-)\n\n"

I was hoping someone else could tell me different, but it seems everyone I ask comes to the same conclusion.\n\nThat book has come up in my searches, but I am unable to purchase anything at this time.\n\nThanks very much for your help.\n\n"
