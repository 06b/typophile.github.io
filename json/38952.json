  "content": "When I have a series of paragraphs beginning with bullets and a blank line in between them, I run into a typesetting problem. I cannot separate them with a non-breaking space, because that causes the last line of each paragraph to stretch across the page. So I have two options: set the paragraphs with an extra line’s worth of spacing after them, which is fine for me, but is going to cause problems if someone who doesn’t know too much about Indesign gets the file and can’t figure out what’s going on. The other option is to just leave the spaces and apply the bullet style to each paragraph individually, but that’s tedious. Is there a third way that beats either of my two?\n\n [‹ Caps to small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203115003/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38910 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Generate Stylistc Sets ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203115003/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38949 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

For an experienced users, having most of the design relegated to styles can be a godsend, both for time and spec’s sake. But for Johnny Wordperfect, even soft returns (which clean files often dispense with in favor of space after, wrap-around, indent-to-here, etc.) can be a source of confusion.\n\nIf that isn’t that huge a concern, though, Ricardo’s approach is certainly the best.\n\n"
