  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nI was wondering if anyone could point me to any directions of stable type proportions? I have been printing out typefaces and tracing them and even trying to 'measure' different parts of a face to try and understand the consistency of proportions of different faces but I don't really 'see' it. Does this make sense? Or am I just diseased with the 'rationalize everything' virus?\n\n",
