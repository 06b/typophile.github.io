Does anyone know any web resources for help, esp. in regard to CSS, layers etc?  \nthanks\n\nNick\n\n [‹ Mactype1 working also on PC](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112063433/http:/typophile.com/node/29880 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Kerning information lost when generating font file ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112063433/http:/typophile.com/node/29803 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You might just want to start with DW.\n\nSecondly, the best way to learn any of the programs is to start learnign HTML and CSS. Once you grasp the concepts of those, using the actual web editor becomes trivial. So, that said, don’t bother picking up any books regarding DW or GL themselves. If you want a book, pick up one on HTML/CSS. If you are a complete novice, [www.w3schools.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112063433/http:/www.w3schools.com/ \"www.w3schools.com\") is a good place to start.\n\n"

I know Dreamweaver and (very) rudimentary HTML and CSS and I realise switching to Dreamweaver/educating myself are better options but time is an issue and I don’t have Dreamweaver, and as it’s such a small quick job, I can’t see the point in my boss investing in a license unless it’s clear that more web work will be forthcoming (that said, wouldn’t it be nice to have it as an option?)—\\> so Golive.  \nI will try these list of links, thanks again for all your time and trouble I appreciate help on a dull topic  \ncheers\n\n—N\n\n"
