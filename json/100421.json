Lanston's does, but it lacks small caps and old style figures.\n\nThanks in advance for the guidance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821084046im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ital_4056.jpg)\n\n",

Plus the recreation of old faces for phototype usually was a bit sloppy, due to enormous time limits.\n\n"
