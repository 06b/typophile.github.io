Can anyone tell me please the name of the font, used for the title?  \nMonday evening i visited a lecture of the japanese designer Kenya Hara, and afterwords i bought his book, with the titel: Designing Design. By the way, it is written in english and it's worth to read. It's the first publication of his work in english language. At amazon.com it's much more cheaper than here in Europe.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011094734im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ke00_6652.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011094734im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ke02_5105.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011094734im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ke03_6347.JPG)\n\n",
