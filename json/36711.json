This image was taken from the _Suitcase Type Foundry Open Type Collection Catalogue_ designed by Tomáš Brousil. Unfortunately, [Suitcase](http://web.archive.org/web/20090830043419/http:/www.suitcasetype.com/ \"Suitcase Type Foundry\") doesn’t seem to offer the script on their website—at least not currently. If it helps, I found the image [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090830043419/http:/www.typosemestr.cz/suitcase-type-foundry-open-type-collection-catalogue).\n\nThanks in advance,  \nKen\n\n",

Thanks to OpenType features, a variety of ligatures and alternative glyphs allow the user to create more authentic and varied connections between letters. Used thoughtfully, BistroScript is guaranteed to enhance any print job.”_\n\nI know, I helped Tomas with the English text for his catalogue. This is from my version of the text document that’s still on my hard drive. ;^)\n\n"
