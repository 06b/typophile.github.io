Different from anything I have has designed in the past. Allumi PTF is a sleek typeface designed with technology in mind.  \n It’s a perfect font family for any communication concerning design, robotics, or functionality. Pushed to its extreme limits, the Allumi PTF shapes are neither perfectly round or geometrically square. It’s a human design with a high tech touch. Allumi PTF can be described as the Eurostyle (designed by Aldo Novarese in 1962) of the new century, mixed with Frutiger. Allumi is a serious typeface because of the unique design and sturdy form. The pure shapes can create a global presence today with an eye on the world of tomorrow.  \n Each series features a full glyph set which covers most latin languages and includes all aspects of typographic needs such small caps, various set of figures & so on. In addition, with the use of some alternate glyphs, the overall aspect of text setting can change. Last but not least, more than 70 dingbats are included and adapted for the 9 series.\n\n_Jean François Porchez_\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Allumi_brand_4103.gif)\n\n[Allumi PTF Extended minisite](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539/http:/allumi.typofonderie.com/)  \n [Allumi PTF Extended page](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/AllumiPTFExtended)  \n [Allumi PTF Extended test it page](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/try/AllumiPTFExtended)  \n [Allumi PTF Extended prices and purchase](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/order/AllumiPTFExtended) Font family from €210 for 8 cpus use.  \n [Allumi PTF Extended pdf specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539/http:/www.typofonderie.com/icono/alphabets/pdf/AllumiPTF_pdf.pdf)  \n [Allumi PTF wallpaper](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539/http:/www.typofonderie.com/wallpaper#last)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015124539im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Allumi_samples_5462.gif)\n\nAbout Porchez Typofonderie  \nFounded in 1994, Porchez Typofonderie is an independent digital type foundry in France, designing, manufacturing and selling high quality typefaces for adventurous digital typographers.\n\n",

      "content": "I have to admit that I have a strange, immediate attraction to this family. Obviously this was considered in the process (at least to an extent, with the reference of Eurostyle), but the high-tech vibe I pick up on is really that of a technology of the past — an industrial, tactile tech more than a digital, bleep-bleep tech. But nonetheless it seems to work in this age too, and because of that fusion I love it. Can’t wait to see it in action!\n\n"
