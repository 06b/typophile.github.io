Sorry this is negative but the name change has torpedoed the (in my opinion) stronger concepts.\n\n\\>it’s a popular number in the UK since they’ve won their only football worldcup in 1966  \nActually it is England’s (not UK’s) only World Cup, and it seems a pretty tenuous link to me, even being a football fan for most of my life and reminded every four years that it is the only World Cup we have won I wouldn’t draw that connection.

I’ve created a new concept which fits pretty good imo.. you’ve got a strong bold font, a dynamic colour and the connection to table with the table top wich also emphasizes the skill aspect because you have to stay sharp and move on (with your skills) in order to win a lot of money.. what do you guys think?\n\ncheers mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108175043im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/table66_5840.jpg)\n\n"

I think you need to look more at the interaction of cue (green flash) and text, especially at the counters of the a & b and in the small size where the l becomes i, you might also want to look at increasing the weight of the numerals. The slogan could be a touch wider (larger) just to bring it to visual justification on table.  \nTim\n\n"

Granted, it would be best to come up with some sort of symbol that would, to everyone, immediately say ’all skill games’, but im not sure something like that exists. Something subtle like having the 66 on a pool ball (maybe without the cue in there) would at least have people looking at it and thinking pool and things like that. Once they saw the site they would know that there was so much more of course, but with the logo you want to have something that will draw people in. I think pool is a pretty universal skill game, so it would work well. I think darts might work well in that respect too.\n\nEven if in the end you dont end up emphasizing it so much, looking at particular games will give you a good jumping off point.\n\n"

That’s because I think a) looks best of all the options (and also because the b and l form the ’gate’ you lie your queue on when playing pool), just that it creates the problem with the t - it seems to be standing out (towards the viewer) too much to still form a nice connected word. If you’d make the upper stroke of the t extend, it could fix that?!\n\nAlso, i think you should definately put in the extra ’end-stroke’ for the queue like in the previous b) - it creates the nice image of someone really holding the queue.\n\ntake this with a grain of salt though, I’d still consider myself a noob ;)\n\n"
