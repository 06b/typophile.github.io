However, judging by revivals, the variations on Garamond seem to be the most numerous. Other names that have become classics or standards that are still used widely: Jenson, Griffo (Bembo), Caslon, Baskerville, Didot, Bodoni.\n\n"

Well, their pricing is quite high and thus their fonts sometimes seem to be unattainable; but ‘expensive’ is not the same as ‘luxurious’, is it?\n\nGo to a Dutch bookstore and sift through a couple of books (or news papers!) … do you really think all of them that are set in Lexicon or Haarlemmer convey a touch of luxury?\n\nIf you meant purchasing the TEFF library and then not using it (“only to look at”), then I have to agree; that would be very luxurious!\n\n"
