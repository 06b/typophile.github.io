Not because it doesn’t seem fun but when I look online I see that they get paid very poorly that may or may not be true but, I was wondering what I should I move towards.\n\nhere is my gallery (portfolio is under construction right now)  \n [http://izacchemical.deviantart.com/gallery/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122113738/http:/izacchemical.deviantart.com/gallery/ \"http://izacchemical.deviantart.com/gallery/\")\n\nI do those painting for fun and for friends I don’t really plan to take those much farther so i am shooting towards my photoshop and illustrator capabilities please tell me your input on this situation.\n\nThanks to all who reply.\n\n [‹ Catch or Skip](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122113738/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48764 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Old labels typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122113738/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48741 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m a freelancer and there is tons of potential in my city, although I’m not where I want to be financially, I’m still pretty new at the game.\n\nGraphic Design may not be as ’fun’ as being a fine-artist, or an illustrator, but it definitely pays the bills better in most cases.\n\nOverall, theres tons of opportunities in different graphic fields (animation, branding, website design, publication design). Do some more research. Your portfolio is nice.\n\nOh and punctuation is your friend in message boards, especially this one.\n\n"

He pointed out that if I look at the parking lot, the fine art faculty were driving beat up vans from the 1970s and 80s, and the design faculty were driving new Volkswagons, Beemers, and even Porsches. The starting salaries in design do suck, but so do plenty of other jobs, but at least as a designer you get paid to do creative work and not schlep coffee and bagels all day so you can go home and do illustration work on your kitchen table all night.\n\n"

Styles and attitudes change, and you’ll never know what happens. I started as an abstract painter, switched to digital media design, and finally ended up falling in love with print and type design.\n\nThe important thing to do is choose a school where you can experiment with everything and where the fine art and design departments overlap. Take a look at the work of seniors and recent grads—if it looks like most of the work was done entirely with a computer, that means you be stuck doing most of your work on the computer, and trust me, you’ll miss out on a lot. And think about big schools so that you don’t miss out on important classes because of scheduling conflicts or course cancellations due to low enrollment.\n\n"

It’s definitely a good avenue to travel. I find it extremely fulfilling.\n\nMake sure to take some business or marketing classes on top of your design classes though, those will be extremely beneficial.\n\n"

      "content": "How much money you make typically depends on what you’re designing. If you design album covers and concert posters, you’re most likely going to make a fraction of what someone designing annual reports for the medical industry is making. Of course, most people would find the former more fun than the latter. Where I live, designers right out of school would make somewhere between 30K and 45K a year, with most people somewhere in the middle. If you need more money than that, going down the motion graphic and/or interactive path might be what you want to do — a lot of people bill $60-100/hr after a few years in these industries. If you live in rural Mississippi, those numbers would be much lower, though.\n\nThe most important thing, though, is to not listen to “experts” too much, whether they’re random people on the internet or teachers at your school. I had a million people tell me “you have to get into web,” or “you should do more illustration,” etc. while I was in school, and I took them very seriously for a long time. If you love doing something, you can figure out a way to make money with it.\n\n"

It looks like you have some real talent for that, and the work in your gallery is closer to what an illustrator would do than a graphic designer.\n\nI’m not discouraging you from studying graphic design, I’m sure you would do well in either profession. Your best bet would probably be to take introductory courses in several disciplines and see what you like best.\n\n"
