But it's not the same, because it's bolder then \"Incis\".\n\nSombody can help me? what could be the real name of the type (Incis)?  \nattached is an image\n\nIs IncisSlab East exist? or... is a fake Antique Olive?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [incis.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120118201711/http:/typophile.com/files/incis.jpg) | 172.58 KB |\n\n",

The [URW version of Antique Olive](http://web.archive.org/web/20120118201711/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antique-olive/) has quite a few weights, including a Light.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Bitstream was the company that originally digitized many older typefaces for foundries that at that time did not have the capability. Apparently one of the terms of their agreement with these foundries was that they could retain and market the design if they renamed it. Incised 901 is their name for Antique Olive. Tilde has apparently gotten into an arrangement with Bitstream where Tilde produces versions of these for extended language support (Florian explained this recently, I believe). URW, with their Ikarus system, was also one of the early digitizers, and by similar arrangement with other foundries they also marketed font designs by new names. For example, URW Palladio, and Paltus Antiqua were both names for URW versions of Palatino. Neither of these companies are stealing fonts, if that was your thought.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
