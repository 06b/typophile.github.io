  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am currently trying to finish a wine label but the client insists on this script font Vivante DTC which I frankly don't like at all. I need your advice. Could You please suggest a nice script font or a serif font with nice italics which goes well with the illustration? Thank you very much for your suggestions.\n\n\\* This is a screenshot with the front and the back label\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417090852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-03-25%20at%2020_5329.41.35.png)\n\n",
