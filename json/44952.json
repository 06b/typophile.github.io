  "content": "I’ve been searching around trying to find film or television shows that use blackletter in their title but can’t seem to find or think of any that do! The only one I have right now is There Will Be Blood. There must be at least one other that uses blackletter, it can’t be /that/ difficult, can it? Anyway, would really appreciate some other examples.\n\n [‹ Know any good legibility tests for typefaces?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905131528/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41365 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Please help me identify this font or find something similar ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905131528/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44962 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
