I notice that the SuperBowl logo has disappeared, while the helmet remains, which says to me that Mr Daniels is a true fan of his beloved team, and I applaud that. He doesn’t need the Seahawks to be the Galactic Champions for him to love them. (As a Montrealer, and once fan of the Expos, I know all about sports-based disappointment.)\n\n"

That would be the logical approach if all the letterforms had uniform widths, but that’s not the case. For example, the **I** doesn’t occupy the same width as the **O**. So the **M** in a **MI** ligature must be different from the **M** in a **MO** ligature. As Ken worked through the task of drawing all 1,400 ligatures, he would adjust forms as needed to make each individual ligature look perfect. Automatically assembled ligatures would not have had that same attention to detail and the organic qualities of the face would have been lost. In cases like this, automation always yields to aesthetics.\n\nBecause the decision was made to hand build all the ligatures, we never really looked into assembling them on the fly. I have some ideas about how that could be done with a combination of contextual lookups, kerning and _lots_ of alternate glyphs, but it would be a big can of worms.\n\n"

Adam was responsible for the OT version with its clever pseudo-random stuff. Of course, no mention of either current version of Zapfino should exclude Akira Kobayashi, who worked on the design revision with Hermann.\n\nIf I were to form an OT team for Si’s list, I think it would have to be the Hebrew Hounds with Ralph Hancock, or maybe the Torah Tigers. All this fancy Latin display typography is a nice light pre-season workout, but I really don’t think you’ve broken a sweat if the game doesn’t require additions to Unicode, changes to the way VOLT works, changes to the way Uniscribe works, and six months in the locker room listening to people shout about why Phoenician is or is not the same thing as Hebrew.  \n\\_\n\nAnyway, kudos indeed to Tal, and congratulations to whoever won that silly game with all the padding. I leave you with [a real sport](http://web.archive.org/web/20080107113211/http:/gvod.blogspot.com/2006/02/rugby-tackles-ouch.html). Oh my goodness, they’re not wearing helmets!
