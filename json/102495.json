  "content": "“Kamenica” - named after a beautiful small mountain river in Serbia - is a font family containing 3 weights: Light, Regular and Bold.\n\nThe Kamenica river is only a few meters wide. Mostly shallow and cold, clear and green, it was the direct inspiration source for the creation of this condensed typeface. As our other typefaces, “Kamenica” also combines traditional shapes with modern forms, tall x-height and a collection of more than 300 glyphs.\n\nComparing the river with the font, we could say that letters are the fishes that lives in the Kamenica river and that the font weights are the seasons in which this river shows most of its own character.\n\nFind out more at: [http://www.tourdefonts.com/font-catalog/kamenica/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.tourdefonts.com/font-catalog/kamenica/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T_Kamenica_Poster1_3798.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T_Kamenica_Poster2_5254.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T_Kamenica_Poster3_4423.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T_Kamenica_Poster4_4079.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/T_Kamenica_Poster5_5714.png)\n\nAvailable (or it will be soon) on:\n\n[Fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/searchresults.htm?foundry=Tour+de+Force+Font+Foundry)  \n [FontDeck](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/fontdeck.com/foundry/tourdeforce)  \n [FontSpring](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.fontspring.com/foundry/tour-de-force)  \n [ITC Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.itcfonts.com/fonts/searchresults.htm?st=5&cid=Tour+de+Force+Font+Foundry&pg=1)  \n [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.linotype.com/808063/tourdeforcefontfoundry-library.html)  \n [Luth Norway](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.luth.no/default.asp?side=fonter&Searchstring=Tour+De+Force)  \n [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/new.myfonts.com/foundry/Tour_de_Force/)  \n [Type.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.type.co.uk/a_to_z_listing/supplier/65)  \n [YouWorkForThem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174439/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/designer/354/tour-de-force-font-foundry/)\n\n",
