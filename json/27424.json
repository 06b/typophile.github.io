  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm using FL 4.5, and I'm doing the kerning using classes to produce a opentype font. Everything is fine apart form this output I get when I compile the opentype features.\n\nStart of new pair positioning subtable; some pairs may never be accessed: [Y Yacute Ycircumflex Ydieresis] [agrave aacute acircumflex atilde adieresis aring amacron abreve] [WORK:Applications:FontLab 4.5:fontlab.fea 114]\n\nI've checked the classes to make sure there is no duplications, and the kerning for the key glyph. The kerning seems to be working fine, so I carn't work out what's causing this output.\n\ns.\n\n",

Even though they did help in some matters, these versions of the software are still behind the current font format needs. Especially if you’re making OpenType fonts, I’d definitely consider upgrading to FontLab Studio 5, since previous versions of FontLab simply did not completely fulfill the \"best practice\" recommendations for OpenType fonts. Unfortunately, the reality of OpenType for the last 2-3 years has been that the OpenType specification has been frozen and a lot of un- or underdocumented fixes and recommendations were issued by Adobe and Microsoft. FontLab Studio 5 takes these into account.\n\nA.\n\n"
