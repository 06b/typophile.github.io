  "content": "Since I designed Mommie you can see a lot of script typefaces with big contrast for big sizes. With Narziss I created a roman interpretation with the very expressive Swirls version. Glenda is again an italic script like Mommie. In the Regular the characters join and it looks like a neatly written sprencerian handwriting. But like Narziss it has got a Swirls version too. Every glyph and swirl is carefully designed to work in every connection. Only use it very big.\n\n[http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/display/Glenda/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016203356/http:/www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/display/Glenda/ \"http://www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/display/Glenda/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016203356im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WassGlenda_5770.jpg)\n\n",
