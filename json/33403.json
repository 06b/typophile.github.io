      "content": "Very nice design so far. I think it's quite readable---the idea of basing it off a grid is quite clever. Adding some basic Postscript-style hints would make the stems cripser at sizes other than 14pt. Of course, your sample makes it look like you don't need it, but since auto-generating such hints is pretty painless, it's worth trying it.\n\nI would suggest posting a pdf file. How much of the design is tuned to the Mac rendering model?\n\nThe s looks like it's falling backward ever so slightly.\n\nIn your anobe picture, what are the blue letters?\n\n"

The blue letters in the anobe picture are the default fontlab backgrounds, they are not linked to the font itself and I just forgot to hide them while printing my screen. And finally this is not a pixel font but a pixel based way to draw letters, I'm trying to make it look decent at big and small size just by the way I'm drawing it. Anyway can someone help about the line height ?\n\n"

      "content": "for the line height, look at the values of the OS2\\>WinAscent and OS2\\>WinDescent, and also hhea\\>ascender and hhea\\>descender. One or more of these values may be set too small. Depending on the app you're using, the value in OS2\\>sTypoLinegap may need to be adjusted also.\n\nAnother question though, (and I might be way off on this one...) If OSX uses oversampling to generate graymaps for the screen, then drawing on a 14pixel grid might not work exactly, correct? I'd imaging there may be cases where the larger oversample size rounds differently then the base 14pixel grid drawing? I am thinking this might be why you're seeing some of the strangeness that Hrant mentioned. As I said, I might be wrong about that, I certainly haven't tested it myself.\n\nJason C\n\n"
