( [http://www.monotype.co.uk/neosans/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145450/http:/www.monotype.co.uk/neosans/ \"http://www.monotype.co.uk/neosans/\")) The reason why I am not able to use Neo Sans is because it does not have a Cyrillic alternative and so I am forced to find something similar.\n\nIf any of you have suggestions, that would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\nVlad\n\n [‹ Kerning list two](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145450/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45216 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rules for punctuation spacing in spanish ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145450/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45156 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
