I'm trying to make a modern font using a constant proportion on most of cases for get clear white spaces with soft curves for be used in posters and graphic performances.\n\nFor example instead vertical rectangle of \"o\" the \"m\" use a similar proportion but an horizontal orientation.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414205421im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Claramaria_show_lowercases_5835.png)\n\nHope you can drop me litle comment or critique for improve some detail that obviousely I can't see.\n\nRegards & respects..!!\n\n",

      "content": "Yes, hard to tell without seeing the letters a bit bigger, and without a full glyph set. I quite like the tone of this. The junctions of the arched letters (nmr) are a bit high and the white notch will clot at small sizes, so I'd make that more substantial. I think e and o look a bit narrow. I think the crossbars on f and t should extend further to the left. And I'm sorry to say the spacing is not very good ;) Look forward to seeing how this progresses!\n\n"

      "content": " **Gary Lonergan:**  \nHi Gary... Happy New Year!  \nwow! so various gliphs are similar between both fonts, although the \"x\" box on cachet is more classical than claramaria.. also one have contrast the other are monolined.. but wow.. so similar.. lol.. now I feel Sad, the world is so little.. xD but any way I'm still working on it.. so, hope soon drop the complete alphabeth here.  \nI really love the references you mention.. specially cachet font.. :) thanks a lot for the info.\n\n**Bendy:**  \nHi Bendy... Happy 2010!  \nwell.. I'm still working on some Caps of this, and well, about juction of 'gmnpr' is caused that I seeking a high simplicity and non classical display font.. I'm thinking at leave without that white notch appear over there for prevent cause that clot you mention.. using an almost rectangle regular porpotion.. so, if I down the junction brake and lose that look, turning like a traditional font.  \nAbout wide of 'e' & 'o' I'll try to extend a little bit and see what happen. I'll also considere to make that modifications on 'f' and 't' may be come a little better, and don't worry about spacing.. I even not fix work on it.  \nThanks a lot to all, very useful points..!!\n\nRegads and hope find us soon mates.. :D  \nPedro (PeGGO)\n\n"

I think the combination of the small notch and the no-thinning junction makes that part quite dark.\n\nYour contrast looks almost reversed. Is that intentional? The horizontals are rendering heavier than the verticals, it seems?\n\n"
