But, having said that, it is so 70’s it is probably due for a comeback in a kitsch ironic way. Hopefully not though.\n\nHere’s my opinion - This is my most detested font of all time. It’s disgusting, but I would be well pleased if any of my stuff were even a tenth as popular as this has been over the years.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
