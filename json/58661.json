It started as a [Type Battle entry](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202235825/http:/typophile.com/battle28) and progressed with [blog feedback](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202235825/http:/typophile.com/blog/7783). You can find out more about it at my website: [www.aquatoad.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202235825/http:/www.aquatoad.com/).
