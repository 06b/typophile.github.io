  "content": "Hi all, I just scribbled down a new (to me, at least) typeface design and, well, I'm not a font designer by profession so I'm posting it here if anyone wants to have a go at it. For future reference, I hereby relinquish all rights to it.\n\nIt's all angles, so I'm tentatively calling it Angul (feel free to rename). The inspiration was: I've been handwriting a lot of numbers in cramped spaces at work, and my 3 has come to look like a backwards uppercase Sigma, so I went from there and got a whole alphanumeric set.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016081331im_/http:/typophile.com/files/angul_3984.jpg)\n\nCheers,\n\nYawar\n\n",

Did you use something like FontForge or a specialised system (or both)? I have some interesting tweaks I'd like to try....\n\nCheers,\n\nYawar\n\n"
