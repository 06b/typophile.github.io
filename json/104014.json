  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am using FontForge.  \nI have a feature while there the rligs are sorted by the number of combinations.  \nGlyphs with higher combination comes at the top and the one with less combination goes down in the list.\n\nWhen I am merging the feature file using File -\\>Merge Feature Info, merging happens fine but when I check the Lookup, I find that the sort order is lost.\n\nThere are few thousand ligatures. Its an Arabic Font.\n\nHow do I keep the order of feature file?\n\nPlease help.\n\nRegards,\n\n",
