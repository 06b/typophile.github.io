I have a client that sent over some designs and uses OPTI Carmella Hand Script\n\nsearch online + chatting with a few in the design industry + reading some posts here basically resulted in finding out that OPTI just stole some fonts, and repackaged them.\n\nHowever... More research showed that OPTI ripped off Julia Script, but when i go to the sites that sell Julia (only one version came up), it looks nothing like the OPTI version (please take that last line in context... i know nothign about fonts--to me as a layperson it doesn't look like the same font, and my client will not like it).\n\nSo i'm hoping someone here can provide a little guidance. I'm trying to do right, and would appreciate any guidance provided.\n\n",
