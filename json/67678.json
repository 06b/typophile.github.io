  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently writing a major book about the life and work of Roger Excoffon, that will be published by Atelier Perrousseaux in french and english at the spring 2011. It will feature a never-published before interview of Excoffon, participations by designers and friends such as Jose Mendoza y Almeida, an introduction by Massin, and a lot of high quality visuals. I have acquired an important iconography, but I am still missing some items, so I need your help.\n\nIf you have ANY documents regarding Roger Excoffon (type specimen, metal fonts, drawings, letters, photographs...), I would be glad to hear about it; any photograph or scan provided would of course be aknowledged, and a copy of the book would be on your way as soon as it's released.\n\nMany thanks in advance,  \nDavid Rault\n\n",

Excoffon used to attend, as did many people who knew and worked with him. Of course, most if not all of that generation is now gone, but there may still be people involved who met him.\n\n"

      "content": "Miss Tiffany: it will be big, thick, printed on a white matte paper, full of never-seen before texts and great illustrations - but unfortunately, it's very, very hard to locate good documents, for most of them basically disappeared. I am working as hard as possible to retrieve everything I can. I will contact Gerard Unger; in order to save time, would you by any chance have an email where I could reach him?\n\nJohn: I did contact Jean-Francois, he will actually participate to the book as well. I am very familiar with the Rencontres de Lure, I was actually in Lurs a few month ago, at Francois Richaudeau's house, overlooking the very house of Roger Excoffon. As you said, most of them are now gone, and I contacted the few remaining ones without much success, apart from Yves Perrousseaux and Jose Mendoza y Almeida.\n\nWolfgang: I did send an email to Sebastien Morlighem, and am now waiting for an answer.\n\nThanks to everyone,  \ndavid\n\n"
