      "content": "Hi Marcus. There is some stuff on the Web, like [this post on grainedit.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123164357/http:/grainedit.com/2008/06/17/aldo-novarese-recta-san-serif-typeface-for-nebiolo/) that shows some pictures. I have a complete specimen back at my office but I’m moving back to the UK tomorrow so I won’t be able to access it any time soon. Lots of people have Nebiolo specimens these days, anyway. Recta is indeed a pretty big family modeled after Frutiger’s Univers in the sense it has the same kind of rational system behind its weights/widths.\n\nAs far as I know there aren’t any available good digital versions. A guy called Derren Wilson [posted to his blog a call to arms to digitise Recta in 2002](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123164357/http:/www.iliveonyourvisits.com/?p=121), then [started doing it himself a couple of months later](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123164357/http:/www.iliveonyourvisits.com/?p=180), but as far as I know he never went further than what’s posted there: lowercase, uppercase and numbers from a single weight with no italics and dodgy spacing, unfinished.\n\nThe biggest issue with reviving typefaces from Nebiolo is related to licensing anyway. In some cases it’s easy to attribute the design to a single individual such as Novarese, but it’s unclear wether the rights to some other designs belong to him (thus to his heirs) or to Nebiolo, or maybe to some other designer like Alessandro Butti or Giulio da Milano or… If they belong to Nebiolo, which closed in the 70’s, as far as I know what was left of the company was sold to FIAT, Italy’s main automobiles producer, but tracking exactly a contact to enquire about the rights to the Nebiolo stuff sounds like a nightmare in such a big organisation.\n\nNot all is lost though: there’s a small group of people including me, Claudio Piccinini, Piero De Macchi, Enrico Tallone and others, who are actively researching Nebiolo’s history so maybe things will become more clear in the future. When exactly I can’t tell now, but that is my hope.\n\n"

That's why I asked for Recta, one of  \nthe typefaces that inspired Christian in the design of Graphik as well  \nas Plak by Paul Renner, Neuzeit Grotesk by Wilhelm Pischner, Folio and Maxima by Gert Wunderlich in Typoart foundry in RDA.\n\nI just found an article on Novarese in EMIGRE (no. 26 spring  \n1993) and in Etapes nº 13.\n\nIf you could send me some pictures about Recta you appreciate :)\n\nthanks\n\n"

      "content": "<cite> Looks more like Avenir. </cite>  \nYou are right Nick, in the sense that Recta appears a good compromise between Helvetica and Futura/Erbar. I always liked it because it's warmer, compared to Helvetica.\n\nMarcus: information, specifically on Recta, are not easy to find. They did not worry producing so much literature and analisys about type designs, they were more likely to proceed through work, and to concentrate on the work's results afterwards.\n\n"
