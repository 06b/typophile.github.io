  "content": "A friend of mine has asked me to design a brochure for his boat charter business. The boats are a blend of retro 1950's boat design and modern technology and I'd like to reflect this in the design of the brochure.\n\nI've had a look at various Gothic typefaces which seem to bridge (no pun intended) both design eras and quite like the combination of Bell Gothic and Minion. However, this combo seems to lack the dynamicism I'd like to allude to (the boats are quite fast and maneuverable...) Another nice option is Futura, but it just feels a little dated. I've also looked at a few modern classics like Meta et al, but haven't hit on something that really fills me with the right vibes.\n\nCan anyone suggest a nice combination that might give the kind of feel I'm after?\n\nMany thanks in advance for any/all suggestions.\n\n",

Futura is the most era appropriate of what you've mentioned . . . Check out some of [our fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020222648/http:/www.fontdiner.com/) to see if they help . . .\n\nStuart :D\n\n"

It has a sense of speed but also softness. You could very well set extended text in the regular version, though this fat ital may be too soft for what you are doing.\n\n"

It's possibly a little formal, but my friend is after an up-market, affluent clientele and didn't want anything too 'comedy' (as he put it).\n\n"
