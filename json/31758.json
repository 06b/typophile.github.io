But this logo comes from a pre-existing long standing ( 15 years+ ) context. So What I am saying is - in a weird way it does fit. Maybe you do't like that aspect of the itallian reality but.... it's there.\n\nWhat I see in it that nobody else seems to see is a willingness to be less serious that the UK & The US don't have. Is that bad or good? I have no idea. Is the logo itself wonderful? To me - No. But the key question to ask is - is this going to last more that a year & how serious is it as an issue anyway. I bet it last only a year & that it is therefore totally un-serious as an issue.\n\n"
