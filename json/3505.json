I have the basics down (color rules, size restrictions, placement, media types, etc.) However, this is going to be targeted specifically at the average employee, as we do not have a formal marrketing group to force adherence. So I'm interested in anything that is targeted at the LCD...the rogue webmaster putting together an intranet oblivoius to IT standards or the secretary that is getting logo sweatshirts done 'just for fun' type of thing.   \n   \nOr anything, really...I just like looking at style guides. ;o)\n\n",

It seems to be the 'holy grail' piece of the ID system, you will find agencies that specialize in just id guides.   \n   \nWe have put together around a dozen, but nothing really worth posting.   \n   \nWhat you may be able to find is online style guides..   \n   \nHeres a few that have been posted here:   \n   \n [http://www.abb.com/global/gad/gad01638.nsf/welcome.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052155/http:/www.abb.com/global/gad/gad01638.nsf/welcome.html)   \n   \n [http://www.att.com/style/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052155/http:/www.att.com/style/)   \n   \n [http://www.identityworks.com/tools/manuals.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052155/http:/www.identityworks.com/tools/manuals.html)   \n   \n [http://www.diebold.com/idmanual/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052155/http:/www.diebold.com/idmanual/)   \n   \n [http://www.wileycanada.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-3511.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052155/http:/www.wileycanada.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-3511.html)   \n   \nHope this helps..\n\n"

I had forgotten all about that identityworks.com site.   \n   \nI've actually found a handful of good university style guides, which is probably as close as I'm going to get to the type of verbage I need for this project.   \n   \nI'll post what I have so far hopefully today.   \n   \nAlso, while I'm at it, has anyone had to design an ID system where there is an existing 'seal' that is often used? Be default or state's seal has become the de-facto 'logo' for any agency that is too lazy to use the seal properly.   \n   \nOh...and as to the system font thing...my first gig was as an intern at 3M. I could use pretty much anything as long as it was either Times or Helvetica.   \n   \nAs much as we cringe at using system fonts, there are financial + IT related reasons for doing it, and consistency with system fonts is probably better than no consistency at all.   \n   \nI'm not sure if I can convince the powers that be here that we should also be considering type setting standards. We hardly have a stationery system at this point. I have a lot of talking to do... ;o)\n\n"

      "content": "I think the style guide is good.   \n   \nOn the style guide, depending on who your audience is, it might help to separate out the logo use and abuse advice for different media/functions: one page for use on the web (size, borders, file-type etc); one page for color printing; one page for black and white printed matter; one page for signage etc.   \n   \nOtherwise, there may be a danger that people say 'Oh well, I prefer the signage version, and although I'm about to put out a leaflet, it's \"approved\" so I think I will use that.' Also some of your audience may start reading about Pantone colors and just think 'This is all stuff for professional printers, I reckon I'll just do the best I can'   \n   \nIt might also be useful to divide sections clearly into \"Preferred\" \"Tolerated\" \"Forbidden\" categories: sort of red, amber and green. Otherwise my guess is people will tend to treat anything not expressly prohibited as permitted. That's how (we) lawyers think.   \n   \nDo you need as many alternatives as you have? For instance, do you need both the green on black and the black on green horizontal versions (since both have the red too)? Which is preferred, or is it a totally free choice? Is the version with the logo preferred to the all-words version, or don't you mind?\n\n"
