[http://www.glennsorrentino.com/blog/view/win\\_a\\_copy\\_of\\_body\\_type\\_2/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015012809/http:/www.glennsorrentino.com/blog/view/win_a_copy_of_body_type_2/ \"http://www.glennsorrentino.com/blog/view/win\\_a\\_copy\\_of\\_body\\_type\\_2/\")\n\n\"From Rimbaud to the Rolling Stones, from declarations of love and belief systems to self-empowerment and homage, the choice of a typographical tattoo provides insight into the human condition.\n\nThe sequel to the bestselling Body Type: Intimate Messages Etched in Flesh, this second volume collects over two hundred new tattoos and explores the ideas and emotions behind this indelible commitment. This stunning photography collection features commentary on the letterforms as well as personal recollections by the tattooed on the motivations for their decided words. Inspiring, sometimes shocking, and always voyeuristic, Body Type 2 is not only for tattoo aficionados, but also for all lovers of the written word.\"\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015012809im_/http:/typophile.com/files/61Ibkch9ciL_3562._SS500_.jpg)\n\n",
