Kudos to the creator(s) and members!\n\nSo... my first post comes in the form of a request for help. I’m struggling to find a not-so-popular font that is similar to Century Gothic and Avant Garde (both having an ’a’ shaped the way most people would normally handwrite it, e.g. circle with stick to the right (Apologies for my lack of correct terminology))\n\nThe typeface will be used for body copy, so it would need to have a large variety of weights and of course, be easy to read in large chunks of text. I would also prefer if the font was slightly condensed (not as wide as Century Gothic).\n\nTo add, I’m also not a fan of Avant Garde’s ’s’ being so squooshed.\n\nThanks,\n\nKoodoz\n\n [‹ TipoGrafica](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234438/http:/typophile.com/node/36166 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Signage ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234438/http:/typophile.com/node/36124 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Koodoz,\n\nI suggest you exercise caution when pairing headline and body faces that are very similar, but not identical. Typically, your headline and body faces should either be of the same family or contrast in a pleasing manner. This is why sans headlines are often paired with serif text.\n\nAnyway, I hope you find what you’re looking for. I wouldn’t worry about the ’a’ style not matching unless you’re actually trying to convince the reader they’re the same type family. Frankly, Lane matches the structure of grotesques like [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106234438/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=helvetica&btnG.x=0&btnG.y=0&site=d) more than geometrics like Avant Garde. It’s possible you’re losing the forest for the trees in matching type.\n\nOne quick note: Lane is a free font. The others we’re recommending are not. Just something to keep in mind for your budget.\n\n"
