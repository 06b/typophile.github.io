  "content": "**TYPE BATTLE: Week 11 (10 April)**\n\nHere’s your chance to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. Each game kicks off on Monday with a new challenge, and closes at midnight PST on Friday. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May be the best designer win.\n\nLink directly to this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/battle11](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021154254/http:/www.typophile.com/battle11 \"http://www.typophile.com/battle11\")\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- Size: 600 width x 400 height. 72 dpi  \n- Color: Black and white only  \n- Format: Please save your graphics as PNG  \n- Only respond with the characters posted in the challenge.\n\n**// THIS WEEK’S CHALLENGE: S Mahem II  \nDesign four more s's: Supercondensed, Condensed, Regular, Super Wide. For extra points: interpolate the characters with the four weights from last week.**\n\n",

      "content": "One thing to keep in mind when going from condensed to wide is maintaining the appearance of weight. Notice in some of these examples how much bolder the condensed appears compared to the extended. It's not too noticeable in the lightest weights, but the bolder you go, the more obvious it becomes. Weight is not just the relative thickness of the strokes, you must take into account the relationship of the strokes to the internal space.\n\n"

      "content": "_Would I make the vertical sections of the stroke wider? I was afraid that would give the appearance of stretching… suggestions?_\n\nNo, you want to keep the relative thickness of the horizontal and vertical strokes consistent, though not necessarily mechanically consistent. Your eye is the final arbiter. Basically, it means that the wider you go, the bolder you go, to keep the same color impression. Again, it's not a mechanical thing. You need to decide for yourself how much the stroke weight needs to change to achieve visual consistency. Take a look at type families with lots of widths and weights to see how others have done it.\n\n_Mark, would you suggest a book on letter construction and typeface design? Something practical, with examples?_\n\nThese may be hard to find, but here are some I like:\n\nType Sign Symbol, by Adrian Frutiger  \nThe Modification of Letterforms, by Stanley Hess  \nLettering Design, by Michael Harvey\n\nFor the most part, these books are concerned with drawing letters by hand, but the main principles apply to digital type as well.\n\n"
