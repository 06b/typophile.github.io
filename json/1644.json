What would happen if we reached that limit? Would we even know?   \n   \nMatha.\n\n",

For one thing, mutation still happens.   \n   \nReadability: It's a dynamic thing (even if you took some \"average\" of all readers), and familiarity does play a role. In my Alphabet Reform work I arrived at the conclusion that the degree to which an alphabet (nevermind a font, which is an instance of an alphabet) is optimal depends on the current state of the reader. What I mean for example is that an \"e\" with a flat bottom might improve readability optimally at this time (by pushing the boundary just the right amount), but once people are totally comfortable with that structure the next step in optimization might be to give the \"e\" a descender.   \n   \nThis is hard to explain.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
