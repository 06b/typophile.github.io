  "content": "I am designing the graphic content of a small museum celebrating the Italian immigrant contribution to Australian culture. My clients want a very contemporary look. I wondered if other typophiles might be able to recommend any recent (post Novarese) type design work coming out of Italy that would be appropriate. I need display type and a type family for bigger blocks of information. Any assistance much appreciated.\n\n",
