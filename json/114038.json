      "content": "It is possible to design a search engine that looks for the mathematical fingerprint of a font. At least with OTF (PostScript or TrueType flavor) this could work. There are descriptions of the vectors and mapping available, which would increase chances of similarity. It wouldn’t be too costly to program such a search engine. The question is more, is it worth the effort? Because it’s a niche use case product. It would require you to have the original font to begin with, so what would be the actual application for general use?\n\n"
