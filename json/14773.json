Hi-fi manufacturers are generally good candidates for undistinguished and boring identities. But the deeper into hi-end territory you get, the more contrived and “faux craft” the identities become, ranging from your little nephew’s attempts at geometric cool to pink marble mantelpieces with gold leaf borders. Try [http://www.ear-yoshino.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20061123005406/http:/www.ear-yoshino.com/) for the chintzy version, or [http://www.wadia.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20061123005406/http:/www.wadia.com/) and [http://www.wilson-benesch.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20061123005406/http:/www.wilson-benesch.com/) for the techie version. There’s only one truly hi-end manufacturer who manages to translate sonic performance into an at least inoffensive identity, ( [http://www.lavardin.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20061123005406/http:/www.lavardin.com/)), but they’re French, so that doesn’t count (just kidding, J-F). Mind you, they all have 1998-vintage websites.\n\nHm. Better get my anorak off, this will get out of hand.\n\n"

Lots of pretenders and few people with enough skill to get all the details right. An esoteric persuit yes, but not to be dismissed as simple vanity. If you’ve noticed, our standards for high-quality music reproduction are doing down fast.
