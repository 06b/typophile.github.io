  "content": "Hi - I'm a freelance web designer/developer, with a fairly modest knowledge of typography.\n\nI was just wondering if you have any ideas of a typeface that would work well with URW Antiqua (specifically Alternative T Super)?\n\nLuckily I think Georgia works well with it in various forms, esp. for body text (I could be wrong?), but I'm looking for something a little less common, and with similar character to Antiqua, to use for the headings and other more prominent areas of text on a new website.\n\nYou can see the logo with Georgia here: [http://www.finelysliced.com.au/old/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018130212/http:/www.finelysliced.com.au/old/ \"http://www.finelysliced.com.au/old/\")\n\nThanks! I appreciate your help/expertise!\n\n",

The first come bundled with OSX, the second with MS Office 03 and 07 on a Windows PC, and MS Office 04 on a mac. (Add Georgia to be safe.)\n\nIf you're not looking for something web specific: perhaps [Ingeborg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018130212/http:/typejockeys.com/type/6_Ingeborg) or [Scotch Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018130212/http:/www.shinntype.com/). I'd say the latter is more dramatic.\n\n"
