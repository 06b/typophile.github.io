I've just found that the sister company to the design agency I work for started stocking [Font Clocks](http://web.archive.org/web/20140118045222/http:/www.icone.co.uk/clocks/font-clock-g270/established/sebastian-wrong/fontg270/), like the office clocks you'd get in banks here in the UK, but they've got 12 fonts that cycle through and mingle together rather than purely Helvetica. As far as I know, there's three sizes (I've got a mid-size one on order, the big one's too big for my house!)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140118045222im_/http:/typophile.com/files/big_6575.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140118045222im_/http:/typophile.com/files/medium_5386.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140118045222im_/http:/typophile.com/files/titchy_6667.jpg)\nAs far as I know, I don't think [icône](http://web.archive.org/web/20140118045222/http:/www.icone.co.uk/clocks/font-clock-g270/established/sebastian-wrong/fontg270/) can deliver to the US :( but I know they deliver Europe-wide... \n",

I know what you mean about the all-Helvetica flip clock, I came close to buying myself one a few years ago (I think Habitat used to do small ones). There's a few bizarre choices of typeface on this one, it's like they got their mitts on a Letraset catalogue from the 80s!\n\n"

I think the reason they don't deliver to the US of A is that once taxes and delivery have been added, it turns into 'a really dear do'\n\nStill, at least the Helvetica Film is showing across the pond... I'm hoping that it'll get shown in Nottingham, England sometime soon!\n\n"
