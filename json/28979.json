They did this in 1977. Hence the name…\n\nIts just like Egyptian 505, which was designed by his class at the Basel School in… Room 505!\n\nMaybe you can try the Basel telephone book (online?), and write him a letter? Alternatively, you could try to get in touch with Hannes Famira, who seems to have moved to Brooklyn from Basel. He was teaching in Basel for a few year recently ( Oblique typeface). Maybe all all Basel lettering people know each other.\n\n"
