Developed by for The Times of London in [1931](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1931) (first used in October [1932](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1932)) and generally attributed to [Stanley Morison](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stanley%20Morison) (not least by himself, in _[A Tally of Types](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/A%20Tally%20of%20Types)_). There is some debate about its origin. In _A Tally of Types_ Morison himself said that he had 'pencilled the original drawings' and handed them to [Victor Lardent](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Victor%20Lardent), a draftsman in the Times' publicity department, who had produced finished drawings, which had then been worked on by the Monotype drawing office. When _A Tally of Types_ was revised in [1973](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1973) a sceptical note was added, suggesting that it was likely that Lardent had carried out the actual design work based on some samples of [Plantin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Plantin) that Morison had supplied. More recently, some have claimed it is the work of one [Starling Burgess](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Starling%20Burgess).\n\nWith the advent of the personal computer, Times New Roman and similar fonts based on the same model have become a standard default typeface in many applications.\n\nFor more info about the disputed origin listen to the interview with [Mike Parker](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mike%20Parker) on [typeradio.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123232/http:/typophile.com/wiki/typeradio).
