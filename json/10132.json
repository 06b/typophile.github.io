  "content": "OK, this is an odd one: I'm currently designing proposals for an engineering firm. We respond to RFPs (Request for Proposals), that often specify \"No font smaller than 12 pt.\" Since we have a lot to say, I've been forced to choose typefaces on the basis of character size.   \n   \n(I hear your sighs ... but it's a paying gig, and those are kinda hard to find in this place and time.)   \n   \nAnyway, Perpetua is my current favorite for serif font; it's so tiny that we have to ad \"This proposal formatted in 12 pt Perpetua\" on the cover letter. The problem is that any sans I use looks huge next to it.   \n   \nI have a vague memory of tables that listed \"characters per pica\" for different typefaces at different sizes; are those still around, or did they die w/ the advent of WYSIWYG?   \n   \nAnyway, if anyone has any suggestions -- both in serif and sans -- I'd be grateful. Thx!\n\n",

But it's not x-height; it's just that perpetua is small ... or at least this incarnation (Monotype?) is.   \n   \nThese are rather long and boring texts, written by engineers for engineers. I'd like to make them as readable as possible, while breaking out of the mold. A lot of the competition use arial narrow as a text font -- sometimes further condensed(Eeeew!) in order to fit into the page limits. I want to come up w/ something that is more readable, doesn't use any more space, and is much more stylin'.   \n   \nThx!\n\n"

Also the original (not ITC) Kabel.   \n   \nVesta at GerardUnger.com is impressively readable for a sans. Myriad condensed is nice, as is Meta. Benton Sans from Fontbureau (related to Trade Gothic, Franklin, etc) has a number of condensed versions. No sans is as readable for text as any good text serif, in my opinion.\n\n"

      "content": "You're trying to strike a balance between apparent size, economy and style. What you should note is:   \n1) A font with a smaller x-height does take up less room at a given point size, but at the expense of apparent size.   \n2) The requirement for 12 point (probably) comes from a desire for a minimum apparent size; if you \"cheat\" by using a font with a small x-height, it's going to come down to them saying \"but it's too small\" and you saying \"but it's 12 point!\" You need to try to predict which way that argument would end up going.   \n2) The larger the x-height, the more economical the face, and the more legible, but also the less readable. (Although there's certainly a lower limit to the x-height ito readability).   \n   \nIt seems that one thing you can do is choose a sans with a small x-height (like Seria), but that's assuming they won't balk at the apparent size (even though it's 12 point). Another possibility is to use a sans with a \"normal\" x-height but set the Perpetua larger (but then things might not fit).   \n   \nIf neither of those work, you could always just say less.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I'm going to re-try on the description of my situation.)_   \n   \nI work at an engineering firm, and I'm trying to create a corp. identity, which includes proposals. Some of the \"Requests for Proposals\" include a type-size requirement, as in \"type shall be 12 points or larger.\" They also include page limits.   \n   \nIn order to fit the verbage into the pages, I've been using Perpetua, which is a very small typeface. Not small in x-height, but just small for its size. (In order to make Gill Sans visually the same size as 12 pt Perpetua, you have to reduce Gill to 10 pt.)   \n   \nThe problem with Perpetua is that it's a bit spindly for this application. (I create these proposals on a 4-color Xerox.) Another problem is that if I use a contrasting san serif for headlines, it looks huge next to the perpetua, even at 12 pt.   \n   \nBut now that I've used it once, the engineers won't let me use a \"larger\" face. So I'm looking for a similarly \"small\" face that is more robust (thicker hairlines), plus a companion san serif, to be used in the proposals and other printed material.   \n   \n(I hope that made more sense...)   \n   \nI'll check out the suggestions already mentioned. Thanks!\n\n"

Big beaurocracies tend to make many little rules. Unfortunatly, there are a lot of competitors out there who are more than willing to disqualify our proposal because we don't adhere to the rules.

I love Electra, but it looks wrong at 12 pt: it's just too big. I'm totally into Octavian ... but it doesn't have a bold or bold italic, which I really need.
