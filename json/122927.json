I thought it was Akzidenz-Grotesk Bold but now I'm not so sure (it's not Helvetica either). The boxed orange letters shown with the type image are Akzidenz-Grotesk Bold from [Berthold](http://web.archive.org/).\n\nAny thoughts appreciated.\n\nThanks!  \n-David\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n AG Old Face Bold \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Les ONeill](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415235856/http:/typophile.com/user/216897 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

However, I'm confused on the timeline — Berthold's website says AG Old Face was released in 1984, but the book I have was published in 1965 (well, that's the copyright date anyways).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415235856im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ag-old-style-medium_3604.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415235856im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ag-old-style-bold_4325.jpg)\n\n"

Your book is definitely pre-digital so ignore the digital release dates.  \nDigital versions are not necessarily a perfect match to the metal type.  \nDon\n\n"
