  "content": "I’m trying to get a handle of multiple master for the first time, and came across a huge annoyance that has me questioning my workflow. I have the black weight (wt1) complete and I want to design a light (wt0) so I could generate the weights between. When I define the new axis (wt0), I have to “design” the light glyphs by editing the copy of the black glyphs. This severely limits my usual process of drawing, copying and pasting segments, using the knife tool, etc. I can’t work that way, or else it ruins wt1.  \nIs there a way around this?\n\nI know the point is to maintain the exact number of points, etc. Is there any way I can tell FontLab “Hey, I promise the points will be compatible when I’m done, so relax!”\n\n",

      "content": "This is a limitation of the way multiple master fonts work in FontLab. There is really only one path for each part of a glyph. The different masters are variations of that path, not separate paths. If you remove or add a node to a path in one master, the same will happen in any other masters, since they are really the same path.\n\nYou might want to start with single master fonts, and then use the Add Master command to combine them into a multiple master font when you are happy with the separate masters. It is up to you to make sure the paths are compatible if you work this way.\n\nI’ve simply adapted to working with the limitations. I draw one master and then edit the others as needed, avoiding doing anything that would affect the other masters.\n\n"

      "content": "Agree with Mark, There’s really no way around it for now.\n\nOne way I’ve used for a while is to experiment with the other new weight in a separate file until you’re fairy happy. Then you import it into the mask layer in the “new” MM weight to be produced. From there it’s pretty easy to change the curves according to the mask and then make final adjustments to correct horizontal strokes versus vertical stems. It has worked fine for me.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"

Even if the design itself is  \ngood looking the feeling of “too perfect” shines through somehow. Therefor I’ve gone back to trusting my eyes  \nmore, rather than guidelines and numbers. This is of course just my personal reflection. The nice thing about  \ntype design is that there are so many ways of doing it right! ;-)\n\nCheers\n\n"
