Just wanted to say how much I like the work of [Nikki McClure](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203155049/http:/www.nikkimcclure.com/).\n\nHere’s [the rest of this calendar](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203155049/http:/www.buyolympia.com/q/Item=nikki08), in case it helps others to identify the font.\n\n"

It brought up an interview in which she is asked,\n\n**And what are your thoughts on digital art?**\n\nHer response:\n\n_Digital art? go for it. I use computer to make the printed versions of my pictures... **but I also use handcut text in a font that we made**. I want it to be handmade without computer text as much as possible. Just like in nature how nothing is perfect. There are always holes in leaves, torn edges, no solid color. It is getting harder to see these things._ [Bold highlighting is mine.]\n\n:-) I suppose she is talking about the font in the image you posted.\n\nThe full interview is [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203155049/http:/siouxwire-annex.blogspot.com/2007/06/interview-nikki-mcclure.html).\n\n"

In addition to tying in with nature and the subjects of her art, the imperfections in the cut paper letters add a level of warmth that a traditional geometric sans could not achieve.  \nToo bad it’s not available. Its very sweet.  \nJ\n\n"
