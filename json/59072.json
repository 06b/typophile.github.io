So this is a font, but finding it is a problem, because it falls into the 'anyone could have made this' category of font design. You could scan through [Part 14 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20130207035856/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script14Pg1.html) (Distressed Script), or look at Dafont (Brush) category.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
