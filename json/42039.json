That may have been excessive [; )], but if it improves the reading experience, why not?\n\nProblem with the current flock of fonts with lots of ligs is that typesetters/designers don’t stick with the rules, eg they use too much (pos or neg) tracking, which means that the (stationary) ligs stand out and distract. Of course typedesigners could program the OT’s to change back to single characters in these cases, but I think that’s a last resort…\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
