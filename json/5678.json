You can also configure new tabs to load in the background, so you can open pages for later browsing without interruption.

It's nice for research too, since I can run 4 Google searches in 4 windows and open links related to each in tabs under that originating Google search. I find IE to be laborious in contrast.   \n   \nThis hits on a fundamental difference in the 2 big OSes (mac and windows) as well: logical/hierarchical segmentation. While tabbed browsing is possible in both OSes, in Windows every _document_ gets its own Taskbar item (except in apps like Photoshop), but in Mac OS every _app_ gets its own Dock item, then you can move between documents in the app you choose. There are benefits to both, but I prefer the Mac method of hierarchical segmentation (this isn't an official term, I'm just using it for convenience). Also, OS X allows document windows from different apps to intermingle, so you can pull your Illustrator work to Photoshop without having to move every window out of the way, so it's not too strict about the segmenting (OS 9 does not have this ability).   \n   \nI'm not a PC-hater, and I don't use every single widget and feature of my browsers, but even for me IE is behind the curve in a few siginificant ways. And, if I understand correctly, MS is ditching IE anyway (probably so they can just integrate browsing directly into the OS).\n\n"

I guess it depends on what you mean by 'apps like photoshop'.   \nAs far as I can tell its only IE, plus MS Office applications that give each document its own Taskbar item (even those get documents stacked into a single taskbar item in XP).   \nLooking at my quicklaunch bar, I don't see any others that have more than one taskbar item for multiple documents.

You design to standards, fix a few layout bugs in IE, and you're up and running. Accessibility is accessibility. When designing with accessibility in mind (a core part of good web design IMHO) then the browser issue is resolved along the way.   \n   \nHTML is HTML. Javascript is Javascript. CSS is CSS. Designing with those tools, you can go a long way. Again, there's a few hiccups in IE/PC that you need to design around, but these aren't budget-doubling issues. Just small annoyances that--if you know about them--you can easily design around.   \n   \nThis is really no different than in the real world. Building an accessible house isn't prohibitively more expensive. It does take a tad more planning. But once you know the jist of accessible design, it becomes a non-issue.   \n   \n\"Why do you think that you see so many websites which list only IE and some 4th gen version of NN as supported browsers?\"   \n   \nBecause there are a LOT of crappy, lazy web development firms that screw their clients...along with a LOT of crappy, old, out-of-date web sites.

That's simply wrong. It takes me all of 5 minutes to test in all the major browsers. Plus, you don't NEED to test in EVERY browser...you just need to make sure it's accessible.   \n   \n\"But the important thing about a browser, to me, is that I can use the sites I want to use. \"   \n   \nOh sure. No argument there. I'm just trying to make it clear that the reason there are a lot of IE-only sites is predominantly due to lazy/incompetant developers...rather than the myth that it's difficult to develop accessible web sites.

They say nothing about the preferences of an actual user. I use IE day-in, day-out at work. I hate it. But I have to use it. So, when I visit sites, I'm logged as an 'IE/PC' user, when, in fact, I'm much more of a 'Firefox/Mac' user.   \n   \nThere isn't a lot of statistics based on this. I did a bit of research once and found a few folks that had access to large national web sites and were able to break down stats by time of day. After 5, they'd see a 5% swing in the amount of Mac users, for example.   \n   \n\"And in what way is it relevant if someone is not using the browser they want to use?\"   \n   \nIf you go on those generic browser stats alone, you'll lock out some of your audience.

This is part of the problem why you have to keep IE on your computer. Microsoft has developed a nice little catch-22 with their browser. Everyone uses because there are so many sites only developed with IE in mind. There are so many sites only developed with IE in mind because so many developers assume everyone uses IE on windows.

So Thunderbird doesn't as such 'come with' Firefox, but it's the mailreading arm of the SeaMonkey project. There are other side-projects, all being developed by community, such as the Sunbird calendar, which can also integrate with Thunderbird (although the last time I tried it it was still awful buggy).   \n   \nAnd yeah, I can testify that the spam filtering in Thunderbird is great. From about ten a day I now get about one a month slipping through, and no false positives so far.   \n   \nSteve -- if you have the time (maybe a spare five minutes) you could report your non-working sites on the Firefox [forums](http://web.archive.org/web/20060718192916/http:/forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=9&sid=7aeddd06e7d74ea63ad4090358e80d9a)?

And in the real world of corporate web development where testing takes place during _and_ after development, it is a crucial and significant part of the development budget, which **does** influence which browsers/devices are supported.   \nSometimes, its also due to browser bugs.   \n\\</attempt-to-make-myself-clear-without-causing-a-row\\>\n\n"

I'd simply argue that it's USUALLY an issue of lazy web development (whether that be the developers, project management, upper management, etc.).   \n   \n\"Often its down to budgets. And in the real world of corporate web development where testing takes place during and after development, it is a crucial and significant part of the development budget, which does influence which browsers/devices are supported. \"   \n   \nI agree that that \\*is\\* a common excuse...but it's not usually (though it is sometimes) valid, as developing cross-browser web sites, provided the developers know what they're doing, doesn't cost more.   \n   \nWe simply disagree on this point. So be it. ;o) ;o)   \n   \nTo be fair, part of the problem is the toolset given the developers. I do a lot of .net development these days and, surprise, surprise, .net favours IE on the front-end. So I need to go in and develop my own front-end interfaces for most widgets rather than depending on .net's built in widgets.   \n   \nI've worked with CMS tools that also favour only one specific browser. So, if the base set of tools is already flawed, then it's hard to blame the developers that need to work with said tool (though I could blame the folks that decided on that particular technology. ;o)\n\n"
