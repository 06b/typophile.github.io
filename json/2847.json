I chose Adobe Jenson Pro, as you can see from the image below (page six of the prologue)   \n [http://www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/mach\\_jenson.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123709/http:/www.donmacdonald.com/Machiavelli/mach_jenson.html)   \nI just wanted to thank everyone for the help and ask if there are any glaring type-related issues that I missed. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Looks very good.   \n   \nI would just check the kerning where your regular caps meet the italic lower case. This is historically correct, but probably the typeface doesn't have kerning pairs for it. For example the T and r in 'Truly' look too far apart to me. So you need to use your software kerning, or if you are using InDesign you can also use the 'optical kerning' setting which might take care of the whole thing.\n\n"
