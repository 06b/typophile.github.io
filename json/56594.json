It is kind of like Adobe's own encoding scheme for Asian characters, alternative to Unicode.\n\nI agree that the term \"by CID/GID\" is not very obvious to the user\n\nIt reminds me of the term \"OpenType CFF\". This is why I have been proposing \"OpenType PS\" as in \"PostScript-flavored OpenType\", but it seems that Adobe was concerned about the use of their PostScript trademark in this context. I think that Adobe was primarily worried that \"PostScript-flavored OpenType\" suggested that \"the other\" flavor, i.e. \"TrueType-flavored OpenType\" aka \"OpenType TT\" is not compatible with PostScript, somehow. But \"CFF\" just like \"sfnt\" is an obscure technical term which I think is an additional burden to the user to learn. Same for \"CID/GID\".\n\nI agree with John that \"Font order\" would be a sensible label in this context.\n\nI have just [submitted a feature request](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203175146/http:/www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform) to Adobe, proposing the terminology _Sort glyphs by_ / _Font order_ and _Unicode order_.

Usually faster, and usually better. Sometimes when you enter a character from the glyph pallet, certain OT features seem to get blocked.\n\nIf you need a character that isn't encoded, two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: If it is a small cap, you have probably used one of the small cap features in InDesign, so again, you can enter the appropriate Unicode cap (or l.c.) & be done with it.\n\nAside: Sometimes a character has a Unicode index, but you don't know it, and figure it will be easier to find it in the glyph pallet. Well, it happens. In that case, you usually want all the characters of a certain kind together. Problem is, there are different \"kinds\".\n\nAn alphabetic sort order makes the most sense when you are trying to find a diacritical variant, at least, using the Latin Script. I don't know the other scripts well enough to comment.\n\nIf you don't know the Unicode index for an oddball character (the circled infinity used for \"archival paper\" for example), you just hope you'll spot it quickly. (But you won't, usually, because it is left out of most fonts.)\n\nCase 2: The other situation occurs with a font like Bingham Script. Now just which of those variants did the designer want? Hard to see all the subtle differences in the glyph pallet. This is one case where I'd personally like to see the variant characters have a Private Use encoding. That way, the \"just which one\" can be passed along the production chain. Failing this, having them all together helps, a little.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
