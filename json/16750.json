Letters that are normally cast flush to the sidebearings can be undercut on the right side to kern onto the shoulder of the following letter. This subtraction of width is at the discretion of the casterman and can be overdone. All characters have a set-width designation stamped on the matix. When followed these widths create proper fitting and in the case of letters like f (roman) a kern is automatically created. In italic matrix suites there are many letters that kern on the right side and make tight fitting in a line.\n\nJustification is the term given to the process of trimming the extra depth that results when a steel punch is over-depth into the matrix metal blank. Matrices are always over-driven since it is not really possible to strike the depth dead accurately. As a result the strike is made a couple of thousandths of an inch too deep and the face of the matrice is trimmed off to make the depth consistent over the entire suite of matrices. In bygone days this was done by rubbing the matrix on a file and trial casting until the height of the lead type was correct. I have two Ludlow Super Surfacers that I have adapted to trim as little as one quarter of a thousandth at a time, and this saves a lot of sore thumbs.\n\nSome people use the term Justification to mean the side fitting of one letter to another, but the more common meaning is the trimming of the matix to depth.\n\nJim\n\n"

      "content": "3)Does broadnib pen equal the quill pen?  \nWhat is a split-nib pen? Does it equal a quill pen with disposable metal nib?\n\nBroad nib and split nib refer to the way in which the nib of a pen, whether quill, reed, metal, etc. is shaped and hence the characteristics of the ink flow and kind of strokes and contrast patterns that can be made with the pen. A broad nib has defined width that determines stroke contrast. A split nib is thinner, pointed and much more flexible, so stroke contrast is determined by pressure rather than by the shape of the nib: the more pressure you apply, the heavier the stroke. As you apply pressure, the two sides of the split nib move apart from each other, but the surface tension of the ink means that the stroke itself does not split (unless you apply too much pressure; this has sometimes been exploited by calligraphers). Split nibs are usually made of metal, since it is stronger and can be flexed without fear of breaking. It is possible to make a split nib from a feather or from a reed, but the material is is less durable and, in the case of the feather, too brittle to last long.\n\n"
