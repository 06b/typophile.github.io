The image is a scan of a letterpress-printed sample.  \nIt bears some similarity to [Wichita TS-Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20080513221127/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/wichita/bold/charmap.html), so perhaps this is M.F.

We have this face only in this weight (and sadly one size), and we would love to know the name of it. All of the other metal type has been identified, except for this one. If it is any help, most of the other type in the shop seems to be predominantly from ATF. Hoping someone out there might recognize it.\n\n"

It was nice to have a full character set.\n\n"
