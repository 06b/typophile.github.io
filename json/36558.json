This project has gone through a long and sometimes tedious process and at this point I’m having some trouble looking at it with the proper perspective.\n\nThere’s no room for major changes at this point, but I think I could use some fresh eyes to help me with the kerning of the letters.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191625im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo_6147.jpg)\n\n [‹ Web Design company logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191625/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34969 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [MAQ ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191625/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35436 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
