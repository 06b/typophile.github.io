This is not Arbitaray Sans... it's a font 'designed' by Bruce Mau in Toronto.   \n   \n/image{disney}   \n   \nQuoting from Bruce Mau's book:   \n\"We began by using animation techniques to produce an exclusive font. It was a technique that we evolved during Zone 6, where we morphed one letterform into another, looking for in-between stages. The resulting font was titled 'A Font Called Frank.' Clear and deceptively 'regular' when reproduced on small applications such as letterhead, the font possessed complex qualities that are revealved when enlarged to the scale of architectural signage.\"   \n   \nThose 'complex qualities', I'm afraid, are just inconsistencies! I see nothing 'complex' about this interpolated font.\n\n"
