Note: I'm not sure this is the right term, as there are straight text fonts with \"Semiserif\" in the name. \"Hybrid\" something or \"Mashup\" might be a more appropriate wiki page for this type of font. - S. Coles\n\nNote: Stephen, i'm not sure how the term \"semi-serif\" is used in reference to these other types of fonts. Can you point me toward some samples, so that I can expand this article to include both usages? --\\>\n\n",
