It is just a simple grid (2x2 + diagonals) according to which the user draws freely each characters and define its weight by the choice of his tool (pen, marker, etc). The “self-square” could be printed on a tape, and then, the width of the tape determines the basic leading.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103205im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/selfsquare02_4391.jpg)\n\nAnd here, you can see that’s too easy to get a condensed version.\n\n",

Your system seems so simple that I can’t imagine anyone being able to wreck it.\n\nI love the stepped B you’ve drawn, as well as the narrow W.\n\n"
