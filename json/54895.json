The projects needn't to be necessarily (typo-)graphic – we are always interested in other parts of design.\n\nAdditionally we present student- and diploma-projects in our section Studienarbeiten/Typostories which needn't essentially suit to the topic of the issue – contributions welcome!\n\nPlease send your suggestions in form of visual material (please prepare screen-pdf) and a short describtion to magazine(at)slanted.de up to and including Sunday, 5th of April 2009. After that date we will spot the received material – then you will be informed per e-mail.\n\nWe are looking forward to your contributions!\n\nPS: The topics for slanted magazine #9 & #10 are fixed already:  \n#9 / principle stencil  \n#10 / black letter!  \nCall for entries follows ...\n\n[www.slanted.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111116/http:/www.slanted.de/ \"www.slanted.de\")  \nmagazine(at)slanted.de\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [slanted\\_8\\_call.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111116/http:/typophile.com/files/slanted_8_call_1.jpg) | 49.66 KB |\n\n",
