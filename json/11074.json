  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nI'm currently trying to set some text in Indesign which contains quote marks. Some of the quote marks are lining flush to the left-hand edge of the text column (the text is set ragged right). Am I correct in thing that these quote marks need to be set outside the text column, and if so, how do I do this in Indesign? Can anybody help!   \n   \nThanks in advance   \n   \nDarren\n\n",
