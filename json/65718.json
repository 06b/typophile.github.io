So either find a free alternative that's really close, or license Gábor Kóthay's original. But don't use stolen fonts.\n\n"

I only meant he may find something out there that is close in feeling and legitimately free. My recommendation is that for $20 he buy the original. \"Knock off\" was a poor choice of words on my part.\n\n"
