Used types have somewhat twitched appearance. As I made earlier an OT feature which does that effect I modified a font (in that case Plantin) to recreate that look.\n\n1. FEA file:  \n@class\\_alt1 contains UC and lc letters, space, comma, etc  \n@class\\_alt2 contains as above, slightly displaced, names with .alt2  \netc up to @class\\_alt10 ( .alt10)\n\n2. I made new glyphs - and copied the references of original glyphs and add the .alt1 to their names  \n3. Again the same with .alt2 names  \netc up to .alt10\n\n4. I moved glyphs of every class slightly up or down  \n`\nfeature calt { # contextual Alternates\nsub @class_alt1 @class_alt1' by @class_alt2;\nsub @class_alt2 @class_alt1' by @class_alt3;\nsub @class_alt3 @class_alt1' by @class_alt4;\nsub @class_alt4 @class_alt1' by @class_alt5;\nsub @class_alt5 @class_alt1' by @class_alt6;\nsub @class_alt6 @class_alt1' by @class_alt7;\nsub @class_alt7 @class_alt1' by @class_alt8;\nsub @class_alt8 @class_alt1' by @class_alt9;\nsub @class_alt9 @class_alt1' by @class_alt10;\nsub @class_alt10 @class_alt1' by @class_alt1;\n} calt;`\n\nAs feature calt is applied, letters (and spaces, commas etc) are substituted and in effect their sequence is:  \nx1, x2, x3, (etc), x10, x1, x2, x3 ...  \nso every next letter belongs to the group moved in slightly different way.  \nBecause font is slightly thinner (and more contrasty) than lead types used I added some black stroke and - to compensate inter letter space - some tracking.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234413im_/http:/typophile.com/files/book_3673.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234413im_/http:/typophile.com/files/idd_5284.jpg)\n\nAdvantage: -calt works almost everywhere  \nDrawback:  \n- in InD tracking about 40 switches off calt (why?!)  \n- when you repeat lines the letters are moved in the same way (doesn't happen frequently in books)\n\nSpecial thanks to Adam Twardoch  \n [1](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234413/http:/typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/10641/#Comment_10641)  \n [2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317234413/http:/sites.twardoch.com/typography/font-tech/gpos-stylistic-sets)\n\n",

However, InDesign's threshold is arbitrary and I've often felt it would be better if it were left to the designer to turn these features off.\n\nAndre\n\n"
