  "content": "I would welcome any opinions. I’m looking at type for an expanded exhibition catalogue featuring contemporary Iraqi book art. There will be several essays—maybe 76 pages or so of largely unillustrated text. Some footnotes, probably to be set as endnotes.\n\nMy thinking is that most faces appropriate for setting medium length texts carry a western baggage that doesn’t add much to the idea of the book. I’ve found a few solutions on my own, but I don’t want to color the discussion yet.\n\nThere are 17 featured artists. Here is a sample cover image of one of the books by Mohammed al-Shammerey.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045451im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/15C_6345.jpg)\n\n [‹ Ok to use Futura Apostrophe?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045451/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27448 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New site ... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045451/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27436 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Not so much an Eastern feel. I don’t think mimicry of Arab script is right on this.\n\nI think the international feel is the direction I’m looking. I don’t want the type bound to a particular period in Western typographic history that has zero resonance with the subject. That rules out most of the pure classics. Some of the very neutral sans faces could work in that they might avoid offending, but they may not be right for the length of the combined texts. The texts (at least the early versions) are fairly politically charged. That makes any playful lightness in a face look comical.\n\nI’ve almost been seduced a few times so far, and have almost settled in. I was looking for someone to shake me up one more time. Thanks for reviving the thread BTW.\n\n"

Or you could take the no-holds-barred approach of using something postmodern / unusual. Then there’s the ’when in doubt, use something Swiss’ approach which usually works for just about anything, though robs it of personality. A neutral position using a neutral typeface from a neutral country. So your choices in this instance would be a typeface from :\n\nSwitzerland  \nSweden  \nFinland  \nAustria  \nMexico  \nIreland\n\nI don’t know whether Liechtenstein, Costa Rica and Turkmenistan have the graphic design scene (or population) necessary to produce fonts for international sale. But the countries listed above do, the first three definitely have active type foundries (Optimo, MAC Rhino, Suomi, Psy-Ops, Fountain...)\n\nPerhaps this is a direction you could try to keep things objective. And good old Helvetica fits this criterion. The Swedish type foundries in particular are prolific.\n\n"
