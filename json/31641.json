  "content": "Hi there,  \nI'm new to this forums. I am currently searching the exact font used on the Calvin Klein logo.  \nI first thought it was Futura, but the C isn't quite right, and the e is more round. Then I thought of Avenir, but the a isn't right, neither is the K. Century Gothic doesn't fit (i, K), and myFont.com's WhatTheFont guessed it was Litera, wich it isn't (look at the e, the i and the K).\n\nSo, do you know what the exact font might be?\n\nThanks in advance :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ck-logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141226010900/http:/typophile.com/files/ck-logo.jpg) | 28.73 KB |\n\n",
