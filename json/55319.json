  "content": "FontBook in Mac OS 10.5 is reporting an improperly structured kern table upon installation of Aviano. I recently overhauled the entire family, including the kerning, and it is now based off of a Multiple Master. All font generated from the master are affected. Class based kerning is used extensively, and I expand kerning upon export. The export expands the kerning to about 1000 pairs. Microsoft Font Validator reports no issues, and Fontlab reports no issues with the structure upon export, and the Kerning Assistance dialog reports no problems. I have filed reports with Fontlab.\n\nIs anyone familiar with this issue? What additional information can I provide to help solve the issue?\n\nThank you for the help,\n\nJDooley\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428155752im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%208_3633.png)\n\n [‹ Aligning the ordmasculine/feminine with sups, numerators, or ordinals?](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428155752/http:/typophile.com/node/55168 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Is it possible? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428155752/http:/typophile.com/node/55141 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "The OpenType specification does not permit the \"kern\" table in PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts, though the Apple specification does. But this obviously is not the problem since FontBook permits some OTF fonts with a \"kern\" table but chokes on others.\n\nFontBook has been known for false-flagging many situations, and this seems like one of them.\n\nI believe this is an Apple problem, not a problem with your font. You might want to install the Apple FontTools from  \n [http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/Fonttools/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428155752/http:/developer.apple.com/textfonts/Fonttools/ \"http://developer.apple.com/textfonts/Fonttools/\")  \nand check your font with ftxvalidator, and see what it reports.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

I doubt that my font is the only one effected.\n\nThanks again,\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428155752/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n"
