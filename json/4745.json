So there will be a focus on content for a younger crowd (18-28) and an older crowd with children who are in school.   \n   \nThe paper is being introduced to fill a gap in the reporting from the local metro daily which doesn't have the ability to cover the area as well as a small community paper will.   \n   \nThanks,   \nA\n\n"

      "content": "Questions are great... It is going to be a mix. The main portion of the paper is going to be more towards the Joe Friday (Just the facts) approach. At times almost an upbeat approach to presenting news since it is a community paper. There will obviously be a more hip section for the paper since it is so close to a college campus. The paper also is venturing to be a watch-dog for the community (as I think most papers should do anyway).   \n   \nHope that clarifies the tone a little better.   \n   \nThanks,   \nA\n\n"

      "content": "Adam look at a Foundry rather than a specific face. Go over to Font Bureau, they create alot of text faces for newspapers and magazines. You might want to use one font for the front section and another for the hip section. I like FB Village quite alot, readable with some interesting characters. FB Miller is nice too. For the funkier section you might use a san serif face like FB Hermes or FB Benton Gothic. What ever you choose they all have a wide range of weights.\n\n"
