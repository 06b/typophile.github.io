  "content": "Hi,  \nI am relatively new to InDesign and I have always hand drawn underlines for forms etc.  \nI know there would be a much more efficient and simple way of doing this, I just don't  \nknow what to search for in help? Is it in paragraph rules, do you have to make a table?\n\nAny help with this would be greatly appreciated. Attached is a screen shot of a form  \nthat I am doing at the moment (pretty rough).\n\nTHANKS\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215060555im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Form_4019.png)\n\n",
