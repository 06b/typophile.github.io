  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI am back with another mystery (for me anyway). Thank you again to those that have helped me previously.\n\nSouthwest Airlines uses this Script font on the nose of several aircraft that carry special paint schemes.\n\nI have tried \"El Greco\", \"Florens\" and \"Calligraphy\" by Cassidy & Greene. I do not think it is \"Flourish\" by Judith Suttcliffe from the Cassidy & Green site, but I can no longer download that font to test it either way. Here is an example:\n\n[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/windchill/cali\\_one.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120121081521/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/windchill/cali_one.jpg \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v319/windchill/cali\\_one.jpg\")\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBrian\n\n",

I don't pretend to know all the techniques used, but it seems like some method might be used to transfer an outline that was font-based on to the fuselage, so that the painter can reproduce logotype lettering as exactly as possible. Airlines like Alaska, or Horizon Air, that use script logo types, must have a way to make sure the lettering is duplicated exactly.\n\nDo we have anyone here with experience about commercial airline lettering?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

A 'vinyl frisket' was a new term for me, but Google searches quickly helped understand that it's like an adhesive stencil -- just lift out the letters cut from the vinyl where you want the paint, and then peel away the rest of the vinyl after the paint dries. Apparently a plotter-like gadget can be used to make the frisket rolls, and even cut the letters (?)\n\nNow, back to the question of what font was used -- I'm still of the opinion that this was a custom font, or custom lettering used to make the frisket masters.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "@Mike,\n\nThe signmaker I use a lot to produce by designs still works this way when outdoor lettering has to withstand the elements for a long time. They cut the stencils on the same machine used for vinyl lettering, just reversed, and then — after applying the vinyl on the substrate — paint in the exposed areas, mostly using rollers... Multiple colour jobs are just repeat exercises (wait until paint is dried, apply different stencil/frisket, paint, etc.).\n\nA very long time ago I used to illustrate with airbrush — using friskets all the time (cut by hand, of course). The (self adhesive) material itself was called Frisket (still have some Letraset branded lying around). Its guess its one of those cases where a brand name became generic (like aspirin).\n\nBTW The oldfashioned way to work was by using stencils cut out of paper, weighing it down on the illustration board with whatever was at hand (eg pieces of leading from a print shop ; )). Soft edges could be created by gently pulling up the edges. Those were the days…\n\n@Brian: Dont despair, I think someone will come with an answer to your question!\n\n"

I've even posted on Boeing 737 maintenance forums (figuring somebody from WN would read them), but no joy.\n\nIf ANYONE can come up with anything, I'd be eternally grateful. Even if I could get good tight closeup photos of the lettering, I could draw it up in Adobe Illustrator, and would be happy to share it with anyone who needs it.\n\nThanks!\n\nButch\n\n"
