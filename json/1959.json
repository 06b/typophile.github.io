I came across this website which looks like the people know their stuff, so i thought I'd try. I only have ONE letter unfortunately. i guessed Centaur, but he said it was wrong. o yea, he wants the designer too. thanks for any help. ![font](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123230im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19868.jpg)\n\n",
