      "content": "To me it looks like a metal type version of Bembo. The 'r' is characteristic and different from Garamond, which is what I first thought this might be. The very low stem above the crossbar of the 't' also seems like Bembo, but I can see from Monotype's digital version, these features are not identical. I don't think it's a digital font, even though it looks similar to Adobe Garamond. I will stay with Bembo, although I recognize that Monotype's digital Bembo has a number of differences.\n\n"

These typefaces don't exist anymore, except at the [Plantin Museum in Antwerp](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124011/http:/www.vandekerckhove-devos.be/plantin/index.html).   \n   \nThere are some modern interpretations of them. The best known is Matthew Carter's [Galliard](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124011/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-galliard/).\n\n"
