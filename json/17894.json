I can’t say I’m entirely happy with the look of it.\n\nBut sometimes one designs a typeface and releases it, then it’s in use in some ad campaign or other, and you think ’OH MY GOD! - Did I do THAT?’ (I’m talking about Ryanair/Houschka.)\n\nIt might be overused in the UK - Huh? Where? I’ve hardly seen it anywhere.  \nBut talking of overuse - Has anyone seen Brazilian Cosmo - it’s the only typeface in the whole magazine. Too much!\n\nThanks for the praise Yves!\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

As far as your new stuff goes I understand. I’ve been wanting to design a typeface for ages, and I’ve got probably 50 pages of sketches and ideas, but my graphic design work is paying the bills, so it has to wait I guess...\n\n"
