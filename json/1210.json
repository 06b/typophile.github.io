      "content": "from the fontlab community site:   \n   \nPatric King and Lune have provided the following tips how to seamlessly copy-paste your outlines between FontLab and Illustrator. The described procedure works on Mac OS X 10.2.4 with Illustrator 10.0.3 and FontLab 4.5.1, but should also apply to other versions.   \n   \n1. In FontLab, check \"Do not reescale EPS...\" in the FontLab Preferences / General.   \n   \n2. In Illustrator, change the units to points: 1 point will be equal to 1 unit in FontLab.   \n   \n3. Make a box with 1000x500 points in Illustrator, add the baseline, x-height lines and whatever you want, make your drawing.   \n   \n4. Fill or stroke everything with something. FontLab won't import paths with no fill/no line.   \n   \n5. Copy in AICB format (you can change this in Illustrator preferences). I don't know if it's necessary, but I have also turned off PDF copy.   \n   \n6. Paste into a glyph window in FontLab. You'll have to actually open the glyph window, which is annoying.   \n   \nYou can now copy/paste between FontLab and Illustrator without re-scaling your outlines. It also works with Photoshop files, it might be useful when you bring bitmap images as background templates. Bon Appetit!\n\n"
