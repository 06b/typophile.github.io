As a South African I've been struggling to find fonts that are \"local\" but not kitch. I was very pleased when I found Lalibela, I think it is quite beautiful:\n\n[Lalibela, a new font family from CyberGraphics](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020025826/http:/www.cybergraphics.bz/Lalibela.html)\n\n",
