      "content": "Mr Larabie, perhaps it is easier to answer your question by describing roughly how OpenType feature export works:  \nFeatures defined in the OpenType Panel and text located in the OpenType Panel's bottom field will be merged into a single feature definition text file. This file serves as input for AFDKO with which FLS5 compiles OT layout tables.  \nIf you have activated the option _Add all glyph classes to OpenType feature definition code_, the Classes Panel's class definitions will be converted into AFDKO syntax and included in this feature definition text file too.  \nNow two problems may occur:  \n_(a)_&nbsp;&nbsp;If a class name is shared by a class defined in the Classes Panel and by a class defined in the OpenType Panel's bottom field, and if the _Add_ option is activated, then AFDKO will find two definitions for the same class in this feature definition text file, use the later definition, and emit a warning. This means: despite of the warning it will compile. You only get in trouble if the content of the identaically named classes differs. Then you may end up with too little or too much kerning. This is similar to what Mr Lozos experienced. In his case, the classes that shared a name were both in the Classes Panel -- the effect is the same though.  \n_(b)_&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no class definitions in the OpenType Panel's bottom field and the _Add_ option is _de_activated (class definitions from the Classes Panel will be ignored), then MakeOTF will complain too -- but this time compilation of OT layout tables will fail. This is the case you describe.\n\n"
