When in doubt, select Trajan.\n\nNow that Trajan Pro is bundled in with Photoshop (and other CS2 and Adobe Production Suite applications) it may be threatened to become even more annoying from over use.

Type, even then, was much quicker to come to market as phototype than the old hot metal predecessor. Many of these faces were redesigns of older styles and brought back (albeit with a bigger x-height and tighter spacing). The faces you say \"are never heard of again\" will be the next decades \"retro\" and hot again.  \nThe good stuff (and some not so good) will come back as new. I remember when Tiffany lamps were being junked. Then they were replaced by 50s clunk. Then they came back as elegant antiques. Then the 50s clunk comes back as cool retro.
