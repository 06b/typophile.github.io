  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI have been searching on the internet for examples or sets of victorian, edwardian, turn of the century i.e vintage fonts. Does anyone here know where I could find some, I don't even mind if it is just examples of typeface or book covers (actually that would be interesting!) , I don't need to download it, have a set of typefaces to work with, I just need a source of examples/a few words as I can easily copy it by hand from the computer screen and make up the rest of the lettering. Any ideas?\n\n",

      "content": "Letterhead Fonts always have AWESOME fonts! Thats the best site for buying unique fonts, at least that I know of...besides that I suggest you scour the internet for old book covers/posters/whatever from the Victorian era or hit the library. You can also search for type specimen books from that era.  \nHope this helps.\n\nJonE.\n\n"

      "content": "Keep in mind that many of Letterhead's fonts are contemporary American sign painter interpretations of Victorian style. They are very expressive, but not necessarily the most authentic source. I would look at books published during the era you're interested in for a more accurate representation of what was going on at the time. Like Jon said: time for a trip to the library!\n\n"
