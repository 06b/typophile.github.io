But while I do find the odd ff lig, st lig and ct lig in the examples of type in use, the specimen sheets themselves don’t show them.\n\nDo they show up in a supplement edition, or a specific year’s catalog?\n\nWhere should I be looking do you suppose?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Identity this Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302163900/http:/typophile.com/node/42591 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Movable Type Question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080302163900/http:/typophile.com/node/42485 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Hmmmm.\n\nMy goodness! - but that font Lightline sure is pretty! It even reads well - far better than helvetica I would say, and interestingly it shares a surprising number of formal characteristics with it.\n\n"
