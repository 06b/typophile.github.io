It just doesn't have the right \"feel\" somehow though as a typeface.\n\nAs kind of a shot in the dark, I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions of any other typefaces of similar size and weight I might look into. Am sort of wide-open in terms of going with something classic or modern at this point--the poster could go in either direction.\n\nHere's a link to this font:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/bold-condensed/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110413081024/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/bold-condensed/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aurora/bold-condensed/\")\n\n",
