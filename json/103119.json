In which case we would need such an ornament font, and I don't think you are interested in commissioning such pi/ornament fonts since Google wants and aims to make the web more \"readable\" than nicer. After all , an aldus leaf means for Google's crawling nothing, right?\n\n\\* Such a f\\*cking forum style! The year is 2013, the forum is all about typography, the theme is readability, but there is not even a simple quoting mechanism and one still must expressively quote like \"Jonny said:\"!\n\n"
