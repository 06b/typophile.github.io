I thought I was being clever with the black/white space, and it gave me an opportunity to use Garamond Premier Pro.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022032927im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wedding-guide_5667.jpg)\n\nHere's the catch:  \nEvery <cite>guy</cite> who looked at it thought that it was ok. Cool even. But the design was UNIVERSALLY LOATHED by <cite>every woman</cite> who caught sight of it.\n\nWe have a freelancer who also happens to be a wedding photographer, and she shot it down immediately. She said it was not \"feminine\" enough.\n\nARGH! That's what I thought I was making!\n\nWhat do you think? How do you make something (more) feminine?\n\n",

The image as a whole is bottom heavy.\n\nMagazines, sure. (What? You dont have a library within a few miles?)
