  "content": "Hello.  \nI am currently half way through my honours in Graphic Design.  \nAfter my graduation, I need to do another 1year course in design related area.\n\nI was doing some research and looking at some 1year web-design courses, and having some trouble finding a programme to suit me (ideally want some interactive flash with a big emphasis on Advanced Action Script) So i started thinking what else I would like to do.\n\nThough I very much doubt there is a professional type design course, I thought I’d ask here to make sure. So if anyone knows of a type design programme in Melbourne, please let me know.\n\nAlternatively if per chance any of you have suggestions about a good 1year flash/interactive design course, that would be good also.\n\nthanks,\n\nVictor\n\n [‹ Spread of Printing in Europe 1450-1550](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821164917/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42472 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Subject for a paper ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821164917/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42833 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
