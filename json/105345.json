      "content": "That kind of serifs are normally called _flare_ serifs or _lapidary_ serifs. If the curves would be straight and the forms looks like a triangle, one might call them _wedge_ serifs. Triangularity usually is not described with slanted. Slanted is normally used for letters, words or fonts being skewed ‘electronically’ i.e. by means of simple software modification and without any optical compensation.\n\n"
