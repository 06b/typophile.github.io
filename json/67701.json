  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI was wondering if there are any resources available for CorelDraw users trying to learn Adobe Illustrator. Google has proven fruitless, as it just returns a list of debates about the merits of both pieces of software. I don't care which one is better - I use Draw and want to learn Illustrator too in case I need to use it in the future.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to find a chart along the lines of \"INSTEAD OF THIS -\\> DO THIS\". Quick and simple.\n\n- Lex\n\n",

Plus, every time I want to use advanced OpenType features, I have to start up Illy, export the text, then import it back into Corel.\n\nIgor - Thanks for the suggestion. I guess I should have posted there after I couldn't find anything :-)\n\n- Lex\n\n"
