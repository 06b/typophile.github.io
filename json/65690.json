I searched Typophile for a while and found nothing. Maybe because there's nothing we can do about it... But it's still freaky enough to be interesting.\n\n--\n\nOn the Wii you can read live news stories. Super. You can zoom the text in and out. Super. When you change the zoom level the words fly to their new positions - each word separately! Super freaky. Should I put up a video of it on Flickr, or has everybody already seen it?\n\nAnd does this mean the Wii text renderer (who made it BTW?) makes a \"sprite\" out of each word and then moves them all around, resizing them along the way?! The thing is, why go to the trouble? I guess it just makes it more game-like. Wow.\n\nhhp\n\n",

The motion paths are pretty funky – when the size is decreased, it looks like the bits that reflow to the first line come from wayyy below. Seems pretty confusing to me, but then I'm so not the target audience for this sort of thing.\n\n"
