  "content": "Hi\n\nI was wanting some help to identify the font used in Dazed and Confused. It is used on all headers (not mast head) for example in the visual \"the independent state of kate\".\n\nI have checked it against Chevin and there are slight differences with the n. Would be great for help.\n\nCheers\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [0069901.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125225746/http:/typophile.com/files/0069901.jpg) | 257.79 KB |\n\n",
