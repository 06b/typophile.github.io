  "content": "Hello Typophile,\n\nI stumbled onto this forum today, many sharp minds and eyes here it seems...  \nI released some work recently, working under the name Adam Tension. Sort of an exhibit, with a variety of work for a variety of reasons.\n\n[http://www.leftrightoutput.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013233404/http:/www.leftrightoutput.com/ \"http://www.leftrightoutput.com\")\n\nI'd really appreciate some feedback, though this area of the forum doesn't seem to be too busy. It's very heavy with typography, I figure some opinions can be found here.\n\nCheers,  \nClint\n\n",
