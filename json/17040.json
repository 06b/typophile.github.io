Almost hinting at the Deco.\n\nThis is a good thing to my eyes, since a lot of my favorite old movie theatres are from the deco era.\n\nBut this also has a nice contemporary feel to it as well. So I’d recommend adjusting the letters, but just don’t turn them into your generic dot matrix letters.\n\nYou could also play with putting this in a type of relevant frame (i.e. look at old theatre billboards).\n\nAnd make sure you look at this really big. I learned some lessons doing this on a similar logo approach awhile ago. Given, it won’t be that big that often but it may find itself on a billboard or banner someday).\n\n"

It has a unique style and grid to it that will make it stand out from other less well thought out uses of dots.\n\n"

C4 gives me the impression of a roll of film which could work better if the ’shadow/film still on the roll’ had more of a curve on it. The old ticket styles are a bit obvious while not having an outstanding quality to them.  \nTim\n\n"

As is the case, it’s usually the first idea that shines the brightest.\n\nThat said, B3 might be a good way to go depending on how they want to position themselves. That has a very fandango big brand look and feel to it. Whereas A has a more sophisticated unique feel to it. This appeals to me more, but am I your audience group?\n\nI think C1 might have some legs, but I see it working like the Paramount logo or the old Le Monde Cafe logo. Big globe with big ol letters in front of it. Again a nod to the deco.\n\nI agree on the shadowing on those newer attempts, seems a little off to me.\n\n"

It’s cliche, a tad cheesy, but seems absolutely appropriate for the subject matter, and perhaps a bit stronger at small sizes at low resolution (ie, on a web site)\n\nI agree with others that #1 is the best logo in terms of overall aesthetics, concept, etc, but not sure if it’s the most appropriate. If you do use it, I’d restrict it’s use to the reversed form.\n\nAlso, on a tangent, does the world need yet another online movie ticket site? ;o)\n\n"
