  "content": "Thought this might be of interest to history buffs.  \nI recently unearthed several samples sheets (very poor copies of original) from one of Lanston Monotype’s promotional pieces from 1924.\n\nIt’s for _Italian Old Style_ by Frederic W. Goudy, with specimen samples of the Roman and Italic faces, and a [**price sheet**](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/www.acmedigital.net/Aimages/Ital-OS_prices.jpg) for type caster matrices.\n\nThis PDF includes the [**Italian Old Style**](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/www.acmedigital.net/Aimages/ITALIAN_.pdf) cover, Roman & Italic specimens and price sheet.\n\nThe only digitized version I found available is [Monotype Italian Old Style Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=202522) which differs in many respects, sort of sterilized, like they took the _Italian_ out.\n\nThe [Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=202523) is altogether different from Goudy’s version, very much like a standard italic afterthought.\n\nMonotype also added a bold and bold italic weight, though Goudy only designed a Roman and Italic.\n\nIt seems that [The Lanston Type Company](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/www.lanstontype.com/Giampa/Goudy-Type-Face-List.html) has Italian Old Style on their list of Goudy designs to digitize in the future... let’s hope they do.\n\n—————————————————————————————  \nYes, I’m old, but so what!\n\n [‹ …and you guys and dolls thought you knew about type](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/typophile.com/node/13924 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [strange and unusual ligatures ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011015855/http:/typophile.com/node/13966 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
