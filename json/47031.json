Free is a big part of its appeal, but the attention it attracts, even when people don’t know what it costs shows that they like the style of it. Whether they _should_ like it is a matter of opinion, but it is eye-catching, graceful and different, and sometimes that’s what the people want.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Just because I know the designer, and have an autographed poster of it on my wall, doesn’t mean I think it’s great, but I do know that a lot of people like it as soon as they see it. I have had _many_ ID requests for it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "I’ve seen so many references to Sciptina, and not one that didn’t look awkwardly set. I understand why people are attracted to the large open swashes. They look a lot like what a lettering artist like Rob Lueschke might do. But Rob’s fonts set properly. Scriptina doesn’t.  \nI used to teach calligraphy classes and one of the most common things students do is over emphasis curves and swashes. Subtlety is needed even when there is a lot of eye candy involved. Like many free fonts, Scriptina is an under developed idea.\n\n"
