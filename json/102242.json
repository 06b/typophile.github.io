      "content": "Re: OptiFonts. No, they are not ALL pirated or badly digitized. Iambic is at least not badly digitized. But most of them are, and it's often hard to tell which is which. As for the others (Thank you Fivos for finding and identifying them!) Neither FontBank nor Brendel are known for original designs. In this case, Speedway and OptiIambic both predate Brendel's Concorde.\n\nDeVroye seems to have a handle on the \"original\" as being FontCompany's Inverserif, now available from Infinitype (not sure whether Infinitype is a creator or distributor). However, Inverserif was/is not available in the oblique form.\n\nThe Optifonts link is peculiar - depending on your ISP, you may need to use a proxy. Oddly, it can be accessed via the wayback machine.\n\n- Herb\n\n"
