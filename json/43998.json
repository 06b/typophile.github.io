I stumbled on this ultra bargain software sight that I would question if its legitimate or a scam, possibly piracy. They say they sell so cheaply because they don’t send packaging or disks. I’m skeptical. Anybody have experience with sites like these?\n\n [‹ Calligraphic fonts - recommendations](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704191510/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44036 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Misztótfalusi Kis Miklós' autobiography.
