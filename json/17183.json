I am not talking about new typefaces or anything, but more like someone making chairs out of letterforms or someone doing typography in a non-conventional method. More in the Art realm...\n\nRight now I am gathering names for a possible exhibit on typefaces so any ideas would be welcomed! :) Thanks in advance.\n\n",
