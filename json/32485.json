  "content": "Hi there. This is my first post and I'm nervous! The expertise on this forum is intimidating.\n\nI'm having a problem with the way Trade Gothic Oblique is printing from PDFs I create in InDesign CS. The Oblique is getting an extra slant, but only when I print from the PDF. The extra slant is not visible in the PDF on screen. It does not have the extra slant when I print directly from the ID file to my Epson 4000 (non-Postscript). When I set the Oblique in a Quark 6 doc and create a PDF file, it prints fine. It seems to be a problem only with the PDFs created in ID.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea how to fix this problem? Thanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TradeGothicItalicsTest1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018085344/http:/typophile.com/files/TradeGothicItalicsTest1.pdf) | 560.38 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I suspect is is something to do with fonts that were originally style-linked in suitcases, which is the way things were done in the good old days before OS X.  \nPerhaps new versions of Acrobat do not recognize the suitcase, within which linking was required to cause italicization to happen.  \nBut now, the italicization happens due to other font information, however Acrobat thinks that it hasn't happened, so applies a mechanical slant as well.  \nSame thing for bold...  \nJust a theory.\n\n"
