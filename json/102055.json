  "content": "I'm in a diploma in writing and publishing and am taking a class on letterpress printing. One of our assignments was to clean and identify some type cases. These are two type samples that I can't identify. I've already tried what the font and have looked through a lot of books and have come up with nothing. Similar types will not work in this case as I need to know the exact name of the type. Any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [s002.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819014322/http:/typophile.com/files/s002.jpg) | 353.18 KB |\n| [s003.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819014322/http:/typophile.com/files/s003.jpg) | 668.61 KB |\n\n",
