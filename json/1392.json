  "content": "Hi,   \nthere's this big german medical company called Boehringer Ingelheim. They even have their own corporate font. The problem is, I have no idea, what kind of font this EXACTLY is... I need it for use on a PC, hopefully in EastEuropean (EE) or CentralEuropean (CE) version...   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423035158im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16816.gif)   \n   \nAny idea, what this thing could be? Looks familiar, doesn't it...   \n   \nGentlemen, start your engines.   \n   \nPeter\n\n",

No idea so far. Here is the logotype of the company - it uses a more condensed version of their corporate font. Maybe that could help a bit out...   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423035158im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/16838.gif)\n\n"

Really it seems that little was changed.\n\n"
