  "content": "Hello.\n\nI’m designing my own wedding invitations and am considering Zanzibar for some of the larger text, e.g. our names. We’re doing a jazz/art deco theme with a peacock motif throughout and I like Zanzibar for it’s movement. I’d like to use a font reminiscent of the 1920s era that will be highly legible when letter pressed, probably a sans, (and is not too over the top) for additional information on the invites. Any suggestions on what would compliment Zanzibar best and still get the feel across?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Ornamental/Illustrated Drop Caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20080324020241/http:/typophile.com/node/43337 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Good tilde design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080324020241/http:/typophile.com/node/43305 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Fountain’s Zanzibar is so open, would it be better complimented by the more open style of Verlag or the condensed style, to keep it [Zanzibar] in check so to speak?\n\nthanks again!\n\n"
