What do you think about Rosewood and Chaparral used in conjunction?\n\n[http://vervesix.com/casa/bg\\_myspace.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135710/http:/vervesix.com/casa/bg_myspace.jpg \"http://vervesix.com/casa/bg\\_myspace.jpg\")\n\nDon’t mind the kerning.. had to do it in Photoshop. I’d like to work with the Rosewood serifs more, even make a few ligatures (e.g. the lower adjacent ligatures of the ’IS’ in DISCO). Also, do you find the leading I chose annoying at all? I feel like there are both good and bad things happening where the letters touch...\n\nThanks for any constructive input!  \nCasey\n\n [‹ Most Readable Serif Font on Earth](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135710/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35551 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lucida Grande and Optima for web ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135710/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49924 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
