[Bátorfi Zsolt](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203084210/http:/batorfizsolt.spaces.live.com/default.aspx) posts [this XAML code](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203084210/http:/batorfizsolt.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!78E216F5ABAE195D!119.entry) that you can paste into XAMLPad or better yet Robby Ingebretsen's [Kaxaml](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203084210/http:/kaxaml.com/) and use to see OpenType features at work. The XAML code can be modified and expanded to change or add fonts or features.\n\nYou'll need Windows for this, preferably the 7 beta or Vista, but alternately XP with the .NET 3.0 or 3.5 framework installed.\n\n",
