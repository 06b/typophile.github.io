  "content": "No, seriously. Microsoft Word version 11.3.5 under OS X (Leopard) 10.5.1, is displaying and printing common ligatures (fi, fl, ffl, etc) for OpenType — not AAT — fonts. Not entirely consistently, but like 90% of the time. But it’s not spacing for them. So you get the ligature and then a large gap before the next letter.\n\nI can post screenshots if you don’t believe me, but try it for yourself.\n\nDoes anyone (a) have any idea what’s going on; or (b) know who I should be filing a bug report with?\n\n [‹ how to write login script](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119051058/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40137 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fonts for Visual Basic ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119051058/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40016 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This behavior started with 10.5\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, MS Word uses ATSUI but they cache metrics and alter the glyph advances via the ATSUI low level callbacks. I believe there’s a MS bug already but I’ll search the DB. Looks like TextMate has the same issues. Bottom line is, I don’t think this is a problem with the OT layout engine in Leopard but I’ll double check nevertheless.\n\nDan\n\n"
