On the paper I saw a small circular shaped object and went to flick it out of the way. That’s when I realized it was the end of my finger. I quickly looked at the damage and to my amazement there wasn’t any blood. However, it was perfectly flat and had this very weird sensation when you touched it.\n\nAfterward someone told me that the human body has something like 7 or 8 layers of skin. Instead of admit I was extremely lucky I told everyone it was all talent. ;)\n\nNow, for the not so lucky ’chisel incident’ in college.\n\nI was working on a wooden sculpture in my dorm room and was moments from finishing. A piece of the masterpiece didn’t fit quite right and I was removing the last bit of material. Just then my girlfriend walked in. This was just enough to distract my focus as I proceeded to jam a small chisel about 3/4” into the soft area of my left hand at the base of my thumb.\n\nI looked up to see the shock on her face. The pain didn’t come until I went to pull it out. I nearly passed out. On the advice of some with leveler heads we went to the emergency room where the doctor was shocked I didn’t severe any tendons.\n\nHappy Halloween everyone.\n\n"
