  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nCan you please help me in my search for a couple of Simplified Chinese language fonts called STXiHei and STXiHei BOLD. Apparently they were shipped with some versions of Windows, but am having trouble pinning down a location where they can be purchased.\n\nOne of our customers requires the fonts for their document composition system. PCTT is the desired format.\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nCheers  \nNeil\n\n",
