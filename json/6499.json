      "content": "The catalogue is in English and published by the Argo publishing house in Prague. The ISBN is 80-7203-515-0, I guess it should be available internationally.   \n   \nI visited the exhibition in the [Neues Museum Nürnberg](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110013718/http:/www.nmn.de/). The exhibition there is very nicely done and I enjoyed it very much. I�d say about half of the exhibition deals with the graphic work of Sutnar and the other half displays products designed by him. The only complaint I have about the exhibition in Nürnberg is the guided tour I took -- the guide obviously had not much interest in typography and sometimes even referred to it as \"typology\".\n\n"

I hope that ATypI Prague Conference attendees won't miss an opportunity to watch her talk on Sutnar! She is really an expert in Sutnar's life and work.   \n   \nPavel\n\n"
