The one on the bottom is clearface. They definately have similar characteristics, but the stems are missing and some of the accents are different. Any Ideas?\n\n",

This reminded me of a recent fascinating [thread involving Phil Martin's Agenda](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141852/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21890.html), which was a Clearface Gothic spinoff/enhancement, but I don't think it's the answer to this post.   \n   \nAfter consulting with the Sans Serif ID Guide I came up with [FF Dax](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141852/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdisplay&packagefontid=0&displayfontid=FF.10269.4.13&view=single&searchID=0&searchby=keyword&searchletter=A&searchstr=Dax&totalrecords=105&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1), which I think is your mystery font.\n\n"
