The logo needs to reflect femininity, luxury and taste. But I also want it to have a slight whimsy to it as these are handmade pieces. I’m looking for a delicate, airy typeface (possibly a hand drawn style). I have a sample below.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210163330im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/miette_logo_3833.gif)\n\nIf anyone can suggest any typefaces or move this topic to the correct board, I would be most grateful.\n\n [‹ \"Asymmetrical\" joins on the N?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210163330/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50153 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [LCM Grid? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210163330/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50206 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

However, it would quite interesting to know a bit more about the area where she is going to open this jewellery, the type of customers and jewellery that she is thinking to sell.
