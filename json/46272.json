He also did “Syndor”, but it is also no more than similar. The calligraphic style also made me think of the Zapfs, but Gudrun’s “Nofret” and “Christiana” are only superficially similar.\n\nIf it’s German and pre-digital it may be hard for many of us to locate good samples of typefaces from this country & time. For me, Jaspert is about my only resource for this. Where is Georg?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It was a Stempel typeface from 1957, designed by Martin Hermersdorf. The text says that this “pen-drawn type was used by the Moritz Diesterweg educational publishing house in reading primers”.\n\nI overlooked it before, because it was included in the scripts, and I thought it was an italic face.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

[This closeup](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615181526/http:/www.kghoefer.de/Bilder_Gross/KGHoefer_Schriften/Prima_Schulschrift.jpg) shows “Prima” well enough to prove this is the right type.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

He reworked Koch’s [Offenbacher Schrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615181526/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offenbacher_Schrift), a German Kurrentschrift to be written with the broad-nipped pen. Bavarian schools used this ‘Koch-Hermersdorf-Schrift’ as a secondary script in the 1950s. Hermersdorf also is the author of several books and was a member of the Iserlohner Schreibkreis. As far as I know, he hasn’t designed any typefaces.\n\n"
