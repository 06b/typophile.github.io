      "content": "Hmm. Andrea declares Rodolfo the winner but then Rodolfo challenges his own answer within the allowed hour, but his challenge is based on information provided by Andrea when she was declaring him the winner. Is it any wonder the rules have nothing to say to such convoluted circumstances!   \n   \nI believe the only correct answer to Andrea's question is _From Russia with Love_, since this film predates _Goldfinger_ and is the only one in which the actual titles of the film are projected onto the body of a _dancing_ woman. So Andrea was wrong to declare Rodolfo the winner.   \n   \nAndrea is hereby requested to pose another question, on a different theme, within the next 12 hours. Thank you.\n\n"

I gotta quit smoking ;-)   \n   \nUnfortunately, I can't claim to know much about Greek - my answer came from Donald Anderson's _Calligraphy: the art of written forms_, p. 37, Dover Press. Just good timing really. I happened to be reading it the other day.   \n   \nSo, next question:   \n   \nThere are five (typically used) typographic or punctuation characters in Thai. I suppose some are used more than others. Name the 5 and give their function.   \n   \nCheers.   \n   \nps: I'm not sure if this violates Rule 9? If so, I'll pose a different question.\n\n"
