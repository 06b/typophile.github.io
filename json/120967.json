      "content": "Even deducting the head-serif overshoot, Minion's ascenders are at least 10% longer than its descenders. In Proforma it seems to be less than 5%, but it's there.\n\nIt's hard to nail down how much is enough, because it's not an exact science, and it depends on a number of things. But as a rule the more a font is serious about being read versus looking pretty, the greater the difference should be (up to some limit). I myself prefer ~20%.\n\nHere's my personal guideline of good descender length for a serious text face: when the \"g\" –the most vertically \"needy\" descending letter– starts looking a bit too cramped, you're there. Because that's a good manifestation of the necessary balance of compromises.\n\nhhp\n\n"
