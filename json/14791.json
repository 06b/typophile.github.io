The collection features designs by talented yet relatively unknown typographers, as well as typefaces by graphic designers better known for their other creative work. One of the strengths of Umbrella is Veer's ability to bring these deserving faces to a very wide audience, both through promotion in Veer catalogs and availability from the Veer web site.\n\n[http://www.veer.com/umbrella/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204225335/http:/www.veer.com/umbrella/)\n\n",
