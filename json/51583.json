      "content": "Logofive.html - absolutely not liking - too much exercise/gym/athletics/dance feeling to it. Consider the abstract human concept a dead end.\n\nLogofour.html - there's something nice about the simplicity of these approaches - they're straight-forward, nothing too dramatic, and they would help the audience focus more on your work/portfolio. Not sure about 9 & 10 - just a tad too faddish and for some reason I keep thinking of the Phillies (American baseball team). Also the fact you had to explain the concept suggests that it's probably not the strongest. I think 8 is probably the best from this group - straightforward, simple, and nice.\n\nLogothree.html looks like logofour.html and so I have no comment.\n\nLogotwo.html - uh...no. Too cliche. Also you overuse the shutter imagery by placing it on absolutely every single \"o\".\n\nLogo.html - stay away from color until you've nailed the concept. I know I've seen the brush/shutter concept used before so its not new and you're not really innovating here, so stay away from it as it's a bit old and cliche.\n\nThat's my 2 cents. Hope it helps.\n\n"
