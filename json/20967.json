I think one (of the hundreds) of reasons that we’ve been mediocre (at best) is that we’re missing Neville, he understands and links up really well with Beckham, is a solid defender (not so prone to mistakes as Rio), and has the longest throw-in range I’ve seen. Plus Hargreaves can then play in central midfield where he plays for Bayern, he’s playing out of position at right back (and put Carrick back on the bench).\n\nRight, got that off my chest, I’m off for a spot of Robot Dancing!\n\nSi\n\nP.S.
