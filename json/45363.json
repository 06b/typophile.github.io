I got into an argument with an author who kept asking me for acrobat files. I sent her pdfs, for some reason she couldn’t open them (I downsaved them to like v4) and she’d email me again asking for the acrobat file.\n\nThat said, Quark has entered the vernacular as the name for that application.

I learned to write a little program that drew a happy face on the monitor. When I was 13, Dad got an Apple IIe, but I think I fell in love with Rick Springfield that year and the computer lost it’s appeal.\n\n"
