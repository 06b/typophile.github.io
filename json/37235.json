Because cyrillic is not familiar to me I would very much appreciate some input on this. Spacing and kerning still need to be done...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Anivers\\_cyrillic.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013144254/http:/typophile.com/files/Anivers_cyrillic.pdf) | 374.55 KB |\n| [Anivers\\_cyrillic\\_2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013144254/http:/typophile.com/files/Anivers_cyrillic_2.pdf) | 374.6 KB |\n| [Anivers\\_cyrillic\\_3.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013144254/http:/typophile.com/files/Anivers_cyrillic_3.pdf) | 14.24 KB |\n| [Anivers\\_cyrillic\\_4.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013144254/http:/typophile.com/files/Anivers_cyrillic_4.pdf) | 14.32 KB |\n| [Anivers\\_cyrillic\\_5.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013144254/http:/typophile.com/files/Anivers_cyrillic_5.pdf) | 16.91 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I don't think this set complements your original style of Anivers. It has some poetic strokes in it. Basically only letters that are the same in both alphabest hold that. All the others are rather much more geometric. A tweak here an there and I think it could be a nice complement to your Roman set.\n\n"

I think you're right, but because many lc glyphs are based on uppercase shapes I find it difficult to let cyrillic complement the Roman set. Above the glyphs I've adapted. (The 2nd pdf is in the openings post... I don't know how to attach a pdf to this comment...)\n\n"

I guess you should stay just as much in the box as you did with your Roman set which is quite geometric bust still a little bit humanist.\n\nI like your latest change. Especially the changes on the upper case.\n\n"

      "content": "very nice, voobshche!  \na couple concerns:  \nthe body of the Ф is nice and large, but the main stroke endings (top and bottom) are likely to get lost at smaller sizes. this stroke can actually overshoot the cap height line and the baseline and will generally improve the appearance of this glyph.  \nthe arms on ЖКжк seem splayed a bit too much to me. if the diagonals could be a bit more upright, i think these glyphs would look better. the ж looks a bit extra wide in the lower case, but i seem to always make mine too narrow, so it might be just right.  \nthe upper bowl on the я could be a bit larger.\n\n"

I think you should entirely redesign the relation between the lower legs and the top parts in ж, я and к (both UC and lc).\n\nI think л and д are not a bit better, though still not balanced enough. The \"shelf\" in д is still too short — it realy needs to be visible in small sizes. The LEFT edge of the right tooth in д should be located slightly to the RIGHT of the RIGHT edge of the right stem of д. In other words, the right tooth of д should be clearly off limits of the right stem of that letter.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
