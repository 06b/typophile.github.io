Alas, with him went all the information (color codes, fonts, etc) so i'm in a bit of a pickle.  \nCan anyone recognize this font?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823073458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled_5344.png)\n  \nFrom what i've heard it is \"certainly a default font\" but so far looking through my system fonts haven't helped much.\n\nThanks\n\n",
