  "content": "hi all,\n\ni'm trying to target mac web users with helvetica neue, and pc users with arial in a new web property i'm building.\n\nhowever, i'm having trouble calling out helvetica neue's extended family members like light or ultralight. the only way i can mess with the glyph weight is via css' generic tags, which only modify helvetica neue regular.\n\ncan anyone verify that targeting fonts in extended families like this is possible via html/css? and if so, how?\n\nthanks!\n\n",
