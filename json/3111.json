I'd just go with your first setting, if that's all you'll use the smallcaps for. But if you're going to use a lot of smallcaps in text, do go for the wider style, assuming you can match the weight better - since you have the Pro, you could try using a larger optical cut of the font, which will be slightly lighter.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I don't believe Myriad has an optical axis, and if there is an adjustment for optical scaling in the Pro version, I've not found it. To date, these are the only places I've used small caps in this project. I'm a bit apprehensive, as the further I stray from the stock font, the more likely at some point it will come back and bite me. That said, I take note of small things in typography, and try my best to do it right.\n\n"
