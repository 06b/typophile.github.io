  "content": "Hey guys,  \nI'd like to ask for some input. I'm designing the cover of an indie mag and have gone with Kursivschrift for the masthead. So I've put it to the paper size as it's in the jpg attached, basically just the font type for now. I'd like to know if the spacings between the letters are alright, or basically any input that you guys might have.\n\nThe mag is targeted for women aged 20-35, into the indie fashion and arts scene. Keywords that may describe are feminine, whimsical, pastel, artsy, illustrative.\n\nI appreciate any thoughts on it. Thanks so much in advance.\n\nRiz\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Cover test.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014013434/http:/typophile.com/files/Cover%20test.jpg) | 69.44 KB |\n\n",

The lower case 's' also looks attractive, but I find that it makes the overall visual less strong. I think I would stick to a higher case 'S' and decide between serif or sans. What do you think?\n\n"

However without a tall cap \"S\" the heights of \"t\" and \"el\" become more sensitive; I might make them [optically] equal.\n\nThe cupped terminals should be sheared flat (possibly at an angle, but still flat); the cupping there is actually intended for lo-fi rendering (it keeps the ends sharp-looking).\n\nThe \"t\" isn't asserting itself enough; I'm not sure how to improve it though.\n\nThe \"yl\" gap should be increased.\n\nThe subhead font: None of the fonts you've tried so far do it for me. I think it should either be a dark, contrasty sans, or a wide monoline.

So then I went to try several other types for the sub. The first is the same as previous, for comparisons sake. Second is a little playful perhaps to better suggest \"indie style\". Third would be to try wide monoline in all caps. Fourth is the same as first, trying in all caps.\n\nThe mag's text is to be primarily [Lido STF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014013434/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lido-stf/) by Storm.
