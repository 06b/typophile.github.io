A font can be sub-licensed twice before its sold on the retail market, giving the designer a smaller share of the retail price.\n\nThe [FontFont contract](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122202315/http:/www.fontfont.com/about/become.ep) is more fair in that regard.

There should be a \"student\" price on each and every type in the world, such as 5 or 10 bucks, the same thing which is happening with softwares. A student can never afford most of the good, modern, independent types, and that's a pity, he needs a lot of them to practice, so he has to steal them, everybody knows that. Once he gets pro, once he has a deal with a customer, he then buys the license, and everybody is happy.

This is not a problem for many in the font business at all. The problems are the nebulous questions around the lower, student price:\n\n1. Do you really think that lowering font prices to $5 or even $1 would stop, or significantly reduce, student font piracy? I mean, if students have no money, then they have no money. You can't afford $5 licenses without money. If students feel \"entitled\" to free software apps and fonts—which many do—pricing will not change their habits.\n\n2. Does the license expire once the student is no longer a student? I have purchased some academic software licenses were this was the case, and some were it wasn't. If a font's license expires along with student status, there is no way to control the actions afterwards… people probably won't delete the files and buy new, non-student licenses for all the fonts they got as students. Maybe for the few they like best. Ideally, they'd stop using all of the fonts they don't upgrade, but this requires a lot of trust.\n\n"

Here are our stumbling blocks:\n\n\\> _I’m talking about students who have been awakened to the beautiful art of typography, students who met typographers, students who know that there is a man behind each type_\n\nThese students are not the problem. If a student gets this interested in type, he or she is already almost, if not already, part of the choir we are preaching to. Also, when these students e-mail the foundry in question, or the designer, they may be able to work out an agreement. I know many big foundries and small designers who give fonts to students for specific projects. But the contact has to be initiated here by the student, and there has to be a discussion. This creates a small rapport and trust, too. I love getting e-mails from dedicated students, and always do my best to help. I can't always give them what they are asking for, but a solution is often available once I understand what they or their professors really need.\n\nA student font license would not be made for this group, but for the much bigger block of \"all-the-other-students-in-the-world-who-use-fonts.\" This is a very different group of people. They don't meet the criteria you discuss above. Nevertheless, they are students, and I do think that they should be met halfway, as long as it remains doable. It unfortunately isn't something that is doable for everyone.\n\n\\> _not to make a “student” license, but a “non commercial” license. Don’t you think it would be great if some guy at home uses, for 5 dollars, a type such as Fedra or FF Meta Serif on an invitation for his sister’s wedding_\n\nActually, many of my colleagues and I really do not like this idea at all. The problem is that \"non commercial users\" are really difficult to define. One can assume that quite many of the design students will become real professional designers in the future. Maybe more will than won't. OK. But many people who \"fall in love with type\" in the \"adult\" world might decide to become DTP professionals, or something similar. Who knows? Then they'd need font upgrades. Would they buys them? I don't know. This requires some more thought… Also, some designers might buy fonts for non commercial purposes, too… like their sister's wedding invite or such. Moreover, many of my customers who I'd call \"non-professional\" might actually think of themselves as professionals. This isn't for me to decide, but for them! It is their identity… I can't determine it for them.\n\n"

There are plenty of students who would honor the student liscence but enough would just assume after graduation that they can use the type in a commercial way and just \"forget\" to pay the also underpaid type designer. Money will flow to pirates, not to type designers. David, it is easy to think of type designers as big foundries like Adobe and Linotype thereby assuming they are all huge corporations with piles of money but this is not the case. Most type designers live a quite modest life and work out of a small corner of their home or apartment. They don't have financial support from their parents as students do and they have children of their own to support and send through college. How would you feel if type designers asked design students to send them half the money they spend on beer so that they may make beautiful type so that beauty could rule and happiness could conquer all? The type designers would then promise to send back half the beer money just as soon as the new types they designed had made large sums of money for them but of course there would be no way to verify this and the students would just have to assume that the flow of happiness caused honesty to flow as well.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The system I proposed has nothing to do with students getting access to files, _because they already have access to the files_. They can download everything Monotype, Adobe, Fontshop or almost anyone else sells in less time than you could ship them a legit collection on CD. What I am suggesting is to try monetizing a market that right now isn’t producing much income at all by selling one-time licenses. Sure the system would be a pain in the ass. Sure it will be abused. But unlike the current system—offering a few discount bundles and a lot of indignation—at least my proposal might generate some revenue and build a direct connection between the type industry and its next generation of customers.\n\n<cite>One thing about a low price for a student is that it will teach the foolish student that type is not valuable.</cite>\n\nThat’s absurd. Students don’t think less of the software and hardware from companies like Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Epson and Autodesk because they offer huge student discounts. The concept of a student discount really isn’t that complicated; anyone stupid enough to misunderstand student pricing as representative of open-market value is uncommonly stupid and not worth working into a business strategy.\n\n"

Doesn't necessary apply to me, or a lot of other designers. But it does apply to some typeface designers!\n\n"

But I believe that there are a lot of people who aren’t professional designers and have very different needs in regards to fonts than designers do. To some extent Linotype has addressed this by selling individual fonts as tiered Opentype offerings at price points that scale upwards with features—a model I very much appreciate. I believe that there are a lot of different design and financial situations that keep users from purchasing fonts under the one-price-fits-all models, and that foundries might just bring in a whole lot of new customers by offering more licensing models.\n\nUnfortunately all my scenarios are just as hypothetical as yours—after all, I don’t have thousands of fonts on offer to play around with.\n\n"

I doubt that is a profitable market for foundries to chase. If there were to be a multi-tiered structure for font pricing, I'd rather see it have to do more with use. I.e. an individual designer or small studio who needs a font to design a logo for a neighborhood bakery vs. an agency that is licensing a font to use for a corporate identity. Perhaps this is something that should be reflected in the EULA rather than the pricing. I don't know.\n\n"

I have hundreds of fonts that I offer for sale.\n\nYou can get my fonts for as little as $4.95 or as much as $124 for a single weight of a font.\n\nThe main difference in the price is usually the license that comes with it. I encourage and empower casual designers and give them a chance to test-drive my fonts by making them available at a very reasonable price. This low-cost option is called a \"Personal Use License\" and restricts what you can and can't do with a font. Sometimes these budget fonts are only available in TrueType format.\n\nI also sell my fonts to big corporations. When they buy a font, they like to be able to do whatever they want with it, so they're comfortable paying a bit more for a less-restrictive license. They also like Post-Script and OpenType. For them I offer a more expensive \"Commercial Use License\".\n\nOther distributors of mine have their own licenses that they bundle with my fonts, and then sell them at a different price, usually somewhere in between $4.95 and $124.\n\n(All these prices are based on a basic 5-user license; I'll try not to get into the murkier waters of multi-user licensing or freefonts in this post.)\n\nAll these licenses have different wordings, and it may be confusing. But the reality of it is that they all sell. That's how my small business survives. I offer my fonts through many distributors at many different prices, because this is how I can reach the largest and most diverse group of designers. Because I want lots of people to use my fonts. It's only when people see other designers using fonts that they can really appreciate a good type design. So I try to get lots of copies of my fonts out there and in use, under whatever name at whatever price it takes to make the sale.\n\nThe best deals are usually at my personal website, where sometimes I have crazy sales and sell fonts for as little as $2.95. But that only happens once in a while.\n\nOne of my favorite sales tools is the split-license option I use for my fonts for sale at MyFonts.com:  \nhttp://www.myfonts.com/PurchaseOptions?familyid=75616&id[]=154232\n\nThere you'll see the exact same font, in different formats, with different licenses, at different prices. I've never really promoted this option, because I don't want to confuse people with licensing talk. But when people see different licenses for sale at different prices, they can pretty easily determine which one is right for them and purchase accordingly.\n\nI sell many more Personal Use licenses than I sell Commercial Licenses. But I make more money from the Commercial Licenses because the big companies can pay more.\n\nAnd that helps offset my costs. So I can make my fonts available to individual users and casual font enthusiasts at a lower cost.\n\nAin't life grand?\n\n-chank\n\n-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nChank Co [http://www.chank.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122202315/http:/www.chank.com/ \"http://www.chank.com\")  \nPO Box 580736  \nMinneapolis, MN 55458 • USA\n\n-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\n"

Woo hoo!\n\nFreelance graphic designers can buy the Personal Use License for their internal design work and sketches they make for their clients. Then, once the client approves the design, the designer can send them to MyFonts to buy the Commercial Use License for themselves. Or sometimes a designer will buy the Commercial Use license on the client's behalf.\n\nAnd it's pretty clear which use is which. If it's a freelancer who doesn't even know if the font is gonna be used or not, then he or she should be using the cheaper Personal Use version. If it's a company who decides to use it for marketing, packaging or the web, then they know they need to get the Commercial Use version.\n\nIf it's student work, it's Personal Use. If it's a logo for a new small business, it's a Commercial Use.\n\nPeople are smarter than most people give them credit for. They will buy the appropriate license for their intended use if given an affordable opportunity to do so.\n\nI believe offering low-cost fonts for casual designer discourages piracy. I personally think my fonts are pirated less because I so readily make them available in a variety of venues. If I were elitist and were to charge more to sell my fonts to a more elite group, I would be more a target of font pirates. But since I'm \"keepin' it real\", people rarely deliberately pirate my fonts.\n\nI think the reason more foundries don't employ a multi-tiered licensing system is that it's just too complicated and confusing. And it takes a lot of time, energy and money to lawyers to write multiple End-User-Licenses. It's kind of a pain. Most font designers would rather make fonts than spend time re-writing EULAs. I'm an anomalie.\n\nBut the way MyFonts does it is clean and easy for the end user (the font shopper). Theoretically a foundry can write any number of licenses and attach them to a variety of prices for an infinite number of SKUs. It's the clumsiness of shopping interface that makes it impractical.\n\nRemember the first rule of marketing: Keep it simple, stupid.\n\n-chank\n\n"
