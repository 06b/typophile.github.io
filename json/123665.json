  "content": "In a thread too old to reply to, I saw this by Miss Tiffany:\n\n<cite>What do you mean by Garamond is too French to be universal? Is Univers too Swiss to be universal too?</cite>\n\nThat's a good question, and I didn't see a good answer, or even the standard answer, in the thread. Hrant did note that he thought of Helvetica as a 20th century typeface, not a particularly Swiss one.\n\nAssuming that a truly Swiss typeface is not necessarily a kind of blackletter that goes well with cuckoo clocks, though, why is Garamond \"French\" if being originally designed in France isn't enough?\n\nOne school of typographic thought, at least, views Garamond as uniquely French and Bodoni as uniquely Italian, and so on, based on those typefaces working well with the letter frequency characteristics of their respective languages, as well as their having a _long_ history of association with them.\n\n",

B. Updike’s praise of Caslon’s intrinsic “Anglo-Saxon  \nvirtues”.\n\n"

It is of course true that a type designer knows his own language best and probably pays more a attention to the local diacritical characters, certain letter combinations and so on. But in general: In scripts like Latin you can put any character beside any other character. There is nothing French, or Italian, or German about that. A good type design should work well in any language and I wouldn’t know that there is anything inherent in the general look of Garamond, Bodoni or Walbaum which make them especially suitable for one language, but not others. And saying the designs inherit certain virtues of a type designer of a certain area in the world where people are said to have certain virtues sounds even more far fetched.\n\nThe second point (association) is all that matters in my opinion. It’s not about the typeface design itself, but about the context in which they are used. These connotations make typefaces British, French and so on.\n\n"

Also, the loose free-form designs Art Nouveau had perhaps wider adoption for French fonts than in most countries. The somewhat similar, but not quite as loose, Jugendstil had influence in Germany and Austria, but my impression is that it was not as strong as Art Nouveau in France. Anyway, it's difficult to see how much credibility can be given to on the fly comments like this.  \nDon\n\n"
