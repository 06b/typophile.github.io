Yagi Link Double was in an old Letraset Catalogue, Dektiv was in the book Homage To The Alphabet.\n\nI assume these fonts were never digitised as I can't find references to them with any of the major type foundries or re-sellers..\n\nso a couple of questions..\n\ndoes anyone know whether the 'Homage To The Alphabet' that was published in 1990 is another edition of the one that was published in 1984? it has a slightly different title so may not be..\n\nanyone got a copy of the 1984 one they want to sell me? or an old Letraset book with Yagi in it?\n\ndoes anyone have any decent size reference for either font?\n\ncheers\n\n",

I purchased it on eBay and it's in excellent condition, but sadly the Y section was removed. I have only the index oneliner of Yagi to show. I can scan Dektiv when I get to the office. Planning to digitize?\n\n"
