  "content": "Hi guys.\n\nThis unknown font is a sans serif with a rounded lower case \"e\" that seems out of place in the small sample I have for identification. The other characters are more typically angular. A newer design from the last eight years?\n\nThanks,  \nJohn\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [15more.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805130641/http:/typophile.com/files/15more.jpg) | 58.32 KB |\n\n",
