I was hoping someone here could recommend a specific typeface and maybe I can convince them to purchase it for the client.\n\nI was thinking something along a friendly typeface something like : The Sans  \nI was considering using something rounded but I do not want to loose the companies serious appeal.\n\nAll help is aprecaited.\n\nThanks\n\nLukas\n\n",
