He moved to [New Zealand](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/New%20Zealand) at age 13 and attended [Wellington Technical College](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Wellington%20Technical%20College). There he concentrated on art and especially lettering. He then went on to work as a commercial artist at [Charles Haines Advertising](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Charles%20Haines%20Advertising) for 12 years before setting up [Churchward International Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Churchward%20International%20Typefaces) in 1969.\n\nHis first breakthrough was not long in coming. [Berthold Fototype](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Berthold%20Fototype) accepted several of his first typefaces for distribution and continued to add Churchward’s new designs to their catalogue for many years. He later went on to sign distribution agreements with [D.Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.Stempel%20AG), [Dr Böger Photosatz GmbH](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dr%20B%C3%B6ger%20Photosatz%20GmbH)/ [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype), [Mecanorma-Polyvroom B.V](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mecanorma-Polyvroom%20B.V) and [Zipatone](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426164941/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Zipatone). Churchward International Typefaces published a handful of original fonts in 1978 being the first and only company in New Zealand to publish original photo-lettering.\n\nNow officially retired, he continues to create unique alphabets and has over 300 original faces to his name.\n\n",
