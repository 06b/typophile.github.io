  "content": "The issue of the correct pronunciation of names and terms has come up periodically on Typophile. Don't worry, this isn't going to be a rehash of those threads, I think.\n\nRecently, I started work on a pet project of mine, [a website](http://web.archive.org/pyogi.pbwiki.com) (almost entirely in Korean for now) to help standardize the spelling of foreign names using the Korean alphabet, hangul. There are certain rules and guidelines to this process set by the National Institute of the Korean Language, but most Koreans are not familiar with them and find them difficult to follow. The website will be a database of sorts with numerous examples of properly applied hangul transcriptions of names.\n\nTranscription of non-Korean names into hangul, a process I call hangulization, is based on the pronunciation of the names in the original language rather than the original spelling. For certain languages including Spanish, Dutch, and Czech, the pronunciation is fairly predictable from the spelling so there are rules for converting the original spelling into hangul. For English, French, and German names however, a knowledge of the original pronunciation is absolutely necessary.\n\nFor fun, I started a list of type designers there, culling names from Typophile and other sources. I kind of went overboard with the list, so it has several hundred names; it is also very Typophile-heavy and not very objective or balanced.\n\nAnyway, I'm confident about the correct hangulization for most of the names, and I e-mailed a couple of people to get the pronunciations of names I wasn't sure about. But there still are a lot of names whose pronunciations need to be verified, and that's why I'm asking for your help.\n\nI would specifically like help with the pronunciation of any of the following names:  \nMarian Bantjes (Canada)  \nGerald Giampa (Canada)  \nPatrick Giasson (Canada)  \nJames Grieshaber (US)  \nMark Jamra (US)  \nGerry Leonidas (Greece) - Is the 'g' in 'Gerry' hard or soft?  \nGérard Mariscalchi (France/Canada)  \nJames Montalbano (US)  \nNeil Summerour (US)  \nKai Oetzbach (Germany)  \nThomas Marecki (Germany) - Is it 'Marekki' or 'Maretski'?  \nJulien Janiszewski (France)  \nGérard Mariscalchi (France/Canada)  \nThierry Puyfoulhoux (France)  \nMagnus Rakeng (Norway) - Is the 'k' pronounced 'k' or 'kj'?\n\nAlso, was I right to hangulize the following names according to the Catalan pronunciations?  \nJoan Barjau (Spain)  \nLaura Meseguer (Spain)  \nJosep Patau (Spain)\n\nIsraeli names are also confusing. Is it Yanek Iontef or Yontef? How is 'Henri Friedlaender' pronounced in Hebrew?\n\n[The full list of type designers can be found here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013125306/http:/pyogi.pbwiki.com/%25EA%25B8%2580%25EA%25BC%25B4-%25EB%2594%2594%25EC%259E%2590%25EC%259D%25B4%25EB%2584%2588) I included my own notation to show approximately what was transcribed into hangul for each of the names, so you can check if I'm using the right pronunciations.\n\nIt's a huge list, so I'm bound to have made a number of mistakes. Let me know if you spot any. Let me know also if you want additions to the list. It will be better if you supply the correct pronunciations as well. Don't be too shy to suggest your own name if you are a published type designer.\n\n",

Everyday usage conflates the two, but I want to maintain a distinction between the two terms since it's a somewhat specialist website.\n\nThe rendering into hangul that I describe is theoretically transcription, since it is meant to be based on the pronunciation, but in practice it's a mixture of transcription and transliteration. The words _romanization_ and _cyrillization_ refer to such broad mixtures of the different modes of rendering words into the Roman alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet respectively, so I'm using the analogous word _hangulization_ to broadly describe any rendering of foreign words into hangul.\n\n<cite>Shouldn’t be a problem with Shinn :-)</cite>\n\nIndeed. 'Nick Shinn' is rendered 닉 신 in Korean, and 신 is actually a Korean surname as well!\n\n"

There are so called 'scientific' ways of doing it, systematically, in the strict definition of 'transliteration', but they are rarely followed. There are a lot of different ways that are practiced, so 'Iontef' and 'Yontef' are the same in Hebrew, and he himself might not romanize it the same way all the time. Basically people today tend to romanize Hebrew roughly as it sounds spoken in modern Hebrew, but 'roughly' the operable word.\n\nHenri Friedlaender was raised in Germany and left because of the Nazis. So his name would I guess be properly pronounced as in German.\n\n"

Koreans can't be depended on to romanize their own names consistently, either, and most do not follow any of the existing systems for transliteration. It would be good to know which spelling Iontef/Yontef himself uses though, if he does favour one over the other.\n\nFrom what I can gather, Henri Friedlaender was born in France and lived in Germany and the Netherlands before going to Israel. He has a French given name and a German surname. I'm going by the Hebrew spelling of his name (הנרי פרידלנדר), which seems to represent 'Hnri Fridlndr' going by a chart of the Hebrew alphabet. I was hoping a typophile could supply the missing vowels in the most common pronunciation of his name in Hebrew. I'm guessing 'Henri Fridlander' or 'Henri Fridlender'.\n\n"

Korean doesn't allow many consonant clusters, so epenthetic vowels (in most cases 'ㅡ' IPA [ɯ]) are inserted, after which the devoicing issue is moot since they are no longer consonant clusters.\n\nIn addition, unlike most European languages, Korean consonant phonemes don't follow the voiced-devoiced distinctions but a three-tier distinction based on aspiration and tenseness. We don't have voiced consonants per se, but some consonants that are voiced in certain environments (and most Koreans won't hear the difference anyway). The idea that voiced and devoiced consonant pairs like 'v' and 'f' can be different realizations of the same underlying sounds is not at all obvious to Koreans.\n\n[edited to add:]\n\nThank you Julien! It's great to hear from the man himself.
