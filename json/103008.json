If you still need something that could quickly do the job, may be having a look to some sections at DaFont would worth a shot: **[Bitmap \\> Pixel, Bitmap](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.dafont.com/bitmap.php)** and [Techno \\> Square](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=301).  \nSome in the same vein: [AnaScript](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.dafont.com/anascript.font) (\"closing\" letters), [SF Square Head Extended](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.dafont.com/sf-square-head.font), [MGS2-Menu](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.ffonts.net/MGS2-Menu.font), [Low Gun Screen Expanded](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.ffonts.net/Low-Gun-Screen-Expanded.font), [Reversion](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/font/T0017/ywft-reversion), [04b-31](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.dafont.com/04b-31.font), [Abstract](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.dafont.com/abstract.font), [Fonts For Flash](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.fontsforflash.com/), [miniml](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055501/http:/www.miniml.com/fonts/index.html)\n\n"
