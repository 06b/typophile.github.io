You’ll find stuff both on type design history and practice depending on what you’re looking for. To get started in type design all-around, there is what some people call “ [the triumvirate](http://web.archive.org/web/20110901172422/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13490)”, which includes:\n\n- <cite>Letters of Credit</cite> by Walter Tracy\n- <cite>Anatomy of a Typeface</cite> by Alexander Lawson\n- <cite>Counterpunch</cite> by Fred Smeijers\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

There's been much debate about the usefulness of this book. I for one found it useful.\n\nTypophile itself is a priceless reference for gleaning pearls of wisdom if you dig around.\n\n"

And, then, to be fair, I must admit that I realized that part of its impressiveness is because it's printed on heavy paper: it is literally a weighty tome. Flipping through it and seeing all the examples of letterforms only reinforces my sense that it will be aterrific reference.\n\nThat said, it does follow a now customary, but annoying habit: a seemingly very good book on design that is itself a bad example of design: tiny, light-faced sans serif main body type.\n\nCan someone please fill me in on the \"much debate about the usefulness of this book\"?\n\nStephen Tiano  \nBook Designer, Page Compositor & Layout Artist\n\n"

The best examples of the latter are \"Letters of Credit\" by Walter Tracy and the [Briem web site](http://web.archive.org/web/20110901172422/http:/briem.ismennt.is/).\n\nStill, the comparisons are done well and well displayed, so it is a pleasure to read, and helpful. The bottom line is that the book is valuable, and does something that you won't find elsewhere. I find the comparison of proportions of the caps, particularly nice. So it is a useful book, though more limited than you might expect from its title.\n\nOh, and I agree with you about the light weight of Univers for the text, on shiny paper; that kind of thing doesn't inspire confidence.\n\nIf you are designing type you will no doubt to much more of she has done by opening different fonts in a Font creation program, and pasting the outlines one over the other for comparison.\n\n"
