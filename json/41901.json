The lighter text in the lineup is Eurostile Condensed.\n\nI used the Adobe Open Type version and optical kerning set to 0 for the lineup unless a small adjustment needed to be made.\n\nGOLDENVOICE PRESENTS is set in Berthold Akzidenz Extended, COACHELLA is hand done, COACHELLA VALLEY ARTS… is set in DIN and then I believe I got back to Eurostile.\n\npbc\n\n"

Gotta love design decisions forced on you by bureaucrats. They were mad that the festival was called Coachella even though it was actually in Indio.\n\npbc\n\n"

I do a T-shirt for me and a couple of friends to wear each year and I send Golden Voice one for them. I do it just to show support and advertise Coachella. Yes, I buy 3 - 7 of their shirts every year, but some of the designs don't do enough to show how cool it is, so I do one that incorporates some of the images that make it special from teh previous year, so I can explain it to people that don't go. I think it would be better to use their type instead of something I come up with, to make the event more recognizable!  \nThanks  \nA\n\n"
