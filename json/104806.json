  "content": "Early '80 video titling Type ID\n\nIn early '80 in Italy, this font was used for a video titling of a japanese cartoon.  \nWhat type is it?  \nWhat type machine or technics could be used to do such a kind of title?  \nThis type was used after in '80 and '90 for titling video. Maybe can it be stored in such a digital video titler?  \nThank you.\n\n[http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6092/4b3s.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131211032132/http:/img594.imageshack.us/img594/6092/4b3s.png \"http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/6092/4b3s.png\")\n\n",
