      "content": "The feature exists, is powerful but works in a very different way than Word's.\n\nYou must create paragraph styles activating the **bullets and numbering** options. It's needed one style for each level in your hierarchy.\n\nSomething like this (the capture is in Portuguese, but you can identify the items as their position is the same):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009102754im_/http:/typophile.com/files/idnumbers_3871.png)\n  \n.  \nIn the paragraph style you define the level (nível) and set the format. Usually, numeration will be continuous whitin a chapter.\n\nWhen setting second- or third-level styles, you need to define where numeration will restart. Here you see a second-level paragrapf settings:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141009102754im_/http:/typophile.com/files/idnumbers2_4392.png)\n  \n.  \nThe option I chose makes numeration for second-level titles restart every time a new first-level appears. The result is this:\n\n1. Nononononon  \n1.1 nononon  \n1.2 nononon  \n2. Nononon \\<– a first-level paragraph makes the 2.n numbers restart  \n2.1 nononon  \n2.2 nononon  \netc.\n\nPlease note that ID keeps the numerations independent. So if you don't have a first-level paragraph in any place on the text, the second-level numeration will appear like this:  \n0.1 nononon  \n0.2 nononon  \netc.\n\nThis is a powerful feature which lets you apply detailed format to numbers apart of the paragraph style itself and build a structured document. I suggest you to take a look on the InDesign Help about this feature.\n\n"
