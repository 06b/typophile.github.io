The user is running Windoze XP with SP3, and every time he tries to open or add a new Open Type font or Type 1 font, he gets the message \".otf is not a valid font file.\"\n\nWe've tried everything I can think of, from sfc /scannow to repairing the font folder and checking the atm\\*.dll files. We've checked that he's not using the switch to use more than 3gb ram (known to cause this problem), and he has a NVIDIA graphics card (not a ATI one, also known to cause this).\n\nAny other thoughts?\n\n",
