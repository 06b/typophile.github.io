      "content": "Hi Claes.  \nI think it looks good - it does have reference to Ed Interlock and others, but these days what doesn't have a link to others? I think the S is a little harsh and needs a bit of fun injected - maybe you don't need the down strokes - might look better to have them running horizontal. The other letters seem to have a kind of \"wacky\" feel to them which is great, but the S kind of lacks that and looks a bit like the Apple system font Chicago.  \nJust my 2 cents. Otherwise she's a beauty.\n\n"

      "content": "hail,\n\nyou're right about the S's being a bit stiff.. i don't think they would work without the down strokes though, since several other characters have them (C, G).. and it'd make them look a bit thin too. there are definitely other ways to make them more playful and less Chicago though, so thanks for the comment.\n\n"
