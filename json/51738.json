  "content": "I saw Dexter’s Season 1 Episode 11 “Truth Be Told” episode two days ago and I’m pretty sure I noticed something odd. Yesterday I went to the video rental place so I could double-check what I think I saw on the DVD, but apparently the DVDs are not out yet here in Belgium. So I was wondering if anybody could help me with some screengrabs. Here's what I'm looking for:\n\nIn [Dexter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116162425/http:/www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do)’s Season 1 Episode 11 [“Truth Be Told”](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116162425/http:/www.sho.com/site/dexter/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=127819) Dexter is searching through newspaper archives, looking for clues as to what exactly happened to his mother and the conditions in which his stepfather found him. A couple of newspaper front pages are clearly seen in this scene, and I really would like to obtain screengrabs of those images (full frame with newspaper in it). Can anybody make these screengrabs and send them to me?\n\nThanks. :^)\n\n",
