It's my first stab at this sort of thing! Any thoughts on how I can make it better?   \n   \nI've done this in photoshop only. What is the best way to turn it into a working macintosh font?   \n   \n ![BITMAP_ZIG.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317130845im_/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-post.pl?action=posting_upload_form&what=show&img=27126)\n\n",

      "content": "Trixie,   \n   \nI'm not nearly as practiced as many of the regulars on typohile in regards to the strict discipline of type design. I do, however, put a lot of time into developing pixel fonts.   \n   \nThe set you are developing is difficult because of the serifs, in my opinion. The pixel grid at that size doesn't leave you much room to experiment with.   \n   \nI think the vertical and horizontal elements of the characters need to be more uniform. This may not turn out to be an exact replica of the font you are emulating. However, as a pixel font and not a postscript one, I think the set as a whole will be more elegant.   \n   \nPerhaps all you need to do is make each character two pixels taller. Readjust your curves and diagonals, and then the serifs won't make some characters look so much heavier than others.   \n   \nAgain, I'm not very comfortable advising others. This is just what I would try. If it doesn't work, no harm done.\n\n"

      "content": "First of all: I can't tell what font this is based on - there's a lot of stuff like this - so don't worry about being kosher or halal or anything else.   \n   \nI think your biggest problem is weight differences, like between the \"K\" and the \"X\". This is not easy to fix in an elegant manner - but you can fool with removing/adding pixels in \"unexpected\" places to make the glyphs more equal in weight.   \n   \nBTW, this thing is screaming to be in grayscale.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
