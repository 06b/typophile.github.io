  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have a queery, i am using Fontographer to design a small set of 7 character typefaces. In the typfaces I am using ’alt a’ (the apple sign). I have applied the letter to this character. Now, when it comes to generating the font, all is well and 6 of the letters work perfect. The seventh however, the ’alt a’, does not seem to generate as a character. In inDesign, it shows the infamous outlined rectangle for a missing charater.\n\nI am very new to Fontographer so am totally stuck on this problem. Can anyone tell me why this character in particular is not generating. It is very important that it is this ’alt a’ key.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nMatt\n\n [‹ OT language tags: IDCS2 support?!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30032 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [OpenType smallcaps in a separate font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32455 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

For eg: ™, ©, #, ¶\n\nThe Apple key + a will SELECT ALL\n\nThe Option key is different.\n\nLet me know if this helps.\n\n"
