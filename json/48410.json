Go to [www.cynscribe.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822012533/http:/www.cynscribe.com/ \"www.cynscribe.com\") and search California calligraphers.\n\nI have always maintained that the time wasted by art directors going through catalogues or the internet they could have had somebody letter it for the same price that you billed for time spent searching.\n\nMichael\n\n"
