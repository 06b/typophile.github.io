It actually was the protype font ’Ohana’ renamed.\n\nI supplied a bitmap font in a .fon form for 18, 22 pt VGA that would be used during the Windows 95 installation process. The reason a bitmap was necessary was during system installation there isn’t a rasterizer present so static bitmaps were used for text and graphics.\n\nOutlines were made and a .ttf created Sept 02 1994 to a full Win/ANSI character set. This font was fully hinted in TrueType.\n\nThe original idea that Matthew had was to do something like Geneva on the Mac but the final result was a bit too close and it got scrapped.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025044156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ohana_4132.jpg)\n\nI also made some bitmap only TrueType fonts of the original Tahoma bitmaps which had 3 sizes of bitmaps (11,12 and 14 ppem) and only circles for outlines. These were the ones used in testing and later when Tom Rickner was hinting he had to match the bitmaps I put in.
