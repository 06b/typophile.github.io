After all, this is lettering, not typography, and a typeface should really only suggest a general style or starting point. Besides, it is doubtful that the lettering will be an exact rendering of the typeface.\n\nBut perhaps I am wrong, and tattoo artists work as mere technicians, going over a printed temporary decal or some such thing—I’m not familiar with the state of this art.\n\n"
