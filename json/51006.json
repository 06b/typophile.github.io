      "content": "I don’t know if it’s the odd shape of the letter K in this or what, but I couldn’t help but think KGB as I read KSG.\n\nI also didn’t get the camera thing until you mentioned it, now I see it but I have to say the imagery isn’t the strongest.\n\nThere’s potential here for sure. I find that to my eyes, the K and the G work together, the S feels all alone and no a part of the rest, and the name below again feels way too small, and dijointed from the rest.\n\nI think if you unify your type choice a little more you might bring some cohesion into the design as a whole and make it read a little better (at least to me)\n\nI think it has a way to go yet, so keep working on it, you can certainly turn this into something beautiful!\n\n"
