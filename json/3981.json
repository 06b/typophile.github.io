  "content": "Hi guys,   \n   \nI have a problem with Fontographer. My quotesingle and quotedbl don't work in Quark. They work in FOG, but when I generate the font, they don't work.   \nThe fill colour is OK and the font is generated as a macintosh postscript 1 with a NFNT bitmap output.   \n   \nHas anyone else had this problem before?   \n   \nThanks in advance,\n\n [‹ Unicode and TypeTool/FontLab.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051816/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3998 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Romanian T comma Vs.

If you have no glyph in these character positions, it will seem as if the \"stupid\" quote marks aren't working.\n\n"
