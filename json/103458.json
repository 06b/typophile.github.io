      "content": "Whether one varies the italic angle at all, or in which manner one varies it, must depend on the individual design and what your intentions are, especially at the smaller sizes: is one trying to emphasise the 'italicness' of the letters by slanting them more, or is one trying to improve the legitibility of the letters by making them more open and less compressed and hence slanting them less? One can easily conceive, surely, that a sloped roman type of italic would benefit from more slanting at smaller sizes, while a highly cursive design might benefit from less slanting at smaller sizes. At display sizes, everything is pretty much a matter of style and aesthetics.\n\n"

Consider that some sizes of a type might only exist because a particular customer requested them and paid for their manufacture. So while it is unlikely to be a case of a customer specifying a variance in the italic angle, it could be a case of a particular customer having requested an italic style of a particular slant for the size they needed, and then that being incorporated into the family _despite the italic angle variance._ These things happen.\n\nWith regard to technical constraints, consider the possibility that the casting equipment might have a horizontal aperture limit, meaning that as italic type gets taller it needs to be steeper in order for the widest letters to fit within the manufacturing width limit.\n\nI don't know if either of these possibilities is the case: one would need access to the company archives in order to determine the reason for the variance.\n\n"
