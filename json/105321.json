WhatTheFont IDs it as Rogue Sans, but that's not it. I'm not sure if the serifs have been added to an existing typeface to go with the font used for the 'Chargers' name (see the logo in the top corner of [the Chargers website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415135201/http:/www.chargers.com/)).\n\nAny help greatly appreciated! Thanks.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Rogue Sans Medium \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [gwg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415135201/http:/typophile.com/user/213833 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
