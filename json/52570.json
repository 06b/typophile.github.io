And the paper we're gonna use for our business cards is also going to the the box that will contain our \"brochure/printed portfolio\".  \nSo what do you think ? Are the stains a big issue or does it just leave some kind of \"craftwork\" feeling ?\n\n"

It has a texture of a \"wet silk\" textile or .. uhm .. a very fine chamois. It is also _extremely_ matte. For example, the burgundy sample showed no visible highlights whatsoever when I looked at it from every angle against a light that was 2 feet away. It was really quite something.\n\nAlso, for what it's worth I didn't manage to leave any fingerprints on Plike even though I was sweating with excitement :-) Skin though managed to accumulate few dozens of white speckles by merely being pulled out of the envelope.\n\n"
