  "content": "Hi there,\n\nMy name is Julian - I’m a final year Graphic Design student from AUT university in Auckland, New Zealand (Bachelor Graphic Design).\n\nFor my exhibition project, I am looking into the area of ethics and design.  \nSpecifically targeting the ideas of ethical responsibility to my fellow peers the next generation of graphic designers.\n\nIm looking to form ethical values through narrative. Showing through example, (positive and negative) rather than telling people what to do.\n\nTherefore, If anyone has had any experiences on a job where they have taken a personal stand in favor of their ethical and moral values, or where they have wished they had in hindsight, or even just had a feeling that what they were doing was wrong, I’d love to here from you.\n\nPrivate message, email or just reply to me in this thread, I would be extremely thankful for any feedback.\n\nDepending on the story, I would like to conduct an interview in the form of an electronic survey (Email) or brief description of the job. These will be used on a ’offline’ website at the exhibition. I will respect anyones wish to stay anonymous.\n\nOnce again thank-you for helping me spread the idea of responsible ethical design, I think this is a very important issue that the next generation of graphic designers must be aware of.\n\nCheers  \nJulian\n\n [‹ DIY Dry transfer rub downs?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205034012/http:/typophile.com/node/50004 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [For your entertaining pleasure ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205034012/http:/typophile.com/node/49933 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Ultimately if you refuse to take a job based on your ethical values, surely someone else is just going to pick it up?\n\nBut at the same time I’m sick of seeing weak ethical guidelines full of shoulds. Ultimately at the end of the day, under stress and and hardship, ethics are the first thing to fly out the window.\n\nThis leads me back to the basis of my first post.  \nI want to try and promote a set of ethical values (Not Guidlines), in which my peers dont think of ethics as limitations or boundaries, but as something that they positively incorporate into every project.\n\nThiis is where my request for your stories comes in,  \nI believe narrative is an excellent way of installing values. If people can read about someone else who has sucessfully challenged the conventional practise of design, it becomes a whole lot more feasable.  \nPerhaps you stood up in the face of ethical uncertainty, successfully influenced a clients unethical practice, or where in hindsight realised that what your were doing was wrong.\n\nI think there is power in these stories for influencing my generation (The next generation) of designers.\n\n"

If so, then it’d be your job as the designer to adhere to your set of professional ethics and the client, theirs.\n\n“I’m sick of seeing weak ethical guidelines full of shoulds.”\n\nWell, the graphic design industry isn’t really that complex. Not sure how strong of ethical guidelines we need. And aren’t all ethical guidelines mostly ’shoulds’? At least in the non-life-threatening professions? ;o)\n\nIn terms of educating clients, being a web developer, I’ve often had to do some basic 101 explanations of IP laws, Spam laws, and such.\n\n"

This sort of satisfaction in your work, and respect for the people who’d come in contact with it could be quite useful in the design field.  \nThe possible ethical implication might be, that we should make sure not to subject the public at large to more poorly-make and tasteless solutions.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nPersonal Art and Design Portal of Ivan Gulkov  \n [www.ivangdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205034012/http:/www.ivangdesign.com/ \"www.ivangdesign.com\")\n\n"
