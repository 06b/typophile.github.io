  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m going to be giving a presentation about designing identity system and I was thinking of staring my presentation with a famous quote or some words of wisdom by a designer, typographer, etc. regarding designing a an identity system or even design discipline in general. Something to warm up a crowd and connect with the audience. Does anyone know some quotes that could work in my case or could point me somewhere I could find something. All help would be greatly appreciated ! Thanks very much,\n\nJen\n\n",

I hope he won't mind my sharing them here.\n\n'You cannot not communicate' - Paul Watzlawik\n\n'You are what you are seen to be' - Erik Spiekermann\n\n'Appearances are not false' (Nur der Schein trügt nicht) - Paul Klee\n\n'Form is the outside of content, and content is the inside of form' - Jean-Luc Godard\n\nOf course, one implication of all these quotes is that identity design won't do anything for you if you suck.\n\n"

It's tough -- because the company needs to mature, needs to be much more business focused. Yet, at the end of the day, innovation is about the employees. We're an I.P.

The fact that we improve on the list is even more refreshing, despite the company having become much more performance oriented.\"\n\n"
