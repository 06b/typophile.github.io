This is really splendid, has a range of optical sizes, and is much superior to the Monotype version. Also, it is based on the foundry metal original, not Monotype's hot metal version. It is not available for license.   \n   \nThe Monotype digital version is not a bad font -- it is better than many digital incarnations of metal types and has a reasonably good weight -- but is pales in comparison to the Stamperia Valdonega version.\n\n"
