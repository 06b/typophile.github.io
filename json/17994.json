  "content": "Couldn't find anything here about this. But I am really annoyed with this.\n\nI am working on a business card design and the dotted line border isn't perfect. The corners aren't the same, sometimes they have a dot at the exact corner, sometimes a space. No matter how much I tweek the spacing of the dashes etc. I can't get it to be perfect.\n\nOne thing that would work is if I could expand the object and just finesse the dots manually. But it just turns into a solid line when expanded.\n\nAny help here would be appreciated. That dotted line is going to be blind embossed so I really would like to get it right.\n\nHere's a pic:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020065218im_/http:/typophile.com/files/comp2.jpg)\n\n",

Then press CTRL+D several times. For each time you press, a new object will be created at the same distance from the former. Once you fill the whole width of the card, fine tune using distribute/align and you're done.  \n(Maybe you knew this already, but anyway...)\n\n"

      "content": "you actually can expand a automatically created dashed line into individual dots. its really a stupid thing that when you do it the normal way that it reverts back to a solid line though. anyways, here is how you do it. in your preferences setting in illustrator, change the transparency flattening setting temporarily to all vectors (on the slider bar, move it all the way to the right i think). then choose that line, and flatten it. This is the only way I have ever been able to figure out how to do this in illustrator.\n\n"

Also the weight and type of the card will affect the final effect (too heavy and absorbent and the dots will start to join). Of course it is possible but it might stretch the budget.  \nTim\n\n"
