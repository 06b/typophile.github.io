I'm trying to figure out the typeface that Chupa Chups uses on their website/ads.  \nI know the logo itself was custom made by Salvador Dali, but does anyone know the typefaces used here?  \n [http://www.chupachups.com/homepage.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014055847/http:/www.chupachups.com/homepage.html \"http://www.chupachups.com/homepage.html\")\n\nI would like to know both the body type and the type on the bottom of the page used for contact info.\n\n",
