  "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI've been asked to design some truck lettering for a bakery truck. The trucks have 18 foot, 26 foot, 53 foot bodies. The bakery's logo is Script and I'm trying to decide on some serif fonts that are going to pop out and be easily read. Does anyone have any suggestions about what fonts might be suitable for a truck this large and that will still maintain a bakery feel.\n\nThanks,\n\nRay Macari\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141004084149im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dblogo.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141004084149im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bwdblogo.jpg)\n\n",

He later had a van (which was run by my grandad, who loved motors) to pick up and deliver, but come WW2 there was a huge demand for moving furniture out of London and storing it. Hence the \"Removals\" on the van picture, which dates from the 1940s. People were more interested in moving furniture out of harm's way than getting it reupholstered. I like the way the telephone exchanges had names, not numbers, as in Chris' photo. Sorry for getting off topic, but given half an excuse to show some nice old lettering... \n"
