  "content": "This is an experimental type face where all glyphs are constructed using solid equilateral triangles. It turned out one can build the whole character set out of triangles with little or no compromise on harmony. The result: a new sort of blackletter with more than a hint of minimalism. Althoght I have not finished the metrics and kerning, it produced quite serviceable text even at small sizes, that could have made any tonsured monk very proud.\n\nAny comments?\n\nTybor\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [nimrodel 72.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317224649/http:/typophile.com/files/nimrodel%2072.png) | 29.54 KB |\n| [Nimrodel sample 36.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317224649/http:/typophile.com/files/Nimrodel%20sample%2036.png) | 68.36 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "for me it s an interesting typo - good modular work.  \nthis is some sort of modern blackletter typeface - i think you should generate more vertical elements, develop the font as a COND one... for example take the small \"e\" - if you make it 3-4 modules higher it will look far different and will not have any reading problems.  \nanyway - it is still good work!!!  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [www.behance.net/epixs](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317224649/http:/www.behance.net/epixs \"www.behance.net/epixs\")  \n [epixs@yahoo.com](mailto:epixs@yahoo.com)  \n+359887323000\n\n"
