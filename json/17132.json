I've attached an image that contains examples that I've scanned in from various playing pieces and the game manual.\n\nThe best match I've been able to find so far is [Kynges X NF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083518/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kynges-x-nf/) from [Nick's Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083518/http:/www.nicksfonts.com/). It's close, but not exactly the same.\n\nAccording to that MyFonts page, Kynges X NF was \"inspired by an offering in the 1938 classic, <cite>Letters and Lettering</cite> by Paul Carlyle and Gus Oring\". Perhaps the face I'm looking for was digitized from the same source?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Puerto Rico typeface.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083518/http:/typophile.com/files/Puerto%20Rico%20typeface.png) | 17.86 KB |\n\n",

What differences do you think you see?\n\nThanks for the pointer, btw. I had been wondering what typeface they were using, myself. Puerto Rico is a great game!\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "I too see lots of little differences.\n\nThe typeface appears in the Solotype Catalog as Yucca. Dan Solo created a digital version under a different name, for some reason: Malvern. It can only be had from the [24 Celtic and Medieval Display Fonts CD](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083518/http:/store.doverpublications.com/0486999602.html) from Dover. I have Malvern and it is a perfect match.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the help, guys. Malvern does appear to be a perfect match -- and quite a bargain, too.\n\nAs Mike has mentioned, there are many small differences between Kynges X NF and Malvern. Aside from the more glaring variations in form (such as the <cite>n</cite> that Thomas has pointed out), Malvern is on the whole more uniform and harmonious, while Kynges X NF is relatively uneven and idiosyncratic.\n\nBTW, Thomas, you probably already know this, but just in case you were wondering about the _other_ face used heavily in <cite>Puerto Rico</cite>, it's [Post-Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083518/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90092.html) from [Berthold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083518/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/).\n\nIt's a great game indeed. And now that I know what faces to use, I'll be able to make my own authentic-looking custom building, resource, and even role pieces.\n\n"
