  "content": "Hi..I'm working on a project where I am imitating the theme of the kids books \"I Spy.\"\n\nCould someone help me identify the fonts used on the cover, and perhaps recommend something similar (doesn't need to be exact, the words wont be 'I Spy').\n\nHere's an image of said cover  \n [http://buy.overstock.com/images/products/bnt/FC0590462954.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215224208/http:/buy.overstock.com/images/products/bnt/FC0590462954.JPG \"http://buy.overstock.com/images/products/bnt/FC0590462954.JPG\")\n\nAny help is appreciated, thank you\n\n",

      "content": "Since you did day similar would be OK, and since I can't offhand name what they used, I'd suggest [Bellini Bold Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215224208/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bellini-rr/bellini-condensed-rr-bold/testdrive.html?s=I+SPY+FANTASY&p=48) for the I SPY part. Maybe some 'squooshing' would be in order for fitting, the way the book title was done. All the black lettering below that looks like good old Bembo. The orange type might be Bembo Bold, but it's hard to see details well in the sample.\n\nAnother I SPY replacement might be [LaBamba](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215224208/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/la-bamba/la-bamba/testdrive.html?s=I+SPY+FANTASY&p=48), which is a bit more 'fun' looking. \"Spumoni\" or \"Elroy\", would also be 'fun' fonts for the main title.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
