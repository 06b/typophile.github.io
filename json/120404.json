It could not be easy to place as a logo, though.  \nBy the way, the fact that |O| and |N| are the same weight, doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re optically adjusted for every situation: they surely work fine in an even spaced, uniformly coloured word say, in an heading. But here there’s need of hierarchy and direction.\n\n"

The letters become tiny...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421234827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo80_5518.jpg)\n\nYou may think you'll never need to make your logo that narrow, but you might occasionally.\n\n"

They only have 7 and 4 weights respectively, so you'd need to customise, but it may reduce the width enough to make the concept workable.\n\nAlso, my first impression when I first saw your post was how interesting it would be if it was oriented vertically, with the letters bunching at the bottom. Is your brief relaxed enough for you to experiment with that idea?\n\n"

Unfortunately, I just don't think that I can get this one to work ... even though I really like the concept, but, just doesn't work with the name.\n\nIf you all are interested. Here is another idea I have come up with. This is a simple mark that uses a G and a C for \"Gravitational Creative\" that come together to echo a planet, star, black hole, etc. Also the line on the G, going into the center of the circle, symbolizes gravity moving to the center of mass. It could also symbolize rings around a planet. I plan to use different gradients with the logo, identity items as well.\n\nI'd appreciate any additional thoughts on this new idea. Thank you all for your thoughtful comments so far.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421234827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-11-15%20at%209_3467.25.56%20PM.png)\n\n"

      "content": "The horse has left the barn but a few comments:\n\nIMHO this does not make a good logo. It makes a great, and interesting, and even elegant type treatment for say an article title where it can be offset/balanced with page layout, but it is too imbalanced, distended, and horizontal for a logo.\n\nAll the weight is at one end or the other, and it virtually dissipates into nothingness at the end. The name implies things that are good in a design firm... design with gravity, with weight and substance and impact. But the treatment actually implies the opposite; mass dissolving into nothingness.\n\nIt's too horizontal. It will work on a web site header or letterhead, and maybe on a pen, but the constraints it poses on usage in other applications is rather severe, both in terms of form and readability.\n\nIt points up the fact an interesting and compelling design type design doesn't automatically translate into logo effectiveness and utility.\n\nPart of the problem is the length of the name, which is right at the limit of manageability. A company name with five syllables is working at a disadvantage.\n\nI would have tried having the name go bold-light-bold or light-bold-light and simply adjust the spacing for visual balance and readability. It would have been more compact and symmetrical. Not sure if it would still work as a logo, though. This situation sort of begs for a mark/symbol that can be used with/without the logotype.\n\n"
