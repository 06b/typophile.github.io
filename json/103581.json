Even if I'm clearly not a specialist of Greek fonts. My first thought was \"this is not Helvetica, /9 is off. looks more like Akzidenz Grotesk\". But after checking the [Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk Pro+ Greek character set](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819132209/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/font/akzidenz-grotesk/proplus/#charset), /γ was still off (and many more actually such as /ɛ). So really don't know what it could be... May be asking to specialists like [Cannibal Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819132209/http:/www.cannibal.gr/) would worth a shot...\n\n"
