I suspect slanted romans might need more slant than I'm looking for – although I wonder if it couldn't work if all the other constituents of \"italicness\" are in place (like narrowness, lighter color, different serif structure maybe).\n\n\\*\n\nLooking at Letters of Credit, I just came across JvK's Romanée (page 108). Too calligraphic for my taste, but that's the sort of angle I'm looking for (Tracy quotes it as 4 degrees). It seems that much of its \"italicness\" (which really is uh, a bit much) is achieved by its narrowness – and am I crazy, or do the vertical proportions differ between its roman and italic?\n\n"

      "content": "You want that strong response from me? OK, here goes:\n\nFirst off, in my world both the \"pure\" slanted-roman, and the \"true italics\" are to be seen as abstract extremes on a continuous axis – in this case, the axis of minimal to maximal chiro/calligraphic influence in the italics, or maybe the chiro-\"delta\" between a given roman and italic cut (in terms of an additional chirographic influence on the italics causing structural differences between it and the roman). It's possible that Morison (and I'm speculating here, because as I've said before, I haven't actually read his text) was too extreme on this scale, too dogmatic.\n\nBut I wonder, might not a position on the non-chiro end of that axis still be workable if other factors were weighed differently? Simply stated, I'd say you can't (usually/easily) take chiro-ness out of \"the italics equation\" and not add \"italicness\" back in some other form without the result becoming, well, less italic! And thus less differentiated. But \"italicness\" can come about by different variables, and the chiro/calligraphic \"tone\" is just one of them.\\* There's slant as well, there's color, there's width/narrowness, there's possibly different vertical proportions; and I'm sure there's more too. So reducing both the slant and the chiro-value would probably mean that one would have to consider making the italics notably narrower, possibly lighter, and maybe smaller. And might that not work?  \n\\* I could swear I've read a similar discussion on Typophile before, but my recollection of it is too fuzzy to quote or even find it.\n\nSo there's counter-weighing, and then I'd personally argue against the idea of the \"pure\" slanted-roman too. I think it should be possible to make very subtle differences in tone that don't need to escalate into too \"literal\" references to chirography. Things like different treatment of serifs and/or joins, or a subtly different flavor of the curves… maybe.\n\nThe question really is, what do we need an italic to be, and can that be achieved both without borrowing excessively from chirography, and without an exaggerated slant? I would go out on a limb and say that I think it can very well. I'm not sure it will be pretty, but I'm pretty sure it can work.  \n(And I'm well aware of the fact that now, I'll be expected to try and prove that. ;-)\n\n"

Italics have a different need than bold although both are attempts to separate some parts of text from the normal roman book face. Bold text set inline with the book face stands out indeed with weight being the primary driving force for contrast. Italics have a subtler use. They are not meant to leap out at you and make a jump in color like bolds do, they just make enough of a distinction for a person to see them as \"different than roman\" but not be emphasized above roman. You might call this a non-hierarchal difference or separation without dominance.  \nBy removing weight change as an option, slant is one of the few remaining players that cuts across all type families. There are other things possible such as the degree of cursive form historically used. The earliest use of italic type mixed inline with upright roman texts were not from the same type family and a pairing was made based on how closely the x-heights matched when set as neighbors. Shortly after that, foundries took the opportunity to design a so-called matching italics to be sold as a companion to the upright. We can debate at this point, hundreds of years after the fact, how closely matched the early italics really were. Today, italics are IMO better matched as family than the older ones were. We have trained ourselves to accept the variance over the past centuries. Whatever we come up with as a substitute for the current use of slant with a strong cursive influence and use of entrance and exit strokes, we will also require several years before the reading public begins to \"get it\".  \nI would be the last person on earth to say, \"don't even try it\" and I welcome the opportunity to see your attempts as you proceed. I would only say do not throw out the tools people are accustomed to--or at least do not curse them as evil.

From Jenson on, type designers have modified joins, weights, and sizes for greater readability.\n\nBut Hrant's position has been far stronger than that. If I have understood him, he thinks that written forms are inherently less readable, because of following the stroke or \"moving front\" of a pen. When they show a moving front, where the two extremes of the stroke are linked as in a pen, that prevents a proper \"notan\" or balancing of black and white. And this messed-up notan of necessity makes the type less readable.\n\nThat more extreme view, which implies that type having more influence of the pen is inherently less readable, is what I don't buy. In my view, some features of pen writing help, and some hurt. Containing noticeable pen-like features, such as in Jos Buivenga's new Calluna, doesn't necessarily hurt readability.\n\n"

      "content": "Chris, no crusade in sight on this end, just a desire to see what italics are and what they do, and if they need to be what they usually are in order to do that job.\n\nLike you say, italics were usually separate types and only later were culturally \"adopted\" to be a subordinate \"style\" to complement a given upright font. And my view is, just because it was culturally \"learned\" to do it this way doesn't necessarily make it the Only True Way.  \nSometimes today secondary fonts are used inline for a different way of adding gentle emphasis or denoting other layers of meaning, for example the sans variant of the text face or maybe a different typeface altogether – much like the old guys used cursive fonts as secondary \"italic\" ones. It's a great effect if done well, and shows IMO that the point is not that such an emphasis-mark needs to be cursive and/or slanted, but that it simply needs to be _different enough while still belonging_ to the regular cut.  \nBeyond that, it's a question of flavor: Setting a word in a matching sans within a body of serif is a _differently_ \"flavored\" emphasis than using cursive italics – and that's where it gets really interesting: It means that if we only accept the cursive-italic form of \"italic\" emphasis, we accept that it automatically comes with a certain flavor, i.e. a specifically chirographic one; and I don't see how that is necessary, or even needs to make sense in many cases. Think about what you'd usually use more cursive/calligraphic fonts for: wedding invitations? Now why exactly would I want a book title highlighted in running text to look more festive, or more personal, than the running text – more hand-written? I only want it to stand apart!\n\n_\"I have a tough time seeing your headlong leap into “necessary emancipation”.\"_  \nShort version (sorry, lots of work ahead): By \"emancipation\" I didn't mean to say that I'd want type design to break from centuries of handwriting tradition and history just for the sake of it, and crusade for that, and fight the pen, armed to the teeth, burning calligraphic type designers at the stake. My point is (and it \\*is\\* a rather benign one, much like William says) that type needs to stop being dependent on the pen and holding its hand, but continue – and a bit more boldly, perhaps – to search for its own, functional aesthetics from within – and ideally based on functionality, rather than tradition. Which isn't limited to italics, but also means asking questions like the one above.\n\n_\"That more extreme view, which implies that type having more influence of the pen is inherently less readable, is what I don’t buy.\"_  \nAnd I don't get. Looks like we need the man to get back here!\n\n"

      "content": "Nina, I wasn't criticizing your use of the two terms interchangeably above. I don't think either have clear, universally accepted definitions, so it's not a question of right or wrong, or even \"muddling\" the terms. I was just trying to understand how you are intending to use them. I admit to still not being quite clear.\n\nI think you've outlined the parameters of distinction (at least, within the context of what we commonly understand to be \"italic\") -- slope/slant, width, weight, relative vertical proportions, and form structure. You've expressed an interest in minimizing the first: the angle from the vertical.\n\nWidth and weight are typically fine-tuned when developing an \"emphatic companion\" to the roman -- typically slightly narrower and slightly lighter. Sometimes relative vertical proportions are adjusted when the angle is great.\n\nTurning attention to form structure, and the reason for my question about terms, I'm trying to understand which components constitute \"chirographic\" and/or \"cursive\" in your assessment.\n\nTaking sloped roman as a point of reference, which changes to the structure would make it necessarily \"cursive\"? Take the lowercase _n_ for instance. If you remove the left serif of the right stem, have you made it cursive, since this one-sided structure typically arises from the motion of writing? What about if you remove both of the serifs on the right stem, now is it \"cursive\"? Does it matter whether the transition is soft & round or hard & angular? What about how high or low the join from arch to stem is; since a lower join typically arises from a single motion of the hand, does that play a defining role in \"cursive\"?\n\nWhen you object to (or question) \"cursive/chirographic,\" what are you directing your attention at?\n\n"

I will admit I'm not quite getting the difference you see between the definitions of the term as used by John and Hrant; they sound very similar to me. Or do you mean that John essentially introduced the term to structurally/aesthetically describe letterforms that are actually written by hand, whereas Hrant transposes it to typographic letterforms that borrow, structurally/stylistically, from handwriting?\n\n_\"Hrant used “chirography” in a different discussion on the same list, and essentially as a slightly broader substitute for “calligraphy,” meaning an approach to letter formation that relies upon the logic of the hand.\"_  \nFor the record, that's exactly the way I understood the term, and/or intended to use it. It seems like a very useful term to have, too.\n\nYour question about what exactly constitutes chirographic-ness (I know that's not a word :-) ) in italics is very interesting. I'll have to think about that for a moment (and finish a couple of other things on my desk). Will be back.\n\n"

      "content": "Kent, thanks for the link, my above summary on the term \"chirographic\" was my mangled memory of your post.\n\nNina, I am uneasy about the philosophy I hear--maybe wrongly--in your phrase \"ideally based on functionality, rather than tradition.\"\n\nTo me this sounds like the radicalism of post WWI \"functionalists\" in architecture, who were opposed to ornament on the supposed grounds of improving function.\n\nFirst of all aesthetics is functional, because human beings want to live with beauty, if we have a choice.\n\nSecond, radicalism in type is misguided. I am not politically a conservative, at least the way Americans use that word, but I do agree with Stanley Morrison that type has an element that is inherently conservative: we are tied to letter forms that we inherit from the past, because if we go too far in altering the traditional forms people can't read them.\n\nThird, when talking about functionally and readability in italics you are facing a tricky situation. Probably all noticeably slanted letters are less readable, and certainly slanted letters in the midst of vertical ones slow you down. But they are \\*meant\\* to slow you down, and draw attention to the word or phrase. That is their function. So here you have slightly less readability as more functional for communication!\n\nI absolutely don't want to discourage your experiments, but I think that the history of radical functionalism in architecture shows that while it inspired a lot of interesting work, it is too narrow and restrictive as a philosophy.\n\nSo I am all for chirographic italics, and non-chirographic ones. Let a hundred flowers bloom.\n\n"

Does that mean the notan end would need to a) ignore these restrictions and do simply whatever makes readability best b) invert all these requirements resulting in independent countershapes, un-linked stem edges, reversed stress, no cursivity??? I wonder if both a) and b) could result in beautiful, readable designs.\n\n"

      "content": "Craig, you're right I wasn't precise. The problem is that \"functionalism\" has meant different things to different people.\n\nSullivan, who coined \"form follows function\" actually loved ornament. But if I remember rightly Mies van der Rohe was opposed to ornament as anti-functional. I don't know if he thought all ornament was ugly, but he was opposed to it. Also in type, Bayer's alphabet was I think also pared down of all ornament, breathing of this same ideology.\n\nSo I'm only really talking about one strand in functionalism, but I do think it's the one that made the most noise in the last century--at least what I remember of it, which is the second half.\n\nBy radicalism I mean that view that in any field we have to tear up the past and start again. So radicalism and traditionalism, in the senses I am used to using them, are opposed to each other.\n\nI certainly think type should be functional, but I think \"functionalism\" has been used for some ideologies that are too narrow and restrictive.\n\nActually, the italics are a good example showing why it is simplistic to identify functionality with lack of ornament and simple geometrical forms.\n\nThe lack of simplicity of italics, and their slower reading, helps provide a contrast, and so is functional in a different way from the companion roman.\n\n"
