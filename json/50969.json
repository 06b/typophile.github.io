  "content": "i'm looking for a font that is an alternative to copperplate. i have a client for whom i'm designing a logo, and he feels that all the fonts i've shown thus far are too 'common.' (these included: requiem, didot, castellar, futura, among others.) he has asked for a 'clean, crisp, unique, formidable, stately' font. he particularly likes the font used for the french laundry logo ( [http://www.frenchlaundry.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140314140105/http:/www.frenchlaundry.com/ \"http://www.frenchlaundry.com/\") click on 'menu + stories' then click 'menu'. unfortunately, i can't find it anywhere that's clear to view other than a downloadable menu.) i believe it's copperplate that has been modified.  \ni have a feeling this is one of those cases where he needs to see many options and will (hopefully) fall in love eventually. i don't think a sans serif is appropriate. thanks for any direction to lesser known, well designed fonts.\n\n",
