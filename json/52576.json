The blighters add a level of entertainment and fun to the forum, and I’ve occasionally engaged in troll-baiting and border-line trollish behavior.\n\nWhat unsettles me is when a troll takes on a fake ethnicity/geo-location, and proceeds to negatively exploit national/racial stereotypes. Does anyone else have a problem with that? Or is that just the way of the Web?\n\n",

I would guess that what you are talking about is, in a sense, playing devil's advocate, as it is said, to stimulate and push a discussion forward. I think this is a very good point.\n\nAs far as the ethnicity issue, I would mention that I recently fed a troll a Borat flavored morsel. I really see a similarity. I guess there are those that treat a board as a holy receptacle of knowledge where no sideways comments or anything that does not explicitly contribute to the discussion should be tolerated. Personally, I believe a well crafted digression can be a welcome contribution.\n\nConsider the specifics here though. Why would anyone attack E.S. for owning \"cool fonts\". It isn't a legit crit—just a silly joke. One that I admit I do not get the point of at all.\n\n"

They're pretty rare on Typophile (as a member of several gaming forums it's pretty blissful spending some time here!)\n\nA fuller explanation can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028234321/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)).\n\nTake care,\n\nAndi\n\n[[semibad](http://web.archive.org/web/20141028234321/http:/www.semibad.com/)]\n\n"

This innovative and ground breaking font is so revolutionary as to be totally devoid of substance all together. Its characterless features are mind numbing in their simplicity without one redeeming virtue. What is most striking in 'San Intelligence' is not what appears to the eye, but what banality has gone on in its creation and development.  \nA watershed of type design which no other can come close to, or even wish to.\n\n'Sans Intelligence' is pure type, its perfection is an indefinable property that only sensitive critics (liken to yourself, Gui Yong) can intuitively recognise in a work of art. Unfortunately insensitive critics (such as Mr Typerror - please excuse his ignorance) are unable to appreciate its full and unique magnificence.\n\n"
