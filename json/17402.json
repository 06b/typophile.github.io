After the publication of Apex Serif, Thirstype's first OpenType font family, Chester returned to Apex Sans with a view to extending the glyphset and combining the Small Caps and numeral sets into OpenType fonts. As he worked, Chester started seeing the type's flaws, and set about fixing them.\n\nAll weights of the type have been revised, and everything heavier than Book has been completely redrawn. The bold weights had previously \"closed up\", especially at smaller sizes; the heavy weights are now more open, with subtle contrast; the new version has been described as \"elegant\". The family has grown to seven weights, with over a thousand glyphs in each font. The font files are shipped solely as cross-platform CFF-flavoured OpenType, with loads of basic and advanced features.\n\n[http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203191110/http:/www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://www.vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexNew/mudTyper+Weights/\")\n\nThose who have purchased Apex Sans packages from vllg.com or Thirstype.com can purchase upgrades for a small price: US$25 for those who had purchased the full family, and US$49 for those who purchased the Roman+Italic package. (Have your original order # on hand; you'll need it to order an upgrade.)\n\n/ / / / / / / / / /\n\nDon't forget our special \"Typographica Favorites 05\" package: 5 Village exclusives chosen as amongst the best of 2005 by the editors of Typographica:  \n/ Arrival by Keith Chi-hang Tam from Type Initiative  \n/ Crank 8 by Greg Lindy & Henk Elenga from Lux Typographics  \n/ Flama by Mario Feliciano from Feliciano Type Foundry  \n/ Garda by Mario Feliciano from Feliciano Type Foundry  \n/ Litteratra by Karsten Luecke from KLTF\n\nThe designers are offering this package of five notable type families for US$575.00, a savings of one-third off the combined price of US$865.00. (That's a savings of US$190.00.)\n\n[http://vllg.com/offers.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203191110/http:/vllg.com/offers.php \"http://vllg.com/offers.php\")\n\n/ / / / / / / / / /\n\nWith best regards,  \nchester\n\nVillage  \n168 Second Avenue #253  \nNew York NY 10003  \nUSA\n\ntelephone ++1 646 654 1506  \nfax ++1 646 429 8597  \n [http://vllg.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203191110/http:/vllg.com/ \"http://vllg.com\")\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n",
