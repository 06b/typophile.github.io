  "content": "Recently, I started a new job at a firm using a font called NaturaRoman for its text.\n\nI have since learned that NaturaRoman (although I have it in ttf and Mac PS 1) does not  \ntechnically exist. Someone created it from Requiem by Hoefler.\n\nSo, I have a problem. Obviously, I cannot use the ttf file for production work. And I am working on a Windows OS machine, so the Mac PS 1 version I have won’t work either.\n\nSo, I need a Windows PS 1 version of NaturaRoman, Italic, what have you ...\n\nOr, I could purchase Requiem. Not a problem. But I am unclear whether or not the 3  \nweights Hoefler mentions on [www.typography.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123002214/http:/www.typography.com/ \"www.typography.com\") (Fine, Display and Text) translate to what  \nI’m used to as Roman, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, Small Caps, Swashes, etc.\n\nRegardless, I am looking at font substitution issues. I can deal with those but what I can’t deal with is the thought of sending a True Type font (even with outlines which might shift my InDesign layout when preparing for RIP.)\n\nAny suggestions? Anyone familiar with NaturaRoman? Under the info on a Mac OS X I have found that the Nature Conservancy produced via a license from Hoefler ... what the heck is that?\n\nKills me how people can rip off font designers ...\n\n [‹ (x) Child's hand printed script - Zachary Font {Dennis (self, via WhatTheFont)}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123002214/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35901 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [\"roberto cavalli\" logo narrow 70s style sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123002214/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35896 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

We (and they) have since replaced it with Requiem proper, as well as some new variations of Requiem that eagle-eyed typophiles might notice at [http://www.nature.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20071123002214/http:/www.nature.org/ \"http://www.nature.org\").\n\nIf you’re using the Natura fonts, just let us know and we can arrange a license for you. We’ll throw in Requiem as well, since I think you’ll like it better (The Nature Conservancy did!) Feel free to e-mail me offlist, or contact Romeo Ruz at my office for speedier service, at ruz at typography.com.\n\nBy the way, I hope that while any of you are scoping out the typography on The Nature Consevancy’s site, you’ll take a moment to learn about the organization. They’re fighting the good fight for our environment, and they’re one of the many non-profit organizations that H&FJ is especially proud to be working with.\n\nThanks!\n\nJonathan\n\n"
