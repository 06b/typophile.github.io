  "content": "Hi,\n\nAfter four years of happy working with LeMondeSans accompanying LeMondeJournal in a business mag I thought it's time for a change.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111114182811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LeMonde_4106.gif)\n\nIdeal candidate to stand in for LeMondeSans should:\n\n- have at least 3 font weights (4-5 are most welcome),\n- have an accompanying condensed family for use in short portions of texts in infographs (not a must),\n- cover variety of functions: comfortable reading in circ. 8-9 pt in sidebar texts, subheads in body in 12-14 pt, sidebar titles in over 18 pt and titles in brochures in really big sizes,\n- OSF and small caps are very welcome,\n- CE characters are very welcome,\n- Open Type is preferred font format.\n\nFonts being under consideration so far are FF Quadraat Sans, FF Unit, Fedra Sans Alt, DTL Prokylon and Stalemate.\n\nU.S. edition of the mag went for Univers family some time ago and I'd like to try something different.\n\nPlease share your thoughts on what in your opinion would be the best choice to accompany LeMondeJournal.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nAntoni\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [and\\_the\\_winner\\_is.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20111114182811/http:/typophile.com/files/and_the_winner_is.pdf) | 172.46 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You could try Budweiser instead… :-)\n\nSeriously though, i find it quite hard to recommend something, it depends on how much \"change\" you want and can't really compare to LeMonde Journal regarding relative x-height etc. just from your image… I'd kickstart by browsing the Hoefler&Frere-Jones site at [http://www.typography.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20111114182811/http:/www.typography.com/ \"http://www.typography.com\") probably…  \nOr have you ever thought of pairing Meta and Meta Serif when the later will finally have been released?\n\n"

But it shouldn't be too \"modern-like\" (eg. Klavika, Engel, Din, Vista) at the same time.\n\nIn fact I put the Whitney from Hoefler&Frere-Jones on my short-list, but wasn't able to get any vector based specimen, so abandoned it for a moment.\n\nFor various reasons beyond me changing the body font (LMJournal) is not possible.\n\nI updated the initial post and added a pdf sample.\n\nCheers,\n\nAntoni\n\n"

Amplitude was something I was strongly considering (I went with Shaker for my newspaper, ultimately), so you may find that the other types mentioned in the thread might be candidates for your magazine. None of them jumped out at me as particularly amazing candidates for your design, but I didn't think you'd like Amplitude, either ...\n\n"

But two, I don't think, are quite ideal: Meta, which is a bit overused if you're going for a change, and Quadraat, which I think doesn't fit so well stylistically (i.e. Le Monde is too modern for it). Both would still work if you like them, though.\n\n"

I got printed specimen of your Stalemate, Remontoire, Tarocco and Delicato stick to the board over my desk. What a pity they don't include Polish diacritics, even in Graficz. Can't work without these. BTW - does your EULA permits adding this characters to the font? You got all elements designed: \"ogonek\" for a-ogonek \"ą\" and e-ogonek \"ę\", \"abovedot\" for z-abovedot \"ż\", \"acute\" for z-acute \"ź\" and c-acute \"ć\". It's so close... :(\n\nPS. Your specimens design is really great!\n\ncheers,\n\nAntoni\n\n"
