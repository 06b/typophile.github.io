(Perferably Mac OSX software)  \nIcons are drawn ready in Adobe Illustrator.\n\nMany thanks\n\n",

Then in Fontforge, you select the slot where you want to put the icon, open it (say double click) and then in File \\> Import you select \"SVG\" instead of \"Image\" and then click the file you want to import.\n\n[edit] On the [fontforge site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016092627/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/) there is a pdf tutorial (second bullet).\n\n"

But of course I don't know what your images look like: it might be possible that they are indeed more complex than any font editing software can understand.\n\nIf nothing else helps, you can subscribe to the [fontforge-users mailing list](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016092627/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Flists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/fontforge-users) and ask about your problem there.\n\n"
