In particular the feelings on the bleaker end of the spectrum; sadness, melancholia, depression.\n\nI am attempting to design such a font and the task is proving more difficult than I initially assumed, and figured I could use some inspiration.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

I think the most you might be able to pull off is a vague and faint sense of \"sadness\", and only among some people - plus you'll certainly get other associations too (like elegance) in fact maybe more strongly.\\* The general traits I would look for are: narrow, small x-height, light, high waist, somewhat weathered finish, and old-fashioned terminals (like balls, but small ones). Maybe something that has an old French colonial air about it - a bit like this:\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20897.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018092939/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20897.html \"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/20897.html\") \\_  \nBut taller caps, and daintier serifs.\n\n\\* It seems like maybe traits that have strong tangible representations have a better hope than emotions (which are rarely associated with any physical form).\n\nhhp\n\n"
