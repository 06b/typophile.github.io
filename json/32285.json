      "content": "Hi Eduardo  \nIt's looking good. A few quick comments:  \nr seems a bit too narrow  \nj and y seems to acend too deep  \nThe cut-off piece on the e is a bit distracting, but you only notice it in the very large sizes.  \nk upper arm is a little weak\n\nIn the bold cut I feel that the upper case glyphs are too dark compared to the lower case, and compared to the relationship between upper- and lower case in the regular cut.\n\n"

      "content": "Am I right and you want to use the red g and w as alternates!?!\n\nIf so I would make the red w the primary letter and the other one the alternate. The red one is more humanistic and better fits to the binocular g.\n\nI dont like the shoulder on the letters n, m (and u). I would make them a little bit rounder. The shoulder on the a is really nice.\n\nI think it would look nice if you slant the crossbar on the e a little bit.\n\nGreetings: Steven\n\n"
