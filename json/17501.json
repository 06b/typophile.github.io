She believes, perhaps rightly so, that we are even more passionate about letterforms and their use than many generalist graphic designers are about their particular industry.\n\nIs this true? Why? I promise not to steal your pithy quotes and use them as my own; I’m asking because aside from the usually-repeated trope (that so much visual communication is bad, that our tools are misused so regularly, that so many ’professionals’ are unfamiliar with their correct use that we MUST vigilantly proselytize / educate not just professionals but all makers and consumers of communication as well), well, I just can’t say it any more succinctly than that.\n\nBut that’s just my own lack of articulation and imagination. Aside from the inherent beauty of good type and good typesetting, what am I missing?\n\nThe reporter’s email address indicates that she is at the Columbia School of Journalism - not sure if this is a CJR project or another endeavor entirely.\n\nI will simply steer her toward this thread if it generates useful dialogue.\n\nYours\n\nJoshua\n\n [‹ the Apple question](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051630/http:/typophile.com/node/17706 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Research question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051630/http:/typophile.com/node/17819 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In the Platonic sense of “Seeing Forms”, we may see ourselves as privileged to “knowing” the forms of letters in their absolute sense. We might even design a typeface that pushes at the boundaries but we know well enough what the essence of those forms are so that they are not lost in the abyss beyond the boundary. Type design is both taxing and exhilarating (the moments of exhilaration are few and brief though). Passion is part of the long struggle to achieve those brief moments. Seeing our labors minimized by being stolen or badly used can make me cry out, “NO!, that is not why I poured my life into that musical score of letterforms!”\n\nChrisL\n\n"

All that crashing means that passion is tempered with a certain pragmatism after a while. Which makes their craft a bit less hypothetical than ours is. I can’t say that we are immune from that, but of neccessity, a bit more removed from end results and our passion isn’t checked as regularly as a result.\n\n"

They work forever on these viral little machines, and understandably become a little bit full of themselves and overly attentive to the smallest details.\n\n\\> 1. When is typography political?\n\nType design can be political quite easily in the non-Latin realm. For example my Nour&Patria system (good news from CR on that soon) is largely an extension of the desire to combat what’s called the White Genocide of Armenians: cultural assimilation in foreign lands, which is a huge deal for us when you consider that most Armenians live outside Armenia (thanks to the Turks).\n\n\\> 2. Why do so many typographers have manifestos?\n\nType design being a financially precarious  \noccupation, you almost have to be an idealist.\n\n\\> 3. If typography is so important, how come some many people ignore it?\n\nImportant compared to what? Frankly it’s not that important  \nin the global scheme of things, except when it tries to help  \nthe vulnerable (which is extremely rare).\n\nBut a big reason it’s ignored is that it’s partly subvisible.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Another feature is that because it you have a finite bunch of designs that have to work with one another, it inspires an effort at perfection, or at any rate at a level of polish and finish that you would find in other design of lasting objects: archicture, industrial design, fabric design.\n\nAnother thing is that it is a great art, as well as a craft. The Chinese know this as they rate calligraphy even higher than painting, I believe. Of course type design is not calligraphy, as the challenges are quite different. But they share the fascination of abstract symbols which mean nothing in themselves that come together to express every nuance of thought and color of passion of humanity. When these some together with an artistic beauty, as well as serviceable craft, the result is quite wonderful.\n\nThe fact that type design is much less appreciated than architecture is, I think, just a matter of general ignorance. To me type design is a great art that is both invisible to the public, and moves them for much of their day—a wierd and fascinating combination.\n\nAt TypeCon I observed that type design is one of the not so many things that people want to do for its own sake, like music and poetry. It is just so enjoyable and satisfying that they do it first, and and then try to figure out a way to make a living out of it second.\n\n"

As in Internal politics. As in Why do typo-nuts disagree with such intensity? As in ’After all it’s only type...’ That kind of thing.\n\nOr was she thinking about historical political use ( like when Communist china created simplified characters & Taiwan kept their older more complicated characters) or current geopoltics. Each of these would be a valid angle to persue. But I wonder what SHE means.\n\n\\> 2. Why do so many typographers have manifestos?\n\nControversy is a long free advertisement - and we don’t have big ad budgets. It worked for artists & art movements - so why not us?\n\n\\> 3. If typography is so important, how come some many people ignore it?\n\nHrant’s answer is excellent. I can only add that many many really important things work without our realizing they are there or that they are working. electricity, radio, sewers, the internet & the list goes on. And most people further have no idea how they work. That doesn’t stop them for taking full advantage though. Or wailing when they go away. I for one \\*adore\\* indoor plumbing. Can you imagine being denied the use of writing?\n\nBut Type isn’t just writing. Type works two ways: It communicates what is being said but then it goes further & communicates how it’s being said. The initial instance is assumed & is a baseline. Types do it with different degrees of success in different media, environments, cultures & individials. Type design is & should be influenced by this purpose. The second instance is more subtle & more culturally bound. People read type style (and facility with the use of type) like they do fashion - they take it too mean something without noticing that they are making a judgement. Is that important? Only to the degree that you want or need to communicate really effectively. For you or me it may be of marginal importance. In contrast for Advertisers and Media companies it means a very great deal.\n\n"

Those who aren’t passionate probably wouldn’t bother. Though, on the flip side, would it really be so great without so many passionate people involved?\n\nAlso, once you’re awakened to the finer points of type and typography, you see it _everywhere_ because many cultures plaster type all over everything (ususally ads). So imagine if you were exposed to your pet peeves over and over all day long. I’ve had friends who are not designers or typographers become aware of things like typefaces and kerning (letterspacing), and now they can’t stop noticing it. It really is like a sickness, but a wonderful one.\n\nThe pervasive nature of type and typography also means that awareness and mastery of it is directly tied to one’s ability to effectively communicate (and persuade) others. It can feel very empowering to know that simply how you _organize and characterize_ your words can make them more powerful/effective. It’s subtle, but that’s part of its power: flying below people’s radar, straight to their minds.\n\nPlus, it’s got creative, aesthetic, and expressive components, which are inherently emotional and therefore passionate.\n\n<cite>1. When is typography political?</cite>\n\nSee [Jan Tschichold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051630/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Tschichold), or the more concise [Typophile wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051630/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jan%20Tschichold).\n\n<cite>2. Why do so many typographers have manifestos?</cite>\n\nFew people listen to discussions of typography unless you shout and over-simplify. Just like politics. Also, it’s a bunch of passionate people who spend long periods alone fidgeting with minutae. That can make one...very emphatic.\n\n<cite>3. If typography is so important, how come some many people ignore it?</cite>\n\nThe typewriter and the computer. The typewriter made ’typesetting’ accessible to the general masses while simultaneously obliterating it. Then, the computer eventually brought back all of the controls and visuals to people who had typewriter-based knowledge, making sophisticated typography appear ’easy’ and ’automated’. Now, everyone’s mother believes they can typeset simply by spilling copy into a word processor. Technically they’re correct, but that’s akin to saying “I’m a pressman” because you own and maintain a laser printer.\n\nAnd what Hrant said.\n\n"

Type is small, but every letter is multiplied thousands of times,so the slightest blunder is amplified by multiplication and looks bad. Of course you need the personality to meet those demands. But being insane is not a \\*requirement\\* :)\n\nThere are analogies in other crafts. In cabinet making, if you join two pieces of wood, you have a certain tolerance—you can go plus or minus a certain distance from your mark (1/16”?), and it won’t matter. If you are machining two pieces of metal to fit together, the tolerance is less. Is joining metal more ’obsessive’? I would say just that the demands of the crafts are different.\n\nGraphic design—which chooses and lays out type, among other things—is on a bigger scale than type design, so the tolerances are a little greater, like wood vs metal.\n\n"

It is more like plumbing in that we’re working a level deeper than graphic design. We’re making the tools graphic designers use. The only reason the tools work is because people are passionate about them, even in the face of disinterest. A home owner may appreciate good carpentry and even know who the carpenter was, and a carpenter may appreciate a well designed hammer, but neither of them ask who designed the hammer. And they’d be even less interested in who designed the nail the hammer was used on.\n\n2) We really have no idea what we’re doing. Just how do little marks on a page transmit thought? Makes no sense really. We have a pretty good idea what happens up to the back of the eyeball, and we know what parts of the brain translate the information, but how on earth can you read a line of Shakespeare and understand what went through the mind of a man who died a few hundred years before you existed? And yet we know how to make those little marks have meaning in relation to this process and what we do in designing typefaces really matters in the reading process. Something has to be built into the human brain that makes it possible for people to design type by intuitition.

Their passion is fundamental to their human condition—-their musical human condition. It’s vital and necessary to their art and the crafting of their music. Their craft produces their art. The same applies to every writer and actor I know personally. Likewise the task of designing fine typefaces demands attention to small details.\n\nThe obsessive-compulsive syndrome applies to some type designers but not others. We don’t all function that way.

The desire to complete each font provides some of the motivation I need to overcome the challenge of repetition. The remaining impetus comes from an innate _passion_ for what I’m doing. This passion is an intuitive and natural emotional response to the art. Passion is a large part of every artist’s _inner life_, and becomes a significant part of our real lives. Artists are as artists do.\n\nIn short, it’s an abiding interest.\n\nNon-artist friends say I am “obsessed” with art & design. What crap. They simply don’t understand what they’re talking about. They have a much lower tolerance than I do for dealing with repetitive detail—-and I thought my pains for infinite repetition were low(!) I don’t share the enthusiasm my friend has for classic sports cars, but it would never occur to me to label him “obsessed”; they’re just his passion, and only one part of a balanced domestic life. “Obsessed” implies complete absorption by a single activity. The same passion-not-obsession applies to the themes I pursue in the fonts I make. Those who think I am obsessed with futurism and linear design fail to comprehend that those are just the themes that interest me—-the material I have the most enthusiasm for. Why does it have to be “obsession”?\n\nBecause people say it is.\n\nNot for me, thanks.\n\n_Of course you need the personality to meet those demands._  \nPractitioners don’t necessarily “need” that kind of personality, but it certainly helps. You need it to produce fonts full-time for a living.\n\nOne thing that concerns me is the loose wielding of the term “obsessive-compulsive” by graphic designers, type designers, laypeople, journalists—-by just about everybody in relation to type and graphic designers. Apparently there are two kinds of [obsessive-compulsive](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051630/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive_compulsive) syndrome. 1)&nbsp;Obsessive-compulsive disorder; 2)&nbsp;Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. I call it a “syndrome” because I believe “disorder” is a misguided and unfair label, and a misapprehension of the phenomenon. Only since the invention of analytical psychiatry in the 20th century has this kind behavioral tendency (or personality trait, take your pick) been called a disorder. In all pre-20th century recorded history the “O-C-afflicted” were called, simply, artists, artisans, craftsmen and technicians. Calling their behaviour a disorder implies some kind of malfunction, or that the person is somehow defective—-a potentially fatuous insult to those who happen to fit the syndrome.\n\n_The fact that type design is much less appreciated than architecture is, I think, just a matter of general ignorance._\n\nTrue. But how did this state of affairs come to be?\n\nType is a passive experience; architecture is an interactive one. Type is a reflexive shaper of human condition; architecture is the practical cradle of everyday living (the human condition).\n\nType and lettering are as visible as architecture, but people are not forced to deal with lettering consciously or mechanically. We read text, absorb the message and emotional resonance suggested by the type style—-and we’re done. The experience takes place largely inside our minds. Type is everywhere, and subliminal, existing as embedded virtualities†, but we don’t live inside fonts or interact with them the way we dwell in and outside buildings, and interact with architecture. To read the title on a book cover and sense the emotional impulse of the typography I don’t have to interact with it physically, or manipulate it mechanically in any way, or be conscious of typography’s hidden mechanisms. Pretending to be a lay person for a moment: To enter my house I have to open and close the front gate, and the front door (architecture is practical). To get to the kitchen or the bathroom I have to negotiate the hallway. The house is an object of architectural design I interact with on a personal wavelength, forming a close familiarity over many years.\n\nThe non-typographer/non-designer rarely has anything to do with typographic design, whereas a large percentage of lay people acquire at least a passing familiarity with architecture by building or renovating houses, and from living in them. For non-typographers, type is not necessarily a personal experience, but more frequently a mass experience. Fonts are served up to the public by designers in automatic fashion. Lay persons do not acquire or seek particular fonts on the products they buy‡; they are not given a choice (in commercial artwork). Whereas specific architecture is chosen and sought out by lay people and designers alike, and it’s a manual, individual, personal affair. Can I choose the font used for the titles of a movie I want to watch? Nope. Its design is a form of mass-produced industrial art—-take it or leave it, whole. If I watch the movie I’m forced to take it. But if I don’t like the architectural details of the house I’m buying I can force the architect to change those details instead of choosing another house.\n\nArchitecture is customizable—-typography is consumed unaltered.\n\nThe buildings we work in determine our human condition too. When an artfully-designed office building from an earlier century is demolished and replaced with a sterile, soulless, featureless lump clad in mirror glass outside and stainless steel inside, the change exerts an impact on the people forced to work in the replacement building with its dubious architectural value\\*. It changes their view of architecture, cultivating awareness and cognition of architectural design.\n\n† If I remember correctly, _embedded virtuality_ is a term coined by Xerox PARC and MIT media lab researchers to describe software running on personal computers (desktop, palmtop & wearables), as a replacement term for the cyberdelic meta-twaddle “virtual reality”, which does not exist as such, ie: “virtual reality” is a fanciful term because it isn’t realistic yet.\n\n‡ Then again, the products consumers choose to buy are partly determined by packaging and advertising typography, allowing them to choose fonts in a sense.\n\n\\* What choice are we given? Accept working in the stainless steel casket or find a job in another building with spirit. Some workers report feeling dehumanized or culturally impoverished by bland modern and post-modern architecture.\n\n_So, typographer; pornographer. Mere coincidence? I think not…_\n\nIf you’re joking, fine :^) If not, the connection is superficial and purely philological. What about photographer, biographer, cartographer, oceanographer? The only thing these terms have in common is the suffix “ograph” meaning “of a graphic or visual nature”. No meaningful coincidence, just philological verismilitude.\n\n_When is typography political?_\n\nWhen the German Kaiser Maximilian I commissioned Fraktur (a blackletter) for use as a standard font thruout Germany to displace the antiqua style of the Italian area typographers. Antiqua had rapidly displaced blackletter thruout Europe as the standard font for printing with moveable type soon after the center of printing shifted from Mainz to Venice. Fraktur was Maximilian’s way of reasserting Germanic national identity. The plan failed because he did not follow it thru; during his lifetime the Fraktur face was only used to print books for the Kaiser’s personal library.\n\nTypography was political again in Germany during the reign of the National Socialists. Once again the schizm was between blackletter and roman type styles. The Nazis outlawed the use of all Blackletters, spuriously declaring them an invention of the Jews. Blackletters had been in continuous use and development from the Gothic medieval period until the 1930’s. The Nazi vilification of Blackletters stigmatized them as “impure” and “non-Aryan”, an unwanted aberration in their classical Teutonic scheme. That stigmatization has had a lasting negative effect on Blackletters right up to the present. Presently blackletters remain far more common in Germany than other countries, but nowhere near as popular as they were pre-Nazi. They continue to suffer an association with Nazism similar to the Swastika—-an ancient, innocent symbol before the Nazis borrowed and used it so prominently.\n\n_A home owner may appreciate good carpentry and even know who the carpenter was, and a carpenter may appreciate a well designed hammer, but neither of them ask who designed the hammer. And they’d be even less interested in who designed the nail the hammer was used on._\n\nCarpentry, hammers and nails are only components in architecture and cannot be considered architectural design.\n\nHow about the architecture of a home? Some home owners at least, take an interest the in the architectural style and detail of the dwelling they live in, choosing one style of architecture over another. And what about people who add extensions to their homes? Some decision about appropriate architecture has to be made to avoid reducing the value of the home by adding an extension in a conflicting style.\n\n_We really have no idea what we’re doing._\n\nReally? (We?) Okay...as a writer and a designer of advertising, and a type designer, I know precisely what I’m doing and exactly how I do it.\n\n_Just how do little marks on a page transmit thought?_\n\nBy way of language. Written language and the semantic meaning of words. Words and combinations of words embody emotions, ideas, thoughts, and human experience, codified in language and literary conventions we learn by studying and agreeing on their meaning. It’s called philology, writing and literature. No mystery.\n\nThe “little marks on a page” don’t transmit thought; language and writing codifiy thought, and typography verbalizes it in visual form. We decode the visual form by reading the text and rationalizing its content.\n\n_We have a pretty good idea what happens up to the back of the eyeball, and we know what parts of the brain translate the information, but how on earth can you read a line of Shakespeare and understand what went through the mind of a man who died a few hundred years before you existed?_\n\nBy cognition and ratiocination of what he wrote, and comparison with our own life experience. You read the text, perceive the narrative, then rationalize its meaning by deduction, comparing the bard’s thoughts with your personal memories. Everyone knows what a poobah (king) is, not to mention jealousy, love, hatred and rivalry—-all common themes in Shakespeare and other literature.\n\nThe style of a roman text font used to print a literary work has little bearing on how printed words and their meaning are perceived. Text fonts are primarily functional machines. Set it in Caslon, Bembo, Clarendon, or something else close to the antiqua model...the “voice” of a text font at text point sizes doesn’t make much difference to meaning, as long as it’s readable. The inflection and voice of a specific type style only comes into its own in display typography.\n\nIn a broad sense, Shakespeare’s mind is understood through the semantic content of his writing. To grasp the full import requires specific knowledge of the historical figures, periods and politics he wrote about. The bard’s work is densely layered in the extreme. People without that historical knowledge who say they understand Shakespeare are kidding themselves to varying degrees. Only readers equipped with the background knowledge can understand his work with accuracy and completeness.\n\nOkay Shakespeare lovers—-kick my arse.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "_Carpentry, hammers and nails are only components in architecture and cannot be considered architectural design._\n\nSorry, that’s a harsh interpretation. To be more precise: carpentry _can be_ an element in architecture, but is more typically a component or sub-building block. Architecture is made up of elements: wall, roof, door, widow, column, frame, post, lintel, pediment, architrave, plinth, stylobate, frieze, etc. When these elements are made of wood, carpentry is a method of fabrication. Nails are materials, and hammers are sub-tools that never become components in finished architecture—-unless the builder is a surrealist (an appealing idea, imagine a hammer permanently fixed in a wall as part of the architecture :^).\n\nSeveral people have compared fonts to tools. Vis-à-vis designers use fonts as tools and a form of visual plumbing that “powers” communication arts. But fonts are more than tools or plumbing—-fonts consist of detailed ready-made artwork that designers use as both tools and major elements in graphic design. That makes fonts analogous to **machines**. Like cars for example: cars are tools of transport, and also elements of lifestyle, industrially-designed sculpture prized for their aesthetic as well as their practical value (as tools). Fonts fulfill a similar role in communication design—-aesthetic machines.\n\n_...my own lack of articulation and imagination._\n\nJosh, you founded Tyopgraphica.

Most of today’s popular blackletter fonts are just digitations of the **display** sizes of centuries-old designs…\n\n"

Unfortunately, I can’t go into tremendous detail here on a public forum, but please stay tuned. Professionally and privately, I’ve got a few plans that will come out later this year._\n\nCool. I’ll wait patiently. This is a good sign.\n\n_...although these later are display fonts, and not real blackletters, per se_\n\n[Rhodaelian](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007051630/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/rhodaelian/) is a display font too, and a step in the right direction, I think, towards bringing blackletter closer to roman forms. When I started designing it its spec was to be a classy Compacta challenger with millenial smarts influenced by the current sculpted, chiselled style of automotive body design. When it was finished I realized the sharp corners combined with Rhodealian’s rigourous modularity to make it a contemporary blackletter (with lower contrast than traditional blackletters). Not what I set out to do, but I love the result. “Happy accident”? No, more like bending and pushing within an established discipline resulting in expansion of that discipline.\n\nShuould I post a Rhodie sample on this thread?\n\nI’m certain I could make a text-friendly version.\n\n_To think that it is not in a vendor’s best interest to support blackletter is silly._\n\nI didn’t assume that is the case, if that’s what you mean. Whatever, I was looking for ways to make a blackletter renaissance viable; it needs commercial support.\n\n_Some vendors are sitting a top large piles of blackletters fonts that no one buys or uses._\n\nYeah, its such a stupid waste.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Nobody has any moral obligation to it. If somebody has a new idea on how to use blackletter that is useful or appealing today, then great, go for it. Otherwise forget it. As I said earlier, though type design has been influenced by politics, the design of letters is not inherently political. Not everything is moral or political Hrant, and that is one of the charms of type. Lighten up.\n\n"

Type lives in context, and although type can almost always adapt to new contexts, the world does always go on, in both good ways and bad.\n\nNevertheless, my little corner of the world has seen some of the most creative blackletters developed right inside of it (I’m not talking about Germany itself, rather just the Main-Rhine region around Frankfurt etc.). I’d hate to see that disappear permanently. I think that designers have a responsibility to preserve the visual culture around them, but it other designers don’t do this, I can’t force them. For instance if central Indiana has a great historical design scene that up and dies, I’m not about to be the one to step in and save it. Everyone has their own borders.\n\n"
