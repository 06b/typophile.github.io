I'm looking for the typeface  \nused on the album cover to 'All my friends are dead'.\n\nAnother example of a similar style I'm looking for is on the book cover to 'The Heart Keeper'.\n\nI havn't yet been able to find either in my academy's library.\n\nI don't know if there are many free typefaces like this but anything in the right direction would be appreciated!\n\nThanks, O\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [105815.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123033734/http:/typophile.com/files/105815.jpg) | 48.04 KB |\n| [n213250.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123033734/http:/typophile.com/files/n213250.jpg) | 25.4 KB |\n\n",
