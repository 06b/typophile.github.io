  "content": "A particular logo contest site has some stiff rules regarding clip art: it not allowed in any way shape or form. Which is interesting given that fonts are used freely and they are without a doubt, at least half of the design factor. One can understand the underlying need for rules, but it seems to omit that typography has any issues of license. Any thoughts on the matter?\n\n",
