      "content": "Are you saying that there shouldn't be Hebrew font designs that are made of angles? Then should there be no Russian fonts that have curves in them, or no Chinese fonts without stroke contrast? You can make any sort of design for any sort of language, as long as it's readable. I think this is quite good; I like the round-cornered counters inside square shapes. However, other than to respond to Prakash Nair's post, I'm not really going to be able to offer you anything. (Sorry to get your hopes up for a good critique)\n\n"

      "content": "My Hebrew is weak, so I'm not the best to comment. But to me the lamed and kof are hard to read at first as those letters, the aleph looks awkward, and pe seems odd in being closed. To me this just feels awkward and not knitting together as one aleph-bet, but I may be off base. Ask Israeli designers for a more expert opinion.\n\n"

      "content": "hey!  \nthank you for your commnts.  \ni guess that the reason that some of the letters are a little bit different is to experiment how much can i stretch the use of them and still be able to understand them. it is still beeing checked (thow the alef - was used to be flipped even in earlier versions of hebrew). what i am trying to give to the magazine is its own character by using bold, propaganda type.  \nanyway more comment are welcome (form of the letters, how to build the numbers, is the angles - rounded and square are working together? etc.).  \nthanks  \ndani\n\n"

      "content": "deshvil,\n\nMy main critique is that while the majority of letters are quite  \nconventional, there are a few that are bizarre (peh, quf & lamed).  \nI don't think that you can create a style by changing a few letters.\n\nThe features that create the style should be applied to the  \nmajority of the letters.  \nThis is rough critism for sure because it goes down to basics but  \nI don't want to discourage you.\n\nMuch depends of the subject of the magazine. What kind of \"atitude\"  \nwill the magazine have?  \n(Back in the sixties, many trendy magazines were almost impossible  \nto read because of the desire of the font designer to be different)  \nKeep at it!\n\nMike  \ncunliffethompson.com/font\n\n"
