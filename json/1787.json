  "content": "I'm working on a logotype for a company whose name consists of 20 characters across three words. The client would like the design to be entirely horizontal (without line breaks). It will need to work across a variety of media including web, signage, vehicles (vans), clothing, and print (mostly flyers & brochures).   \n   \nMy initial thought was that a heavy, black, or extra condensed sans face would be best due to the many characters (22 with spaces). I'm also leaning toward all caps and italics for reasons having to due with evenness (type color) and the brand's strong associations with movement/motion/activity.   \n   \nWhile I'm able to see what looks good on screen and at 1200dpi from my B&W laser, I'm somewhat unsure about the implications of the aforementioned typographic choices when it comes to the other media I mentioned (esp. signage & vehicles).   \n   \nHowever, when I set the type in a gothic (not condensed) place it next to a black condensed sans and pump up the point size - my eye is definitely drawn to the gothic from way across the room.   \n   \nHence, I leave my query with the Oracle at Typophile in hopes that I may be enlightened.\n\n",

Might also experiment with a condensed face if in all caps. You might also propose using the Initials of the Company as the logo and use the name small under them. Your example would be BCC large and Bike Cruiser Company small.\n\n"

Not as accurate as James' method, but it's cheaper & quicker & it'll get you in the ballpark. A really long logo like that is difficult to work with; if nothing else, a photoshop demo will show your client what challenges you are up against if your logo has a 14:1 width-to-height ratio.   \n   \nYou could also present your logo in 3 versions, printed matter, \"outdoor\" & web. All 3 media have different issues, so it's appropriate to have 3 solutions, i.e., one line for printed matter, 3 lines for \"outdoor\", & a less-bold version for web.\n\n"
