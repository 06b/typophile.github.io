All I've done is set their name in a typeface that I thought they'd like... is that common? I feel like I'm getting off really easy on this one, but, the examples of logos they showed me all looked like they'd been done the same way.

      "content": "It's conservative, if that's the impression the client wants to project. It is closer to what I might expect from a law firm.   \n   \nArchitecture is an interesting field to design for (I made some signage for an architect who had her office next to Tiro for several years). On the one hand, architects need to project competence and reliability -- to reassure people that their buildings will stand up --, which suggests a conservative treatment, but on the other hand they need to be seen as creative and innovative.   \n   \nWhat kind of architecture does this firm practice? If it is mainly domestic, the appropriate design might be quite different from that for a firm that specialises in offices or commercial properties. Do they favour particular construction techniques or materials?   \n   \nWhatever the answer to these questions, I suspect that Minion is a poor choice of typeface. I would look for something less common and with more presence. Minion is not a bad text typeface (although it is overused), but it has too little character for a logo. Andy Crewdson memorably called Minion 'the typeface without qualities'.   \n   \nPersonally, I would be tempted to deconstruct the fleuron. You could render it as an outline, in pencil, as an architectural plan, perhaps including some guidelines or measurement lines. You could even get a bit cubist, and try to combined a plan and elliptical projection of the fleuron into a single image. Lots of possibilities.\n\n"

(specifically image 3) All that can be found/read in _Dwell_ magazine.   \n  \nHowever if your firm is not so rigid and/or experimental then you could choose a softer sans. Anisette Petite caps for instance.   \n  \nBut, definitely not a book publishers face.\n\n"

Sans-serif!   \n   \nAbout TMA : TMA does both commercial and residential architecture, renovation & design.   \n   \nI've seen logos/company names that are in all lower-case and have even heard it argued that a company name set in all lower-case is more humble & approachable. I'm wondering if you think that approach would work with this, where the company's name is also a persons name... has this rule been broken? Could I break it anyway? I'll admit that my reason for wanting all lower-case is that I like the way it looks.   \n   \nHere's the latest :   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203556im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7765.gif)   \n   \nComments?\n\n"
