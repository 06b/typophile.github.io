  "content": "In August 2008 someone from Brest, France bought my font Logotypia Pro from MyFonts:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/logotypia-pro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123200727/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/logotypia-pro/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fdi/logotypia-pro/\")\n\nThat same person is also registered for the website of a type foundry from Brest, France:  \n [http://www.gasoligne.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123200727/http:/www.gasoligne.com/ \"http://www.gasoligne.com/\")\n\nOne month after the purchase a new font is released at this foundry:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gasoligne/urqinoa/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123200727/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/gasoligne/urqinoa/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gasoligne/urqinoa/\")\n\nEvery glyph was modified more or less, but looking at the character map there is no doubt, that this font is directly based on the digital data of my font Logotypia Pro. They even kept all my beginner's mistakes from 2004.\n\nHere is an overlay of both fonts:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123200727im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bild12_3455.png)\n\nSo, if you are a typedesigner, please have a look at their [current](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123200727/http:/www.gasoligne.com/download.htm) and [future](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123200727/http:/www.gasoligne.com/in_progress.htm) designs to check if one of your fonts was also ripped off.\n\n",

Aside from Chris' jokes, the things that comes out of Uli's mouth are truly the most humorous around here.\n\nI, too, find the sudden disappearance of the foundry and their fonts somewhat telling. I have been in touch with \"our friend\" over at Gasoligne, and he is making some interesting and ridiculous claims on this issue. I advised him that if he wants to defend himself and has nothing to hide, he should consider participating here as well as offline with other parties involved.\n\n"

      "content": "Wow, what have I started here!? ;-)\n\nOn the matter of inspiration vs. rip-offs:  \nThere is no useful font without inspiration from other typefaces. We always built our work on other peoples work. But that's not the point here. In every little detail, in every curve and anchor point of Logotypia Pro I made lots of design decisions. No other type designer would make these choices in an identical way, even if this person would digitize my font from a print-out. So when I look at the font mentioned in the first post, I clearly see a font, that was build from the outlines of Logotypia Pro. This is a violation of the End User License Agreement and must be stopped. It's not a question of an \"inspired\" type design.  \nI contacted the Gasoligne foundry and they took their website down within minutes after my email and also asked MyFonts to remove the fonts. There is nothing more for me to ask for. I don't know if their other fonts are rip-offs. That's why the title of this thread has a question mark and that's why I asked other designers to have a look at the Gasoligne fonts.\n\nI also knew the name and address of the Gasoligne owner when I started this thread, but there was no need to point this information out to anybody here. I have no reason to denunciate or defame the Gasoligne owner in any way aside from the (to me obvious) case of Logotypia vs. Urqinoa. He has made a mistake and he has reacted as quickly as possible when it came to light. So I'm fine with that and I don't hold a grudge against him (any more). We all make mistakes sometimes, don't we?\n\n"
