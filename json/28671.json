Oxford University Press, 1966. This was two lists of the twelve typefaces most frequently appearing in the National Book League's Annual Exhibition (of just over 800 books per exhibition) in the postwar years in England.\n\nFrom 1945-55, in ranking order; Bembo, Baskerville, Times, Fournier, Imprint, Perpetua, Walbaum, Garamond, Bell, Plantin, Poliphilus, Caslon.\n\nFrom 1956-63, in ranking order; Bembo, Baskerville, Plantin, Times, Fournier, Poliphilus, Garamond, Bell, Ehrhardt, Imprint, Walbaum, Caslon.\n\nThe author goes on to say that the top two of these accounted for more than one third of the books exhibited, Bembo being used for over 50% more books than Baskerville, and Baskerville in turn, being used for over 50% more books than Times, it's nearest rival over the whole period.\n\nFor my part, please note that Arial, Comic Sans, Courier, Franklin Gothic, Gill Sans, Helvetica, Univers, Verdana etc. appear nowhere here. But then these lists are really just about pre-digital British book typography.\n\n"

As Larry Oppenberg put it to me, they were the 'Microsoft' of its day, dominating the market. Monotype actually had a small portion of the market, mainly a portion of the book market. Hence world wide a different list of Latin faces would be relevant. Also if you just look at sheer volume of print, probably newspaper typefaces from Linotype would dominate.\n\n"

My one time client-from-hell actually insisted that a magazine ad campaign headline be set in Courier. I offered detailed explanations and many alternatives, but to no avail. Everyone thought the prepress department had loused up, and it stayed that way for months.\n\nAs for _Hence all the Monotype faces?_ well sure, I said those lists were specific to a time and place; William and Thierry make the same point.

It did have a Baskerville. By the way, I suspect that Ben's list was first edition hard back books. If you looked at paperbacks in that period--which probably sold more--I think Times New Roman would be much higher on the British list.\n\n"
