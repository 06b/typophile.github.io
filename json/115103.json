But I think that image just combined with some different fonts.. cos i have try using Din it's quite match with that but some letters like A, M, J, don't mate with the image.

Most of them do not have a slant of exactly 10 degrees and the mismatch becomes obvious.  \nDon\n\n"

[Feliciano](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402035144/http:/www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/flama?page=5) shows the right set. So, again, sorry for the confusion. Flama it is!\n\n"
