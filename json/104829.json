I've been looking around, but I can't find anything (likely to be my total lack of understanding of Chinese/Chinese Alphabets!).\n\nMany thanks.\n\n",

A Traditional Chinese typeface would be useless if you need to render a Simplifed Chinese text and vice versa.\n\nHow long is the text? If it is short enough, modifying an existing non-stencil typeface may be an option.\n\nIt feels like there ought to be a stencil typeface for Chinese, but I can't find one despite looking through several foundries' offerings. I'm not familiar with Chinese typefaces in general, though.\n\n"
