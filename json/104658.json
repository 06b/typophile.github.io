The name of similar typeface's would also be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232751im_/http:/typophile.com/files/thawkfont_6216.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Really doubt it could be a font, more probably a custom lettering for Powell & Peralta Tony Hawk deck. You could find [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232751/http:/weandthecolor.com/custom-typeface-design-by-macfadden-thorpe/17218) a complete alphabet by [McFadden & Thorpe](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232751/http:/www.macfaddenandthorpe.com/) and based on the classic 80's Tony Hawk deck.  \nFor the rest, if you still need it as vector, that could be pretty easy to trace it from any [big sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232751/http:/i1.ytimg.com/vi/TxfgqHnoyJo/maxresdefault.jpg) or even redraw it as it is blocky/squarish and only made with straight lines (no curves). You don't even need to be strict with lines and alignments as the original drawing looks a bit clumsy.  \nSome candidates for customization (more or less work): [Bionic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232751/http:/www.dafont.com/bionic-type.font), [Squarefont](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828232751/http:/www.dafont.com/squarefont.font)\n\n"
