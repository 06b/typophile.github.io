Its encoding as character U+00A0 makes it 'special' -- and only if the software it is used with _does_ use this for what's it been assigned a code point to.\n\nFairly modern software, such as Adobe InDesign, doesn't really _need_ a hardwired fixed space, it can emulate its behavior.\n\nDoes your font license allow modification?\n\n"
