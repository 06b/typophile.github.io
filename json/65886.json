Instead its top is around three-quarters of the distance between the x line and the cap line, and the bottom around the same between the baseline and the descender line. This leaves the /a/ part floating in space around the centre of the x-height, which looks fine to me.

Koreans (and Japanese, I think) often make use of circled letters, and Thai numerals or Japanese hiragana contain many symbols containing a circular-swash-like element. So to me, what distinguishes \"@\" from an array of other similar symbols—indeed, the most characteristic trait—is the central \"a\" component.\n\nI remember seeing other Koreans writing \"@\" as simply a circled \"a\".

Just because in my mind \"@\" is inextricably connected to \"a\" doesn't mean that just any \"a\"/\"A\" with a circular swash makes an \"@\".

But really, you have to understand how fond Koreans are of using circled letters (both Hangul and Latin) and numerals to see why I am even talking about this.

Now that I think of it, I've noted in the past looking at sign-up sheets and such that this is how the vast majority of Koreans write the @ in e-mail addresses; I was the type geek who insisted on a proper connected @ form. I can't even recall seeing another Korean who writes the @ like I do, although surely I can't be the only one.\n\nThe lesson, I think, is that we should keep in mind that how one sees a character is often more culture-dependent than one might think. Something to keep in mind when we discuss the designs of glyphs like the @ or numerals, asterisk, daggers, and such.\n\n"
