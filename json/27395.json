  "content": "I am trying to figure out a way to render typography into a 3D plane. I am able to do it in photoshop by rasterizing the text and then transforming its perspective. I have also tried it in Illustrator using the 3D effect. I am not completely happy with my results yet. I would prefer to take a text frame and put it into perspective and then have the ability to edit the copy.\n\nHas anyone had any great luck at this? Should I try 3D software.... if so which one?\n\nbest,  \njosh\n\n",

A good place to start for price/features is the open source 3d app Blender [[http://blender.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019021000/http:/blender.org/ \"http://blender.org\") ], but it will take a while to figure out the interface.\n\n"
