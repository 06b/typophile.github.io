      "content": "Big news for a lot of anxious people.   \n   \nIs this legal? Anyway, if the publisher of the print version didn't think they could make money on a reprint, then they probably don't care. On the other hand, they could have gained some positive exposure by releasing the PDFs themselves, maybe even selling the book in PDF form - FontLab does that with their manuals. So a small lesson for MIS Press.   \n   \nBTW, it's interesting that the text is text, not image. That might mean OCR was done, which would make it more work. Or maybe somebody provided the original digital files? One clue would be the body font: from what I remember Moye had modified Goudy's Italian Old-Style (giving the \"y\" a longer tail), and an OCR scheme wouldn't have that (unless the person had that special font)... And the PDFs seem to be using the non-Moye short tailed version.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Why are there so conspicously few typrographic software programs? And why is it that the main one (Fontographer) hasnt been updated for the best part of a decade and is no longer distibuted by Macromedia? Why is there only one(?) reference manual available for it and why has its publisher stoppped publishing it and mysteriously refuses to pass on the rights etc? Is there some kind of conspiracy going on? The truth must be out there...?\n\n"

Partly \\*because\\* of Fontographer (the so-called \"democratization\" of type design), but maybe also because their file-size is so small. Some people also blame a certain low perceived value among the public (the alphabet is free, blahblahblah), but I've started to think that such \"high-level\" cultural stuff is a side-effect, not a cause.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Democratization is a threat to some, especially large corporations to whom it represents a general lack of control. You'd think there would be a lot of demand for a program like Fontographer, after all most of us still use it right? Enough demand for the continued developement of it at least? Why is large corporation not acting like large corporation and going where money is? Does Adobe have a font developer program? Not that I know of(?) Arent they one of the biggest names in digital typography AND software developement? hmm...   \n   \n(hope this doesnt sound like paranoia, its just something thats always bugged me)\n\n"

Since the time of its publication MIS Press was absorbed by Hungry Minds and now Wiley Publishing and Wiley has no intention of selling them back or reprinting the book.   \n   \nThis puts Mr. Moye in a bad situation since he doesn't legally own the content and cannot buy the rights to the book back.   \n   \nI had tried many times to contact Mr. Moye and he blacklisted me from his e-mail list apparently not interested in discussing the matter at all.   \n   \nI would genuinely like to see a follow up to this book and even a re-release since the information the book contains is as useful now as it was when it was originally published.   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

A little here and a little there may add up faster than you'd think.   \n   \nIt seems like there could be two distinct efforts: one to tackle the technical, application-specific workflow, and the other to address the design issues, like making properly proportioned small caps, kerning sensibly, etc. Personally, I would be more interested in the former, as the latter is often very subjective, so forums like this perhaps better serve that realm.\n\n"

This means that it would be legal in some jurisdictions for you to go to a library and photocopy the entirety of _Fontographer: type by design_.   \n   \nHowever, I'm not aware of any jurisdiction in which it is legal to _publish_, i.e. to make public, a work without obtaining rights from the copyright holder. Making a PDF version of a book available on the Internet for other people to view and download is not the same thing as making a copy of the book for your own personal use: it is publishing. The fact that a book is out of print does not mean that it is out of copyright, and it is neither legal nor ethical to _publish_ someone else's work without permission.   \n   \nYes, Moye's book is out of print, but that doesn't mean it is not available. Copies show up in second hand bookshops, on Ebay, etc.\n\n"

You'd have to do that even if it's just a reprint of the existing one, of course, to make your current actions even vaguely ethical (they'd still be illegal, of course).   \n   \nT\n\n"

But I, too, searched for this book and ended up finding a copy in the library, and resorted to photocopying the first three chapters. As far as I know, the website where the PDF version is posted isn't charging any money for viewing the PDFs -- how different from the library is that? And it's not even a good PDF, as parts of the book seem to have been scanned with OCR software, so that there are typos -- and those sections don't use the same font as the book, so the text doesn't justify properly, etc. If the book was available somewhere, at a reasonable price (not the 200+ dollars they are asking for on some websites, which I can't afford!), I'd buy it in a second.\n\n"
