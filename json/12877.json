  "content": "Hello there, this is my first post.\n\nMy scan is from a German Cookbook (Die Küche Indonesiens).  \nIt’s set in two characteristic fonts (two, I believe) that play together very well (and with the theme “Indonesia”, also) and look simply gorgeous.  \nCan you help me?\n\nBy the way, I am one of the “lurkers” Hrant has addressed recently.  \nIt’s not that I feel I was lurking around the Typophile boards, it’s more like I’m interested in typography, not professionally though, and the best place to learn something is where the “professionals” discuss, ie here. An amateur like me isn’t exactly capable of establishing a well-founded point in your highly sophisticated discussions, that’s why I’m not participating.  \nBut I do enjoy reading them very much. Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [küche-indonesiens.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709003805/http:/typophile.com/files/k%C3%BCche-indonesiens.jpg) | 81.47 KB |\n| [überschrift.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709003805/http:/typophile.com/files/%C3%BCberschrift.jpg) | 90.09 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Zaïre 74 - custom-designed logo {Patricia}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709003805/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12926 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) type used on iPod displays - Chicago \\> Myriad {Dav, Tim} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709003805/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12899 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Once you feel at ease, you can consider moving up to General Discussions, maybe by starting off with a question you might have. I can guarantee you it will be a lot more interesting and rewarding once you start participating.\n\n"

Plus it goes well with the Veljovic body text.\n\nI’ve uploaded another scan. Ideas?\n\nPS. Is it not possible to upload images in new comments?\n\n"
