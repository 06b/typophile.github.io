In 1999, EyeWire was acquired by Getty Images and later absorbed into the realm of the mothership. Finally in 2003 the Image Club library along with the EyeWire domain name was acquired by Fonts.com, who are now the exclusive distributors for the fonts. The Image Club clip art collection, as well as the remaining vestiges of the EyeWire stock imagery line, is still owned and distributed by Getty Images through various third party resellers.\n\n[Grant Hutchinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Grant%20Hutchinson) was one of many designers who created original typeface designs for the Image Club library. Others included [Patricia Lillie](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Patricia%20Lillie), [Jean McAllister](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jean%20McAllister), [Laurie McCanna](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Laurie%20McCanna), [Cathy Larson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cathy%20Larson), [Ty Semaka](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ty%20Semaka), [Calvin Glenn](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Calvin%20Glenn), [Dean Stanton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dean%20Stanton), [Noel Rubin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Noel%20Rubin), [Michael Allard](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Michael%20Allard), and [Lorne Maclean](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lorne%20Maclean).\n\nComment: <cite>\"I lived through all these changes... wish Image Club would still be around.\"</cite>\n\nGrant replies: <cite>\"It was a wild ride, to be sure. Image Club lives on... in my basement, on my hard drives, and at <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203552/http:/www.imageclub.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site</a> - which will eventually become a historical document of the company and the people who worked there.\"</cite>\n\n",
