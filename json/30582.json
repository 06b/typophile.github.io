You can use just about any sans serif typeface as a reference for what the alphabet looks like, if you forget the shape of some of the letters :-) Alternatively, for a more authentically inept vernacular look, perhaps it would help do be slightly unfamiliar with the alphabet, so you could try doing it totally plastered.\n\n"
