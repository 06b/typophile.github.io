The repeating \\_e\\_ and \\_o\\_ are not identical.  \nBut what font or fonts might have inspired the lettering?  \nAnd what fonts since then have this distinctive angular formal style?  \nVery interested in your ideas. Thanks.  \nDon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DeutscheGrammophon2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102614/http:/typophile.com/files/DeutscheGrammophon2.jpg) | 118.31 KB |\n\n",

The other fonts are also interesting.  \nIt occurred to me that this type of cursive lettering has some similarity to the angular cursive style of handwriting that was taught in German schools as Kurrentschrift [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102614/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurrent\")  \nBut Kurrent lacks the thick and thin character and is less regular.  \nI wonder if there are any more fonts in the Cabarga Cursiva genre?  \nDon\n\n"

Also the Cincinnati 1882 Script Text.  \nBB&S was a notorious font imitator, so I expect that digging through the competition might turn up more that are similar.  \nBig problem with the pre WW I font specimen books is that all one gets is a few phrases of the font in use rather than a character set. Tantalizing but not fulfilling.  \nYour research shows that this general idea was a font genre at least as far back as the 1880s. So digging might indeed be productive.  \nDon\n\n"
