  "content": "Okay all you InDesign experts: is there a way to override the typographic quote marks on a temporary basis from the keyboard in order to insert inch and foot marks?   \n   \nI realize that I can just insert them from the Type \\> Insert Glyphs... palette. But how tedious and clumsy is that?! In Quark (Mac) I could just use the control modifier key and type either control-' for a foot prime or shift-control-' for an inch double prime.   \n   \nAnything like this in InDD?   \n   \n-- K.\n\n",

Now hit ' and you'll see the change.   \n   \nLet me know if you have any problems.   \n   \nChris\n\n"
