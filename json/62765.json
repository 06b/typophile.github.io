[Ricotta](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135850/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000502#specimen), a fresh new ingredient for your packaging designs and [Cascabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135850/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/cascabel/), a modular modern font with multiples alternates.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135850im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophilericotta_6206.jpg)\n\nAbout [Ricotta](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135850/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000502#specimen)  \nAnother unmistakable Koziupa/Paul production, Ricotta has very little baby fat for a sturdy brush script. What movement it shows is effective and integral to its expression, which is at once compact, lush and eye-catching. Ricotta, and its subtle details in just the right places, should feel at home among the bright and cheerful colors of dairy product and pizza packaging.\n\nAbout [Cascabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135850/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/cascabel/)  \nCascabel was built on a modular harmony and creates visibly maze-like geometric structures. When typeset in complete words, it conveys an unmistakable architectural approach to a design project. Ideal for magazines, posters or flyers, Cascabel is an alphabet functionally defined by a concept similar to that of building blocks. Designed By Ariel Di Lisio and digitized by Ale Paul.\n\n",
