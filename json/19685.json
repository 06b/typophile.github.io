These are pretty much final revised system boards from class, so more of just a showcase rather than a critique. I'll answer questions as I don't really know what else to explain other than I drew my ideas from the architecture of the building, the different arches and the patterns on the architecture. I did this system in 3 weeks so it wasn't comprehensive of the whole building but more of fixing problems and unifying the system as much as possible.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [scaled.directory.board.4.29.06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010422/http:/typophile.com/files/scaled.directory.board.4.29.06.pdf) | 129.45 KB |\n| [scaled.interiors.board.4.29.06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010422/http:/typophile.com/files/scaled.interiors.board.4.29.06.pdf) | 45.83 KB |\n| [scaled.gallery.signs.board.4.29.06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010422/http:/typophile.com/files/scaled.gallery.signs.board.4.29.06.pdf) | 39.63 KB |\n| [directory.detail.board.4.29.06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010422/http:/typophile.com/files/directory.detail.board.4.29.06.pdf) | 147.41 KB |\n| [secondary.detail.board.4.29.06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010422/http:/typophile.com/files/secondary.detail.board.4.29.06.pdf) | 46.33 KB |\n| [galleries.detail.board.4.29.06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010422/http:/typophile.com/files/galleries.detail.board.4.29.06.pdf) | 50.61 KB |\n\n",
