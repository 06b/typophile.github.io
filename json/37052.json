  "content": "I’m an American working in an ad firm in Birmingham, AL.\n\nBasically, i’m looking for an established British typographer to work with and learn from. I worked with Rick Valicenti of Thirst (Chicago) for a semester, and he cultivated a love of typography in me. I learned more in one semester with Rick then i did in five years at university. I’d like to get a similar experience with type design.\n\nGrad school is a little out-of-reach, and i feel like a working internship would be more practical anyway.\n\nI’m enthusiastic about drawing type and creating faces, but without formal instruction i feel like i’m missing something.\n\nAny suggestions? Firms to contact? Type designers looking for cheap help next summer?\n\n [‹ Best Laser Printer for type](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012052421/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36700 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A new proposal for student font licensing: single-use font licenses. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012052421/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36920 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
