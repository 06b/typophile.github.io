I'd like to hear thoughts on the illlustration, whether it's implied meaning (commercialization/exploitation) could have been expressed with more clarity and sophistication. My thoughts after a few seconds were, the illustration was repeating itself multiple times over, given the audience (us) the point would be made immediately w/o the swoosh or 'pod buds.

It just seems like a piece that should either be subdued, or blown to the extreme . ex. Che wearing Prada/Nike/Abercrombie, sitting on pile of fashionable corpse's, eating McDonalds, drinking Pepsi whilst the valet pulls up his H3 for the opening night of the new season of American Idol.\n\nPeter  \n_No, just intimidation, coercion, terror, insurgence and revenge.  \nPower lies in the resonant messages that typographies convey._\n\nSo your saying guns don't kill people, typography does?.\n\nAnthony  \n _Regarding the design’s execution, the metaphor IS redundant, but it’s interesting that without both Swoosh and iPod Buds it looks like a commentary on that particular company/industry/product. Maybe avoiding this was the designer’s intent._\n\nCould you clarify \"...looks like a commentary on...intent\" ? thx\n\nAnd yes, the iconography is tired. If they had run it like I first suggested.

      "content": "Without having read the article, the image suggests shifting trends in the use of graphic design, exposing an ideological clash between Cuba's political past and their impending future in the global marketplace. It's not about a Cuban relationship to Apple, or Nike per se, but the effects of consumerism as a whole on the present design culture. Using multiple corporate elements helps convey this meaning (if you accept that Apple and Nike represent consumerism as a whole). I dont think I would've made that connection as swiftly had it been just an image of Che without the other symbols.\n\nI think your point about the treatment needing to be subdued or blown to the extreme is a good one. This piece falls somewhere in the middle, which is why it feels passé.\n\n"
