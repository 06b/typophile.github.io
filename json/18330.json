  "content": "Hi there,\n\nWondering if anyone can identify any of the four fonts on display here, please? They’re all from the Nuttelex factory in Melbourne, Australia. Nuttelex was first manufactured in 1932, but I don’t know when the signage went up.\n\nIncidently, I posted the bottom one a while ago, but no one was able to name it. Thought as I was posting some new ones, I may as well try it again...\n\nCheers,  \n/stephen\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [nuttelexsignage.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116152917/http:/typophile.com/files/nuttelexsignage_1.jpg) | 44.27 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Lubalin favourite extreme contrast modern serif - Pistilli Roman (Didoni) {Mark S}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116152917/http:/typophile.com/node/18307 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Dream of the Rarebit Fiend - hand lettering by Winsor McCay {Mark S} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116152917/http:/typophile.com/node/18253 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I did quite a search for the NUTTELEX typeface, and I couldn’t find anything that had that stepped X. The bracketed vertical serifs on the E and T suggest a Clarendon, and my suggestion would be to use a medium weight Clarendon, with a modified E (remove the middle serif) and X (to step the legs).\n\nFor the script ’Solidified’, this looks like a hand-drawn sign painter script that was made into an illuminated sign. A similar example is ’Blaze’ from Art & Sign (signfonts.com) shown with other sign scripts [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116152917/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg8.html). The style of ’f’ is common in sign painting scripts for some reason, and that’s what made me look at these.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
