It is super thin but the characteristic that gets me is the slightly curved crossbar on the uppercase A.  \n Please excuse the very large image, its the only way you could see the curve i mentioned.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054824im_/http:/typophile.com/files/besidebrochure11-pdf-8873-4_5739.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n sevigne \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [osamu](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054824/http:/typophile.com/user/215937 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
