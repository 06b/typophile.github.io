Apart from the narrower UC 'D', [Times Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017083937/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=LH.8295.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=60&sampleText=Destricted&sampleSize=74) is indeed a perfect match.\n\nStephen, why do you think this is ITC Bookman? The sample has sharp, pointy serifs, while ITC Bookman's got [chunky rectangular ones](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017083937/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.125939.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=60&sampleText=Destricted&sampleSize=48). Any amount of [squooshing](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017083937/http:/typophile.com/wiki/squooshed) the type will never get you anywhere close.\n\n"
