Everyone has been complaining that it's difficult to read. It looks exceptionally stale, too (white space problems, mostly). So, a friend (a member in the publication organization) asked me to have a list of recommended replacements for their current text typeface. So far, I can only think of Brioni Text, probably at 8 to 8.5 pts. Any ideas? Thanks.\n\n",
