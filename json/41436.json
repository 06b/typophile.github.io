  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am looking for a font similar to ITC Bauhaus. I did find some alternatives like: Pump, Blippo, Moderna but I'm not satisfied with them. They look 'outdated' to me. Not trendy (contemporay is a better word) enough. Important is the font has no spur or serif. It doesn't need to be complete round.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nHS\n\n",
