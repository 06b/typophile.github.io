So I'm trying to recreate it and would like to use the font that was originally used to create it. But I'm stumped.\n\nHere's the current logo: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/khedaywi/1809370610/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191845/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/khedaywi/1809370610/)\n\nAny ideas on the font??\n\nThanks!\n\n",
