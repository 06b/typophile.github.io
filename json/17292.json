The second edition is a hundred pages longer, so I’d say it’s obvious there are significant differences (or at least additions) between those two.\n\nThe revised second edition has about 40 pages that have corrections or additions compared to the regular second edition.\n\nI think that the current version is actually “edition 2.5” as of 2002 or so, and has moderate noticeable changes compared to the second edition, mostly in areas that have to do with things that have changed due to technical advances (e.g. OpenType). However, my most recent copy is at work, so I can’t check easily.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

For the entire first chapter, only every other set of pages (one side of each piece of paper) is printed. Oddly enough, you’d expect the same near the end of the book, but it doesn’t seem to be the case.\n\nOh, the irony in having a defectively-printed version of a book about typography. I’m not returning it, either. :)\n\n_Is this a new trend, and is it really necessary?_\n\nConsidering that Bringhurst cites Strunk and White as his inspiration for _ETS_, maybe he’s just trying to keep up with S&W’s publishers.

Look at the top or bottom of the book, near the spine, and you will see the signatures and how they fold. Or, open up the book at pages 16-17 (or 48-49) and look at the spread’s gutter: you will see the sewing that keeps those 32 pages together.
