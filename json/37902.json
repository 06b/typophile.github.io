  "content": "Hi all.\n\nWhat do you think about creating a logotype for multiple brands. Let me be more specific:  \nI must create a logotype not associated to anything(!?!).  \nIt will be use in handdryers, ladies brushes or even bandages (!?).  \nThe brand name? Not sure but something like \"metaline\".  \nThe ideia is to \"develop\" this new concept: logotype not associated to anything.  \nCan this work? how ? ideias? suggestions?\n\nThanks.  \nAntónio\n\n",

      "content": "You have a brand name (or will have) that is to be applied to different products, the problem/opportunity is that your logotype shouldn’t be specific to one product – many brands do this, some use a strapline so –\n\n**Metaline**  \n_handdryers_\n\n**Metaline**  \n_bandages_\n\nOther approaches might use colour or shape to separate the strands of a brand.\n\nFrankly though, it is not a new concept, these products are not so diverse they seem to be the kinds of things one might find in a pharmacy or clinic. Many retail chains have own brand products or carry a range of products from one supplier.\n\nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Hi tim\n\nThanks for your input.  \nWell... when I said that the \"this new concept\" I real wanted to say \" this new concept to me\" (first time) :-).  \nYes the medical disposables industry uses a lot this concept...  \nHmm...  \nI had ideais similiar to yours:  \n1- strapline, possible  \n2- Color. Good ideia but this represents a printing problem. I have to stick to 2 colors already used (PMS 179/PMS 343).\n\nAntónio\n\n"
