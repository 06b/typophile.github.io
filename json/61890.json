(i) is easy enough, but I don't know of any simple way to achieve (ii) that doesn't involve manually renaming all of the glyphs involved.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nAndré\n\n",

All it requires is a text file with two columns of names separated by white space (can be one or more space characters or tabs). So something like,\n\n`oldName1 newName1\noldName2 newName2\noldName3 newName3`\n\nThe script will only rename glyphs. It won't change the glyph names used in Classes or OT features.\n\n"
