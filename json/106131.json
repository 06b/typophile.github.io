AFAIK Lauren Script was produced as an original work previous to Adage Script and thus is in no way a rip of Adadge script. No info on the pre-digital original. Perhaps a photo lettering era design?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130914174423im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AdageScript_5346.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"

I'm going to look through the Filmotype catalog right now.\n\nMike Allard created some of the earliest digital shareware revivals. I don't believe he created any original designs - but I might be wrong.\n\nEdit - It wasn't a Filmotype face.\n\n"
