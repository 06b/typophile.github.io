Also think about matting and framing a few specimens just like a drawing or print. Mat or mount with plenty of space around your work so it is isolated and can be looked at without distractions. If you use 32x40 inch panels five or six in a 20 foot area are enough with space between.\n\n"

They seem to all plot out large, tall banners showing off their type in various sizes.\n\nI know someone in Offenbach who filled a room with his thesis typeface. He had a foot high banner running around the room, black, with white type on it. I think it was a continuous text about typography. Then made three foot high blocks, sort like the chips in scrabble. These were all black, each with a white letter on them. They stood in the middle of the room, and spelled out the typeface’s name. Lastly, he had a podium behind these blocks. On that was a book, which described the process behind the typeface’s design.\n\nI have made posters in the past myself. 6 x DIN A0 (I think). Each was framed, and they hung in two rows of three.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907064622im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2004%20Rundagang%20Poster%20Hanging2.jpg)\n\nAnd then there is [this project of mine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907064622/http:/www.typeoff.de/?p=9).

Like picture a continuous thick line going around the room, at a gentle incline, so that it wraps around repeatedly without a break: people can follow the spiral, sort of becoming part of the motif even.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "About installing individual 3D letters: Tim has it right. Signpainters and installers, and mural painters make patterns. Here’s a long version.\n\nTo make a pattern and transfer it on to the wall you’ll need: paper for the pattern, pounce wheel, fine sand paper, pounce in a pounce bag, tape, rulers, tape measures.\n\nMake the pattern. If you had your letters made from computerized patterns, then you might be able to print all the copy out at size to use as paper pattern.\n\nBut if not get a big roll of butcher block or kraft paper. Draw a baseline on the paper and any other guides you might need, and place the letters on the paper exactly as you would have them spaced on the wall. When you have them in place, weigh each letter down to help keep them in place as you carefully trace around each letter. Put the pattern drawing up on wall to evaluate and adjust if needed before perforating.\n\nYou can get a pounce wheel, which is a handle with a wheel that has little protruding spikes of varying sizes and spacing around it, at a sign supply store (some art stores) for about $4 or from Dick Blick online. The surface you will be applying the pattern to and the size of the letters will determine the size of the wheel you need: the coarser the wall texture and/or larger the letters, the bigger and coarser the pattern holes should be. I also had an electro pouncer that burnt holes in the paper pattern, but it’s a sizable investment and often literally a shocking experience.\n\nPut the paper on a slightly padded surface (a rug will do if you aren’t heavy handed) and carefully run the wheel around the outline of the letters punching a line of little holes through the paper. If a letter tears along the perforation, tape it back in place and go over it punching through the tape if possible. After perforating, gently sand (fine paper) the back of the paper pattern to open the holes. Tape to wall in place with masking or other tape that won’t leave a residue or pull off paint. You can measure from floor or ceiling to baseline and/or eyeball the placement (not many walls are really square).\n\nYou can buy a ready-made pounce bag for about $15. Or you can make one yourself by filling an old sock with chalk dust (if surface you are applying letters to is dark) or charcoal dust (if surface is light) and tie it shut. 20 ounces of either chalk or charcoal pounce is only about $6 (Dick Blick again). Gently tap over the holes in the outline to transfer a dotted line of powder to the wall. Check to see if the pattern is transferring when you start, and that it’s all there before removing. After applying letters, an old towel will probably remove 99% of any overblow on the wall.\n\nInstallers frequently use two sided foam tape and Liquid Nails for a quick fix.\n\nHope this is helpful, clear and not too long winded.\n\n"
