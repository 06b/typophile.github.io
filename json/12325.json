He works as a graphic designer and teaches second-form art students. Typeface design was a hobby for many years but it has become an everyday routine with [Fontmunkások](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809023131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fontmunk%C3%A1sok) and [Fontana Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809023131/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fontana%20Type%20Foundry).
