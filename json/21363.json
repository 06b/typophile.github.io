The first time they put a STENT in one of my coronary arteries and sent me home 2 days later. 2 days after that I was back in the hospital with chest pain. This time, they put 3 more STENTS in different arteries. They sent me home 2 days later and a day after that, I had serious chest pain again. Ruth called the ambulance and back I went. they did another Thallium stress test and blood enzymes and found out that I had a very minor heart attack so back I went to the Cath lab for a third poke in the groin. This time, they just changed my medications. At least now I am home again and looking forward to a hospital free week.\n\nThanks for asking!\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "A stent is a kind of cylinder made of titanium mesh, flexible and open at both ends, inserted into arteries with weak walls or thin spots in the artery wall, to fortify the artery and encourage regrowth of the walls. When I had my cerebral aneurysm at the end of January this year the surgeons put stents in each artery (two) that burst inside my head. The complications and impact of the bleed episode, and brain trauma caused by the fluid pressure in my cranium—-all that mess kept me in hospital for three months.\n\nI hope it all works out for you Chris. Sending you healing vibes and best wishes.\n\nI’m off to visit a musician friend in hosptal today. He just had a cancer removed from his brain.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
