      "content": "Hey.   \n   \nA few months ago, I was looking into doing circuit board etching art. Ya know, where ya buy a circuit board that's covered in copper, lay down a resist and acid etch off the copper leaving that circuit board green behind? I was (and am still) considering silkscreening photos onto 'em, or doing circuit trace outlines. If ya google around, there's PC programs to layout circuit traces. With all the useful circular endpoints (pads), etc. Dunno if it'd just be easier to whip out Illustrator, but...   \n   \nDavid Roughs   \n   \np.s. Or you could use a pre-done layout off the web, like from this [page](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213003/http:/www.pjrc.com/tech/mp3/pcb_layout_revc.html):   \n ![circuit](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213003im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/18491.gif)\n\n"
