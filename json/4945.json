  "content": "Hey. Do any of you know whether you can create a text style that has three layers of type?   \n   \nI am designing a DVD menu system and each menu item has a top layer, a middle outline layer, and a bottom offset layer for a drop shadow effect. I have to translate this system into three languages and it's turning out to be a big pain in the  to edit three type layers for every item x three languages!   \n   \nI tried making a text style but it only works on one layer of type.   \n   \nAny suggestions?   \n   \nThanks,   \npeter\n\n",

      "content": "I think maybe you're going at the problem backwards.   \n   \nThere's no reason you need to use more than one layer for this. Use a stroke on the type, and use Illustrator's own drop shadow capabilities.   \n   \nThe stroke will tend to erode the type. If Illustrator doesn't have the option to simply place the stroke behind the object (not sure), you can set the path offset to half the stroke thickness, and that should eliminate the problem.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

I've been playing around with this in Illustrator and you **can** do exactly what you want.   \n   \nThe key is to modify the appearance of the text by selecting it as an **object** (using the arrow tool), not as **text** (using the text tool). When it is in object mode, you can change the stacking order of the stroke and fill in the appearance palette. You can't when the text is selected as text.   \n   \nDoing it this way means that the effects will apply to the whole text block, but that would only be a problem if you wanted to use the style within a text block. It doesn't sound like that's the case.   \n   \nYou change the stacking order of the strokes and fills by dragging them up and down in the Appearance palette. Also, you can add as many strokes and fills as needed and modify them with the Effects menu. With the appropriate stroke or fill selected in the Appearance palette, use Effects -\\> Distort & Transform -\\> Transform to do the dropshadow effect.\n\n"

In the Appearance palette, do Add New Stroke and set the stroke thickness to 6 points and the color to red (to make it easier to see what's going on).   \n4. Illustrator automatically adds an empty Fill layer to the appearance palette. Click on it and change it to yellow.   \n5. In the Appearance palette, drag the yellow Fill layer to above the Stroke layer. You now have the Fill in front of the Stroke, just as if you had pasted a stroked copy of the text behind the filled text.   \n6. Switch to the text tool again, select the text and type something else to see that it worked.   \n   \nOf course, use whatever attributes you want for colors, etc. The ones I chose were just to show how it works.   \n   \nTo add a dropshadow:   \n   \n1. Swith back to the solid arrow tool. Make sure the text block is selected.   \n2. In the Appearance palette, do Add New Stroke.   \n3. Change the color of the new stroke to black.   \n3.

I was able to acknowledge--somewhat in passing--that the new AI version had 3-D extrude tools, but I couldn't say more.   \n   \nI just played around with Appearance and 3D extrude with ambient shading in AI CS and yes, they add a whole new dimension. It's a miracle!   \n   \nThere are a few problems, though. The shading gets put in as bands that are too low res. Each band is an individual object which makes editing difficult (too many points flying around) and gets us into issues of trapping if we're doing this for publication.   \n   \nAlso, I tried a couple of layers of fills and strokes followed by a 3D extrude and when it was done, 3 of my letters ended up behind the top fill layer, so this is a bug, I presume.   \n   \nThe revision of my book--eventually--will have to cover these new AI features, though! However, I'm thinking that I would still very likely build my own shadows because there's always a superficial feeling to out-of-the-box features like these. But maybe   \nI'm just futilely trying to resist progress.   \nLeslie\n\n"

      "content": "Also, one caveat about the \"cast shadow\" effect I did in the second sample... It's made of individual copies of the black stroke layer, so if you zoom in or print it out you would see tiny stair steps. One way around this is to increase the number of steps and reduce the distance between them. The other would be to not rely on such a short cut and actually draw it. The 3-d extrude can do it too, but it tends to be a little imprecise for this kind of shadow and the artwork you get when you expand the appearance is a little, I don't know, messy.\n\n"
