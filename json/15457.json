Preferably an original, but would settle with hi-res scans (300+). I've already made attempts to contact them, with no luck. If you qualify for either one, I would be interested in enlisting your assistance.

If they own the rights and have their own intentions or not, you are trying to replicate an existing type design... and apparently don't even have decent scans of the original. This doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If they had approached you, completely different story, but likely (from what I understand) Neufville has its own plans.\n\nGerald\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, Gerald,\n\nThis isn't quite accurate. Occasionally, designers will revive an un-revived typeface that a certain foundry has the rights to. After that designer shows the fonts to the foundry, the foundry will—on some occasions—license them and distribute them itself. This is what Eric is hoping for, I think.\n\nIt is quite costly for a foundry to revive a face like this on its own. (The money for Blackletter just isn't there…) But if a designer does it for them, it costs them nothing. It is a win-win situation, and I know designers who have gone through this before. So please don't say never, or assume the worst. Eric's intentions here are admirable, and this is the right path to take. If Neufville is not interested in the design, Eric may be able to release it through other channels under a different name—perhaps even with Neufville's blessing.\n\nDiscussion is always good.\n\n"

      "content": "It is quite rare for a font house (especially an old-school one like Neufville) to pick up an unsolicited design, even if it's free - the main reasons being quality and suitability. The one case like this I remember is that guy who made a DIN clone, not knowing the issues (although DIN is admittedly a \"public\" design) and when he tried to sell it or something the FontFont people graciously paid him to take it completely over... and didn't even use it.\n\nIn Eric's case: he's a self-confessed beginner\\*, he knows the issues, and hasn't even fleshed out the whole design yet\\*, so here's what I would suggest: contact Neufville (maybe even arrange for a telephone call) and tell them there's a design you really really like, and you've sort of started on it, but realize they own it; you want to keep working on it, and see it released somehow; you offer to submit it to them when it's pretty much finished; they don't have to pay anything, and they can accept it or not, but what would be really nice is if they critiqued the work in progress so that it ends up to their liking and they'll sell it. If they say no, you stop (and maybe make something inspired by it). If they say yes, you work hard, and listen to them. The risk is that they'll say no at the end and you'll end up with a design that's dead in the water. But at least you would have learned a lot.\n\n\\* Correct?\n\nhhp\n\n"

Maybe this is stupid, but I've never, i'm sure like a lot of midwesterners, called Europe (Spain)\n\nI really don't want to let this die, I've got my heart set on it. ( the OFFICIAL GOTIKA ) . Just maybe some suggestions from folks on how to go about calling them. International relations is new to me. Is English pretty standard, no communication problems if I called? Maybe I'm just being a big chicken.\n\nLike, what dept. would I ask for... You know, I just don't want to sound absolutely inept.\n\nAnything is helpful. If not, i'll figure it out.\n\nThanks\n\nAs an aside, I was perusing Neufville's catalog, and Gotika doesn't show up, unless it's just the type they expect to release in the future?

      "content": "_\\>Maybe I’m just being a big chicken._\n\nYeah, you are being a big chicken ;-)\n\nNow cut it out! Make sure you get the whole international dialing code thing right. It should be in the front of your phone book. Then, after they pick up the phon, say Buenos Dias, and then ask politely if they speak English. I'm sure that they get English-speaking calls all the time. English is the language of European business now, with the EU and all. How many Swedes speak Spanish? Exactly. Nothing to be afraid about.\n\nThen tell the person on the phone that you are type designer calling from the United States. You'd like to speak with someone to get some information on old German Bauer tyapefaces. I'm sure that they will connect you to the correct person, or ask you to call back later.\n\nThen it is up to you. It isn't that hard, really.\n\nI used to get the fear of God in me when I had to call up German institutions for the first time, and speak in horrendous German (while English is the international language of business, it is not the international language of bureacracy. Bureacrats must always be spoken to in their native language, if possible). But it always worked, and I soon got over it. Now I live in the midst of these crazy people. No one will hate you because you are from the midwest.\n\n"

It isn't like they are some cheapo free font hacks: those guys are the ones to get annoyed at when they beat you to the punch on an old digitalization. CanadaType seems to be doing a nice job, in my opinion. Every type designer works differently, and everyone will interpret joins, etc. differently, too. The world is big enough for Gotika and Leather. And there are always other typefaces to be made anyway.\n\n"

If you're still faced with Spanish, it probably means the guy is out\\* - try again later (after saying \"moutchas grahsias\" - \"thank you very much\"). Oh, do get the time-zones right.
