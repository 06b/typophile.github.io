  "content": "Hello- To the best of my limited knowledge, the attached logo was hand-drawn. Does anyone have a suggestion for a font with similar characteristics that I could use as a substitute? The \"o's\" are not a problem; They're simple circles. The funky \"s\" and the \"m\" might be more of a challenge though? Any ideas folks?  \nThanks!
