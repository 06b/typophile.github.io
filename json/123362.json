Most probably exclusive and proprietary of Rolex and definitely very close to ' [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/eurostile) Extended/ [Microgramma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/microgramma)'. From what I can see, 2 main differences but easily redoable:  \n- /1: top-bar-less  \n- /4: top with extended flat section  \nSome more \"Eurostile-Extended-like\" clients for customization: [House Gothic 23](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/housegothic23) Extended, [Forza](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/forza/overview), [Myers Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/myers-sans), [From The Stars](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/from-the-stars), Latin counterpart of [Arian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/arian) (variation on Eurostile Extended), [Bitsumishi](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/bitsumishi-pro-v2), **[Miedinger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/miedinger)** (probably my choice here), [Metro DF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/haroldsfonts.com/portfolio/metro-df), [Geom Graphic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171451/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/geom-graphic) (nice too)\n\n"
