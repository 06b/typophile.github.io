  "content": "Book design question: My editor wants the author bio before the text. I’ve been pondering various solutions, and came up with the attached PDF. The bio texts are rather long, and I don’t want to push the title too far down the page.\n\nThere’s two navigational issues: A: The title of the chapter is on the left page (which makes browsing harder then necessary). B: The first page of a chapter omits the page number (ditto).\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on this. Do you know any other examples of books where the author bio is the first element in the chapter?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [chapter\\_opening.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181212/http:/typophile.com/files/chapter_opening.pdf) | 47.79 KB |\n\n",

Chapter titles a third or even half-way down the page are not uncommon.\n\nThat would help solve the major issue with your layout, which is that the biography text looks way too similar to the main text – it looks like a hangover block quote from the previous chapter (compare the next page!) and its nearness in style (especially in terms of left margin) gives it a slightly-off, disharmonious, unintentional impression. (You know, the old maxim of making things that are different singnificantly different.)\n\nWith more space, or even without it, you could do any number of things to make it less similar to the main text. Set it futher left. Add a right margin. Switch typeface (to a sans?). Set it in bold or italic. Give it more space above the title. Set it in a shaded panel. Etc. etc.\n\n"

      "content": "Some semi-random thoughts:\n\n- The navigational issues you mention are pretty usual. Except maybe the fact that it’s more common to have the book title on the verso and the chapter title on the recto. Losing also the page number is unfortunate, but in a book it happens in several places, for a variety of practical or traditional reasons.\n- There is a range of length for the bios? Otherwise, a particularly lengthy or short one could break things apart.\n- What distracts me in your example is mainly the setting of the running head, which in places (see page 4), interacts a bit too much with the main text.\n- Finally, echoing Johan’s advice, you could try to differentiate more the bio text from the main text, maybe also tightening the leading. But what I mainly would try to do is creating a hierarchy inside the page:\n  1. Author\n  2. Title\n  3. Text\n\nFor that you will probably need to highlight in some way the author’s name so that the bio text would be supporting it in its role.\n\n"

I want the biography to appear less important than the text, while still being at the top. I could take a number of different routes to get there (cursive, smaller size, contrasting typeface), but none of the ones I’ve tested so far _feels_ right. Hence, I’m interested in seeing how others may have solved similar problems.\n\n"

      "content": "The chapter-opening page numbers are the ones referenced in the table of contents, so chapter openers should always have a folio (page number).  \nWhen the standard placement of the page number is at the top, on the chapter-opening pages you can put the page number at the bottom. This practice is sufficiently well-established that there's a name for it in graphic-design jargon: It's called a _drop folio_.  \nThe author biography does dominate the layout too much as it stands. I suggest you increase the indent for the author bio and reduce the point size and leading a bit to compensate for the shorter line length. And try making the chapter titles larger and/or bolder (unless you have some very long chapter titles).\n\n"
