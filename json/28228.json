I want a typeface that has:\n\n1) The swashes, ligatures and other ornate fun of [Sabon Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200048/http:/www.linotype.com/webshop/view.linotype?viewmode=search&searchFields%5B%5D=0&searchFields%5B%5D=2&PHPSESSID=92d321831a12bdc82e2dd30cb35ad975&ACT=quicksearch&searchLogic=and&searchContent=true&wildcard=1&searchType=as_families&GROUP=&DISPLAYC=full&searchTerm=sabon+next)...\n\n2) ...but the personality and feel of [Quadraat](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200048/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=quadraat) or [Dolly](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200048/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview).\n\nAm I asking too much? Do I want to have my cake and eat it too? (Note: while I very much like [Sauna](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200048/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=sauna&id2=overview), I’m looking for a true serif typeface.)

There aren’t a lot of samples of body copy. I’ll be using this typeface for large amounts of text.\n\nI think Yves mentioned before that he’s used it for text before, any samples anyone?\n\nPatty, thanks for the link I’ve found some great examples. I also like [Dederon Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200048/http:/www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=dederon%20Serif%20Std%20OT#15) but don’t see any large copy samples. Have you used this face before in copy (or anyone else for that matter)? Any samples?\n\n"
