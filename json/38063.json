Is it still going and just something I’m failing to locate? The most up-to-date reference I could find is 1999.\n\nI quite liked all the “experimental” (illegible?) pieces of work they could produce quickly, if simply for nothing but their curiosity value.\n\nsimon\n\n [‹ Best font of the 70's? opinions please!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042447/http:/typophile.com/node/38065 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [typographic illustrator ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042447/http:/typophile.com/node/38228 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It took me about 8years of successive FTP failures to get Moonbase Alpha, which I saw in Wired. Obviously if they were not all sold, the legality of use is now in question (CanYou I used I think).
