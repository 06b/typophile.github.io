  "content": "I'm fresh out of college and starting out into the freelance design world. Is there some resource for getting some sort of essential typeface starter pack? I'm looking for solid typefaces for multiple occasions, something that might act as a base for my type library. Of course, I'm on a limited budget, but I'm realizing that the free font sites out there don't offer the sort of \"nuts and bolts\" essential typefaces I need.\n\nAny thoughts? How can I get my type library essentials without breaking my [tiny] bank?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

You could start by picking two or three from each category, choosing a \"formal\" and \"informal\" typeface from each of these categories: sans-serif, serif, display, script.\n\nYou most certainly will want robust type families, so look for families with lots of weights. It'll cost more up front, but you'll be glad you did.\n\nOr you can try these sites to get started:  \n [http://www.adobe.com/type/collections.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031100946/http:/www.adobe.com/type/collections.htm \"http://www.adobe.com/type/collections.htm\") -  \n [http://www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=283](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031100946/http:/www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=283 \"http://www.veer.com/products/gallery.aspx?gallery=283\")\n\n"

      "content": "I'll second the recommendation for Adobe Type Basics, OpenType Edition. There's a lot of overlap with the fonts that came with CS2, but you still get a few additional complete families. For instance, Basics includes the Palatino Std 1 package, but Basics is the same price as Palatino Std 1: $99. Go figure. With Basics you get more families and also a smattering of display and novelty fonts.\n\nAnother somewhat cheesy route to take is to find a used copy of Corel Draw or the Corel graphics suite. Corel bundles, or at least used to bundle, some version of the complete Bitstream font catalog. This contains about 1,200 fonts, including many digitized versions of classic text fonts such as Plantin, Bembo, Sabon, Granjon, a couple Garamonds, Univers, Electra, Caledonia, Melior, Frutiger, Cheltenham, a few Bookmans, a few Bodonis, etc.\n\nThe Bitstream catalog is a much better collection than the \"1,000 font for $5\" CDs which are just freeware fonts pressed onto a CD. However, compared to top-notch Adobe fonts, these old Bitstream fonts aren't quite as nice since they often do not include small caps or old-style figures. I think the bundle included both Type1 and TrueType versions of each font. You can still use these fonts on a Mac if you have a font manager. (I use FontAgent Pro.) I don't know about Windows.\n\nOr you can buy the current CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X3 which apparently has an upgraded type catalog -- it offers 1,000 OpenType fonts. I don't have any experience with this though. See\n\n[http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1150981051301](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031100946/http:/www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1150981051301 \"http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1150981051301\")\n\nIt's US$379. Heck, maybe you should consider buying the software just for the font collection.\n\n"

Some of their typefaces are geared more toward display, but from what I can tell they are all original...I don't think any of them came from old photolettering. There type designs are somewhat unique. They have some nice serif and sans-serif faces that can offer someone a fresher alternative to the standard workhorses. The catalog is worth having. It's pretty straight forward in it's layout, but the samples are easier to see than on the website.\n\n"
