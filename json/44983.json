It looks nice and clean, and barns are usually not constructed with elaborate rounded curves, etc... It’s very plain and simple, without getting tacky (in my opinion).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080515232541im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/barndance_4604.jpg)\n\n"

D A and part of N in DANCE are are receding correctly, as are N and R in BARN, and then the words curve forward. I wonder if you did this manually or relied on a digital distortion envelope?\n\n"
