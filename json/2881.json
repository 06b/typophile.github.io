Im aware that both these are probably custom drawn, If anyone has any information on their origins, It would be most appreciated.   \n   \nBest,   \nJeremy.\n\n",

Esquire uses my \"Mercury Display\" typeface, as well as Tobias Frere-Jones' slab serif, formerly known as \"Strada\" (Albert Pinggera just released a design by the same name, so we're looking for a replacement.)   \n   \nThe GQ face is indeed Gotham, also by Tobias. You can follow the link above.   \n   \n   \nRegards, Jonathan\n\n"

      "content": "I haven't seen a copy of Esquire recently, but last I knew they were using Jonathan Hoefler's Mercury for their serif text face and some heads. For sans, I think they've been using a fair bit of Frutiger's [Vectora](http://web.archive.org/web/20121219013708/http:/www.myfonts.com/FontFamily4514.html).   \n   \nNeither have I seen GQ recently, so I may be mistaken, but I believe that they've been using a version of HTF's [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20121219013708/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html) for their main sans.   \n   \nSomeone who has the magazines at hand (or Jonathan) can confirm.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
