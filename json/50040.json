It has an interesting combination of both official looking strong letterforms as well as a few whimsical curlicues. This typeface will be used for the company branding of a Horsedrawn carriage company operating in a midwest river town celebrating their bicentennial. I need to find something that is classy and historic, and horsey- Main Street America... but not mistaken for wild west or circus.\n\nOpen to alternative suggestions!\n\n [‹ BOHLERT MASSEY INTERIORS logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002050218/http:/typophile.com/node/50043 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Can anybody tell me what this is? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002050218/http:/typophile.com/node/50041 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
