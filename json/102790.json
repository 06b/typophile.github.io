  "content": "Dear experts,\n\ncan please anyone tell whether the form of tironian \"et\" in the image below is the correct one that had been used to write \"viz.\" before people started to substitute \"z\" for it? And if so, do you think using this archaic form would be a good idea (in a bit old-fashioned philosophical journal)? Or do you think it would just look weird?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720180629im_/http:/typophile.com/files/viz_6068.gif)\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nNolmendil\n\n",

Long ago, I once spent an entire afternoon finding samples to show a client, who felt the one we used was somehow \"wrong\" (I used one with a descender).\n\nSee [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tironian\\_et](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720180629/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tironian_et \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tironian\\_et\")\n\nAs for using it in a philosophical journal in the context you suggest, yes, it would look weird. Not to mention causing the typesetter trouble...\n\n"
