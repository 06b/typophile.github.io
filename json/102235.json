  "content": "Hello, newbie to the forum, but figured this was a good place to start. My grandfather recently passed, and I'm working on an art piece for him but I'm having trouble locating a particular font. I want one that will represent the emblems on his favorite car, 56 dodge coronet. Any help would be much appreciated. Looking in particular for letters M, C, G, upper and lower case\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011220710im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dodge%20logo_5189.jpg)\n\n",
