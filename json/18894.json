      "content": "Typeface names can become Trademarks (or Registered Trademarks). I do not know what the procedure is to do this myself. But I would recommend doing it.\n\nYou cannot \\*copyright\\* a typeface name, I think. You can only copyright the source code of a font. Font source code data may be copyrighted as a literary work, like other computer programs. This is done through the copyright office of the country you live in (I believe that the US Copyright Office is in Washington, D.C.). Other countries have copyright agreements with the US; therefore, it is usually not necessary to register this copyright elsewhere.\n\n"

      "content": "Chris, what are you intending to protect legally?  \nAs Dan mentioned, a typeface name (a name of an actual product) can be trademarked after a moderate search of like sounding and spelling names within the industry or market of the product.\n\nA registered trademark requires extensive tradename research (legal fees) before you can even apply, then more application fees, a period open for contention, then more legal fees for actual registration. It's really all about \"trade\" protection, or to disuade \"competitors\" from capitalizing on the brand investment and product name equity of the originating company.\n\nIf a \"brand\" is big enough or well known enough, its protection will go beyond the actual product category and marketplace. An example would be if you tried to register a trademark for a typeface named _Corvette_.\n\nA name won't protect the typeface itself, if that's what you're hoping to do. If you are interested in \"branding\" a typeface, it requires more than just protecting the name as well.\n\nLet me know... I'll help if I can.\n\n"

It's a fairly small field of type foundries and designers, so branding yourself will stand as both memorable and irrefutable as to the source of any of your typefaces.\n\nDezcom NOW, or Dez Leporello, or Dz Align Sans, or CL NOW, all can easily be branded and trademarked at the same time since your \"prefix\" becomes the actual distiguishing name.\n\nIt's why Aaron Burns _insisted_ that \"ITC\" preceded every licensed release (except for the few ITC sub-licensed) and why several type suppliers and vendors still use prefixes today. But personally, I think \"Dezcom\" or even \"Dez\" is quite catchy, and you can even use your avatar as a brandmark.\n\nTrying to trademark and brand three new type families is far more difficult and costly than building a single brand with three available products (in this case typefaces).\n\nNow if that's not worth a beer, I don't know what is. :-O\n\n"

Let's say you name Leporello \"Dez Leporello\", and someday soon a competitor names his typeface \"Dis Leporello\". This is no good.\n\nIn the future, should automatic internet searches dominate the way people find fonts, both of you could end up in a sticky situation.
