I really enjoy Aviano Flare ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-flare/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720012314/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-flare/)) but I can't seem to find any similar typefaces that spark the same emotional feel as Aviano.\n\nAny suggestions are greatly appreciated as I've been searching for a few days now. Thanks in advance!\n\n",
