      "content": "In a sentence: it's how the stroke is modulated. :)\n\nIn a simple way, let's say that a \"calligraphic\" font tries to emulate a nib or other writing tool, while \"geometric\" is a rationalization of the letter's shape.\n\nWith that said, the calligraphic letter considers the imprint that a writing tool would leave, a.i. the stroke, while the geometric letter considers the geometric reduction of it's outlines. So one is written, the other is rigorously drawn.\n\nAs for the dots, the same thing: is it the register of a writing tool or a geometrization of the outlines? And, by the way, the advantages are none, nor the disadvantages: it's just an aesthetic choice.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
