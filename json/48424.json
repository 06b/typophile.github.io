I notice TextEdit pastes the selections on separate lines after a copy -- pretty neat.\n\nA related feature I occasionally miss from my old PageMaker dayz is selecting columns of text. With PageMaker, you could select any text _vertically_, right out of the middle of running paragraphs, and cut, copy, or format at will.\n\nThe thing is, these sort of things are not built-in behaviour. A programmer has to physically work around the \"single-selection\" paradigm that has been a part of GUIs for ages.\n\n"
