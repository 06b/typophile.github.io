  "content": "Recently, I received an e-mail from Tabur Buhl asking my why I'd sent him a blank e-mail. In reality, I'd never sent Tabur any e-mails and we wrote back and fourth to determine the source of this wierdness . . .   \n   \nA few days later, his friend Brode of Sacred Nipple had similar encounters. I also received another blank e-mail with an .exe file attached from Fontosaurus.   \n   \nA day later, I found out the same thing had been happening to Brian of Astigmatic. I had been the recipient of e-mails from infected computers, but never from computers infected with font designers e-mail addresses.   \n   \nHas this happened to anybody else?   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n",

The virus infects their machine, steals some email addresses and forwards itself and a randomly selected file (think about that!) to the email addresses it found. It may even be self-modifying in that it passes on email addresses through a couple of iterations.\n\n"
