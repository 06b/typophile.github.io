  "content": "I've recently been trying to prepare a presentation detailing the differences between fonts. My problem is that as a student I know very little about fonts myself and I've had difficulty finding any difinitive distictions.   \nMy aim is to take categories such as Serif and Sans Serif and break them down into sub categories such as Slab, Neo, Geometric, Humanist. I also hope to be able to describe their most distictive features i.e. Humanist = anti goemetric, anti perpendicular, slightly bent tips and so on.   \nAnd to the question:   \nIs there a trusted comprehensive source for detailed information on fonts?   \n   \nAll advice welcomed and greatly appreciated,   \nThanks,   \nKanebo\n\n",
