  "content": "I'm making a big multilingual sans serif and by default, the \"a\" and the \"g\" are double storey. I do include the single story versions available by \"salt\" because this feature works virtually everywhere, where there is Opentype).\n\nHowever, I've heard that the Germans mostly use the single story _g_. I've searched pictures of various street signs in Germany and Austria and I haven't found any double story g's.\n\nWould it be ok to include 'locl' feature for German language to substitute only the g (while leaving the \"a\" double story)? I do understand that the single story g has its roots in Fraktur. And is it a German-only preference or the neighbour languages like Dutch, Danish, Swedish, etc. look more natural with a single storey g?\n\nIn the attachment, there's an example with single and double storey g's. To my eyes, the combination of single story g and double story a looks more \"natural\" in a German text. Don't look at the kerning, I didn't start polishing it yet.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [GermanG.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414004031/http:/typophile.com/files/GermanG.PNG) | 65.55 KB |\n\n",

Perhaps this pandered to the stereotype of European modernism. Or perhaps, soon after WWII (which is when I believe it was manufactured, not before), there was a feeling that Gill Sans was too ﬁrmly associated with England, and this would have negative connotations in Germany.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414004031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GillGerman_4324.jpg)\n\nFrom an undated Monotype specimen (probably early 1950s), Belserdruck, Stuttgart.  \n\"M 10, Serie 262-11, Durchschuß 2\"  \nThere is also Bold, but no Light shown.\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah, I don’t think there’s a connection there. It’s nice that you’re putting a single-story g as an alternate, but I’d see no reason to make it a locl.\n\nSamples like that Gill, I would see that rather in a historical than a geographic context (“pandered to the stereotype of European modernism” sounds right; weren’t there lots of faces that suddenly came up with Futura-esque alternates…).  \nDurchschuß means leading, FWIW.\n\n"
