      "content": "I assume this is going to be a free typeface, since you are giving it away for critique. (It's more typical to post a PDF specimen of the font.)\n\nOverall, it's pretty nice, but the color is somewhat variable. Keep in mind that slanted lines behave differently optically from horizontals and verticals.\n\nThe first character that struck me as odd was the @ sign. Also, there are inconsistencies that don't make sense. Your superior 2 looks OK, but the 2 in your two quarters sign looks cramped. I would expect those to match. I would keep the f on the baseline. The æ has a slant that isn't anticipated by the a or the e, and so looks a bit odd.\n\n"
