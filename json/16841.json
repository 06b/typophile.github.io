  "content": "Hi me new to this scene and still finding out answers about what's right or wrong in using fonts in my designs. Here is some of my questions:\n\n1.) When a font author digitizes a font they really like from a fantasy book and they licenses it to Internet users. And I want to use the font for COMMERCIAL use, is it enough that I only deal with the \"digital-font-author\" or do I go directly to the \"printed-book-font-author\"?? Or need I contact them both before commercial use could be deployed?\n\n",

Is it already digitised? Is it commercially available? Is it freeware or shareware?\n\n"

      "content": "I'd agree with oldnick, but you'd have to trust that the person offering the font actually drew it from scratch, and didn't just open up an existing commercial version and re-name it.\n\nAlso think there are benefits in doing some research and trying to find a more original/professional version of the font if it exists. It will likely be better drawn and have better spacing than a re-digitization based on printed samples.\n\n"

I converted it to a Windows True Type font with the method defined at this site and have made it available to the general public.

Maybe I should try some other method, but first I wanted som answers from Typophile before doing that.\n\n"
