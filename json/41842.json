  "content": "My first thought was, not specifically, but something with similarities to New Century Schoolbook. I realize it’s kind of a trite face by now, ubiquitous as it is on so many computers, but there's also a comfort in its familiarity. And its open, generous character width makes for readability, I think, that might make training materials easier on the eyes.\n\nCan anyone suggest anything—perhaps nothing exotic—that has a similar degree of ease on the eyes and reability, but that isn’t overused?\n\nThank you.\n\n",
