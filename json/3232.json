  "content": "So. I got a new Power Book with Panther on it, and have been dealing with the throws of color managment recently.   \n   \nI just calibrated my monitor last night and what I have found is that though i would LOVE to use Adobe Photoshop 7's preferred RGB profile (sRGBIEC6 etc....) it seems to me that it is seriously oversaturated and too 'contrasty'. When I output graphics for web work they look very dull. When I open those same graphics in PS, they look great.   \n   \nI have been testing these outputs on a bunch of different monitors around the office and I have concluded that it makes more sense to not use Color Management (or use the Monitor RGB - Color LCD profile) and deal with the reality that most other monitors aren't going to display my graphics like PS would have me believe.   \n   \nI would really like to hear your thoughts on the matter. What has worked for you? What profiles do you use? If any.   \n   \nBest,   \nPeter\n\n",

You might look at GretagMacbethï¿½s Eye-One display.\n\n"

Which results in super saturated, high contrast colors over a really bright or dim white.   \n   \nI called Apple service which were no help, I searched through the Apple forums, Adobe forums, and found there were NO solutions to speak of.   \n   \nI finally just decided to Google it and about 6 pages in found a post in a threaded discussion about a monitor calibration application called SuperCal.   \n   \nIt is AMAZING! I now have perfect calibration, perfect outputs, and across the board. Give it a try and let me know what you think, I'm honestly telling everybody about this app and am now going to keep the iMac.   \n   \nCheck it out: [http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/12756](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123830/http:/www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/12756)   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

But when I was viewing the imagery on the 4 PC's we had at the office, they looked washed out on there as well. But if I use the Color LCD profile in PS, and design within that environment, then I get a better cross platform consitency.   \n   \nAnyways, time to invest in some calibration tools.   \n   \nHave a good weekend everybody.\n\n"

      "content": "If you have Adobe Photoshop, there is a little utility packed with it called Adobe Gamma. It has wizard and manual mode to callibrate your monitor and allows to manually set the levels of Red, Green and Blue. It has proven quite useful to me, while the Pantone Spider has given no acceptable result, as it does the callibration according to some imagined \"standard\", but I need to adjust the colors so that they'd look the same as they come out from my printer's offset press. Adobe Gamma does that pretty well.\n\n"
