There is no such justification for repeating this shape in the P. It looks odd, and it draws attention away from the R.   \n   \nPersonally, I would try this with _only_ the R having an abnormal shape (and the T, of course, where it is cut off by the crest of the helmet). I think it is a mistake to remove the crossbars of the A's: sure it looks Greek, but it looks like two uppercase _lambdas_, which confuses me into reading it as SPLRTLN. Actually, in the context of the two pseudo-_lambdas_, the cut-off T begins to look a lot like a _gamma_. And then do I read the P as Latin P or Greek _rho_? SRLRGLN, anyone?   \n   \nMaking Latin letters look like non-corresponding Greek letters is a bit naff: like reversing the letter R to make things look 'Russian'.\n\n"
