I pretty much agree with you. Your posts about outline theft, pirated copies, and rip-offs are well taken. Mostly your posts are directed at a few people in IDing contests who are not as passionate as you in the sourcing or origin of the fonts.\n\nYou've made your point to them many, many times. Don't you think they understand your point by now? Will saying the same thing to the same people over and over again produce different results?\n\nAlso you are shifting the burden to the IDers to make sure they're naming a legitimate copy. Why don't you do a little checking before disparaging fonts and IDers? Why don't you start a list of illegitimate fonts? And more than once innocent posters looking for an ID, some newcomers, got caught in the crossfire.\n\nI'd just like someone with your knowledge and passion to take the rant out of Hrant. Don't give up your principles; just give up being a nag that just incurs the ire of others. And who wants to see a thread about a font ID with more posts about (il)legitmacy (real or imagined) than about the font itself?\n\n"
