      "content": "I don't know a lot about Thai typography, but IMHO these are some decent Thai fonts for long copy - e.g., they have the loops on them (font followed by vendor):   \n   \nThonburi (Apple Singapore)   \nIris (Unity Progress)   \nMerrimia (Unity Progress)   \nEucrosia (Unity Progress)   \nKinnari (National Font)   \nNarai (DB Designs)   \nCharnchai (JS Technology)   \n   \nIf I'm not mistakem, Iris and Eucrosia are installed on Windows machines that are set up for Thai. And there's always the work-horse Angsana which comes bundled with Windows too. Decent headline fonts in Thai...Lily (UPC) and Imperial (PSL SmartLetter) are \"sans\"-style faces. I think Kobori is what you see on most of the newspapers. And when I was there, I saw Siara (PSL) and Pumpuang (JS) used quite a bit in advertising. They're highly latinized faces, complete with serifs if you're into that sort of thing.   \n   \nHope this helps.\n\n"

      "content": "Actually, the version of the Arabic Typesetting font that is available with VOLT is a pretty early alpha version. It's been completely redesigned since then, and a lot of new stuff has been added. The new version, however, will not be available as a sample font from the VOLT community: it will be shipping with future MS products.   \n  \nAnother thing to bear in mind is that not every Arabic typeface is appropriate for setting Farsi text, even if the Farsi character set is supported. There are long-standing stylistic preferences among users of what is nominally the Arabic script, and fonts that are appropriate for use in Arabic text in, for example, Egypt are not appropriate for Urdu text in Pakistan. I'm afraid I do not know enough about Farsi to identify the stylstic differences between Farsi and Arabic type styles, but I know they are significant enough for Farsi users to have requested a distinctively Farsi font from Microsoft, despite the availability of numerous Arabic fonts.\n\n"
