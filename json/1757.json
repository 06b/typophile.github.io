In other words, they avoid the dazzle in this illustration.   \n   \nI am interested in what you experienced type designers think of the problem of avoiding dazzle, particularly in text faces.   \n   \nFirst of all, do you think Noordzij has it right? Is getting type to rest on the page a matter of balancing white and black? And what are your thoughts on doing it?   \n   \nWhat would make me question whether the black/white balance is all of the story is the to me undesirable dazzle in many of the 'didone' class of type in small sizes. It seems like part of the story is just the thinness of the lines.   \n   \nI was recently struck by how well Kent Lew's new face, Whitman, 'rests' on the page, at least judged by the samples on the internet. I am interested in how he and others have approached this problem.\n\n [‹ Show us your card!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829232007/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1562 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [1 week to go ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829232007/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1770 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Ironically, notan is the reason his theories of type design don't make sense!   \n   \n\\> \"Real characters have built-in stabilizers that keep black shapes in the forground\"   \n   \nThere is no foreground (at least not during immersive reading). We read notan, the balance, not the Black and White separately.   \n   \nThe relevance of notan to type design is complex, because we have to design \"firm\" atomic blacks, but half the whites (the sidebearings) exist on a more abstract level (since they only work in pairs). OpenType actually allows us to equalize the treatment of Black and White (by designing entire words which would get swapped in contextually), but I don't see many people doing that...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

As well as Kent Lew's accomplishment, mentioned above, James Montalbano's Clearview seems to be an example where this was thought out carefully.   \n   \nHe notes on his website that the typeface is designed to reduce 'halation' experienced by older drivers looking at lighted signs at night.   \n   \nWhat is this about?   \n   \nFor myself, I think that fineness of lines and points can create dazzle, as well as evenly spaced parallel lines. I think there are psycho-optical effects going on that affect comfort in reading, but they do seem to be complex.\n\n"

      "content": "Its not a matter of reducing halation. Halation occurs, especially with the new high-brightness retro-reflective materials used in roadside signage. One tries to design glyph shapes so their inherent character allows them to be deciphered even with the halation.   \n   \nIn the example of Highway Gothic Emodified I previously posted, it is quite apparent that the counters on the lowercase e and uppercase B are too small. Also the bottom terminal of the e turns up and begins to close in on itself and form an oval. Also the descender of the g is too short and not clearly formed. The v-notch or crotch of the lowercase n is not destinct enough. All of these design characteristics become overwhelmed.   \n   \nEmod was never designed for high-brightness, it was originally designed so the stroke width could support refective buttons that would reflect illumination at night.   \n   \nThe work on ClearviewHwy tried to minimize the distrotion of halation, by addressing these shortcomings in Emod.   \n   \nClearviewHwy's counters are gererous and the the round forms do not close in upon themselves (the worst example I can think of in regard to this is Helvetica).   \n   \nAll of ClearvieweHwy's \"difficult\" characters (a,e,g,s) have ample internal space. Again, you cannot minimize halation, you can only design the glyphs to survive halations effect. Letterspacing is a critical issue as well.   \n   \nAs to the notion of halation in text. I'm not sure. What I do know is when you are reading or deciphering highway signage you are doing it at close to or beyond visual threshold. Reading text on a page is done well within threshold. What I have found is that even in these different environments similar letterform constructions work.   \n   \nDisplay designs fall apart at signage distances, they also fail at text sizes. The delicate finely wrought nature of a good display type appears too \"dazzling as text. As signage it does not subtend a large enough arc across the retina. (translation: it doesn't appear large or strong enough).   \n   \nSignage types (at least in my experience) work well as text. the same sturdy, clearly defined characteristics that allow them to succeed at the edge and beyond visual threshold, are the same qualities that allow them to succeed as text.   \n   \nBlah, blah, blah.   \n   \nJames\n\n"

Drawing a glyph, putting it up on a computer screen, stepping back and squinting, is not recommended.   \n   \nYou have to make the sign at the proper size with the proper materials, put it up, get in a car, turn on the headlights and see for yourself. Perferably with an adequate test population along with you.   \n   \n   \nJames\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks so much, James; that is really interesting.   \n   \nHrant, your hypothesis on why the same considerations apply to text sizes seems plausible to me.   \n   \nWhen you look at a page of small text in Helvetica or Bodoni, the problem is not that you can't read it. It is that it is noticeably more effort to do it, and it probably slows you down also. If we do, as you (and others?) hypothesize gather significant information outside our center of focus, then that would explain it.   \n   \nThe sharp points and hairlines - and more closed counters etc - would fuzz out before more beefy points and lines, and open counters, so you would lose that information.   \n   \nIt may even be that this is the cause of the 'dazzle' experience. When you look away slightly from part of the text with sharp or thin lines, they fuzz into vanshing, and move your eyes they 'pop' back into appearance. This would explain the 'twinkling' experience.   \n   \nI do have the feeling that there are also some 'optical illusion' effects as Noordzij hypothesizes. -and the two types may interact.   \n   \nWith Whitman, the 'resting' effect is noticable to me at least, but it is a very different face from Clearview - and less beefy than James Montalbano's Rawlings.   \n   \nI hope we can rope Kent Lew into commenting on this also.   \n   \nVery informative!\n\n"

One's typefaces (both headline and text) may look perfect on a laser proof on white paper, but they will be dull printed with dark grey ink (aka black, but nowhere near the density of toner) on light grey newsprint paper. So a little pre-emptive dazzle is required.   \n   \nSo to answer the original post, if I'm designing a typeface for a specific use, I try and get what I consider to be just enough sparkle, but not too much dazzle, for that context, and, as James says, do in situ tests.   \n   \nHowever, with more \"experimental\" typefaces (and perhaps Vendome may be so described), I may decide to crank up the dazzle to 11 just for the hell of it, and let typographers figure out what to do with the font. Hence Eunoia.   \n   \n ![TurnUpTheDaz](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829232007im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/19121.jpg)   \n   \nWith a dazzling font, the typographer has the option of playing off the dazzle by printing it in subtle colors, or on rough stock, or very small, or filtered, or moving fast, or low res, in which circumstances the dazzle can be considered a pre-emptive sharpening. Or the typographer may use the font precisely for its eye-popping effect.\n\n"

There are so many design axes (or elements in the graphic language of a typeface), and once you get the knack of type design, they all get mashed together, into a global skill.   \n   \nI would say that dazzle is a question of contrast and precision, so it can manifest in any parameter -- which is why Bodoni is so dazzling across the board, as it has strong thick/thin stem-width contrast, and also sharp serifs -- sharpness being a strong figure/ground contrast at the level of detail. Bodoni also has a strong contrast between straight and round forms.   \n   \nThe dazzle that is caused by an equivalence of positive/negative forms, where there's ambivalence about which is figure and which ground, is apparent in Vendome, where the sharpness of the serif shape is \"mirrored\" in the sharpness of the acute joints.   \n   \nAnother kind of dazzle caused by equivalence and precision is the \"picket fence\" effect of evenly spaced vertical stems.   \n   \nAgain, on the subject of equivalence, when a typeface has a very precise evenness of spacing between characters -- I mean the almost imperceptible negative \"hairline\" space between adjacent serifs -- this creates sparkle, if not dazzle. You can also see that in Extra Bold House Gothic.\n\n"
