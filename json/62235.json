  "content": "Hi Guys, Im looking for some advice for this logo, a freind who's got a great writing style is doing a custom signature style logo for me (my father actually) and Im looking for advice on how best to combine the supporting text with it.\n\nDue to the odd outline shape of the signature Im finding it hard to sit it next anything comfortably. Do any of you have any good examples or advice on how best to combine heavily scripted hand rendered styles with supporting sans serifed text like this?\n\nThanks for your help.  \nGeorge\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020080356im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_06B_5431.jpg)\n\n",

Have you tried putting \"DESIGN\" above the line, and \"DEVELOP\" below?\n\nThe wide set width of the sans font might be causing some of the uncomfortable union you speak of. I might try a sans serif that's tall, like the script is, for more unity.\n\n"
