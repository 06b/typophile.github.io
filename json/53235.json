  "content": "Hello, I would like to let you know that I've updated the [iKern](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014123421/http:/www.ikern.com/) site. Several question raised here about this tool and I recognized that I needed to explain more (and better). As promised I went deeper, and I also hope clearer, into the description of its model. I hope it could be interesting.\n\nIgino Marini\n\n",
