  "content": "Hi! I'm designing a logo and I decided to use House Gothic 23 Text. But I'm with problem because I think there's only the following versions: House Gothic 23 Text Light, House Gothic 23 Text Italic and House Gothic 23 Text Bold. And I really wanted a \"Regular\" or \"Medium\" version.  \nWhat do you suggest me to do? I don't think filling the outline is the best option. Do I need to customize it? Or is there an easier way?  \nSorry my broken english. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "Well I chose this font because it goes well with the icon I designed. Both font and the icon are square-ish and semi round.  \nI'm using caps and I tried now a tricky thing, to open even more the kerning of the Bold version and resize it smaller so it will look lighter. I'm going to print and see if it works.  \nAny alternatives to House Gothic 23? It has to be very similar. Thanks.\n\n"
