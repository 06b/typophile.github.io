      "content": "Joseph, the odds are great that this is a custom (home made) font, because this type of font is so easy and cheap to produce. There is even a website ( [Fontifier](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142726/http:/www.fontifier.com/)) that will do it for free with your own printed letter samples.   \n   \nHowever, there are a lot of these kinds of fonts already available, or in circulation. If you have the patience to scan through about 500 samples, see my [Script Font ID Guide, Part 11](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142726/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html). Those with \"HW\" in the names are from the ClickArt Handwritten Fonts CD (no longer being sold), but there is an [HW Alias List](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142726/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/HWFontAliases.html) that tells you the re-named versions that you might be able to find on the web.   \n   \nI'm sorry, but I don't have time to do it myself right now.   \n   \nMy advice in cases like this is to find the closest match and go with that, because you may never be able to find the exact font. It's not worth the effort, in my opinion.\n\n"

It turns out that an intern had created the font for them but is no longer with them and they don't have the font.   \n   \nThanks again for your help...\n\n"
