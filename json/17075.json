(And considering [it's all about cars](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017203518/http:/www.edmunds.com/insideline/) and it would be everywhere? _phew!_)\n\n"

I'm sure there are many examples of neat hyphenated compounds, but can't conjure any up at the moment.\n\n"

Personally, we've been on the web long enough where I consider all of these generic nouns: web, email, website, internet.\n\nas for e-mail, that was ALWAYS an odd one to me.

      "content": "\"as for e-mail, that was ALWAYS an odd one to me. Doesn’t seem to follow any established english language rules.\"\n\nWell, it does follow the compound rules where two words aren't easily joined. Spaceship is the one side of that where they grow towards each other, e-mail is the other. Because \"e-mail\" has an inherent defined pronunciation, it has my preference. In Dutch, it's mandatory because the pronunciation changes an awful lot without the hyphen. I won't be one to tell English people how to do it on this topic, however. I'm still foreign ;)\n\n"
