Note the handwritten Greek phrase.  \nWe can check the design against some of the popular typefaces used on IBM \"elements\" -- the thing that looks like a golfball -- and see if it is digitized. They had names like \\_courier\\_, \\_prestige\\_, \\_elite\\_ etc.  \nHere is a selection of these typefaces compiled by Luc Devroye [http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317120026/http:/luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html \"http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html\") If you can find some of the distinctive letters in the book, like \\_Q\\_, \\_R\\_, \\_g\\_ and \\_3\\_ it makes it easier to decide on a match.  \nDon\n\n"

Like you say it comes from a IBM Selectric typewriter : it's called Delegate (look at the K, it matches : [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2425128/Screenshot%202014-10-02%20%C...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317120026/https:/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2425128/Screenshot%202014-10-02%20%C3%A0%2011.27.50.jpg \"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2425128/Screenshot%202014-10-02%20%C3%A0%2011.27.50.jpg\") !).
