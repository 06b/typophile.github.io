      "content": "I think it's at least customized, mostly because the 'whiskers' (or spikes, sounds more rugged) all point outward on the outer letters, regardless of case. This seems too fortuitous just to be part of the font design.   \n   \nThe lettering style has many Fraktur features, particularly the dagger-like 'p'. but you'll notice there are two different 'h' shapes. This argues even more for completely custom lettering, based on possibly a variety of Germanic Blackletter styles.\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, but if you notice, the two 'h' designs are not seperate, the lower h is simply a shortened stem while retaining the top elements. The curve on the right side of the stem where the top of the stroke touches the body of the letter may have been tweaked. I think the photoshop embossing or whatnot is affecting perception. The lower h looks like it has a smoother inside down-stroke, but I think that is caused by the play of shadow from the filter. Hmmm... Bastardized blackletter. Not a fan.\n\n"

      "content": "You are right Eric, but my point is that the lettering is not 'out of the box'. The artist may have just modified his own letters to create the two h's. And added the spikes to the outer letters.   \n   \nAt the least, I think this is a highly customized font. At the most, it has been completely created by a lettering artist.\n\n"
