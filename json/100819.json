      "content": "OT does one-to-many (type 2 GSUB lookup) easily enough. In theory, it can be made to do many-to-many, but in fact this is nowhere supported in either tools or apps. So you'd probably have to do some clever contextual one-to-many substitutions. In other words, you would have to analyse the decimal positions in the number, and substitute the appropriate word for the letters in each position. So, for an English example you might have a number '625', and you would need context to isolate the initial numeral and capture that it is in the hundreds position (followed by two integers), then substitute\n\n`six -> s i x space h u n d r e d space a n d`\n\nthen you would capture the 2 in the tens position:\n\n`two -> t w e n t y hyphen`\n\nand finally the five in the ones position:\n\n`five -> f i v e`\n\nThe biggest risk in this kind of approach is failure of context, which means you need to carefully think through all the permutations of situations in which a number might occur. I think the feature would need to be like the 'frac' feature, i.e. explicitly applied by a user to a selected string of characters, and not the sort of feature one could safely turn on for an entire document.\n\n"

You have to do it in two steps: contextually insert the new glyph where you want it, and then contextually delete the old glyph from the unwanted location. Since there are no insert/delete GSUB lookup types per se, what you need to do is first use a one-to-many lookup, and then a many-to-one lookups. So, for example, let's say I want to reorder the glyphs in the sequence ABC so that they are BAC, I would first have a lookup (VOLT syntax; sorry the Adobe stuff makes no sense to me).\n\n`A -> B A\n|C`\n\nwhich would result in BABC; then a second lookup something like\n\n`A B -> A\nB|`\n\nresulting in BAC.\n\n"
