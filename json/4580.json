The current exhibit, \\<a href=\" [http://www.nypl.org/research/calendar/exhib/hssl/hsslexhibdesc.cfm?id=351](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121924/http:/www.nypl.org/research/calendar/exhib/hssl/hsslexhibdesc.cfm?id=351)\" target=\"new\"\\>Russia Engages the World, 1453-1825\\</a\\> seems promising if you're interested in the history of printing.\n\n"

I love it, the typography is rich and diverse. I get on the Greenway at Carl Shultz park (Gracie Manson) head north to Harlem, cruise by the Cotton Club, and the Cloisters, wonderful grafitti on the bridges, and kitchy type on the buildings in lower west Manhattan. The only spot on the ride thats depressing is the WTC site.   \nIf you don't ride, take a stroll to the Empire State Building, wonderful art deco work there and that whole area.   \nAnd unrelated to typography, visit Central Park\n\n"

      "content": "Daniel - the main branch of the library is truly not to be missed for a type affecionado - it's great. The Gutenberg is perfect.   \n   \nPersonally, I could spend a day or two simply riding to every NYC subway station and pixing the graphics. The mosaic type is inspiring and thought provoking for me.   \n   \nIf you want historical scripts - The Cloisters inerior displays are a must see as well. It has the finest display of text from the early 1200's to the Gutenberg Bible that I know of (I assume the Vatican and Prado can top it for non-tourists).\n\n"
