Previously when I've printed it's been from large printing houses, and a couple hundred a pop.\n\nMy friend doesn't want to spend as much as a large printing house would charge, so can anyone suggest someplace I can get cheaper cards printed. They're only 2 colour and I've explained a cheaper place = lesser quality. I live in Toronto, but don't mind sending them out somewhere.\n\n",

      "content": "Haley,\n\nI've had many friends that need a business card - fast. Our solution: I buy cover stock #110 from Staples. I run it through 10 up to a sheet on a 4/c laser printer (Okidata) and cut (well, I have a person who does superb, accurate xactoknife slits....)\n\nIf there is a bleed - then we use an 8-up format, so we can give (till it) bleed(s)...\n\nThey go home happy - and we are cheap, cheap, cheap.\n\nAnd... yes, they look professionally printed and we receive many-a-smile.\n\nOr... you could go to Popular Printing in NY - fast, reliable, not expensive. Here are their business card prices:  \n [http://popularprinting.com/BC.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623044025/http:/popularprinting.com/BC.html \"http://popularprinting.com/BC.html\")\n\nP.S. Ricardo - I just did check out where you asked - and boy are they expensive  \n1 color 1 side 500 cards $170 (and maybe a 10% off) (and they don't even quote 4/c just 3/c 500 cards for $285)  \nGuys I use - 4 color 1 side UV coating applied 500 cards $39 bucks - no discount....\n\n"

      "content": "\"No business cards\" are better than \"cheap quality cards\". Thermography is cheap and rightfully so. Real cheap.\n\nIf you are skilled, one colour business cards, top quality paper, (Hand made perhaps,) letterpress which is suited for short run work, would improve your clients intentions.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of a designers obligations is consulting your clients. And I should add, will help build your \"reputation\". Not that that seems important in this day and age.\n\nGiampa\n\n"

The look the same as the last set I sent out to a professional printing house.  \nI have a friend who owns a letterpress studio so maybe he has an easy way for cutting business cards already made. I'll look into it.\n\n"

Nary a rough edge in sight!\n\nMore info here:\n\n[http://www.avery.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623044025/http:/www.avery.com/ \"http://www.avery.com\")\n\n"

A co-worker saw them and told me that a few years ago these same Avery cards did have rough edges, and was surprised at the smoothness of the current ones.\n\n"

This is my recommendation when money for a client really counts. Take it or leave it -- but it is very rare for me to make any recommendations, especially when it hinges on my reputation. Otherwise, for our high-end quality magazine, etc. we use a printer near Columbia, South Carolina. We've beat them up enough to give us the top of job we expect. Considering my husband has more than 50 years in the printing business, knows it inside out -- well, nevermind - to some of us quality still counts.\n\n"
