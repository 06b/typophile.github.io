  "content": "Ok so I’m making a logo for a photographer.  \nShe plans to shoot anything and everything, but her own personal style  \nis a lot of macros of natural things like plants and insects.\n\nSo I got a logo here that is using the symbol for a roll of film, creating  \na butterfly. There are 2 versions which I am posting, the only thing being  \ndifferent is the orientation of the butterfly’s antennae, and the spacing  \nof the “wings.”\n\nAny thoughts on the mark?\n\nAnd the typography is just kind of thrown on there,  \nif possible I would love some suggestions on some good  \nscripts and sans-serifs that are free, or that I may potentially  \nhave in my library already.\n\nPlus any suggestions as you see fit. Thank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170807im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Version1_4632.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170807im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Version2_3487.jpg)\n\n",

Although I myself am still leaning towards the butterfly.\n\nAlaskan—I spaced the mark out a little bit as requested. I certainly had thought of making the inner circles the lighter color, here’s what it would look like.\n\nBut this leads me to a conceptual question that i’m struggling with. I included in the far right of the image, the basic black film roll icon. The mark I created refers to that icon, though I admit it is no longer simply a film roll—it is now a butterfly. But in the way that the icon uses the same color for both inner and outer circle, should i do so for MY mark? Does changing the color of the inner and outer circles (as opposed to using a two color scheme in which the inner and outer are always the same color—as in the previous versions) take away from the idea that this mark has to do with photography?\n\nAnd in the last version I post, I almost get the read of binoculars which has to do with optics and lenses, seeing...photography.\n\nAny other opinions or input?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170807im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Version2_4603.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170807im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Version3_4925.jpg)\n\nPS. Alaskan—haven’t bought the font, so that arrow says “purple text,” which can happen when i buy that thing\n\n"

I’m not sure if I can drop the caps treatment on the word Photography then... what do you guys vote for, caps or no?\n\nOk people—I apologize for getting color crazy. But I’ve sourced some RGBs from pictures of butterflies. I don’t think the tri-color treatment works though. It looks to me as though having a diff. color for the outer circle and antennae screws with immediately recognizing the butterfly. I tried a whole range of colors, clearly, sorry... as well as a black and silver combination—of which there are 3 shades of gray.\n\nI also noticed that many butterflies are duo-tone, with black edges.  \nSo I’m now leaning towards the two with black outer circles, and blue, then red inner, respectively. Or one of the ones below those two that feature gray inner circles (there’s something elegant about them).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170807im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Version4_5688.jpg)\n\n"
