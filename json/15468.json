It is nicely worn but highly legible even at small point sizes.\n\nGrit Egyptienne™ is an eight font family designed with heavy grunge in mind. The distressed look is what lead to the formation of Baseline Fonts - but now designers seem to be more willing to really extend even further into worn and nicely throttled type treatments. Grit Egyptienne™ and alternates are interchangeable to provide an endless array of variation in a block or single line of type.\n\nPDF specimen sheet is available for download: [http://www.baselinefonts.com/sample-gritegyptienne.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329210722/http:/www.baselinefonts.com/sample-gritegyptienne.pdf)\n\nAntimony™ is a vertical typeface with delicate, worn flairs and includes a regular version as well as a distressed version.  \nPDF specimen sheet is available for download: [http://www.baselinefonts.com/sample-antimony.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329210722/http:/www.baselinefonts.com/sample-antimony.pdf)\n\nCoincidentally, all three new typefaces enable a significant number of characters to be packed into a relatively small footprint.\n\nAll fonts are available directly through the Baseline Fonts website ( [www.baselinefonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329210722/http:/www.baselinefonts.com/)) and should be available through all Baseline Fonts vendors over the next few months.\n\n",
