  "content": "I copied a piece of text with numbers from a file since I wanted to use the font to create another set of numbers. The trouble is when I type the new numbers, they look different (\"2\") and the numbers fall below the baseline (\"7\").\n\nBearing in mind it is the same font with exactly the same properties (baseline shift, character styles, paragraph settings, etc.) I cant seem to understand the problem.\n\nI can use the original text of numbers to create the new set of numbers but I want to understand what the problem is. Please help!!!\n\nIn the image, the numbers above is the result and the numbers below is the source from where I copied the numbers\n\nFont: Prelo Sans Light 7pt\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105040926im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-1_4612.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "You are using an OpenType font with oldstyle numerals enabled (the top example). These are often used in running text, since they tend to blend in better. The bottom example would be called lining numerals, in which the numbers are all the same height. More and more typefaces nowadays include these two sets of numerals and more.\n\nSwitching from one set to the other depends on the application you are using. If you are in InDesign, in the character palette click the flyout menu, then OpenType, and then (at the bottom) select the numeral style you would like.\n\nRead [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105040926/http:/ilovetypography.com/2008/04/25/extreme-type-terminology-part-4) on I Love Typography for more information.\n\n"
