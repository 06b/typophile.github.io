It searches historical churches, museums and similar institutions to develop handwriting and other fonts from old documents. This kind of research is not common in Brazil. In addition, its design team also works to create new and modern typefaces for all applications.”\n\nSamples & bio text courtesy of Myfonts\n\nMr.Google tells me typophile has no references to Iza W.\n\nj a m e s\n\n",
