  "content": "A cousin of Galette, Tertre derives its inspiration from the French signage tradition. It is a display typeface with a wide range of applications from signage to menus and pricelists, branding and packaging or publishing. It is named after Place du Tertre, a square located at the top of Montmartreâ€”a hill overlooking Paris, made famous by the artists of the 19th and 20th Century.  \nAlternate capitals with Art Nouveau flavor are provided, as well as Central European, Baltic and Turkish language support.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203011508im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tertre1_6163.png)\n\nNow available from [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203011508/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/paragraph/tertre/).
