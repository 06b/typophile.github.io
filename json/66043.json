  "content": "Hot off the press, cards for my consulting persona on Hahnemuhle's Copperplate+Bugra custom duplexed to make a 430gsm sheet.\n\nThis is the Bugra \"Burgundy\" color, and bright-white Copperplate etching paper.  \nThe stock was dampened using a 16th century technique before printing from photopolymer plates on the 10x15 Heidelberg Windmill letterpress\n\nThe reverse side has been printed with two varnishes, tinted with bronze powder and silver... which only show up when the light is just right. The silvered varnish is used on the front, along with two 'normal' inks.\n\nImpression depth is not quite as dramatic as it seems, but I had to use a hard side-light to be able to see the subtle varnish on the front of the card.\n\nFonts are Gill Sans with bold and italic. The Semiotx logo is from my own library, A\\*I Marlowe, a revival based on the Oxford Fell types, the forms here were altered by eye to make the lower-case weights match the caps (or was it visa versa?)\n\nprinted at slowprint.com - exquisite letterpress takes time™  \nIdeas Words: Idea Swords - ideaswords.com - semantic strategies for communication™\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415045801im_/http:/typophile.com/files/semiotx_HDR2-2_5646.jpg)\n\n",
