He asked me if there was a constructivist heyday in Greece at the same time as the Russian Avant Garde and German Bauhaus. I told him I didn’t think so because it was a troubled time in Greece then. Since I said that, I began to wonder if anyone knew more about it? Perhaps Gerry Leonedis, John Hudson or any other student of visual history might be more knowledgeable and share their insight?\n\nChrisL\n\n [‹ Luc DeVroye's website has been closed!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423220059/http:/typophile.com/node/19516 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [\"Combining\" two fonts into one? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080423220059/http:/typophile.com/node/20441 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

What I’d really be interested to know is if there was any sort of dialogue between Greece and the West, or between Greece and Soviet Russia at this time.\n\nMalevich, Van Doesberg, El Lizitsky, Jan (here Iwan) Tschichold, Paul Klee, Kurt Schwitters, Mondrian, et al. … these people didn’t all have much in common with everyone else necessarially, but in hindsight it is easy to put them all in the same “box,” even if that oversimplifies things. Did they have any “copiers” in Greece? Artists trying to follow along the same lines?\n\nWere there Greek Communists/Bolsheviks? What did their graphics look like? Soviet Russia laid heavy on the propaganda during the 1920s and 30s. Did any of this make it to Greece?\n\n"

Eventually Italy ended up with its birth of Modernism and the oft blasted Massimo must have learned his trade somehow but Greece? xero ego?\n\nΠοιος ξέρει;\n\nChrisL\n\n"
