  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nThe Politics magazine The Economist does is a special serif font designed for them named Eco.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/eco-101/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150226174251/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/eco-101/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/eco-101/\")\n\nHowever I could not help to notice that is looks very much alike some classic serif modern font but I cannot remember the name. Any help on this?\n\nBy the way, did anybody saw The Econommist Magazine, three column page design with this font and the very tight leading? I do like the design but the leading so tight make it hard to read for me. What do you think? Most Economy and Political magazine, like Time and Newsweek use the same format.\n\nThanks for any help and best,  \nSebastiao\n\n",
