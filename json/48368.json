Again, looking for any comments & critique, also if you have any ideas as to more of a “rose” like symbol, ideas would be great.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Discover Rosetown text used in that order\n- The color red that is seen in the logo\n- A symbol representing a rose\n\nAgain, looking forward to your input.\n\n[http://freshnewthing.com/rosetown\\_logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045653/http:/freshnewthing.com/rosetown_logo.jpg \"http://freshnewthing.com/rosetown\\_logo.jpg\")\n\n [‹ Personal Logo Critique](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045653/http:/typophile.com/node/48203 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo For a Photographer, WIP ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045653/http:/typophile.com/node/48080 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I like this one. It’s nice and subtle and balanced. Funnily, in this one the “.com” doesn’t bother me as much. I think it might be because everything else doesn’t lend itself to an online company that it doesn’t take it over the top.\n\nI like the subtle shade changes in the rose mark, however, I would suggest changing the perspective. Right now it doesn’t look much like a rose. I think a head-on perspective (looking into the center of the rose as opposed to the side) might work better. For some reason, a Charles Rennie Macintosh rose came into my mind when I read the name. Here’s an example: [http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5158M2VM5GL.\\_SL500\\_AA280\\_.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045653/http:/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5158M2VM5GL._SL500_AA280_.jpg \"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5158M2VM5GL.\\_SL500\\_AA280\\_.jpg\")\n\nIt’s a nice simple shape and I think would work well with the overlapping, transparent petal feel you have right now.\n\npenn\n\n"
