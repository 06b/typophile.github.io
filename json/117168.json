They look so familiar and yet I haven't been able to figure them out.\n\nThis was created sometime between the 40's and 60's. I don't know exactly when though. The Bates type seems to be related to Caslon, based on the A. But I'm not sure what other fonts were used in the era that would have similar characteristics.\n\nAny feedback or direction would be appreciated!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725014219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bates_4943.jpg)\n\n",

Even though those weren't exactly the fonts, looking at the details of them helped to guide some of the decisions I had to make in regards to the how some areas terminated and things like that. I'm almost done with it and hopefully the client loves it. Thanks!\n\n"
