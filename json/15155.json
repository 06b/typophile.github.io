Sometimes the difference can be huge. If you want to answer the question you have to choose a type & then measure. Why do you want to know? What is your purpose?\n\n"

Believe it or not, some guys even had scabbards for their “blades.”\n\n_58 lines at 10, 11, 12, 14 points of lead converted to inches, agate lines, centimeters? Easy, just place your thumbnail at 58 and flip over the ruler!_\n\n"

      "content": "The height of the block of text from ascender of the top line to descender of the bottom line will be 22.43cm (636pts)\\* the top line won’t have any leading above it so it isn’t 22.50cm (638pts). This is only pedantry and won’t really affect a mark-up for text with such tight leading and the difference will only be tenths of a millimetre.\n\n\\*This figure is likely too high since the actual height of a font rarely takes up the full point size it is designated.  \nTim\n\n"
