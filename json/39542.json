  "content": "I was just told to squeeze in my body copy in order to fit it rather than size it proportional to its original intent. I makes me feel so dirty and sinful even thought I don't believe in God. Well I believe God is made up of ligatures, yeah that’s it. I told them that squeezing type is wrong, If you designed a typeface would you want to see it squeezed to fit on some huge billboard? I think not. One wouldn't skew a painting, One shouldn't skew type. If its too small to size it correctly then you should work larger. If fact work as large as you can. Working large is fun, really it is. The 'center' tool is the Devil.\n\n",

      "content": "I feel your pain, Chasography. I don't know where it starts or how it happens, but irreverence towards typography is a common problem here, too. I really cannot believe it when I open a file and find type condensed as much as 85%...sometimes even more. I've made similar statements to yours in front of the group, and they nod in agreement, then go on offending. It's as if they are insisting that I don't know what I'm talking about just because I talk like I know what I'm talking about.\n\nI have learned to do things correctly without asking permission. I no longer mention that I've found condensed type in a file, I just correct it, reduce the point size to fit and save over. I'm a vigilante, for cryin' out loud! I'm pretty sure my supervisors appreciate my efforts even though they might be totally unaware that it is happening.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot get my hands on every file.\n\nAgreed regarding centering, and I'm going to add exaggerated drop shadows to your rant.\n\nI've gotten the impression that most of the people using this site are professionals...art directors and junk...pretty sure they all completely understand, only they have the good fortune of being in charge!\n\n"

      "content": "I don't know if you will even get this since its down on the newest board but, sometimes its not that bad, but for me...99% condensed is bad. We only have condensed Bodoni, Helvetica condensed and Runic or something condensed.... Work computers doesn't have that many good typefaces since they mostly download them for free. I'm thinking of putting some of mine on cd’s and uploading or just buying some. It kinda sucks buying for a wealthy company out of pocket but then again I've got my designer side to me.  \nSee last night I was engraving three glass plaques, they were curved into a crescent which is something that is usually sandblasted. If it goes too far right or left then the laser will not engrave since It thinks its flat and all the same thickness as the center most point. In order to have all the type to a point to where it stays in the engraving zone it has to be pretty small. I made it that way. I personally like lots of white space but they don't. They want a maximum of a half inch border and centered. They said it was too small, that I didn't have to make it ALL smaller, I said that if the logo and the 'presented to' and the year was the same size then the name and the body copy would be insignificant. They said just squeeze it, I did. they said \"not that much\" I said it would have to if it is engraved. It was condensed about 50%. ugh\n\nChase Langdon\n\n"
