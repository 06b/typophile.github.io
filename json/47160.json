  "content": " **UPDATE** We're now taking pre-orders in the [Typophile Store](http://web.archive.org/web/20140218052730/http:/typophile.bigcartel.com/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140218052730im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typ_tee_winner_promo_2008_6741.jpg)\n\nAfter a heated battle and much deliberation the winning tee has emerged! SN Rajpurohit from Ahmedabad, India has won the contest with his subission _Light, Regular, Bold & Bold Italic_.\n\nWe don't expect the world to get it, and that's parf of the point. The tee will be printed on an American Apparel shirt in \"Light Blue\" with gray ink. Stay tuned for pre-order information.\n\nSatya will receive a copy of the mighty **[FontBook](http://web.archive.org/web/20140218052730/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontBook)** (A $99 USD value, thanks to FontShop!) and a $100 gift certificate to [**Threadless**](http://web.archive.org/web/20140218052730/http:/www.threadless.com/), (thanks Skinnycorp!).\n\nThank you for the [hundreds of entries](http://web.archive.org/web/20140218052730/http:/typophile.com/typophile_tee_contest_2008). We had a difficult time judging them all.\n\n",
