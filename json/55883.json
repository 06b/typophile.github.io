If you hate them and have a lot of free time on your hands, then you can pursue some course of action like demanding extra money, hire a lawyer, etc. Of course I think this would be a huge waste of time in most instances, and you should just show it in your portfolio if you're really proud of your work and be done with it.\n\nI would say a good 50% of the time, the credit info has been wrong when I get work in a publication. This is not always to my detriment, but they get at least some detail incorrect.\n\n"

Try just sending a nice letter politely requesting that this oversight be fixed in future editions of the book.\n\n"
