  "content": "Hi everyone@typophile,\n\nI was asked recently by a good friend of mine to determine the typeface in 'christian Dior' (see attached image).\n\nAnd I couldn't find it. I searched in my typefinder, and online but nowhere I could find it.\n\nI've got the impression that it might be a recent design or custom made; But it is a beautiful face; notice the strange 'a'.\n\nI found something that came nearby like 'cochin'&'sabon'.\n\nHas anybody an idea who designed this font, or where to find it for purchase.\n\nthanks!!!\n\n;-) Zoë\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Christian\\_Dior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103081207/http:/typophile.com/files/Christian_Dior.jpg) | 21.06 KB |\n\n",

However, _contra_ the custom theory, it strikes me as somewhat odd that the spacing between the i and o in Dior seems a little dodgy.\n\nAlso, wdq154226: why are you gracing these discussions with links to Chinese manufacturers? Much as I love fiberglass, I don't see that it contributes much...\n\n"

Can anyone confirm that the Dior-typeface **is** custom made? Or is there somewhere a typeface which can be bought?\n\nthanks again!\n\n;-) Zoë\n\n"
