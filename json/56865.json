(Though I don’t know how you work! ;-) )\n\nI think #1 clearly reads as “anavink”.\n\nRegarding how to connect the two “i”s, how about something in this direction? (Hope you don’t mind the quick comp.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170534im_/http:/typophile.com/files/anavi-idea_4174.gif)\n  \n#7 might also work quite nicely but I’d try making the top of the “I” look more like it could also be a lowercase “i”. But then it might look too much like a numeral one. Hmm.\n"

I like your idea of reversing the i since that feels a little bit quirky which works well with the style I have also. I will play with your idea and #7 some more. Thanks a bunch!\n\nLast question..how do you like the splotch? I did it on the computer, but if it doesn’t “feel” right then I can also make a real ink splotch on paper scan it in and trace it in Illustrator..I want to make sure it feels genuine.\n\n"

      "content": "Small splatters have way too much detail to be complemented with less detailed type. On the other hand, none of the big ones work...\n\nso you either:  \n1. try to make a big splatter work  \n2. remove detail from the small one (I would also enlarge it a bit)\n\nregarding #7. It’s probably better to have it as capital I, but what should definitely be done is stem weight to match other letters.\n\nAnd apart from my comment with “1 and 2”... I’d separate splatter from the letters. I guess that’s a good way of using a bigger splatter. If you make the splatter somehow resemble letter “a” it would be even better. But it should look natural and not too artificial/pushed... Or maybe use letter “a” and replace the bowl with a splatter. Could be a nice logo symbol. And probably also a very nice and original use of splatter.\n\nSplatters are usually visually pleasing, natural and beautiful. So I would just use ’em as is.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

      "content": "_“how do you like the splotch?”_  \nI like it. At this size, it didn’t strike me as artificial at all (at least when it’s used small). But you’d have to show a PDF to be sure.\n\nI don’t agree with Litera’s point of equalizing the level of detail. To my eye, this contrast in detail-level between the type and the splotch is very interesting visually and works just fine;\\* plus, I don’t think it’s so _very_ detailed that you’ll run into reproduction issues at a “normal” size/usage.\n\n\\* Though I’ve been known to like more extreme levels of contrast than other designers, so maybe it’s just me. But coming back to the artificiality question above, I’m thinking if you make the splotch less detailed, it might just stop looking like a splotch!\n\n"
