  "content": "Hello,\n\nThis is my first post here, and this is my first typeface.\n\nThe face is conceptually based off the town planning grid of a town in New Zealand called Levin.\n\nHere it is. I have quite a bit of work to do on the kerning.\n\nThis is the lighter weight version of the face.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123163357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/levin_4122.gif)\n\nAny feedback is welcome. I realise that the characters are a little odd, but that conceptually was what I was going for.\n\n",

      "content": "I like this in general. Much of the lc seems too wide, while the uc is too narrow, relative to each other. But that might just be my opinion.\n\nI see among your punctuation you have a \"$\" and a 2-story \"a\" which I guess could be an alternate or an \"@\". If it is the latter, it isn't recognizable as such, nor is the \"$\". While the vertical bar doesn't need to be continuous or even necessarily penetrate the outer contours, it still needs a little more of it. As it is, the \"$\" looks like an \"S\" with some obscure accent of some kind.\n\n"
