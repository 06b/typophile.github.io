My intuition tells me that if there were, I would see it used, because it really is beautiful. It seems to have been very common back in its day, but I'd never seen it until I recently started looking at old print ads and such.\n\nI'd like to make sure I've researched it thoroughly before putting in the time to recreate it myself. Any help is much appreciated. I'm a new member on this forum, so hello to all.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1896\\_bikeadbooklet.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012135034/http:/typophile.com/files/1896_bikeadbooklet.jpg) | 644.67 KB |\n\n",
