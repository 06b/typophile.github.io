  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am very interested in how you genereally think when you are making those specimen PDF sheets.\n\nI've seen that many foundries include a full character sets in the PDF, and we all know it is possible to break out the font from that. On the other hand maybe it is worth the risk.\n\nI am pending between including all characters (for the buyers sake) to give people the possibility to see all characters and by that I think it is good for buying customers – OR to put up the full character sets on my webpage as pixelbuilt images. And by this let the PDF serve more as inspiration. The negative side of the later is of course that people cant zoom in on the characters etc and get a full picture of the whole font.\n\nHow do you all approach this? Thanks in advance.\n\n",

I have met people (online) who collect fonts, not to use them, but only to be able to boast that they have a large(r) collection. Many of these people will never use the fonts, just having them on their hard disk is enough for them.\n\nAnd of course that does not deduct from the designers income the way that pirates who sell or otherwise distribute to actual users do.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>If you embed a full font in a PDF, it will always be possible to extract it.</cite>\n\nThat necessarily doesn’t make piracy of embedded fonts especially relevant from a business standpoint. People who have nothing better to do than extract fonts from PDFs probably aren’t ever going to be customers. At best it prevents people from running programs that download every specimen on a foundry web site, extract the fonts, and create new-but-screwy-versions that get released as large collections. But people do that with flash type testers already.\n\n<cite>How do you mean? A password to open the file?<br>\nThat would defeat the purpose of downloadable PDF specimens, wouldn’t it?</cite>\n\nPDF encryption can place different limits on a file. One can encrypt a file that can still be viewed and printed, but not viewed as plaintext, converted to postscript, printed to another PDF, or embedded in other files. Reading the Acrobat manual would be an excellent idea for people outputting PDF specimens.\n\n"

Don't let fear run your business.\n\nI don't think a flattened PDF is a good idea. It is just as bad, maybe worse, that a limited set. I want to be able to zoom in on the letters. In order to make it high res enough for zooming that PDF would become a monster.\n\n"

Embed fonts with subsetting. And convert only the glyph overview to outlines. So the embedded/extracted fonts are at least incomplete, in addition to lacking kerning and OT layout tables.  \nI would think that someone who is interested in a typeface will print some pages. Even the glyph overview converted to outlines should be fine for evaluation with standard high-res printers.\n\n"

I have no reason to believe that piracy via ripping fonts out of the PDF is a significant portion of all piracy of our fonts. If it were 10% or more, I'd start to be concerned about doing things differently. But I have no reason to think it's even 1%. It's just so much easier to get the \"actual\" font from pirate sources.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
