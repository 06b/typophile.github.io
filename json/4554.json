  "content": "I made a font for a client who uses Corel Draw. Now when I suggested that he should switch to Illustrator, that opened a can of worms. He really didn't like my suggestion.   \n   \nThe font works for him in Word and Works, so it's obviously valid. It works on both my PC and Mac at home. Is there something perhaps in the way I'm generating the font? I used Fontlab 4.6 to make it.   \n   \nThe worse part of this is that Chank made the last font for him and it worked perfectly. I asked Chank if he did anything different from me (after all, he's the one that taught me) and there wasn't anything we could come up with.   \n   \nWhat do you think? Anyone have an idea, besides dumping Corel Draw? I mean really, why use that program? But that can't be part of my answer.   \n   \nThe only possible thing I can think of is that I copy and paste the font into a new document. Maybe the document is corrupt? I have no clule. Please help me!   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "sorry, should have gone into more detail. the font shows up in the type menu. however, when he tries to type nothing happens. from what i understand, the cursor doesn't move. so basically corel doesn't understand the font.   \n   \ni came up with two approaches for this after i posted this:   \n1. download the corel 12 trial version and install it on my pc. if it works on there then no problem on my end.   \n2. since i used fontlab, maybe i should use fontographer and export it as a ttf file. maybe that might have something to do with it? i don't like that option because fontlab shouldn't have a problem.   \n   \none thing i don't know is what he's running. how old his computer is, if he's using windows 98, etc. so there are some unknown variables in this problem.\n\n"

Maybe the font isn't correctly installed.   \nHave he tried reinstalling the font?   \n   \nAnother (less probable) hypothesis is, there's something wrong with the font's name.   \nAny 'weird' (non-alphabetical) characters in its name?\n\n"
