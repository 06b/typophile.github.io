  "content": "Hi all,\n\nNot specifically a type problem per se, but I thought the Typophile collective might be able to suggest a solution to the problem...\n\nI work on a Mac (OS X) and regularly need to print lots of PDF files (magazine pages). They need to be sent to our laser printer on our studio network and it's a grade-A hassle to print because if I try to highlight all the files and select print, a print options dialogue box appears for each and every PDF - meaning I can't leave the Mac working away and go and do something else, even though the print options are identical for each PDF file. It's not the end of the world or anything, it's just irritating, having to sit there and manually attend to the dialogue boxes!\n\nHas anyone got any idea of a way around this? Is there an AppleScript or application that will take the chore away?\n\nCheers\n\nSi\n\n",
