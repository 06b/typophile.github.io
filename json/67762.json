  "content": "Hi all, this is my first post, so I hope I'm doing everything right.\n\nMy late grandmother had this book entitled \"Humorous Poetry\", and since there's no copyright / colophon, I'd be really interested in help in finding more about the book and the typeface used for the body copy. The book is a collection of poetry (from Chaucher and the like)... I found an [archived copy of it](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022204919/http:/www.archive.org/details/humorouspoetryof00part), with the copyright date (mine has the copyright page missing) at c.1884. Can I assume this was (or close to) the publication date?\n\nI've attached a specimen of the font and I also included a photo of the cover for interest's sake. The floral capitals and embellishments on the cover are really neat.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [type\\_specimen.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022204919/http:/typophile.com/files/type_specimen_1.jpg) | 104.52 KB |\n| [humorouspoetry\\_cover.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022204919/http:/typophile.com/files/humorouspoetry_cover_0.jpg) | 316.1 KB |\n\n",

In Baskerville it ends out, in Caslon it ends in.\n\nI would also note that so many Caslon/Baskerville faces do not carry the classic italics but have modernized them considerably. Go for the old ones - they're delightful!\n\n--Kelsey\n\nThis is Baskerville:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022204919im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gilpin_6434.jpg)\n\nThis is Caslon:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022204919im_/http:/typophile.com/files/caslon_gilpin_5731.jpg)\n\n"
