The link speaks for itself. \"The\" DejaVu \"fonts are free as in freedom, and may thus freely be embedded\".\n\nWhat i 'm posting below is a recent attempt to design Greek glyphs for the serif version from scratch, initially for my very personal use (i guess i liked too much typesetting in the Latin version). The idea of including these glyphs in the original DejaVu Serif is currently under consideration by the team running the project, so, your feedback on the way the glyphs look and any ideas for their potential improvement are more than welcomed.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DejaVuSerif.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417091937/http:/typophile.com/files/DejaVuSerif.pdf) | 48.72 KB |\n\n",

Too many serifs for one thing, and I'm guessing you've matched up the vertical proportions WRT the Latin. Please read my article in the 2005 edition of Hyphen (the Greek typographic journal). Or for starters: [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417091937/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome1.html \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss\\_rome1.html\") \\_  \nSpecifically in the lc for example, the eta and chi are fully Latinized. They're not Greeks, they're tourists.  \n2) There is a general malformation of curves. A quick look at the alpha indicates there's a lot of work to be done...\n\nAll this said, I think with research, thought, sensitivity and persistence you can and will arrive at something good enough. And try to be happy even for the negative opinions: it means people care. Also, you have something very valuable going for you: nativity. The fact that you've been (I presume) exposed to Greek since childhood means you have the invaluable but elusive cultural sensitivity in you - you just have to get to it, by effort, but also by knowing what elements from Latin type to throw away instead of blindly replicate.\n\nBTW, I noticed that\\* DejaVu has an Armenian component.  \nI'd be curious to see that, and there I could help you guys for real.\n\n\\* I'm asssuming it's the \"Arev\" set mentioned in that wiki - which is  \npretty clever, since it's the reverse of \"Vera\", and it means \"sun\"!\n\nhhp\n\n"

I also strongly support your choice in favour of letter shapes that comply to what a typographical typeface should be, i.e. that what some consider \"latinocentric\". That choice is seconded by authorities in type design such as Jan van Krimpen and Eric Gill. However, some suggestions:\n\nΑ: cross bar too low  \nΒ: too wide; cross bar too low  \nΓ: too wide (= arm too long)  \nΔ: foot stroke too thin (match it with the left slanted stroke)  \nΕ: cross bar too high  \nΗ: cross bar too high  \nΘ: cross bar too high; serifs too big (long), which clutters the counter  \nΞ: cross bar too high and too thin, serifs to big (cfr Θ)  \nΡ: (bowl) too wide  \nΣ: the diagonals shouldn't have the same thickness; either the upper one is the thicker (following the translation of the pen), or the lower one (as in Z)  \nγ: you should choose between these alternates (I prefer the first one)  \nζ: you should choose between these alternates (I prefer the second one)  \nη: perhaps making a descender from the second stroke would be one concession you could make to the misolatinists (and would better match the μ)  \nν: you should choose between these alternates (I prefer the second one)  \nξ: you should choose between these alternates (I prefer the first one while is the most latinised)  \nς: you should choose between these alternates (I prefer the first one)  \nυ: you should choose between these alternates (I prefer the second one)  \nΰ: acutus too low in regard to the trema\n\nDid you plan to add polytonic glyphs as well?

But i can hardly see any real criticism on your posts nor do i feel that you essentially offered any real input. I shall therefore not consider these posts any more seriously than  \nyou considered mine. Just for the record, without being a \"self-respecting typographer\", but definitely considering myself a self-respecting reader, you need to be reminded that we do need to typeset other texts as well rather than...the Bible or the Battle of Marathon, in Greece. Regardless of your nationality then, your stay for as much as a quarter of a century in the country should have offered you a couple of looks on some newspapers at least. Garamond's or Didot's designs were wonderful, the Slimbach and the Greek Font Society's revivals are magnificent, still there are people who need to typeset texts that simply do not look OK with the \"retrospective touches\" typefaces like these have. Oh, and by the way, my sincere apologies for hurting your eyes.\n\nDear Hrant, Ludwig M. Solzen and crossgrove sincere thanks for your comments. Now, that's real food for thought. Indeed, i still have a lot of work on the curves and lots of research to carry out. To be honest, i was expecting to hear that it looks too latinized and was more than sure that the remarks about the latin \"chi\" and \"eta\" would immediately pop-up. I've kept these glyphs like that after some consideration though. I'm not sure whether it's just a trend or whether the real reasons behind it are more practical (e.g. saving up some space and simplifying letterforms when typesetting in very small sizes etc.), but chi's and eta's without descenders are something that more and more appears in contemporary Greek typefaces (a big percentage of typefaces designed and used inside Greece); you might want to consider that. Also, you might not be aware of that or like it, but another \"trend\" is a latinized zeta or final sigma and I'm not speaking about just a couple of typefaces for specific uses here. I'm speaking about typefaces used by the biggest newspaper/magazine publishing companies. The only contemporary typeface that managed to be a real exception to all these \"trends\" without looking \"old-fashioned\" (don't misunderstand my point here, please) is, to my eyes, P. Bilak's \"Fedra\". Now, it was after some thought that i chose my pathway; i wanted to attempt a design that, while it might not be so academically consistent, it might actually turn out usable by people who simply don't want the classical touches of already existing, beautiful serif typefaces, some of which are already offered as freeware. Moreover, to my eyes, an overall too curvy and \"calligraphic\", too-\"traditional\" (e.g. Garamond-like since \"rcc\" mentioned it) design of the Greek glyphs could easily end up leading DejaVu to a \"typeface-within-a-typeface\" problem, namely, Greek glyphs side by side with Latin glyphs looking as if they actually belonged to different typefaces. A too-Latinized version, as you nicely pointed out for my design, is on the other edge, though. And upon this i should do some more research indeed.\n\nFor the Armenian component of the DejaVu you might want to contact the team running the project?\n\nAll the best,\n\nVangelis\n\nPS: Dear Ludwig, yes, polytonic support is going to be added as soon as the glyphs forms are finalized.\n\n"

      "content": "The concept of latinisation is wrong. Western script originates from its Greek ancestry, which in its turn derives from the Phoenician alphabet, which in turn, &c. Alphabetical script forms one insoluble whole, as opposed to syllabic or pictographic scripts. The differences between the diverse sets (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic) are in the letterforms, their skeletons that is, not in the way they are stylistically rendered. This derives from the tools and the intended use.\n\nPrinted scripts are formalised because of the way in which they were and are produced, and because of their use with composing and printing machines. Printing was invented in Western Europe (forget about the Chinese and Koreans for a moment), where Latin script dominated. The letter forms that were taken as a model were already heavily formalised, becoming even more so as printing faces. So, what one considers latinocentric (formalised in stead of chirographic forms), really is the essence of type (printing type, that is), not an exclusive particularity of Latin script.\n\nGreek script never came loose from chirography, likely because it was introduced already too late in print, or because those who commissioned the first Greek types attached too heavily to the exotic Greek manuscripts of their days. Anyhow, the fact that for centuries Greek has been set with cursive types, makes that all Greek fonts look the same, i.e. there is but one style that is deemed proper for it, while Latin script has evolved over the centuries and can look back at a rich variety of styles. I strongly support type designers to give Greek (and Cyrillic) script a similar richness of style. This doesn't mean that proper glyph shapes are to be rejected (such as in Serbian or Bulgarian); chirographic idiosyncrasies (such as the pleade of Greek script ligatures), though, should be removed as unnecessary redundancies.\n\n"

Yes, it's important to be aware of them, but even more important is: recognizing and supporting the ones that are actually good; and seeing the limits of style in the domain of text faces.\n\nSaving space is a good thing, usually. It's just another factor.\n\nSimplfying: now there's the bugbear. Way too often it ends up resulting in empoverishment, and not much else. I wish it was just another factor, but usually it's too dominant. A symptom of Modernism.\n\nAnd what usually gets dropped from the equation is cultural and functional insight and sensitivity. This can only lead to an icrease in the size of the pointless gray blob consuming (intentional choice of term, that) the world.\n\n\\> what one considers latinocentric (formalised in stead  \n\\> of chirographic forms), really is the essence of type\n\nThis is exactly the sort of cultural hubris that leads to the demotion of minorities.

Still, they didn't invent printing as it is understood generally, and as it was (re)invented, refined, used and promulgated by the Europeans. The endeavours of the Chinese and the Koreans in printing with moveable types is an interesting anecdote of history, but nevertheless remains marginal in regard to the history of print and of present evolutions.

A lot has been said in this thread that I could comment on, but let me just add my opinions about the font for now.\n\nFirst the lowercase letters:\n\nOf the variant forms of letters (gamma, zeta, nu, ksi, finial sigma, upsilon), I like the first ones in all the cases. Breaking the symmetry helps letter differentiation. I agree that the curves have to be touched up in alpha, and also in the zeta, ksi, and finial sigma. The upper-left serif of eta needs thinning.\n\nI think I might prefer the theta opened up on the left, although it might be a challenge to keep a clean look in that form. The chi might work better with semi-serifs for the thicker diagonal. I am curious about the decision to shape the tau like you did, with the foot slightly dipping below the baseline and diverging from the forms of iota and pi.\n\nMaybe you could make the angle of the acutos steeper when it combines with the trema. Right now the combination isn't completely happy.\n\nAs for the uppercase:\n\nI agree that the crossbar of the alpha is too low, but I'm guessing that comes from the latin cognate forms from DejaVu Serif. Still, you could make the Greek forms subtly different from the latin. The serifs of the middle horizontal strokes of the theta and the ksi are a bit too prominent.\n\nOverall, the text setting looks good, though I'll have to print it out to form a better opinion. Please keep posting improvements.\n\n"

Putting aside the issue of their design merits for a moment, I'm curious whether you (Vangelis) intend the new version to complement the existing one or to replace it.\n\nI think both styles of Greek have their uses. In fact, I think maybe three different styles of Greek glyphs are necessary for full versatility.\n\nLet me explain. Who needs the Greek glyphs in a multilingual open source font like DejaVu Serif? I think most users will fall under one of three categories:\n\n1. Greek speakers.  \n2. Scholars who deal with Ancient or Mediaeval Greek.  \n3. Those who need the odd Greek glyphs now and then for technical symbols.\n\nAs you implicitly suggested, each category has its own rules of what is acceptable in the design of the Greek glyphs. It is possible to have a single set of Greek glyphs for all those purposes, but perhaps what is needed is a different approach in designing the glyphs for each case.\n\nMany of the glyphs you designed will be inappropriate for use as symbols in technical contexts. In an English-language mathematics book , it would be useless to have an alpha that can be confused with a single-storey a, or a chi that is identical to x. International readers who have been taught just those canonical Greek letterforms (in most cases just a subset of the whole alphabet) will surely be left confused and clueless.\n\nAnd as you mentioned, different styles of Greeks are appropriate for setting something like the Septuagint and the latest Greek newsmagazine.\n\nSo my thinking is that a multiscript font that aims for full versatility should offer up to three different styles of Greek to suit each need, maybe as Opentype stylistic sets.\n\n"

There are different applications for type; if a Greek newspaper or book needs to refer to some Latin-based text, of course you don't want the Latin to visually clash with the Greek, but visual harmony is not the same as identical texture, color, etc. in every detail. Why would we consider it important to harmonize different scripts unless there were technical constraints? Hopefully we try to overcome those constraints whenever possible?\n\nIn setting multilingual documents in multiple Latin-based languages, the challenge is always to differentiate the material in the different languages, or at least organize the layout so a reader can follow one or the other language.

It's rare to see any understated innovation (which is actually the case with Latin as well).\n\nYour serif history (Missgiggles, correct me if I'm wrong ;-) isn't exactly right, I don't think. Although one-sided serifs can be said to be more chirographic, two-sided serifs were also pretty much a result of writing. You're right that serifs later became \"formalized\" into totally symmetrical shapes, but that applies to the UC as well.\n\nhhp\n\n"

That’s why I did not choose a Latinized zeta or a Latinized final sigma on the design. Many thanks anyway. :-)\n\nBrian, my sole intention has been to design a version for use as is. Whether the project members will eventually decide upon the replacement of the existing version or not is a whole other subject, yet I am definitely not designing something from which certain glyphs would be taken and compiled with existing to constitute the Greek version of DejaVu.\n\n\\>Let me explain. Who needs the Greek glyphs in a multilingual open \\>source font like DejaVu Serif? I think most users will fall under one \\>of three categories:  \n\\>1. Greek speakers.  \n\\>2. Scholars who deal with Ancient or Mediaeval Greek.  \n\\>3. Those who need the odd Greek glyphs now and then for technical \\>symbols.\n\nNow that’s great input! Sincere thanks for it. I have to admit that, so far, I was considering mainly the first category. It was good being reminded I should consider the third as well. Still, Greek glyphs to be used as technical symbols should almost always be italics, hence they should be separately designed. It's on purpose that I don’t refer to the second category by the way. There are already wonderful, freeware typefaces that perfectly serve such needs; the releases of the Greek Font Society. On the other hand, I, myself, was aiming on a general purpose contemporary Greek design that would be to some extend usable in a variety of applications, from on-screen reading to typesetting one’s thesis.\n\nRegarding some other posts on the thread, I feel that there’s a tendency to forget that Greek language is not a museum exhibit; it’s a “living language” and, as such, subject to changes and novelties. Discussion on whether Greek glyphs should have serifs or not, is, to my eyes, equivalent to asking whether glyphs with accentuation marks (“tonos”) or lc should be included; were they used in classical Greece? No. Why use them now then, they were “novelties” introduced later on. In a similar manner, what’s the point of discussing on whether “eta” should have a descender? It could have yes, it could as well not have. Both forms can be seen in Greece nowadays with the latter (no descender) being way more common in typefaces designed by Greek designers. So, who knows if both alternatives will still be used in 30 or 50 years (I bet they will be)! So what? Today, is a an eta without descender equally or even more usable than an eta with descender in Greece? Most probably yes. Do we have open type? Can we include both etas? Why don't we and let one choose what they like?\n\nThe current version is the one shown  \n [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417091937/http:/osmosisnet.com/vkarag/DejaVuSerif_new2.pdf)\n\nQuite some changes have taken place. I might have displeased someones with my \"xi\". I eventually chose a more \"consistent\" form, compared to the previous version. Some other glyphs have changed as well. The result is definitely far from being considered all smooth and fine-tuned, but i think it starts getting there.\n\n"

But it is about sensitivity, to things beyond the whims of personal expression and mere style. So for example when you ask \"what's the point of discussing on whether 'eta' should have a descender?\" I would say that the point is to know the effects of such a decision, not least concerning the health of Greek culture as well as the readability of the resultant design. Also, you can't blindly do to Greek what people typically do to Latin - not just because there are structural differences but because the users of Greek and Latin need different things, hence the scripts need different things. The case with Greek isn't so dramatic, but for some scripts -like Armenian- the danger of eventual total assimilation into larger cultures is a very good reason to be extra careful and not give in to expressive whims, instead channeling one's expression to help one's culture, not to mention make something functional, not just abstractly pretty.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Specifically in the lowercase, the chi is more dynamic, the descenders look better without serifs, and the letterform for beta is more in accordance with the rest of the alphabet.\n\nThe lowercase theta needs to resolve some dark spot issues, perhaps by making the middle stroke a touch thinner.\n\nHrant, you say it's not about conservatism but sensitivity. I share those reasons, so I guess our differences in opinion (I don't find the supposed latinization in the design of Greek minuscules as offensive) come from different ideas of cultural authenticity.\n\nAttending to cultural needs is important, but most often such an intention finds the easy expression in the avoidance of any similarity with the product of another 'threatening' culture. A good topic that gives many fascinating examples is orthography reforms in European alphabets, for example in Czech where differences from Polish orthography were deliberately introduced to emphasize cultural difference. This tendancy is not a bad thing in itself, but if it becomes prescriptive so that any resemblance to a product from a threatening culture becomes reason enough for its rejection, then you're overdoing it.\n\nI think Hrant won't accept what he perceives as latinization to be culturally authentic. For me, the fact that such a style of Greek type is widely accepted as standard for Greek speakers is enough to accept it as culturally authentic.\n\nBy the way, I've seen Greeks who don't like the 'latinized' style (especially oversees Greeks), but have never found a non-Greek who approved of it (not that I've seen that many people express an opinion on this matter). I think it just goes to show that Westerners judge Modern Greek culture with the huge expectations coming from idealized notions of Classical glory, and tend to label anything that fails to conform to such notions as devaluations. This is an unfair burden for Greeks. I'd rather trust them to do what they choose to do with what is in fact _their_ culture and not hold them to unreasonable expectations based on what we think they should do.\n\n"

It's really much more complex than that, and we shouldn't succumb to the allure of over-simplifying it.\n\nAlso, I personally think that authenticity can be over-played. As I said I'm not a conservative, so to me more important that what's been authentic is what should be authentic. Anything out there plays a part in the future - and that's where we're headed!

Also, there certainly are non-natives who approve of Latinization, like Ludwig right here and Jan van Krimpen more famously. And if you read Morison's intro to Schonfield's book about reforming Hebrew, you might share the shiver in the spine that I felt.\n\nI also don't agree with the them-us dichotomy. We're all part of this world, and everybody is at least a tiny bit Greek. We should all care what happens.\n\nhhp\n\n"
