  "content": "I've started a series of articles on [Unzipped](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234743/http:/www.fontshop.be/) about type design. These are intended to be an introduction, to explain to novices what type design is. In the [first episode](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234743/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=161), I dwell a little on the motivation of designers to start on a new typeface.\n\n[Peter Bilak](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234743/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Peter%20Bilak) reacted in an e-mail, and this comment had me particularly intrigued:\n\n_“(...) to explore other motivations for designing type. I am sure there is more than craft/technology versus art. (...) I am wondering myself what are the motivations to create type, besides the two obvious ones: problem solving, and urge to express oneself artistically. I used peculiarities of language as inspiration for making Eureka and Greta. A new Typotheque project embraces entire typographic history as a single source of inspiration, so the result is poly-historical. But again, these are personal stands, and I am wondering what else can serve as inspiration; these are the issues I discuss with my students when they are starting their type projects.\"_\n\nSo I thought it would be interesting to post his question here and listen what other motivations might be a reason to start on a new type design.\n\n",

And once past the point of passive interest, it's only a small step for curiousity and a self challenging attitude to get you started. It's also the best way to learn about something. For the professionals out there, hunger & the need to get food on the table might also be a good motivation ;-)\n\n"

Certainly not every non-Latin type designer thinks in those terms - in fact some try hard not to! But whenever you see something like Nour&Patria, or even something like a Hellenicized Latin (Carter's Skia; Michail Semoglu's work) you can safely assume there's some \"culture-clash\" undercurrent at work there.\n\nAnd then there's the \"ideological\" motivation, which is not as rare as one might suspect. Think of the 20th century's penchant for making type \"rational\" = sans. But think also of Legato, which embodies what Evert (and I as well to a good extent) thinks type <cite>should</cite> be, irrespective of sales, personal expression, etc.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Big thoughts are fun to romanticize, but it’s many small insights coming together that bring big ideas into the world.  \nIt’s no accident that type designers study type.  \nPart of the challenge of innovation is coming up with the problem to solve, not just its solution ; according to [Dyson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234743/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson) _“it’s very important to be idle... people who keeps themself busy all the time are generally not creative.”_  \nA typeface is like a fact, and a fact is like a sack——it won’t stand up till you’ve put something in it. So, evolution in type design probably means only that what’s on top is fit for the current environment, not that it’s “better.”\n\n"

Not because of some virginity envy, but because a font is really an abstract thing that's qualitatively greater than any instance of its usage.\n\nOn the other hand, even though I do occasionally feel the above, I do also generally feel very good when I hit some keystrokes in a new font!

It's a question of being able to objectively judge yourself which -I know- sounds like a complete contradiction. I can only speak for myself when I say I'm probably my best (or worse, depends on how you interprete it) criticist & I'm sure there are more people out there like me. Being your own judge has the adventage that you can take everything into account which is something an outsider can't do. You know where you're coming from, where you wanted to go (and your limits as to how far you can go at a certain point) & where you ended up & how you got there. So even a modest person can be openly proud when he has achieved something in his own best potential. This obviously often gets confused with arrogance, but for that I refer to a previous post of mine in this thread ;-)\n\n"

And they will enjoy the honor that comes from their contribution.\n\nEinstein put it beautifully when he wrote: \"The most important motive for work in the school and in life is the pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.\"\n\nThe negative form of pride is arrogance, when one tries to build one's self up by not listening to others, tearing them down and dominating them.\n\nAdded:\n\nTom, I think you are confusing criticism of one's own work and running one's self down as a person.
