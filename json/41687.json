But to the extent that I think I do . . .\n\nXavier Dupré plays with this sort of construction a lot, so in addition to your Malaga example, you should be sure and look at Absara.\n\nJohn Downer has also done some work in this vein. Look at Paperback and Vendetta. Oh, and Sam Sans.\n\nJeremy Tankard has some of this sort of thing going on in Enigma and Shaker (especially in the italics).\n\nMatthew Carter has used some of this kind of construction, but only very subtly. In addition to the little bit from Yale mentioned above, you can see some of this in Alisal, Charter, and Fenway (again, especially in the italics).\n\nI've been known to play a bit with this sort of thing myself. The arch of Whitman is well-known. I continue to explore it in some of my designs in development. However, I don't usually take this approach to round counters, focusing instead on arches. (But you're probably only interested in finished, published examples.)\n\nIs this the sort of thing you're looking for?\n\nI can generate images later, if you don't have access to some of these.

In addition to the c it has an a the upright has an a sor sure and almost an s defending on where you draw the line. Nice!\n\nI agree with what you are saying about the quasi 3d thing. I think it is partly a pen related effect although in urbana it starts to feel also like tape or ribbon or something thicker like taffy. I say pen because partly because if you look at Sheila Water's calligraphy ( and lots of other folks too ) you can see the same structure and in a more pronounced way than is typical of a font. This is true from her humanist miniscule to her blackletter. So I think it's a kind of chirographic echo. Not that these fonts are (or are not) \"chirographic\" ( separate issue) but I certainly I think they are they are drawing on that history/structure to some extent.\n\n"

      "content": "My angle is - I am doing a write up on a font for Typographica and The font I am describing uses this feature. Before I had taken a decent stab at sample books or anything I started the thread so that I might finish writing the article in time. In the font the feature seemed spookily familiar! But this font's use of it seemed exemplary. Still, before I could say so I wanted to get a better sense of it's history, derivation and impact on the faces it is used in. And to see if, having seen plenty of other faces I still felt it was as exemplary as I originally thought it was. And I do. So I definitely did get what i wanted - and more really. It's a wonderful micro typographic feature.\n\n"

      "content": "Eben,\n\nI think it's worth considering (maybe for a longer essay than a typophile review) that there are some very different origins here, that are easy to confuse or conflate: The pen artifact in counters which comes about from tight or small letters written with wide pens, and the M-theory of Dwiggins, which, you can see by inspecting his drawings, does not really follow calligraphic logic at all. For example, he carved out space near the ear of a g where no pen would ever leave a notch. His interest was in creating exceptionally clear type at small sizes; avoiding clots and making something small read correctly at its native size. The impulse to include calligraphic artifacts can seem similar, but if you keep looking, I'm sure you'll find examples of calligraphic artifacts like these that actually obscure or mar clarity in small sizes; in other words the 2 origins may not be linked at all. Look at the bolder weights of Trajanus. There's a consistent calligraphic logic here, but not necessarily a high priority on clarity at small sizes. One approach might actually work against the other.\n\nThe funny thing about this trend is that printing conditions are so good, the M-theory has much less usefulness than in hot metal days. Remember, Dwiggins designed for the foundry with the most business in book typesetting. Type wasn't scalable, and display type didn't use these tricks; they were meant to be hidden. Much of the typography now that features these adorable quirks is explicit display layouts, in magazines, meant to show off the cuts and angles.\n\n"

Gerard Unger wrote an article about Dwiggins's Experimental No. 223 newspaper design in <cite>Quarendo</cite> xi, 4 (1981), which also discusses the M-formula at some length. It's been a while since I read both of these, but I seem to recall that there are some background elements to the M-formula that aren't drawn out.\n\nBut, of course, there's much more to Dwiggins than just the M-formula. A good overview of his other type designs can be found in Walter Tracy's <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>.\n\nPaul Shaw recently wrote an article for the Italian bibliophile journal <cite>Bibliologia</cite> about one of Dwiggins's book designs.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
