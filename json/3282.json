  "content": "Hello folks,   \nI have been asked to track down a typeface called Volgare. I've done some research on the net and found out it was developed by Stephen Farrell from Slip Studios. Most of his fonts are licenced through [T-26] but not this one. Does anyone know the font and if it is commercially available?\n\n",

      "content": "Paul, I am a HUGE fan of Volgare. There is little information about it on the web. Here is the best and only page that describes Volgare: [http://www.altx.com/ebr/ads/ebr6/farrell/page3.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115190425/http:/www.altx.com/ebr/ads/ebr6/farrell/page3.htm) (it's a pain in the  to navigate though).   \n   \nVolgare took Stephen 4 years to make and you can tell in its detailed construction. All the information I know about it is in that link above, so I encourage you to read that. If you want a copy of the font you have to call Stephen and ask him to send you a CD with the font, it costs $75. It is well worth the price.   \n   \nHe is also mentioned in this article on Design Observer [http://www.designobserver.com/archives/000021.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115190425/http:/www.designobserver.com/archives/000021.html)   \n   \nAs mentioned there, Volgare was on display at the Cooper Hewitt's original design triennial [http://ndm.si.edu/triennial/animation.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115190425/http:/ndm.si.edu/triennial/animation.html)\n\n"
