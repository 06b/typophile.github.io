      "content": "<cite>«How frequent are ‘Æ’ in ‘Œ’ in French, Danish and Norwegian?»</cite>\n\nSince œ in French has already been dealt with by native French-speakers, I’ll speak only of æ in Danish and Norwegian (and also in Icelandic and Faeroese—or should that be Færœse? :-P).\n\nÆ is very common in Danish and, unlike in French, it is not thought of as an actual combination of the letters a and e in the minds of the common Dane. Whereas a French person might easily type _oeuvre_, rather than _œuvre_, without really considering it ‘un-French’, no Dane would ever type ae, but always æ. The letter is about as common as ä is in German, perhaps slightly less so, since umlauts are more common in German than in Danish. As in German, æ is pronounced as [ɛ] in Danish (and Swedish, where it’s a bit more open).\n\nIn Norwegian, æ is less common than in Danish; many words where Danish uses æ (and German and Swedish use ä), Norwegian uses e instead: D _æbler_, S _äpplen_, G _Äpfeln_, but N _epler_ (‘apples’). It’s pronounced [æ] in Norwegian.\n\nIn Icelandic and Faeroese, it’s even less common. In Faeroese, where it’s pronounced [æ] as in Norwegian, it’s used in a number of very common words where it’s a very strange development of an old Germanic i or Scandinavian é, such as F _mær, tær_, I _mér, þér_, G _mir, dir_ (dative of ‘me, thou’), but apart from that, its usage is similar to Icelandic, where it’s only used as old i-umlauts of Old Norse a and is not that common. In Icelandic, it’s pronounced [ai], a diphthong.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs for the digraphs themselves, I’ve never liked the uppercase Œ, either. In some fonts, they manage to get away with it and make it look sort of harmonic. The _Cardinal Léger_ text above is a good example of that. But most commonly, it just looks like the poor O has had its skin pulled too taut, making it all warped stretched. Not pretty. I’ve never read it as a CE, though. More commonly (due to sheer ingrained habit, I suppose), I’ll instinctively read it as an æ instead, so _œufs_ becomes _æufs_, which in turn becomes complete nonsense in my head and makes me stumble in reading.\n\n"

The files have extension .xpi and you just unzip them to get the dictionaries, that are good old-style plain text ISO8859-15 (latin9) encoded files (one word per line); fr-FR.dic (82000 entries) would be the \"pre 1990\" version and fr.dic (1990 reform, 90 000 entries) would to be the most \"modern\" one. Instead of utf-8 re-encoding, I just used a unix window (on my mac) with \"Window Settings \\> Display, Character Set Encoding \\> Western (ISO Latin 9)\" and kept the files as is to better see the bugs.\n\nI first looked at all proper names containing \"oe\" or \"œ\" in fr-FR.dic. Here is the command (I had to make a screen grab)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110418204808im_/http:/typophile.com/files/egrep_6474.jpg)\n\nand I got on the output the following list (one entry per line):\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Coelho, Defoe, Goethe, Groenland, Hoegaerden, Hoeilaart, Koekelberg, Loewner, Noether, Oedipe/LM, OEM, Oersted/M, Piedbœuf, Schoenberg, Toeplitz, Westhoek.\n\nThis proves that in foreign names, even if \"oe\" is not pronounced as two separate letters, French will use \"oe\" if necessary, and not \"œ\". The entry \"Oedipe\" looks however erroneous and the fact that Oersted is not written \"Œrsted\" may unfortunately be explained by... a bug.\n\nIndeed, if I look more carefully at the file fr-FR.dic (if I search for \"rsted\"), I realize that the character \"Œ\" was ill encoded; it was encoded twice 0xBE (for \"Œrsted\" and \"Œdipe\") and twice 0x8C (for \"d'Œrsted\" and \"d'Œdipe\"), instead of 0xBC. The entries \"Oedipe\" and \"Oersted\" might just be... a patch?\n\nIf I compare fr-FR.dic with fr.dic, I see that the entry \"œrsted\" (for the physical unit) has become \"oersted\", which seems to be reasonable but, on the other hand, many other \"œ\" are now \"oe\" in fr.dic, for unknown reasons. Those I have checked have not changed in the \"Petit Robert\" dictionary (online). Does anyone know who decided what in 1990? And do you know of more reliable plain text dictionaries?\n\nMichel\n\n"
