I’m under the impression that it’s used in Switzterland, but that the version there (ASTRA-Frutiger?) may have been reworked by the Swiss government. Does anyone know anything about Frutiger being used on Swiss roads, or whether any version of it appears on highway signs anywhere else? If so, what version is currently on those signs?\n\n [‹ GETIT™ Yellow Pages](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006111313/http:/typophile.com/node/36978 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Avenir vs. Avenir Next ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006111313/http:/typophile.com/node/36755 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But the body responsible within the Swiss Road Expert Association (VSS) decided not to go for a new development, but went back to Frutiger 57. Adrian Frutiger approved the modifications to his typeface, which allow for current insights into legibility at a distance and when on the move. the most striking feature are the widening up- and down-strokes, which are intended to give the eye a better hold than was the case with the earlier version. but for a pragmatic reasons, it was again decided not to take account of the different legibility of sheet-metal and back-lit signs. so astra frutiger now has two styles, for motorways and for streets.  \n(end quote)\n\n—-\n\nit seems like you are actually able to buy the font, but maybe its also just the text to tell you how to use it...\n\n<cite>Anordnung und Darstellung der ASTRA-Frutiger-Schrift wird in der VSS-Norm640 830c “Strassensignale; Schrift” festgelegt und mit der 73.
