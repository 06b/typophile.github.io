  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nWhile shifting from the PC to Mac I have discovered that the vertical metric lines(sidebearings in the FontLab Metrics window) in Macs are different than in the PCs. On PCs its almost invisible and doesnt distract when am doing spacing or kerning but while on the Mac I really find it annoying seeing that thick dotted line.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080904215922im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4924.jpg)\n\nIs there a way in FontLab I can adjust the visibility of the Metric lines?\n\nThanks for your time.  \nSatya\n\n [‹ Multiple Master question](http://web.archive.org/web/20080904215922/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45734 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help!
