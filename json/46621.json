  "content": "Hi guys\n\nI'm designing a logo for a company which produces expensive bespoke clothing. I want to find a seriphed font which has a classic feel about it - not dissimilar to those used by long-established suit-makers/professional outfitters.\n\nI want something which is (very) slightly heavier than Garamond. I'm also looking a font which has a slightly unorthodox ampersand.\n\nAny ideas would be very helpful.\n\nThanks,\n\nDrew\n\n",
