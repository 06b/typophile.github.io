More weights would be added by Koch, the [Klingspor](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901145307/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor)s, and by [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901145307/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) until the second World War.\n\nFamily members include:  \nDeutsche Schrift (1908)?  \nDeutsche Schrägschrift\n\nDeutsche Anzeigenschrift (Anzeigenschrift means Headline Face)  \n- breiter Schnitt (extended)  \n- schmaler Schnitt (condensed)  \n- schmaler, halbfetter Schnitt (condensed, semi bold) this was the default design  \n- enger Schnitt (ultra condensed)\n\nDeutsche Zierschrift (a outlined and engraved version)\n\nDeutsche Werkschrift (Werkschrift means Bookface)  \n- mager (regular)  \n- halbfett (semi bold)\n\nKoch wasn't very much in love with this typeface, but due to its great commercial success [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901145307/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) and [Klingspor](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901145307/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor) forced extensions to the family. (1910 to at least 1921; some of the Anzeigenschriften were cut during the 1930s).\n\n[Maximillian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901145307/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Maximillian) is a similar design to the Deutsche Schrift. Presumably, Koch have better feelings about [Maximillian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901145307/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Maximillian)…\n\n",
