(my first post!) but i've been reading it alot over the past few months.   \n   \nanyways,   \n   \n   \noh yes.. i posted this in the design forum because it seems that you cant make threads in the critique forum for some reason?   \n   \ncurrently im taking typography 1 at my college. its alot of fun, our current project is to design a 27th letter of the alphabet using a provided face. of all faces I was given times new roman! haha! anyways, I wanted to see what people thought about this, or any suggestions. I am still learning about type, and i figured this place could help me out. we have to render these in ink at 2.5 x height, 5 times, replacing the created character with a letter in a 5 letter word.   \n   \nmy current concerns pertain to the descender on my letter. should it be the same distance down as the 'j' ? or should it be smaller? personal preference? i was looking at the face, and i guess i could argue that it was meant to be a unique form in the alphabet like the loop on the 'g' my professor brought this up in critique tonight.   \n   \n ![kerned example](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135334im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17778.gif)   \n   \nthanks for any feedback!\n\n",

      "content": "Fascinating project! Your teacher is good.   \nAnd Times is a great candidate: it's \"constructed\" but has good readability, plus it has all those funky IPA characters designed for it which you might look at.   \n   \nI see some problems with you proposed new character, but I think you need to back up and look deeper at the problem before going too far towards a solution.   \n   \nI would start with the \"Intro to Typeface Design 110\" under Courses on Typophile itself. It's a great \"formal\" aesthetic approach in understanding not just shapes, but their underlying structures.   \n   \nBut there's a world of richness beyond that exercise. There's the issue of spacing, where your new character is problematic (it may hit a subsequent left-hand descender\\*). There's the issue of what the/an alphabet _needs_: does it need a character that fits in more (like the \"n\") or that diverges more (like the binocular \"g\")? And does it need an x-height, ascending, or descending (or both!) character?   \n   \n\\* It might help to decide if the new letter is a consonant or a vowel, or if it's just phonemically superflous (like the \"c\", \"q\" and \"x\" are already).   \n   \nI would love to make concrete recommendations, but since this is about the process of learning, it's better if you try to answer questions like the above - the answers will draw out the solution from within you.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Randy, since email delivery is down (not just for me, I assume?) I was working my way down manually, and I saw Drew's thread here first, _then_ the other one with your post! :-)   \n   \nSince I think the Design section is a better place for this than Typography/Composition, just to streamline things here's Randy's post from the other thread:   \n   \n\"   \nHi Drew,   \n   \nLet me be honest. I think the length of your decender is the   \nleast of your problems! Sorry...   \n   \nAs a start at curing your letter of it's maladies, let me point   \nyou to Jonathan Hoefler's course at typeophile that looks at   \nthe very assignment you've got: Type Design 110   \n   \nHonestly, first check out what he's saying. What are the   \ncharacteristics of times roman? Given that, is the basic   \nstucture of the \"letter\" consistent with Times? How could it   \nbe more Times-like in structure? Where is there evidence of   \na pen? What angle is it held at? As a result, where are the   \nthick parts? Where are the thin parts? Where are the serifs?   \nWhere does times roman break it's own rules?   \n   \nYour glyph needs all these questions to be asked. Take a   \nlook, and if you're still at a loss, I'll give you more specific,   \npractical pointers.   \n   \nLooking forward to seeing the fruit of your studies!   \n\"   \n   \nBTW, I agree with what you said, except I would [predictably] caution against the \"pen\" approach. You'll note for example that Drew's glyph has one thick horizontal and one thin: depending on the \"structural context\" of the rest of the glyph, that might actually work best, irrespective of chirography.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Honestly, I learned more looking at those than the 5 weeks into this semester of this class, however our first 2 projects involved just tracing letters at 5\" xheight in ink \\*pefectly\\* to appreciate differences in the forms. Then we did kerning.   \n   \nAttached are a few revisions. I started to think about how you would write it with a pen, and where the serifs should be. I am not sure how to determine whether it is balanced correctly? like, the counter space.. too big? small?   \n   \n ![evolution1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135334im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/17873.gif)\n\n"

Before you figure out the structure of the character, you have to figure out the essence of the letter. For one thing, in the Latin alphabet letters have two cases, and they're related.   \n   \nA letter is not a shape, it is an _idea_.   \nThe idea has to be solid before you can build a structure of it, and then build a shape on the structure.   \n   \n--   \n   \nYou're probably enthusiastic about the project in general, and what you've done so far in particular, and enthusiasm is extremely important! But the end-result quality of the glyph depends most of all on developing a solid alphabetic foundation.   \n   \nDon't polish a boat when you need to build a car. :-)   \n   \n--   \n   \nAnd what Randy said.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
