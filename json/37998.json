So I’m looking for a photography forum of a similar veign.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n [‹ Relationship between Headers/Indent/body in a magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322020938/http:/typophile.com/node/37741 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Web standard font to go with Chaparral ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322020938/http:/typophile.com/node/38012 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Since you don’t have the experience of them when they were faster and more useful, you might not mind. The Photoshop forums (one each for Mac and Win) and the Photography forum might cover what you want.\n\n"
