Somehow I’ve lost the font and I just can’t track it down anywhere. The fonts I find when I search for ’chemical’ is somehow more techno-ish or what ever you would expect fromt that name. So either it gone for good or it has a different name.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121113417im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/luksus_logo_3992.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Oxxo advertising face - Burghley {Lex}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121113417/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27486 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [When Sport and Type Collide ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121113417/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27506 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
