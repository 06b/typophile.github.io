So I don't get why it's useful in a text face context; however successful it is in it's own dualistic context. Hrant, if this is your example I am not sure what you want to get across with it. Maybe you can help me see what I am missing... It is an interesting extreme example of playing with b/w or figure/ground though.

Even if you might not have made anything notanically worthy yet (which is actually the case with me).

I won't post mine because, in all honesty, I never understood the meaning of notan in the way you describe it--I understand more now after the recent thread prior to this one. I would only say that I attempt to have figure and ground in a harmonious relationship which locks them together. If this is called notan or not is not of much concern to me--I am just trying to make good type. Perhaps Froggy may be part of the discussion (not to say it is notanic) after someone takes a harder look at Dead History though. That is by no means to say that I think I have been successful in the execution, it just means I strive to be.\n\nIf you want examples of type that I feel works towards equal importance of figure and ground, I would say Frutiger. I don't really \"look around\" much. I prefer not to be influenced any more than I can help. I will also name one of the faces you hate, Bodoni--not because it is easy to read, it isn't. Just because of the positive and negative form. Legato is another one which works for me. Most of Dwiggins stuff as well. I doubt if he ever thought about it but it was just within him.

When you say \"I am just trying to make good type\" I would reply that yes, of course you are, good for you, but to make <cite>better</cite> type you have to keep looking, listening and thinking.

A related kind of suspension seems to be present in Shirokuro and it Dead history too. Am I getting warmer?\n\nHere is my sample. It's derived from online renderings, scans & assorted other sources. It is imperfect. Let's try to use it anyway.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/comparingforms_5749.gif)\n\n1. is a bembo revival about which I make no claim except that it has a Bemboish r. Note the 'flag' shaped flag or arm.  \n2. is an 'ra' from metal 72 pt Caslon.  \n3. is Big Caslon  \n4. is Univers 65 Bold  \n5. is Scala  \n6. is Lucida console  \n7. is Patria\n\nLet's start by looking at the 'ra' in rahja.\n\nThe problem it presents as I understand it is that the flag or the r and the top of the a may look as if they are going trhe clash unless you make arrangements to avoid it. When I look at the older typefaces aI see that the 'r's arm is bigger & it is the 'a' that accomodates it. When I look at Univers this sitiation is reversed to a some degree. The 'a' becomes stronger & the r's arm is shorter. After that even in serif faces such as Scala this trend continues ( obviosly not all typfaces but you get my drift I hope ) despite the fact that the shape Scala's a is quite bembo-ish. Then there is the Monospace. I threw this in because it illutrates an modern but opposite condition where the r must become more assertive to help fill the monospace. In fact it has to get a vertical serif to appear balanced! Thinking about Courier ( not shown) you have a less asserive 'r' made possible by long serifs. And finally there is Patria. In Patria I see a synthesis of a strong but not wide r with a 'shy' but un'deformed' a. Each of these is a pretty succesful example of managing a tricky balance of forms to create Notan that works. As you compare solutions you are looking at Notan in play.\n\nI have more to say but I will leave it at that for now. Hrant thanks for rendering Patria for me.\n\n"

To me it's now clear that you don't. And considering how much typing I've been doing here lately I think the ball is in your court to understand more than in mine to explain.\n\nBut hey, what the heck:  \n1) There is no holy grail.  \n2) Notan is a thing, and it's always there. It doesn't have a goal.  \n3) A designer can leverage notan in different ways depending on what he wants to do, for whom. A good designer does this awarely, a bad one does it Vegas style.\n\nConcerning readability (which is only one place notan is relevant) my contention has been that the two halves need to be treated equally (and that chirography/painting inherently goes against this). Readability-directed notan is NOT the case in Shirokuro, and that's wonderful. The only think I have disdain for is pretending (to understand/leverage notan, in whatever way).\n\n\\> Legato ...

I guess you've gone back on your former agreement with JFP that the forms don't hold together.\n\nThe thing is, Patria is still way too black-centric. If it does enjoy good (text) notan that's most probably due to a combination of dumb luck (hey, I'm entitled to some too you know), a black-directed minding of spacing (a rejection of the form-\\>space-\\>kern idiom) and a concerted effort at functional divergence.\n\n\\> Patria and Scala ... exist in different ‘notanic [or dark / light] registers’\n\nCould you explain?\n\nBTW, I really like the \"La\" in William's \"Lady Willoughby’s Diary\" samples. Color is one thing, but the interletter notan seems great.\n\n--\n\n\\>\\> \"disposing of the linking between the two edges of the black\"  \n\\> I think you are saying that the outlines don’t follow ductus…  \n\\> it sure as hell can’t be while still appearing conventional  \n\\> to the reader now can it?\n\nThe insides and outsides (so to speak) of the black have been disjoined (which is something more than saying they don't follow something or other). This is in direct violation of the moving front.\n\nAs for appearing conventional while doing this, the way this is possible is that there's an essential difference between conscious expectation and subconscious effectiveness. Unless you meant that fonts that follow ductus can't appear conventional: I assume you mean those that follow it slavishly (for example giving the \"Z\" a thin diagonal) and would point out that it doesn't have to be slavish to be relevant, and a font certainly can appear conventional while \"alluding\" -even strongly- to chirography.\n\n\\> In some ways Patria is even weirder than Bembo & Caslon.\n\nThank you! :-)  \nAnd (I hope) it's a \"good weird\", not merely an eccentric one (those Brits :-).\n\n--\n\n\\> these Tokyo pictograms represent good (or considered) notan or am I fooling myself?\n\nThey are \"considered\" notan (see how there are white spaces conveying things). Whether they are good or not can be debated - I think some are good and some not. Overall it feels like <cite>exhibiting</cite> notan has been made into an objective there, which is too much Art (\"Look at meeeee!\") and not enough Design (\"Look, and use.\")\n\nSo it follows that the answer to:  \n\\> Is the best place to look for good notan in the base character  \n\\> or in the character in its environment (as per William’s samples  \n\\> but maybe not cleaned up) or does one naturally follow the other?\n\nis: it depends on what the font is for. Notan is there for individual letters as well as letters in context; the effectiveness of a given notan scheme depends on what the font (or shape, or collection of shapes) is intended to do.\n\nhhp\n\n"

He has wonderful studies of the evolution of his logos, starting with hand drawn versions of standard typefaces, and then adjusting them, partly for even color of the given combination of letters. The story of the evolution of the Prudential logo is particularly revealing.\n\nAt any rate, to me 'notan' makes more sense for individual letters, where you have closed or nearly closed counters. The way Frutiger talks about it, if I remember correctly, is how the white in the inner counter relates to the white on the outside of the line. What is at issue here is whether the whites and black 'lock' as Chris put it, or 'click' as I put it, or 'become part of the page' as Cyrus Highsmith put it.\n\nAnd 'color' has more to do with how the letters in mass, next to other letters. Here both the design of the letter and the spacing affects whether you succeed with even color.\n\nDo others see this distinction between color and notan?\n\nEg, the 'notan' in Nick's two examples is the same; the color in the second one is better, to my eyes. In my Caslon La scans, all the letters have good 'notan'--they become part of the page, with b & w vitality--but the color is much more even and better in the lower example.\n\n"

      "content": "Eben,  \nThe continuum I spoke of earlier is my projection of figure/ground (or what I might call inner and out space). The continuum starts resolved yet disjoined (but not harmoniously locked) as in the Dead History far left example (this is our “not enough to be good” extreme). It end at far right with the Water Quality logo which is two forms locked in a syntactic relationship which goes beyond their form in an attempt to be a referent to a meaning outside of them—Water Quality as opposed to just Q and Drop (this is our “too much to be good” extreme). Both of the opposite polls operate by having disjoined figure/ground. This does not operate in all of the glyphs in Dead History, not the \"o\" or \"a\" for example. The positive and negative disjoin by being 2 different fonts interjected on each other. There is no specific meaning attempted though. It is a formal relationship that still just refers to the letterform. Dead History \"H\" is just trying to be an H. There may be some connotation perceived by someone looking at the type but this is not consistent or intended. The Water Quality logo, on the other hand, is intended to have a connotation other than just Q and Droplet. The point of the continuum is to place items between the 2 poles to see where they fall in relationship to others. If we, for the sake of a beginning argument, agree that the typeface Legato has something of what we are looking to define (call that notan only if you like) and place it between the outer poles, what would go after it and what before? Something after it would be the desired state we seek. Something beyond it to the right would be “too much” of it to remain positive. If I am testing items which might be too much, I might postulate that “meaning outside of or greater than” the glyphs would be too much—hence the Water Quality logo, You can replace the Water Quality logo with whatever you might deem “too much” as well to come up with another in-excess quality to create an ordinal system with. By the same token, you can replace the Dead History face with some other item which has “too little of” the desired trait. In my initial post in this thread, I said that the Dead History face was “one that should evoke some debate”. We can use this technique to test where we place visual examples fall next to each-other in relation to any 2 variables. We can even place a very chirographic sample at far left and something antithetic to it at right and again place Legato as our zero point. The point of this is to have then a collection of variables and ratings. The value is in seeing what variables are in operation as well as having something physical and visible to compare and describe rather than just philosophical terms. Think of it like discussing what might be a recipe for good soup. You can name ingredients but you have to determine relative quantities before you can test the soup meaningfully. You might also find out that a particular ingredient needs to be left out completely.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "William: Thank you again for posting those scans!\n\nRE your question: I do think there are many differences between 'Color' & 'Notan'. Here are a few ways they differ:\n\n**Specificity**  \nTo begin, I think Color is a very broad almost sweeping term meant to encompass many variables. It is substantiually vague & hard to understand precisely because it sweeps over so many aspects. It's not a useless term to people who spend lots of time with type but it does require experience to begin to be comprehensible. Notan is superficially much simpler but also more specific or precise & therefore maybe a bit more useful. It's just about the relationship of lights & darks. 'Relationship' is key to that phrase.\n\nIronically Notan is even useful for thinking about bright yellow text on bright blue or vice versa where as our Typographic term Color is not. That's because unlike 'Type-Color' which is rooted in specific type history, Notan is just about lightness & darkness which is an aspect of Color - in the common, or even scientific sense of the word. Notan is relationships in one Color Axis: Light Dark. Chroma, or Saturation or color intensity is another. And Hue is the last one - the color frequency eg red blue green etc. Ironically we can talk much more readily about the Notan of Bright blue text on Yellow because both colors have light & dark values along with their Chroma & Hue - so you can talk about the ways the relationship. In contrast, talking about the 'color' of colored text is messy for obvious terminological reasons ( which 'color' was that?) but also because of the relative imprecision of the term itself.\n\n**Implied Scale**  \nColor & Notan also differ in that one implies something at the level of scale the other does not. Color is something you tend to be aware of or notice more broadly - like at the level of a paragraph. A single line of text cannot really be said to have color I think. Do you disagree? Maybe you can see it in a word. I am pretty sure I cannot. In contrast, Notan occurs at the glyph level, the inter-glyph level, the word level & all the way up & down the size scale. In type design practice I think we are most concerned with the glyph, interglyph, word & paragraph levels. Graphic designers & typographers are likelier to be concerned with Notan at the line, paragraph & layout levels.\n\n**Descriptive of Magnatude ( or Not )**  \nType-Color also refers to a degree of darkness or lightness on the page. It is to some degree quantitative. In contrast, Notan also does not refer to the degree of grey. I think it would be a misuse for instance to say: 'that has dark Notan'. Notan is not descriptive of Magnatude but to something superficially simpler - the relationship of the whites & blacks.\n\n**Descriptive of Quality or Superiority ( or Not )**  \nThe phrase 'good Color' is essential to any understanding of what is meant by 'Color'. It is not helpful to say 'Good Notan' because it implies that one relationship or arrangement is superior. Notan is not about that klind of judgement. Similarly you can't quite say 'good type' outside of a context : use, paper culture, audience etc. Notan refers to a way of looking - not a result or a judgement of that result.\n\n**Sequence**   \nPhilisophically you might say that Notan is higher up ontologically - that it to say it comes first or put another way 'Color' results from Notanic interactions. Or if you prefer you could turn the order around could think of Color as being the observable phenomena and of Notan being a theoretical construct to explain an aspect of that phenomena. Either way they are not sequentially non-contemporary.\n\n**Usefulness**  \nNotan is more useful if for no other reason than because Notan is less vague than can the term 'Color'. I also think that new insights and progress in the design of type can be leveraged from observing and thinking about Notanic relationships.\n\n--\n\nNick: Thanks for posting your example and your desription of your thinking about the choices you were making. I wholheartedly agree that the 2nd one is a BIG improvment.\n\nPeter: I like your distinction between 'visual (optical-grammatical) integrity' and ‘interplay’. I think an awareness of Notan can be used to either one or both and that they are indeed quite different. I can of course not prove it but I am wondering if visual grammtical integrity & cue values in the bouma are enhanced by the successful notanic interplay between glyphs. Maybe not. Maybe interplay just gives the eye something more compelling & comfotable to spend time with. But my gut says - no. My guts says this interplay is where the big gains are to be had and it's where I think the best new faces get their power from.\n\nHrant & Chris: Let's make an effort to keep the signal to noise ratio reasonable! ;-)\n\nChris: It was fun trying to figure that one out. I am almost disappointed to have gotten it!\n\nHrant: I agree this isn't easy. But I think examples and discussion of what we are seeing in them especially as they relate to Notan is the best way of helping a deeper, more useful understanding of Notan as it applies to type to emerge. Because Notan is so precise and can be seen at so many scales levels and is so superficially simple it is also hard to get a brain around. It's almost like an object you need tweezers to pick up. I hope our examples can be those tweezers. Eventually I hope we can just say Notan. Saying Notanic relationships is a little like saying 'Safe Safety'. It's weird.\n\n"

Evenness of color is one of the keys to readability, because you need a relatively uniform background matrix. If the background has uneven color, then it randomly adds information that interferes with the information you need to detect in the varying features of the letters--what Peter calls 'role architectural features and evoked forms' in the letters.\n\nTo me 'good notan' does have a meaning in a glyph, at least for text faces. To me it means what I think Chris meant when he talked about in 'locking' the black and white together, or what Cyrus Highsmith said about 'becoming part of the paper'. But it may well be a quality that requires the glyph to be in context of others in the face to really see it. Perhaps that is because the other letters create boundaries and so define the outside space.\n\nBecause evenness of color involves how the blacks of letters relate to other blacks in other letters, as well as the proportion of black to white, I think it is not a subset of 'notan'.\n\nFurthermore, I would say that evenness of color is more important in a text face. Lacking that, its usefulness is really compromised. Good notan adds a handsomeness of character which makes it a really good face. So you need both.\n\nSo I can see the conceptual framework I have been using here is different than yours--which is why I haven't understood you. I do think the terminology of color is rooted in type design realities, as is shown by its long use and the in depth illustration and demonstration of it by Doyald Young.\n\nBy the way, the way notan is used in Shirokuro is where whites become foreground, competing with and here cleverly complementing the blacks. This damages readability--though clearly that was not the goal in this display face. This would be very bad notan for a text face.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you Eben, for inviting me to your thread. Happy to find out that Typophile has a nice description of traditional Notan in its Wiki, but I think humans have come upon the concept outside of Asia too. I guess I came to a similar approach from a different angle: As a teenager I was given Paul Klee's \"Pedagogic Sketchbook\", where, in chapters II.23 and .24, he explains \"non-symmetrical balance\" (and expands it interestingly in III.26 and IIII.40) – a concept which, to me, explains modernist composition quite nicely, and how effects of vivid tension can be achieved.\n\nA few words about Shirokuro – Akira Kobayashi just interiewed me for the Japanese magazine \"Design no Genba\" (I'll put the entire text on my website sometime soon) –\n\n\"During my studies at the Basel School of Design we spent much time thinking and working in figure-ground shapes and exercises, which I enjoyed a lot. In type design class we also often dealt more with white space than black form. When I began designing typefaces in 1993, I therefore also played with Romaji whose shapes were composed of white as well as black shapes, but did not get far since I found too many possibilities. Years later when I learned Kanji, I remembered again and thought, in most Kanji I might be able to separate the radical (hen) and the rest of the character in a positive-negative treatment? Here too there were too many variations at first, but in the Kana I soon found the best design rule: On the upper right often appeared ten-ten or maru, and these had to be positive shapes, so they could simply be added separately. Hence the negative part could only be located on the left or at the bottom. Thus, Kanji with a 'hen' went fairly quickly, but simpler glyphs were difficult – i needed to 'break' them in a way. Back then I still did not understand much of good Kanji formgiving, and hid my ignorance behind a playfully-random papercut style. When my Japanese design was finished, I was able to create the Romaji with the same rules very easily – in only two evenings. Many designers hate rules – I in turn often search for them, as I like using them like toys.\"\n\nCorrect, Shirokuro is not easy to read, actually in more ways than mentioned. Readers of Kanji actually appreciate uneven color in their text, because it assists in recognizing the characters also by their color, i.e. amount of strokes. Especially the Japanese who mix them with Kana, can easily identify the lighter-looking inflections, particles etc. in Hiragana, or foreign words in Katakana. And that is where Shirokuro totally \"fails\", because every character has almost equal amounts of black and white, which results in rather even color, and the simplicity or complexity of a character can only be perceived indirectly through the coarseness of its details. Still, they seem to like my idea a lot, since they told me they are trained to see Kanji only as collections of strokes, not as inside and outside shapes. Which is evident when you see how even the comparably few closed shapes are built from several strokes placed one by one, not as continuous ovals and connectors like western writing.\n\nAnd yes, Shirokuro's notan is on a glyph-by-glyph basis only. So where is \"interlettral / panglyphal\" notan? In Blue Island? Or in Ed Interlock? :-)\n\n"

Also, according to Peter ( or so I imagine) the 'salient cues' for the letters are still there.\n\nAdmittedly outlines introduce an additional factor in desciferment of a word or phrase or bouma if you like.

And maybe I can gain the viability of my pet 'contextual notan' idea too. That's why I posted the 'ra' & 'La' examples and asked William to help me with the samples I was missing. Let's look back at the samples of 'La' & comment on them. I don't want William's good will to be wasted! Does anybody have any further comments about 'ra' combinations?\n\n"

Okay, so when I look at the samples we have here imprefect as they undoubtedly are I see that the 'problem' and some of the 'solutions' are maybe not so well represented. The examples I had for LA were just a little too middling. So here are some examples that I think suggest something interesting about 'hole' problem in the combination 'La'.\n\nLet's look at what I think of as an examples of 'problem' relationship. Here is Geneva. And Mrs Eaves. In both cases the gap just seems too big to me. It's too much of a 'hole'.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/geneva_4905..jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mrseaves_3966.GIF)\n\nHere you see the 'hole' made by the shape of the L. It looks a bit too irregular.I see many many ways of compensating or ovoiding what looks imballanced to me. In fonts based on handwritting I see that the L is bent over filling that gap partially.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cezane_6702..jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/zaphino_3690.GIF)\n\nBlackletter partially fills the gaps too. Petras Script is not blackletter of course but it seems to use the same strategy as to Fette Fraktur to deal with the 'hole'.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/petrasscript_4453.GIF)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fettefraktur_3622.GIF)\n\nAlso, a serif can help fill that space - in many styles. Courier, and Rockwell and Cooper Black.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/courier_4474..jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rockwell_3609.GIF)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cooper_4226..jpg)\n\nCooper Black is a little bit of a hybrid.

Here we have Futura Medium, Humana Sans, and Meta Book Pro and Octone.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/futuramedium_4459.GIF)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/humanasans_4488.GIF)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/metabookpro_4239.GIF)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100413105052im_/http:/typophile.com/files/octone_4007.GIF)\n\nIn Graffiti There is another solution - raising the leg.

I find your script (including the blackletter) samples are moving towards a confusion with an uppercase C.  \nTim\n\n"

With the r you have the same problem in the southeast quadrant, but it is less as the r arm can be short, and you can extend the serif to the right under the arm. Also we read more clues at the x-height, so the baseline gap is somewhat less obtrusive.\n\nThe L problem is partly solved by the serif on the leg, which is often one of the biggest in a font, as in your Hoefler text. David Kindersley argued that the serif on the leg shifts the L's 'optical center' (the point ideally equidistant between sidebearings) to the right. And this allows more space to the right of the leg, and less to the left. This help to avoid the problem of the leg being too close to the next letter, creating a 'crash' or clotted spot. Too close seems to be a problem in the Albertus example given by Tim.\n\nThere is an inevitable tension among three factors in glyph design: diversity of form, even color, and avoiding too close proximity of blacks.\n\nThe L and sometimes the R are the biggest problems, and with the L particularly you can't really design it away.\n\nGlyph designs are always a compromise between the different factors, and trying to be too perfect on one is going to mess up the others.\n\nThis is particularly true on the caps-to-lowercase combination. One of the things I have learned from working on Caslon is to keep in mind that the caps are really a different script that has been slapped together with the lower case. Trying too hard to harmonize them, which is the modern tendency, may backfire. They are, after all used as markers of sentence beginnings, titles, etc. Making them too harmonious with the lower case defeats this purpose.\n\nCaslon could on occassion make his caps way over weighted, as in the Double Pica L above. And sometimes they stand off too far from the lower case--the italic caps can be in the next county. Still, I think he understood that you can use the different structure of the caps to give strength and emphasis to a font, and that is a quality that can be lost in the quest for even color.\n\nFinally, loose enough spacing, as in Caslon, helps make compromises work, and the mania for tight letter spacing can impose bad choices on you.\n\n"

I think more descriptive and probably more accurate are 'notan', 'tension' & 'relationship'.\n\n<cite>Mrs Eaves is also suffering from small x-height</cite> Probably. But a shorter leg and or a larger serif on the leg would have promoted a nicer notanic balance.\n\n<cite> ‘activation of the white’ </cite>\n\nI think that these words refer to activationg the white mentally while designing not some kind of wacky figure ground effect or any other of a number of distractions. Notan isn't white centric.\n\n"

When a glyph disappears, that’s a good sign. </cite>\n\nAnother case of non-litteral description! :-0\n\nBut I think I get what your talking about. Of course you could get that effect with a constructed/geometric face quite easily. And that's why they don't work for text. Too much regularity. The seeemingly wild aspects and excentric matches found in text faces ( I will never forget the day I actually looked at a double storey g carefully) require extra consideration - and that's where taking a notanic position can help. Relationships need not be even, the need to be balanced.\n\nThinking about your description I started to worder how that sense of balance might shift around as you work on text for smaller sizes. When I look at something like Beorcana the combinations look funky when seen at large sizes. The way you balance your notan probably shifts too. Carl, would you comment on this?\n\nAnybody got a new combination problem they want to examine?\n\nDoes anybody think my 1st two examples were 'just fine'? Or that my analysis about the problems and solutions was off?\n\n"

I will even admit that the problems to be solved might be presented for the sake of teaching as being in a different class, kind, or category in general; but the ground in which the problem is solved (or not) is still Notan. And there are exceptions. The D is a great example to contast with the upper case I. The I is fairly simple to solve for upper case or lower. It's an exeption. But not an exception for Notan. I think that while the problems vary alot between glyph combos, uppercase & lower & even kinds of scripts - the same issue: Notan; applies across all forms - even Thai & Hebrew & Cyrilic & Chinese etc.\n\n"

Habits are hard to break.\n\nEben, I really hope you are not taking up Hrant's deplorable habit of ascribing any disagreement on an issue to personal failings in the other person.\n\nI don't think I am stuck in silly type habits. I don't have a lot of type habits to break, as I have only been drawing type for a bit over two years.\n\nI think we just disagree about understanding phenomena that in reality nobody understands all that well. I did explain in detail why I think the concept of 'color' is critically important in type, specifically the importance of balance of blacks, and Doyald Young's demonstration of this in logos. Do you have Doyald Young's book? Have you read his case study of his 'Prudential' logo?\n\n\\>Of course you could get that effect with a constructed/geometric face quite easily.\n\nI haven't drawn a geometric face, but I think it would be quite a big challenge with a geometrical face. The 'disappearing' comes from achieving even color and extensive visual consistency from character to character. Simple geometrical shapes go directly against even color in character after character, and they have to be masterfully modified--as Futura is--to achieve the harmony that makes type 'disappear'.\n\n"

I don't mean ( or think) 'silly' either. It's true we don't agree on all of this but - so what? Where's the fun in that?\n\n<cite> ‘Prudential’ logo </cite>  \nThe only think I recall re- that logo was the way they went progressively towards an abstract state until it became too much & then they toned down the abstraction. I don't think that's the story you mean. What's the gist of this Doyald Young book?\n\nWithout being 'good' a geometric face can easily have the uniformity that allows characters to disappear. Futura is only semi-geometriuc compated to the faces I was referring to. I mean those techno faces... should I post an example? Anyway, my point is that no matter if it's extremely easy to achieve or very tough because of the complexities involved in a good text face - the dissapearing glyph is telling you something. I think it's tellling you that some kind of relative Notanic balance has been acheived. But I was also trying to draw a distiction. Just because a glyph now 'fits' in a face doesn't mean that the Notan of the face is rich. Just that it's balanced.\n\n"

      "content": "Eben, did you see the connection between my point about the basis for leveraging the _light / dark (notan) of it_ being not _as_ there, and Noordzij's comment about the basis for a rhythmic bond not being present in the capitals?\n\nAlso, I deliberately said the basis for the leveraging was \"just not _ **as** _ there.\"\n\nI think the point is effectively demonstrated in pretty well every \"Largo\" you showed. In each case the 'argo' makes a notanically integral bouma-object, with the \"L'\" consistently breaking away. We are so used to seeing this, we don't realize how badly.\n\nIsn't it the case that the most we can hope for in the \"La\" combos is a harmonious integration of the blacks between the right end of the leg of the \"L\" and the bowl of the \"a\", and a smooth flow of the white, from the white between the arm and bowl of the \"a\" into the white just above the leg and to the right of the stem of the \"L\"?\n\nThe notan won't be 'ideal' or 'solved' in formal-functional terms across the word-object--and, as someone already suggested, perhaps it shouldn't be in proper names and at the beginings of new sentences--but we will have leveraged the black and white of it intelligently.\n\n(Hrant, I'm picking up on your excellant comment elsewhere that the important thing is the _leveraging_ of notan.)\n\n"
