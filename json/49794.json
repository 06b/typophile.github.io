  "content": "I’ve been assigned to teach a one-hour art class to my son’s 2nd grade class and I thought it would be fun to introduce them to typography in a very basic way. I’m not a type designer (I design books), but I love type and I’d like for the kids to understand letter forms as art and also as a means to communicate—how different fonts have different functions, etc. Anyway, my plan was to just introduce these ideas to the kids (open their eyes to what is all around them), and then give each of them a letter to design, which I can then take home and turn into a font with SigMaker. Has anyone ever done anything like this with kids? I want to keep it simple so I don’t know if I should give them a ton of info—but it seems like I should introduce some basics (such as ascenders & descenders). Any ideas?  \nThanks, Sarah\n\n [‹ Oh to design on a PC... /sigh.

My son just started kindergarten and we’ve been working on writing letters, of course. He’s been diligently working on printing his name with the first letter capitalized and rest lower case and it has been a challenge since he got pretty comfortable printing his name in ALL CAPS. He has an ’a’ in his name and was working on printing the ’one-story’ (thank you, Michael!) form, as found in Avant Garde, for example, as he was taught. I was very surprised then, when he came home with a worksheet on which he’d been asked to copy the word ’bat’ and the font used to layout the worksheet used the ’two-story’ form. Not surprisingly, his ’a’ was about three times bigger than his ’b’ and ’t’ and very elaborate and probably took him twenty minutes of labor and caused him to miss free-play time (not the worst thing in the world, but still). When I asked his teacher about the confusion this might cause a new learner, she agreed and said it is an active debate in early childhood curricula. She considers the issue just one of many confusing things they have to deal with and says it’s just part of the process. She calls the one-story form the ’writing A’ and the two- the ’reading A’ since all grade school story books are printed with a font that uses the two-story form.\n\nWhew. So, here’s my question. Can anyone tell me why we have two forms (and is it just ’A’ and ’G’), and what they are called so I don’t sound like such a eejit when I try to describe the problem?\n\nMany thanks in advance,  \nJessica\n\n"

In America, there is a trend among educational institutions toward teaching chilren handwriting based on the Zaner-Bloser alphabets, which, in printing, have one-story As and Gs, open 4s, tailed Qs, etc. These forms obviously differ considerably from those used in most text faces, so when possible, specially modified versions of existing typefaces reflecting these forms are used when setting books for early readers. These are often proprietary to the publishers, but [Gills Sans Schoolbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201161010/http:/www.identifont.com/show?3O7) and [Bembo Schoolbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201161010/http:/www.identifont.com/show?3NE) are similar-enough, publicly available examples.\n\nThe shift toward “standard” letterforms usually occurs sometime around the middle of second grade – which isn’t to say that no materials intended for children younger than second grade use two-story letters. A lot of publishers either aren’t as aware of this issue or aren’t as strictly influenced by state adoption practices as others.\n\n"

Why do we teach kids handwriting from geometric sans-serifs? The letterforms are unnatural to create by hand, which is why they are geometric and not humanist. Creating a single-story a by drawing a circle and then a line is unnatural and awkward. I suppose the idea is to first teach them to create uniform letter shapes, and then to develop them in to something more natural for them.\n\nBut for the first year or two of their handwriting education, kids are forced into creating awkward shapes that aren’t the only way to draw a letter. If they don’t conform to these letterforms, they get bad grades. I think that handwriting education needs to be reevaluated. It’s okay to have an x-height that is not exactly half of the cap height. I think we also need to create a humanist, rather than geometric, handwriting education system. Kids may not learn to write as quickly, but the ones who have terrible handwriting from the start because they can’t form perfect circles will probably benefit.\n\n"

If we change handwriting then who knows what else would come flying out of Pandora’s box? How exactly did Columbus discover America if people were already living here? Does anyone really think that Jefferson’s sex with Sally Hemmings was entirely consensual? Why is Andrew Jackson, an architect of our nation’s greatest genocide, still on the twenty?

No joke.”\n\nThere is ’lazy’ and then there is ’smart enough to realize the silly repetitive handwriting exercises in grade school really have little to do with the success or lack thereof in his future’. ;o)\n\nI suck at handwriting, always have, except for those intermediary stints as a draftsman. I’m OK a lettering, but not writing.\n\nOur second grader despised handwriting, but can probably type faster than I ever will be able to already at 7 years old.\n\nHandwriting is a necessary skill, of course, but things like cursive and the like, IMHO, are a colossal waste of time when taught at the gradeschool level. These kids are growing up with keyboards, cell phones, touch screens, etc.\n\nTo these kids, having to plow through handwriting class probably seems as pointless as if we having to take blackletter calligraphy classes when we were kids in the 70s/80s.\n\nNot that any of this has anything to do with you teaching type and typography and even lettering. That’s important.\n\n"

Therefore, it’s stupid that we don’t teach it.\n\nReally...how many kids can line up that vertical stroke so that it comes right down perfectly tangent to the bowl of the one-storey a without intersecting it? Whereas with the two-storey a, the counter comes AFTER the vertical stroke, which makes perfect sense. And please pardon my possible misuse of the bowl/counter terminology (I like type a lot, but I don’t design it, and my vocabulary is close but not perfect!).\n\nAnd as far as cursive being a colossal waste of time...I disagree completely. Suck at it or not suck at it, it’s good to encourage kids to express themselves with their hands and their handwriting. We are humans, and as much as we’re all on the same team, our individuality is an essential part of what makes each one of us beautiful in his or her own way. We are not all Times New Roman or Arial, and not all children have Typophiles for parents.\n\n"

How do you mean that the kids are taught to draw a one-storey a? Do you imply that they draw a “c”, and then lift the pen to draw the closing stroke? Or with one continous stroke? In any case, I don’t see how it would frequently cause an intersection.\n\n"

The fact that it was the second “branch” of communication, first being speech, made it all the more important.\n\nI do what I do today as a result of my fascination with handwriting when I was growing up. I remember in the 5th grade my teacher pissed me off. So, in retaliation I wrote my assignment in print that was less than 1/8” high. She was old and struggled with it but gave me a good grade, BUT chastised me for trying to drive her crazy. Mission accomplished, but it showed me the power of the written form.\n\nMichael\n\n"

My son has trouble with handwriting to the point where it can become a hindrance to learning the subject matter. At the same time, he can whip out all sorts of stuff via KidPix just fine.\n\nI’m more of a fan of accommodating the students style. I like the idea of bringing in the concept of graphic design and typography and letting children explore the many many variables and options rather than ’just do it this one specific prescribed way’.\n\nI still kind of hold resentments to the fact that it wasn’t until I entered college that I had any clue that one could actually make a living at being a designer.

And if we were taught to first draw a c, creating one with perfectly aligned points on the right and then drawing a straight vertical that doesn’t intersect the curve would also be tricky for a child.
