I have bought the domain name [http://badd.pl](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419225813/http:/badd.pl/ \"http://badd.pl\") and this is the logo for my new domain name. I think that I am going to sell this domain so the logo has been done just for fun.\n\nPlease tell me what do you think.\n\nlink: [http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/751/baddpond.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419225813/http:/img269.imageshack.us/img269/751/baddpond.png \"http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/751/baddpond.png\")\n\n",
