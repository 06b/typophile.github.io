On the type ID board it was common practice to make the ID and then go back and insert the link. Now we find ourselves adding the link into an additional post, which is extra work for everyone (poster and reader) and falsely moves you up in “Prolific Posters”. I also sometimes reread my posts and feel I could have worded something more elegantly. Or maybe I said something I wish I hadn’t said.

In some ways they’re the same but in some ways they’re completely different. For one, a discussion board discussion can (hypothetically) exist forever and anyone who wants to join it can. discussions don’t work this way in real life, therefore participants in an online discussion have incentive to present themselves and their ideas in the best light possible.\n\nYou feel (if i understand correctly) that once something is written, it should be forever. I don’t feel that way. I don’t mind that you have the original discussion opener in your mind, as you “contributed” to the original discussion. However, i think that if i can rephrase myself to make myself better understood by newcomers to the discussion, it is desirable to do so. i have edited myself several times writing this post, i don’t see why i should have to stop doing so once i have pressed the “post comment” button, if i feel that i can further clarify my intentions.\n\ni’m human. i make mistakes. i should be able to correct them if i have a chance. i’ve made every effort to act ethically in this instance and throughout my interactions here on typophile. if you disagree with my actions, you’re entitled to your opinion.\n\n"

Obviously it can be a slippery slope but I don’t think it’s wise to make a blanket statement. This is inevitably going to be a grey question requiring judgment - which will fail sometimes.\n\nI do agree with Miguel that when in doubt it is probably best not to change things because of the violence it does to the clarity of ideas being exchanged. I have definitely seen some threads here where the narrative became muck as a result of edits & retractions. I wasn’t happy about that. I would like to have the opportunity to make up my own mind. Also what he said about<cite> ’only makes the discussion richer’ </cite>and his point that in most cases clarity can be established as part of the flow rather than by re-writing a post, struck me as particularly pertinent and insightful.\n\nHowever all this talk about pretending and real life though strikes me as a little bit too much like unasked for armchair psychoanalysis.

Discussions get very confusing because of it, since for example a post with an answer or reply end up _above_ the post they were an answer or reply to. It almost becomes randomized; very inconvenient for a proper discussion.\n\nThe same goes for the suggestion that edits become bold or colored. That would render the ability to set something in bold yourself useless.

This creates an additional troublesome problem with long data however, when both the original and edit are long (and dissimilar from one another). I think that’s why this problem is so often deliberately ignored. Some existing solutions that generally work out a little better are: to only give the author of a comment the ability to add a brief editorial correction in addition to the original (that is marked as such or so understood); Allow unlimited editing under the clearly marked disclaimer ’This content has been modified’ (eBay); Or allow a brief time window for editing, after which your only option (regarding that specific comment) is ’delete’ (Facebook); To run a ’diff’ on the two comments, and to display the original—placing footnotes that correct it. That last one’s hairy, and all of these are kind of under the assumption that the purpose of editing is to correct mistakes, rather than the full range of things one who edits may purpose to do (change mind, rewrite).  \nBut it’s a computer, and we’ve come to expect the tools we use to be somewhat silent and obedient. After rewriting several sentences, I don’t want a computer telling me, “So you’re changing your mind? You must be. This data looks nothing like what was here before you clicked _edit_. Maybe you’re just changing your tone after reading how poorly you got your point across on the first try. Either way, that’s what my _rewrite comment_ button is for. You should have clicked that one.

I’d like to understand the nature of the bug. I have no idea how posts are ordered. The timestamp of an edited post must change, since it is used to determine when a font was identified. If posts are ordered according to their timestamp, then edited posts must be moved to the end. Again, if ordering is determined by a date, the date of the first post must also be kept if we want posts not to be moved to the end; as a consequence, at least two dates must be kept for each post: that of the first post, and that of the last edit. Why then not keep at least those two posts? This would allow comparing the first post with the last edit, and I would feel better after editing a post because I never tell what I changed (usually typos, sometimes I add a few words because sometimes I tend to be cryptic).\n\nMichel\n\n"
