My [Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20110625035802/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html) shows samples of most of the available Hallmark fonts. Most are included in Parts 7, 8 and 9 of the Guide, in the later pages of those sections (most samples are courtesy of typophiles Mike F. and Paul Hunt).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
