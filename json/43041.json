They’re often small operations without a good inventory database system, and they may not always know exactly what they have.\n\nIn New York City, there are Barnes and Noble stores all over the place. If you go to their website ( [http://www.barnesandnoble.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706084229/http:/www.barnesandnoble.com/)) and search for the book, there will be a link on the right to “Find It” in their stores. Go to the link and type in a postal code (try something like 10036 for midtown Manhattan) and it will list stores, ranked by distance, and whether they have it in stock.\n\n"
