Think I have started a thread with this theme also..  \nDefinitely recently someone has made some changes in this logo so that it really looks good now!  \nAnd I wondered who could it be..  \nThe new ad pages of Lauren now are one of the best.  \nI don’t believe that Fenice - at least using it as it is as a standard font - brings you any nearer.\n\nI am looking forward to see if there is anyone joining in here with new information about the making of this logotype.\n\nGood luck  \nStefan\n\n"
