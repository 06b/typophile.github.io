      "content": "Hello Maarten   \n   \nlooks nice to me but needs a lot of work I guess! Did you have it in biger gif? maybe Flash or PDF?   \n   \nBook:   \nThe diagonal line of the UC 'Z' is to bold. Guess it its the gif but the steams have diffrent with- Look at LC 'i' and 'n'. The 'c' seams to closed. Open it more like 'e'   \n   \nUC 'H' and 'E': The middle horizontal line is in my eyes to high.   \nUC 'Q': The Tail .. uh its not my favorit but is also not the ugliest ;-) Maybe you should try some other solutions.   \nUC 'N': The width is to small I guess   \nUC 'M' and 'V': It seams that the inner is the same.. I dont like it and the bottom edge need to be more left.   \nUC 'P': I like this semi-lowercase caracter ot the top-left   \nAlso Bottom-left of 'B' and 'D'   \nUC 'S': leans to the left... Maybe you have to him a crook ;-) just a joke \\*g\\*   \n   \nOkay I will stop here otherwise u maybe get fustratated ...   \nTypedesign should make fun and not work! ;-)   \n   \nGreets Jens\n\n"
