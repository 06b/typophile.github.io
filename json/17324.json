  "content": "I'm looking for something similar to Amplitude. By similar I mean something that is sans, is a little bit agressive, has display size qualities yet could still be used for short text sized advertising paragraphs.\n\nIf any of this makes sense.\n\nIt would be a primary face for a corporate identity. Our budget is just a bit less than would be needed to purchase the entire amplitude family. Im looking for something that can come in around $200 for the family, or at least under $300.\n\nAny bright ideas?\n\n",
