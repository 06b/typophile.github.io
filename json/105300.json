I am looking into the use of Bevel fonts (see example image below) and I am struggling to find a history of the font - where it came about/why it came about/any decent foundries that specialise in Beveled fonts.\n\nIf anyone knows anything about Bevel fonts i'd really appreciate it.\n\nThanks,  \nRobyn\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140404083917im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dec3fc209c572f059de29c8738eb26_6720.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dec3fc209c572f059de29c8738eb26.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140404083917/http:/typophile.com/files/dec3fc209c572f059de29c8738eb26.gif) | 14.18 KB |\n\n",

You may also wish to consider using your real name as your screen name. It used to be somewhat of a convention here, and it has been my experience that it results in being taken a little more “seriously.” It also makes addressing people by name easier and less confusing, but that’s a personal decision.\n\nGood luck, and may the fonts be with you™.\n\n"
