  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI have been messing about with Type since uni but would like to start getting a bit more serious about it. I know I could probably learn what I need by doing my own research but Id really like to take a class as my company is willing to pay for it ;) St Martins seems to have a course but I missed it.\n\n[http://courses.csm.arts.ac.uk/shortcourse.asp?ct=1&ma=3&cat=17&ci=5729](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023161830/http:/courses.csm.arts.ac.uk/shortcourse.asp?ct=1&ma=3&cat=17&ci=5729 \"http://courses.csm.arts.ac.uk/shortcourse.asp?ct=1&ma=3&cat=17&ci=5729\")\n\nCan any of you suggest another good course in London?\n\n",
