      "content": "Chris, These sports logo questions come up a lot. We have talked about having an FAQ about them, I think, because these are almost always custom designs. Especially your major professional franchises. The logos are usually designed by the firms hired by the Leagues or the teams, unless they are based on historical team insignias (which were never fonts in the first place). The teams own the rights to these emblems, so duplicating them is almost the riskiest thing to do -- the higher profile your project has, the more likely you will get 'fanmail' from their lawyers. You didn't say why you wanted to know if there was a font like this, but if you love the teams, buy their gear. Play it safe, is my advice.\n\n"

      "content": "Mike,   \n   \nNo worries on copyright infringement, I run a design firm and I get it. I'm not looking to create a do-it-yourself Giants jersey. I'm just looking for a jumping off point for a client who likes the look but can't afford to have us hand letter their charity event logotype.   \n   \nTo better phrase the question, I'm looking for a decent script face that recalls some of the idiosyncracies of sports/baseball lettering. I've seen the stuff at Veer and Letterhead Fonts, but they just don't have the quality I'm looking for.   \n   \nAnyway, thanks for your post.\n\n"

My impression is that these are less well-known, but might have some qualities you are after.\n\n"
