They used to have a round logo and thats the only thing my client requested. Ive done a few different roughs for now. Let me know what you guys prefer or if you even like it.\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042407im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4991.jpg)\n\n [‹ Your thoughts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042407/http:/typophile.com/node/47232 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo: Tool Sharpening Company ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042407/http:/typophile.com/node/50232 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Have you considered a lock and chain perhaps or a shield?\n\nThe type is clean, but some of the letters need tweaked in the curved layouts. Specifically the M.\n\n"

Go too literal and you quickly look clichéd, IMO.\n\n"
