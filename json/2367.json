      "content": "Providing the font was installed correctly (perhaps see if it appears in the font menu of any other program the person has on their computer) it will appear in AppleWorks (previously called ClarisWorks, by the way).   \n   \nThere are basically two ways to set type in AppleWorks. One is using the word processor (which, like Tiffany mentions, is similar to Word) and the second is within a text block as part of the drawing module. The drawing module allows you to scale, stretch, rotate, etc. the block of text (which can still be edited, of course.)   \n   \nI am guessing that if the person cannot \"set\" the typeface, it's because it is not installed properly. The first thing I would ask them is if the font appears in the AppleWorks font menu.\n\n"

It's great, and I wouldn't say that an alternative to the incredibly bloated Word is dumb, quite the oposite in fact.   \n   \nI've never had a problem with being able to set fonts in the database part of Appleworks. If a poorly-manufactured student font shows up when double-clicked in ATM, it sets in Appleworks.\n\n"

But your encouragements led the customer to successfully set type.   \n   \nThe problem with this font, _cough, cough,_ the good thing about this font is that it is multi-coloured.   \n   \n [http://www.lanstontype.com/JacobeanInitials.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020071312/http:/www.lanstontype.com/JacobeanInitials.html)   \n   \nSo the fellow needs to be able to set, copy, and then layer the colours on top of each other.   \n   \nFirst, can the fellow colour the font? I imagine the answer is yes.   \n   \nSecond question is, can the fellow accurately layer the fonts on top of each other? Or is it visual placement only?   \n   \nThis fellow is most brave. It is his first font purchase, and first font installation. Frankly I need half a pot of coffee before thinking about working with this _user friendly font._ I just like to be prepared for the beauty of the results.   \n   \nAlright, it is hard for me to say bad things about a font that does nice things. I think you understand.   \n   \nProbably I should write a manual for this font. Maybe I should spend some time with fringe software. I am so bare bones here. There is no toys or nice things for me to work with.   \n   \nKeep thinking about boats.\n\n"

Maybe go to Apple's site and check if they have more information.   \n   \n [http://www.apple.com/appleworks/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020071312/http:/www.apple.com/appleworks/)\n\n"
