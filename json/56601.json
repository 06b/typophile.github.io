White trash.\n\nPutting aside all resemblances to other logos and suggestions about improper type use. I agree with all of them above.\n\nOh. Bahamas is a good example of what I just pointed out. Achromatic/Nonvivid type against colourful logo.

If you still want to go with the mark you are using i have an idea. You could make them into cubes, representing cubicles. But, you can make the bottom right one colored or seperated vs. the others being black or together. That would represent it being \"free\" imo.\n\n"

I am not exactly sure what happened, whether he spoke to my intern or not, but the guy decided to crowdsource the logo, eventually turning to Crowdspring. He's now singing its praises, and in passing made some disparaging comments about the design field in general.\n\nI decided to crowdsource critiques from various online message boards (besides design boards) for his logo.\n\n"
