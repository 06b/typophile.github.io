Following this is our lighter side – a special cartoon font section. Here we will introduce you to a few clever comic-style fonts. Peer in a bit deeper to discover the extraordinary script face Bergell™, whose mesmerizing elegance and dynamism set it apart from day-to-day fonts. But we’ve saved our best treat for last: our new “Complete Typeface Catalog, A–Z.” Hot off the press, this book is now the standard reference guide for fonts in the Linotype library, presented in a beautifully bound form.\n\n[Read the rest of the Linoletter at Linotype.com!](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808055644/http:/www.linotype.com/8-38-8-19293/issue200602.html)\n\nOr, [subscribe to the Linoletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808055644/http:/www.linotype.com/webshop/newsletter.php), and get the information delivered every month directly to your mailbox.\n\n",
