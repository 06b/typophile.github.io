School program offers too few opportunities to learn actual type (other than some basic Bringhurst and Swiss people) so I'm thinking applying for type-related internships, whether they be inside US or outside US (Europe or Japan...?) I'm thinking it would be optimal to work for a production type designer or a design company.\n\nAny recommendations for internship-searching?\n\n",
