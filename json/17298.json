  "content": "In most classical sheet music, directions for “volume” (called “dynamics” in music lingo) are indicated with expressions like “mezzoforte,” “sforzando,” and “pianissimo” (abbreviated “mf,” “sfz,” and “pppp,” respectively). These expressions are usually in some sort of bold italic Modern/Transitional Didot/Bodoni face. Here’s a sampling of these expressions (and numerals) in Coda’s “Maestro” font:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120091431im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/musicexpressions.gif)\n\nIn my own composition work, I’d like to use a similar font for all spelled-out musical expressions. Do you have any recommendations?\n\n [‹ Reprogrammable Keyboard...and keys](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120091431/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17207 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Typograhy (Not Typefaces) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120091431/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17183 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
