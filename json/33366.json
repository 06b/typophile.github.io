  "content": "I don't know if this is the right place for a job listing but since it's feasible that there are art director types hanging out here, I thought that any responses would be from the kind of people I'm looking for (I'm the art director).\n\nWe are a well-known International publishing company looking for two full-time people with at least 3 years experience designing for magazines (this is in the field, not in school) for a media magazine redesign. You should have an expert knowledge of Indesign CS2 and be competent with Photoshop, Illustrator and Mac OS X. You should have expert typographic skills and a know how to create compelling page layouts while maintaining a strict and often tight schedule.\n\nAs mentioned, there are two positions:  \nAssistant Art Director  \nGraphic Designer\n\nBilingual a plus for the designer position, essential for the AD.\n\nSalary is attractive and both jobs have benefits.\n\nEdit: I'm an idiot - here's my contact email: dgirard at spafax.com\n\n",
