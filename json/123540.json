I feel I should know what it is, but I don't. It looks a lot like Caledonia, but it's less distinctive, leaning a bit towards Century Expanded. Also, it has very short descenders.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317153024im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bold_sam_5519.jpg)\n\nHere's the bold face, as that may be helpful.\n\n",

Looking at V&M's _The Type Specimen Book_, the six and seven point sizes of Linotype Caledonia had very small descenders, while the larger sizes, even eight point, had the more generous descenders with which I am familiar.\n\nThe book in question was set in a smaller size than is usual for books, presumably so that it could be a small volume and economical despite being printed on glossy paper.\n\n"
