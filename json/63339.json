Or maybe you would like to adopt an entire Bodoni family?\n\nThe mentioned sum is used to restore an alphabetical set of Bodoni  \npunches, currently in bad condition, oxidized and stored in an  \ninappropriate place, and put it in a purpose-made polybicarbonate box for  \na proper preservation.\n\nWith some more money it is possible to restore a series of punches  \npreserved in the original wooden cases.\n\nThe restoring is made by Studio Paolo Crisostomi in Rome, an experienced  \nworkshop dealing with antique and bibliographical stuff.\n\nThe donors will be publicly acknowledged and as affiliated will be  \nrecognizable by a plate on the case in which the punches will be stored,  \nin the Museum’s exhibition.\n\nFor more info: Typevents Italy - Simone Angelica Wolf (Via Del Pozzo 6 -  \nReggio Emilia, phone 334-1814389, e-mail [simone@typevents.com](mailto:simone@typevents.com)).\n\n[http://www.typevents.com/index.php?id=422,0,0,1,0,0](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134733/http:/www.typevents.com/index.php?id=422,0,0,1,0,0 \"http://www.typevents.com/index.php?id=422,0,0,1,0,0\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni01-sml_5893.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni02-sml_5018.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134733im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni03-sml_6339.jpg)\n\n",
