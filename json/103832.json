  "content": "Hello all\n\nSlightly odd question; I'm going in cold to a client briefing for a redesign of their annual research publication. Currently they use a combination of Umbra for headers, Swift for body and Verlag for anything else.\n\nMy understanding is they want a major overhaul but I don't know where they want to go typographically - so I'm fishing a little.\n\nCan anyone make some alternate suggestions, pairing options or suggest contemporary 'versions's or fonts inspired by the above? I'm anticipating they may want to keep one or more to maintain branding - so if they retain Umbra (which is a big statement font) can you recommend options to pair with it?\n\nAny thoughts gratefully received!\n\nthanks\n\n",

But hopefully do give credit where due.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "yep taken onboard. Thinking here is really if they say we want to keep one of the set, my question is why change any of the others? The design is very much based on the use of the shadow of umbra (i.e. the sheared serif of swift) and the graphic elements are all based on that - so I wanted to have a convincing argument to make wholesale changes.\n\nMy thoughts at the moment is that given the art deco feel of the current set we move them on to the next decade of style fonts. I was thinking maybe an inline font like (H&F's) landmark might be one way forward.  \nThoughts?\n\n"
