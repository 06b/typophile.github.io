  "content": "Hello, I am a newbie here and a newbie to the whole font creating thing, so hello everyone, and I've been struggling with a following issue for weeks now:   \nI was given a bunch of .fog's created on Mac to convert and generate PC TTF fonts. I also wanted to make Italic versions of them, which I made with the simple Element:Transform:Shear -12. They converted fine, but I have a problem with family building. I generate two TTF's: the original one and the italic one, setting the Font Info:General attributes respectively to Font and Font -Italic. When I try to add them via ATM Deluxe I use for managing all my fonts, it would show up only one of the two fonts. ID changing didn't help. Am I missing something or is there something wrong w/ the Fontographer itself? Is there any other tool/program I could use for such conversions/modifications?\n\n",

      "content": "\\> Element:Transform:Shear -12   \n   \nMany \"users\" wouldn't notice (at least not consciously), but I assume you realize that mechanical transformations like that produce inferior results. If you look at almost any italic (even ones called oblique that maintain the Roman structures, but especially so-called \"true\" italics that are totally different than the Roman) you'll see that at the absolute very least there has been some manual post-processing, but very often the whole thing is redrawn. Also, the larger the angle you use, the greater the distortion.   \n   \nAt the very least, call the resultant fonts \"Oblique\", not \"Italic\".   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "\\> mechanical transformations like that produce inferior results   \n   \nI am aware of that. However, I wanted to make those italics in the 'quick and easy' way, as it is the voluntary part of my job. Besides, the font is sans-serif grotesk (like Helvetica, I hope I got the terminology right), so simply shearing it does not do it much harm, and I was told that -12 is the optimal angle for such transformation.   \n   \nAnyway I'm in trouble, when it comes to discussions like this, as there are like 2-3 font professionals in my country which is not that big itself, and font design is not taught in schools, so I guess forums like these are the only place to learn things.   \n   \nI will keep in mind the Oblique suggestion, thanks ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415223851im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

I've been told that if something doesn't work, ie. the fonts not being generated the right way, altering it manually often helps.

Check out with Windows   \ndefault font showing (just double-click your font files on Explorer).   \n   \nBtw, you don't need ATM to install TT fonts on Windows.   \nTry installing via Control Panel\\> Fonts.\n\n"
