Coda literally means tale (Italian, from latin cauda) and refers to  \nthe way the letters h, m and n stretch below the writing line towards the  \nend of a sentence or before a final stop. Coda Pro is an elegant and  \ncontemporary font suited for display purposes.\n\n[http://p22.com/ihof/coda.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20110402151308/http:/p22.com/ihof/coda.html \"http://p22.com/ihof/coda.html\")\n\nThe Mai Family is a new transitional antiqua that features ligatures, Small  \nCaps and full Central European support. Mai's classic design is understated  \nenough to be used for long running text applications yet includes unique  \ncharacters suitable for design purposes. It is the Norwegian name for the  \nmonth of May.\n\n[http://p22.com/ihof/mai.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20110402151308/http:/p22.com/ihof/mai.html \"http://p22.com/ihof/mai.html\")\n\nIntroductory offer through August 31st  \n------------------------------------------------  \nYou can now follow P22 on Twitter.com:  \n [http://www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20110402151308/http:/www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry \"http://www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry\")  \n------------------------------------------------  \nBecome a fan of P22 on Facebook:  \n [http://www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951](http://web.archive.org/web/20110402151308/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951 \"http://www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951\")  \n------------------------------------------------  \nBest Regards!  \nP22  \n [www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110402151308/http:/www.p22.com/ \"www.p22.com\")\n\n",
