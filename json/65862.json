  "content": "Hi, im new to all of this so apologies for any stupid comments or blatently obvious questions i may come out with.\n\nAnyway, to the point, im looking to get a tattoo in a few days, and am looking for a few fonts, or fonts similar to the ones im looking at.\n\nThe first of which is this piece, created by Mister Cartoon:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130106073723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cartoonw_6339_6034.jpg)\n  \nThe font in which the cities are written in would be ideal, i know its custom work, but if anybody could point me in the direction of a similar font, that would be brilliant.\n\nI am a big fan of Mister cartoons work, and the lettering in most of his tattoos is what im looking for. Any help towards finding the right font for my tattoo would be brilliant.\n\nThanks, Rob\n\n",
