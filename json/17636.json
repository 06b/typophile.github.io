  "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nGotta quirky question for you:\n\nWith PC TrueType fonts, in Microsoft programs like Word & PowerPoint, is there a way to BOTH have your fonts show up on the list AND be style linked.\n\nIE: Your font list would show Times, Times Italic, Times Bold, Times Bold Italic, AND you would be able to select Times and hit the Italic or Bold style linking button and have it connect to that.\n\nIm not sure if it can be done, and thought maybe if it couldn’t with a standard font set, you can stly link the four “standard” fonts, and ALSO include a seperate font “Times Bold”, “Times Italic”, and “Times Bold Italic” that are formatted as singles. So there would be duplicate files for some.\n\nAm I making sense? Let me know if you’d like clarification.\n\n",
