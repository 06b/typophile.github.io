I got palatino as my type and I was wondering if anyone knew of any or where I can find some either on the font its self or made by the creator of the type about it (Hermann zapf). I hope that makes sense.\n\n [‹ Thought you all might be interested. . .](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213853/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37247 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Advice for legal pleadings ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213853/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37541 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Well, then the [Wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213853/http:/typophile.com/typowiki) is a good starting point. Search-engines like [Google](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213853/http:/www.google.de/search?q=hermann%20zapf) can be quite helpful, too. Or [libraries](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415213853/http:/www.typophile.com/books).\n\n"

Bill Gates didn’t get to be as rich as he is today by paying people for the use of their intellectual property... Microsoft saw a font they rather liked — Hermann Zapf’s Palatino — so they called in Monotype to make a quick copy. The result was named Book Antiqua, and bundled with Office.”\n\n"
