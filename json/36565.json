  "content": "I am helping a friend ( who is a product design student) put together a document about his internship at Renault. The document mainly talks about how he went about designing a new car… right from research to his final concepts for the car. The car is more of a ‘concept car’ and not a car that you would see on the roads too soon. I would be grateful if you guys could suggest fonts that might work well for the body text and for the headings of such a document. I hope the information I have provided is enough for you to help me out with your suggestions.\n\nThank you!\n\n",

This document would be read by his teachers and later by other students, mainly product design students, at our institute ( The National Institute of Design, India). A copy of the document would also go to Renault… but I doubt if the top brass would read it though. So I’d consider design students to be the main audience.\n\n"

Cartype.com is an interesting site indeed.\n\nBpotstra thanks for the link but it throws up an error message when I try to access it. Are you sure its cartype.org? Or maybe there is something wrong with my connection at the moment.\n\n"
