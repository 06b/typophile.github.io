It was used on this 1977 series, and I believe it matches a typeface used on the Kovacs shows from 1961. What is this?\n\nThanks!!\n\n [‹ Boston Red Sox](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010182155/http:/typophile.com/node/50257 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [spikey type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010182155/http:/typophile.com/node/50363 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
