  "content": "I am trying to generate diacritic glyphs like agrave, etc. but for some reason when I click generate glyph from the anchors preview window it is only generating for instance the a glyph and not the full agrave with the diacritcal mark. My anchors are named correctly and everything is perfectly fine within the anchors preview window...Never had this happen so Im kinda of confused. Tried generating the glyphs a few other ways same solution(or lack there of really.)\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThanks,  \nDavid\n\n",

As you can see the diacritical mark is missing completely...  \nI have included an image of the anchor on the 'a' glyph the marks have a corresponding anchor of \\_top so things should match after generation as they do in the preview window, but alas no...I have never had this happen and now it is. Frustrating...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012503im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-14%20at%203_5995.29.27%20PM.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012503im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-14%20at%203_5654.30.14%20PM.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315012503im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202015-03-14%20at%203_6294.32.50%20PM.png)\n\n"
