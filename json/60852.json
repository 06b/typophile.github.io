I have just noticed that InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop have atleast 100 active fonts, including certain ones I have been unable to open in Fontbook.\n\nPlease can someone help?\n\nThanks v much  \nSiaronx\n\n",

Adobe CS installs fonts in that location.\n\nWith respect to jsmi's comment, there's nothing in the license of which I'm aware that reserves those fonts for use only in Adobe applications. You can move or copy them to another font folder if you want to access them elsewhere.\n\nAnyone wanting to make fonts available only to their own applications would probably store them inside the application bundle rather than in /library/application support.\n\nAndré\n\n"
