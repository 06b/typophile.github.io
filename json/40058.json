But I don’t want to read any more books about the history of type, what an ascender is, etc. I would like a book that explains line length, leading, tracking, but not what they are, but what the rules are for using them and how to best break them.\n\nthanks!\n\n [‹ FontLab or Fontographer?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217175205/http:/typophile.com/node/40087 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Can I produce a set of metal type to use in an old hand press? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217175205/http:/typophile.com/node/40084 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Erik Spiekermann but several others are already on their way from Amazon.\n\nI am just developing “my style” but I am starting to think that I am one of those people that likes to work with only 5-10 fonts but really, really get to know them well and I hope these books can help me with that. Right now I am obsessed with Whitney not only because it is “museum-like” but also because it has an amazing array of weights which for my publication work is a godsend. It also seems sort of like a classic in the making which I love.\n\nDo You have long term “favorite” fonts or do you switch all the time?\n\n"
