With Opentype, we have unionized the 5 fonts  \nplus added many new characters into one “pro” font. More alternates, more  \nlanguage support, more circles and squares... Registered users may upgrade  \nat a nominal cost.  \n [http://www.p22.com/products/constructivist\\_pro.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060024/http:/www.p22.com/products/constructivist_pro.html \"http://www.p22.com/products/constructivist\\_pro.html\")\n\n—-And in Commemoration—-  \nTo celebrate this release, we have issued yet another Constructivist Coffee  \nMug. The mug, like the font itself, is bigger and better. It is a 17oz red  \nceramic mug with the phrase “Bigger Coffee For Better Workers”. It is  \navailable for free to the first 100 purchasers of the Constructivist Pro  \nfont set.  \n [http://www.p22.com/products/mugs.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060024/http:/www.p22.com/products/mugs.html \"http://www.p22.com/products/mugs.html\")\n\n—-Hockey Night in Buffalo—-  \nFew people are aware of the P22 Hockey Team and its recent sweeping of the  \ndivisional Championship. To commemorate this event, we have produced a  \nlimited number of hockey pucks with the aforementioned triumph emblazoned on  \nit. $5 a pop, get ’em while you can.  \nAlso available in very limited quantities are P22 Hockey Jerseys.  \nTo see the P22 hockey memorabilia and the team over the years, visit  \n [http://www.p22.com/products/hockey.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060024/http:/www.p22.com/products/hockey.html \"http://www.p22.com/products/hockey.html\")\n\n—-New Typecaster—-  \nThe P22 Typecaster is now improved for easier font test driving. The new  \nMasterCaster combines all 5 divisions of P22 into one convenient font test  \nsetting tool. Once you type in your sample text, it will remain the sample  \ntext for every font you try. Once you find just the right font for your  \nneeds, you can click on “Info” and select “Purchase Options” to go right to  \nthat font’s page. These new features make it even easier to decide on the  \nright font and get it quicker than ever.  \n [http://www.p22.com/typecaster/master/caster.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080212060024/http:/www.p22.com/typecaster/master/caster.html \"http://www.p22.com/typecaster/master/caster.html\")\n\nThat’s it for this installment.  \nUntil next time.  \nP22 type foundry\n\n",
