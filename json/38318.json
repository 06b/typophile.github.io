I think the standard at most design school’s is an Adobe Collection made specifically for colleges (or at least that was what we had.)\n\nI remember doing these type treatment projects. I was actually pretty fun, because you don’t have to be so fickle with type setting. It was a very creative use of type as symbols. Don’t look at the letters as letters, look as them as pen/paint brush strokes. Create an image using light whispy calligraphic characters and then use bold fonts to fill in and build up the shadows/highlights. Think like you’re using a pattern brush in Photoshop (if you’re familiar enough with using Photoshop.)\n\nSorry, but our ideas cannot be your ideas. You’ll have to come up with that on your own.\n\n"
