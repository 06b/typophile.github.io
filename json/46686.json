A list is being compiled but additional items are welcome. All items will go home with the lucky (or skillful) high bidder. Donations are tax deductible and can be brought to TypeCon or mailed in advance. All proceeds go towards future SOTA & TypeCon activities.  \n [http://typecon.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317151104/http:/typecon.com/)\n\n",
