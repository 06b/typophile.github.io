Is there another font that would be better suited for asserting confidence and sporty too?\n\n",

Branding a store is entirely different from branding the products that fill it (though it is not unrelated).\n\nNaturally you have to consider the sort of customers you're seeking, how to differentiate your client from their competitors, and finally what would look good in many low-quality reproduction methods, from building signage to flexo print on plastic bags.\n\nCopperplate Gothic certainly has an air of confidence about it, in a very conservative, bankerly kind of way. Not sporty at all, in my opinion. If your client's heart is set on it, I suggest offering [Typodermic's Biondi](http://web.archive.org/web/20141202021219/http:/www.typodermic.com/32.html) as an incermentally more modern alternative that will stand up to those low-quality reproduction processes much better.\n\n"
