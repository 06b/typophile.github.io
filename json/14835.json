  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’ve found this old catalogue of the Cal Arts school.  \nI really like the script used in the text, does someone have an idea ?  \nA friends of mine tell me it was maybe a font called freehand.  \nI’ve found some style on the net (591, 575 etc…) but no one matches this sample.\n\nthanks !\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [calarts.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=calarts.jpg) | 57.31 KB |\n\n",
