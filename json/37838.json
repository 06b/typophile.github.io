I have only used it years ago, it was fairly good, but I have no idea if it still is. But it’s free, so that’s not too bad. :)\n\n"

      "content": "I find it very helpful to partition hard drives, not merely into two or three, but really carve it up. This allows certain data types to be grouped easily, and you end up with multiple small directory trees, one on each partition, instead of one great big cumbersome tree on C drive. Much easier to navigate and find things, automated searching is quicker.\n\nFor example:  \nC: Sys Vol (the OS and system apps only)  \nD: Documents (.doc .pdf .rtf .qxd .pm6 .p65 .txt, email)  \nE: Applications  \nF: Admin (desktop, shortcut to IN drive, out folder, personal stuff, project folders, shortcuts to key utility proggies. This drive contains any data type)  \nG: Work drive (.ai .avi .bmp .eps .indd .pcd .psd .psp .gif .jgp .png etc)  \nH: HTTP 1 (saved webpages from the interwebs)  \nI: IN drive (my in basket, accessed by shortcuts on F:)  \nJ: Anime (a library of anime artwork I collect)  \nK: D’Arts (artsy-fartsy artwork of all kinds for reference)  \nM: Femmes (pictures of attractive women)  \nN: Webdev (web-based work projects: .html .htm .php .css .txt)  \nP: Pics (massive library of stock images, different from artsy-fartsy stock)  \nT: Type (whole drive devoted to fonts and EULAs)  \nS: Spare (large storage drive for dumping giant-sized files, software, DVD movies and the like)\n\nA place for everything and everything in its place. Having one drive devoted to fonts only makes finding a font manually quite easy, provided you create an extensive hierarchy of category folders. The IN drive has only a few folders, each assigned to whatever clients I’m working with at the moment. I used to have an OUT drive just for outgoing items but found an out folder on the admin drive more efficient :^)\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Windows doesn’t have a decent search tool built in (and, in fact, I’m not finding Mac’s ’spotlight’ all that great either, though it is fast)\n\n"
