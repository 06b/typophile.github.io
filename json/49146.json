  "content": "I do have to say that I quite like FontStruct--- three basic fonts done and ideas for more keep popping into my head. It does rather seem the fontish equivalent of those old record-your-own-record booths which were so prominent in the 50s and 60s. If anything, it's made me more acutely aware of the talent, skills, and abilities of the true font designers, and ashamed of my own inability.\n\nProps to the folks over at FontShop for giving us rank amateurs a chance to shine, even if most of us do not!\n\n",
