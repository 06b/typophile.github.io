The colored type which reads \"QUNICE\" etc. I cant find a heavy slab that has a Q with a tail like that and includes condensed or compressed weights as shown on a few of the jars.\n\nThank you so much for any help.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 9.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113234/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%209_15.png) | 72.02 KB |\n| [Picture 10.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113234/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2010_8.png) | 73.38 KB |\n| [Picture 11.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022113234/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%2011_7.png) | 176.41 KB |\n\n",
