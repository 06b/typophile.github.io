Mr. Giacco and Politica are great faces, check them out.\n\n[http://sudtipos.com/fonts/36](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125730/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/36 \"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/36\")  \n [http://sudtipos.com/fonts/42](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125730/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/42 \"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/42\")\n\nThere is also an interesting serif from adobe called Belwe\n\n[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125730/http:/store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=BELQ10006000 \"http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFont&code=BELQ10006000\")\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
