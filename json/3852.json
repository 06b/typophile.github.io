They are among the most famous works by the British sculptor and designer Eric Gill.   \n   \nRumour has it that on its initial inspection by the BBC's governors, they demanded that several inches be lopped off the manhood of the sprite Ariel.   \n   \nAriel was chosen as something of joke on the word aerial. But Gill himself was not completely amused by the joke, saying: \"Comic, though, the BBC kidding itself that it may be likened to a prince putting the world to rights and its bally apparatus likened to a sort of heavenly spire.\"   \n   \nIn a piece of historial neatness, the corporation now uniformly uses a typeface designed by Gill - Gill Sans - as its house style...\"\n\n"
