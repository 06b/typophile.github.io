  "content": "I'm working on a typeface at the moment that uses plenty of ligatures (in the style of [Ed Interlock](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020160718/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=150&subpage=viewfontsinuse)) and I'm wondering if there's any way to make certain ligatures be dominant over others? For example, for SHI I have an SH ligature and a HI ligature, and because SH comes first as you're typing, it turns into the ligature and the I is left alone. Without having to make an SHI ligature, can I make the HI ligature dominant over SH in the case of SHI?\n\nAnd pardon me if that makes no sense at all. I'm just curious if I can make certain ligatures bow down to more dominant ones.. If there's any code or such.\n\nAlso, while I'm here and asking, can you include spacebar in ligature replacements? Say, for example, you have an S and when it's at the end of a word (marked by a spacebar following the S) you want it to do a swashy thing, is that possibe? like a \"sub S [SPACE] by SSpace.li\" thing..?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I really did enjoy your presentation and your \"paralized with fear\" part did not show.\n\nBTW, I just attended a Fontech session in NYC at TDC where Thomas Phinney was one of the presenters. He was bragging on you and showing your work to some of the attendees who had not seen it. Your many hours in graduate school did not go in vein!\n\nHope you will be able to come to TypeCon Boston and join us all.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
