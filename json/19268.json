  "content": "I am making a font for a chinese music instrument’s tablature. It’s a CJK ideograph based font. First of all, there are glyph that are out of the unicode prescribed glyph, but I have to code them in some fashion. Therefore, many of those glyph is in the private use range. Second, it seems like the script named does not support features like and so on. But i desperately need that. Third, I dont know what script am I suppose to use when the font falls mainly into the private use range. So, is there a way to code at least half of my glyph (which has a total of 1800) and still able to use feature like ? Thanks in advance. A sample of what is happening is attached, but all coded in the CJK range NOT the private use range YET.\n\nI have posted in VOLT MSNgroup but no one reply. Thankx in advance.\n\n",
