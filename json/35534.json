What do you think? Like it? Hate it? Is it readable?\n\nSomething seems not right to me but I can’t put my finger on why I’m dissatisfied.\n\n [‹ Help with serif type](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123247/http:/typophile.com/node/35608 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font that asserts confidence and sporty too ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080928123247/http:/typophile.com/node/35412 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "With something like this, as you connect more lines, just like when blackletter joined stems (is it mun, num, mnu, mum, mmu, umn, etc), it can be hard to recognise letters are they should be.\n\nOn first glance I couldn’t immediately process the letters, and after thinking about it for a while (without reading your post) I figured it was either carikou, or carijoou (I’m sure those mean something in some language —wait, nevermind, actually there is a musical artist Len Carikou, though according to Google, Yahoo!, and MSN, I’m the first person on the internet to type in carijoou, wahoo)\n\nAnyways, some alternate interpretations would be caruoou, carykou, couribou, courikou, etc. If you have to go for the connected letters look, make sure it’s unambiguous as to which letter it is. If you have to go for the long connected descenders, maybe try a slight break (like you have between the top of the _c_ and the bulb of the _a_) so that we know to see two descenders, and not a connected _u_. I agree with some of the others who’ve already posted, the _o_ on top of the _b_ and _u_ is really distracting, and hampers reading (it makes the _b_ look like _k_).\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

I’m not sure your branding doublespeak applies here, especially since you haven’t given any constructive criticism at all.\n\n"

And I think you might be right on the mark, depending on the band’s sound/image overall.\n\nPossible ideas:  \nplaying with using a radius on the r more similar to the other letters\n\nnow that te o and u fit the rest of the word, get freaky with them. try bending each end of the u. Maybe around the o, maybe into it move the o up to the b’s ascender area. See if any of that looks good, or spawns other more interesting ideas.\n\nIgnore the haters. The logotype only needs to be art letters at first, and eventually become pleasantly readable (after digestion) The first image wasn’t pleasant, but you are closer now. If someone really needs the letters to be data containers, they can flip it and read the band name in Arial on the spine of the box.\n\n"
