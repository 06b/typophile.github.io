This was in the geography department at the university I was attending. They wanted to make a map with light and dark shading to show the distribution of something (population density, maybe). The only thing the computer could print was ASCII characters, so they made the thing print using different glyphs for each zone. A “light” zone would use periods; a dark zone m’s (m of course is quite dark in a monospaced font, which was all the computer had then); a mid-zone i’s. With a bit of experimentation they had about five levels easily distinguished.\n\n"
