I have seen the cap Eng with the cap N used as in Garamond Prem. Pro (see below) and as done in Gentium, where the cap Eng looks like an enlarged version of the lower case eng (using lc n). Which will read best to most people?\n\nBelow is a graphic showing both:\n\nThanks,\n\nChrisL\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424041246im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eng_5392.png)\n\n",
