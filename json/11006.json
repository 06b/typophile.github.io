  "content": "Hi all.   \n   \nMy gut feeling is that this is going to be a hard question to answer. Here goes: Is there a rule of thumb about the cost difference between letterpress and offset printing. Obviously in many ways this is like comparing apples and orangutans.   \n   \nUnderstanding of course, to get a solid answer, just request a quote. I'm in the dreaming phase and don't want to bother if the cost will be prohibitive. I'm out of New York City, the job is a promo piece called A little Book of Logos. 24 pages, 4x6 inches final size. It will be a mix or art/type so I think we're talking polymer plates rather than hand setting type. Oh, one color. Anyone hazard a guess? +20% +50% +100%?   \n   \nThanks   \nRandy\n\n",

I hope not. My fingers are crossed for you not to say something like that. I hope you tell me the opposite.   \n   \nThe press I used to do my invitations were very generous. I had lined up another printer only to have them cancel at the last minute. (Which was good because they weren't going to be able to meet my deadline.) The press I used saved by bacon and that of my clients as well. And I have a feeling they were also generous in their pricing.   \n   \nIt was my first time to letter press anything, ever.

      "content": "Tiffany   \n   \nI was way too flippant about this. The price you paid seems way low but perhaps not necessarily so. If a printer is set up for this kind of work and has the right presses for the job, and is doing significant volume where they can standardize it a bit, yes, the price could get fairly low I'd suppose. I just don't see these kind of prices anywhere. I don't do wedding invites because I'm not set up for it and could not be competitive (like your friend, I just do fine press bookwork), but in the LA environs I'm seeing obscene prices being charged for not much effort. A couple of the bigger boutique letterpress outfits who do cater almost exclusively to weddings have me make their plates for them. Their prices are easily ten times what you paid.   \n   \nObviously, high price does not necessarily equal high quality, in fact, it rarely seems to. On the other hand, I think you were given a gift (?), and I wonder if this is their normal rate of charge. As Hrant suggested, I think also that the cost of plates would eat up a portion of the charge here. So your printer wasn't getting much for his effort.   \n   \nBut you never did say what they looked like. So I guess I should throw this back at you. Is cost more important than quality? And what is quality? Is letterpress a qualitative measure in and of itself?\n\n"

Based on my experience, I would say yes, letterpress is going to cost a lot more than offset. But there are levels of letterpress.

      "content": "The invitations were simple, not fancy, one color. Printed on Classic Columns Pistachio with a medium-dark grey ink.   \n   \n_Is cost more important than quality?_   \n   \nNo. I'd say that, for me, I try not to separate the two. In general, I can tell what my clients want/need and base my press (paper, ink, binding) selection on these things. If they want it quick, but don't want to pay a lot or if they want it quick, but quality is important ... well, I have different presses for different jobs. There are presses that I won't use based on the fact that they can't cut straight and often forget to call for press checking, even though they can outbid everyone. And I also don't use presses just because they have Philipe Starck chairs in their front office. Quality, Price, Time -- all important.   \n   \nIn this instance, this wedding invitation, as it was for a friend I wanted it too look good (quality). My friend had seen the letterpressed invitations while doing the rounds of wedding planning and saw how it added a little something special. So for her, quality meant letterpress. So I suggested letterpress. Now, it could be said that just because we printed letterpess doesn't mean the final project was of high quality. Letterpress doesn't necessarily equal high quality. Although I did use a pressman who does quality work.   \n   \nWhile your question is good, it's difficult to say without generalizing. Of course, I always want the final product to be quality and cost effective. I don't like the word \"cheap\", but I've been known to tell my rep that I need the paper to be \"inexpensive\". Cheap connotes trash and polyester. I don't like to think I do trash.   \n   \nPerhaps quality is in the eye of the beholder. You have been known to say that you shouldn't slam the paper into the plate. But, for some the question is \"why do letterpress\" if you can't see it? To protect myself, we didn't do any slamming on these invitations, only mild tapping.   \n   \n ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018024032im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n _Is letterpress a qualitative measure in and of itself?_   \n   \nNo. I don't think so. No amount of good inking and perfect padding can save a poor design. Or on the other hand, a good design can be made bad by poor press work.   \n   \n_What is quality?_   \n   \nQuality is a combination of everything. But mostly, quality is in the eye of the beholder.   \n   \nThanks for the questions. I think everyone should answer these. It would make for a great discussion in and of itself.   \n   \nDo I pass? ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018024032im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "\\> \"why do letterpress\" if you can't see it?   \n   \nBecause you can _feel_ it.   \nIt's subtle, \"subvisible\", the way you might not concsiously   \nnotice a perfume, but it will \"atmospherize\" you anyway.   \n   \nHard to sell, things that you can't fondle, I know. In fact, some people seem to enjoy letterpress because they like the feel of a lump of metal in the hand. This is problematic, in a number of ways. For example, it's display-centric (handling 9 point type is no fun compared to 60 point), and it has nothing to do (except maybe metaphysically) with the result, which is the only thing the _user_ cares/needs\\_to\\_care about.   \n   \nOne great thing about metal type though is it lets you physically appreciate why chirography is anti-typographic. Holding some large Palatino in my hand recently, I couldn't help but think \"this is not right\". It's supposed to be engraved - even though the illusion of the result can be convincing.   \n   \n\\> quality is in the eye of the beholder.   \n   \nI myself would say that wholeheartedly about Beauty, but Quality is not so simple.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I was thinking maybe an A+ (for thinking about stuff!!!).   \n   \nI guess when I furtively responded I was thinking about quality without really getting in to it. But since quality is difficult to evaluate I'd prefer to apply it to the work of persons who have a certain approach to their work which would include concern for appropriate materials, work attitude, experience, etc. To determine the quality herein, one, unfortunately, must share a lot of these characteristics.   \n   \nBut when I said \"degrees of letterpress\" I was thinking of an easier way to define this. The degrees of letterpress are a combination of the above qualities of the printer as well as his or her equipment and technique. The latter is actually somewhat important in evaluating letterpress. They don't always follow but...   \n   \nAt the high end, in cost/quality you would probably encounter folks using an iron hand press. These are less machine than tool and are quite labor intensive and require a great deal of skill, expertise and \"thinking.\" They also, for the most part, require dampened handmade paper. Most of the work here is fine book work. Not many of these folks around.   \n   \nA second step down, but not necessarily so, are folks working with hand-operated cylinder presses. Dampened handmade paper is often used, and often not. Bookwork, broadsides, and the like but not so much jobwork, though occasionally. But you are somewhat dependent upon the operater here (lot a variation in quality and professionalism) and most folks running these kind of machines have rarely been trained in printing (in the traditional technical school way).   \n   \nInterchangeable somewhat with the above are fully functioning commercial letterpress shops running big automatic cylinder presses. Handmade papers are generally not applicable here but these folks (generally trained) are capable of running any kind of work, relatively fast, relatively good, and relatively cheaper. Professional grade work most of the time. These kind of operations are quite rare though.   \n   \nBottom dwellers: motor driven platen job press operations. Job work, cards, stationery, labels, die-cutting, stamping, etc. Rarely capable of decent book work. Should be quite inexpensive (unless boutique), rarer to see good quality work, fast.   \n   \nBasically, operator somewhat aside, the more distancing the machine from the human hand, eye, and mind (not to mention heart), the cheaper in cost and quality. But not always so!!!   \n   \nMy five minute attempt here to put a bit of a different spin on this.\n\n"
