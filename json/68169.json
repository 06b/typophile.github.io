I do not know of an exact match for this, but I found a free font that I think could easily be made to look like it. See [MTV2C](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012030503/http:/www.abstractfonts.com/font/13011?text=ODYSSEY350) at Abstract Fonts. If you square off the appropriate corners, add vertical serifs to the 3 and then slant the result, I think you are there.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
