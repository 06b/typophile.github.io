      "content": "Don't think you'll have good suggestions. My 2 cent:  \n- 1: these typefaces are rather unique (at least to me) so pretty convinced nothing really approaching could be suggested  \n- 2: free fonts are not very appreciated by forum members. Most are type designers or type-business related, some sell their creations so suggesting alternative free fonts might sound off-topic  \n- 3: many free fonts are actually rip-off/bad copies/illegal clones and have fooled more than once many people from this community so suggesting free alternatives is always kind of risky  \n- 4: asking for free alternatives without specifying context/purpose could also be wrongly appreciated, possibly meaning you don't want to pay the price for the type designer hard work.  \nAnyway, here are 2 trusted sources for free fonts: [Google Fonts directory](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025149/http:/www.google.com/fonts), [Fontsquirrel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417025149/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/)  \nGood luck!\n\n"
