  "content": "I'm working through an agency to brainstorm ideas for a logo to use for the city of Mountain View's annual Art & Wine Festival. I figured I'd take the opportunity to do some custom lettering rather than the more conventional logo approach.\n\nAttached is the first idea (of three) I finished. Here are some notes:\n\n- ALL the text you see has to be included, unfortunately. That part isn't negotiable.  \n- All the lettering is custom. Obviously I spent the most time on the \"Art & Wine\" section, but the smaller sans and serif blocks of text were done (somewhat hastily) as custom lettering as well. There was no real reason, I just thought it'd be fun to do all of it \"by hand\".\n\n",
