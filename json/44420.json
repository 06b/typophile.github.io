There are browsers that simply don’t care about CMYK, so how are their users supposed to do so? To detect the colour mode of a web image, I’d have to download it, locate it on my disk, select ‘Information’, and additionally, select ‘Further information’. 4 steps, only for finding out, i.e. without conversion? No dice, Jan, sorry. :-)\n\n"
