  "content": "In 1986 Amsterdam tried to get the Olympic summer games for 1992, and ran a campaign in which some railway coaches were specially decorated.  \nCould any of you identify the typeface of \"Amsterdam 1992\" here? It looks a bit like Franklin Gothic Condensed (angled terminals, variations in stroke widths) - but that doesn't seem to be fully accurate, for example the \"1\" in Franklin Gothic is totally different, having a big serif at the base.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Amsterdam1992_4792.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Amsterdam1992_detail_3693.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425145151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Amsterdam1992_side_5580.jpg)\n\nThanks and greetings! I'm planning to make a model of this.  \n(edit: added two more photos, better angle/size)\n\n",
