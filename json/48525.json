I also designed a typeface known as [The Angel of the Odd (ultrabold version below Jellybrush in this sample)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122123004/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/arboghast/2467911416/in/set-72157604893392854/) a number of years ago. It has an extreme shape in it which happens to look a lot like the Opera House. Should we consider using the Angel for ATC? Or would that amount to grandstanding and proprietizing the ATC with my own personal typo motif too strongly?\n\nAbout this current logo attempt: Should the letter outlines be tighter? Give them a high-tension effect?\n\nOh the ink traps on the t! Well, you see, Evert Bloemsma invented that. I love it because look, _look at that_, look at the tiny 150 x 150 pixel and 100 x 100 pixel small versions. Those traps are only about 12 units wide on 1000 unit per em characters. But they keep working even at tiny reproduction sizes. I love that effect because it proves how powerful the design principles Evert was working on really are. A triumph for Dutch type design.\n\nWhat else?\n\nWhat else would you do to it?\n\nAnything else?\n\nThat’s all I could come up with in three hours.\n\n[Edit: I just removed “ghosts that sell memories” from the thread title.

De Goot is kind-of unavoidable, so influential on so many of us.\n\nGaramond, yes, there is an element Garamond-like bending in the hood of the a and the cursiveness in the t and c.\n\nBayer I’m not greatly influenced by, altho I do love what I was able to do to Bayer Universal / Bauhaus and get away with it : ^ ) Benguiat is probably more influential on the sentinel design canon. I’ve used the principle of the quarter round in a few faces now. The original was Midnight Kernboy. The thesis / signature version is known as the Angel, and Amity is the commercial version, a “soft” angel.\n\nThere are cross-cultural design connections everywhere and I gues a lot of those things are put there specially for us to find.\n\n"

Its bite has been deemed uncertain.\n\nDarrel—-I’ve experimented with the tagline benath the box and felt it reduced the simplicity. The advantage of doing that way, the tagline ends up larger and the logo will reproduce even smaller. Another thing I experimented with was a tagline going the whole width of the box but still inside it, and letterspaced. Letterspacing the tagline I thought could be a way of evoking the vast opens spaces and distances between population centers characteristic of Oz. Unfortunately the letterspaced versions look like crap at small sizes and I don’t even want to post them.\n\nAnother reference for the cruciform t—-the Southern Cross constellation.

I’m trying to finalize this as an initial logo design, but of course other people may have ideas in future years which will be up for consideration.\n\nI think we may end up using numerous different ATC logos for different purposes, and the design of each can be an integral part of club-goings-on. For example, if we decide to devote one year to calligraphic lettering then we’ll need a caligraphic version of the ATC logo for that year. Another year it might be a celebration of the renaissance Italian roots of book roman type, and whoever is most enthusiatic can design an exaggerated Jenson-esque ATC logo for that year. And so on.\n\nPaul—-yes ATC is full steam ahead as of now. We’re not just playing. You have to give it time to gain momentum and be patient while we organize and acquire the resources needed to incorporate. Once it’s incorporated we will have access to serious funding and the fun can really begin.\n\nRussell—-yep, the **a** does appear optically larger than the dark type.

It looks like a mistake to those who are not type-oriented and even then, it is only the “t” that has that treatment. I would keep it all clean.

Half of them didn’t even notice the traps are there.\n\nI think consistency in design is vastly overrated, or at least overvalued by designers. Typographic design and typeface design are unlike buildings and automobiles in the sense that a typeface is a team of individual players that combine the strengths and weaknesses of each character. Logo design tends to overlook or neglect this vital aspect of typeface design. I’d like to keep some inconsistency in this logo as a reference to the philosophical side of type design.\n\nWhy does every element have to have the same treatment (why do we all have to think this way)? Integration of form and finish is one thing. Humanism is something else.\n\nThere are practical reasons for not putting the same style of traps on the a and c. They won’t go on the c because there’s nowhere to put them on the c without having it look unnatural. I could suggest or emulate them with kinks on the inner profile, but somehow anticipate that will look contrived. In the second iteration the traps on the a were exaggerated, but they can be even more exaggerated and still look natural so I’ll try that.\n\nMy rationale for why the t can have such pronounced traps has to do with its structure. Of the three letters present, only the t has a four way cruciform joint. Each letter is individual and has its own requirements.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
