Nothing too expensive. Something with a bit of theory and a bit of experience would be perfect, I'm not so much looking for an instructional guide as musings/discussions on type design.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)\n\nG\n\nps. I already have the triumvirate, ta.\n\n",

Ta though.\n\n'The Stroke' by Gerrit Noordzij was something I'd had a look at. It deals with constructing typefaces from the point of view of the written letter. I was wondering if anyone knew of any books that approach type design from the opposite point of view; rejecting the stroke and considering each glyph as a collection of shapes? This is something that I am equally interested in.\n\n[I'm not trying to start an argument about which is the right approach here, I'm just intrigued by both perspectives]\n\nThanks for your help,\n\nG\n\n"

      "content": "re. The Stroke: _It deals with constructing typefaces from the point of view of the written letter._\n\nWell, no, it doesn't deal with ‘constructing typefaces’ at all. I'm not sure that type is even mentioned in the book, except perhaps in passing. It's an approach to analysing and understanding what is happening in letterforms in terms of stroke construction. As such, I'd say it is a fundamental text, even if one's approach to type design is more or less independent of such analysis. It's not about a right or wrong way to design type, but about building analytical toolsets that enable one to understand what one is doing and looking at. I'd love to be able to recommend another book that provides a comparable analytical approach to letters ‘as collections of shapes’, but to my knowledge such a book doesn't exist. Perhaps because type designs approached in such a way tend to be individual, so there is no common model that can be applied to their analysis.\n\nBy the way, Walter Tracy's _Letters of Credit_ remains one of the best books on the subject of type design.\n\n"
