      "content": "The first one looks like a logo for a heavy medal band. The second one would be a stretch for a jeans company. Maybe a secondary brand. Both Mens and Womans Jeans need to be pushed a squoosh to the right to balance the weight with the line above them. I would also ask you to develope them as black and white solutions. The jeans line especially being they have either printing or embrodery restrictions. Good work keep going\n\n"
