  "content": "I work for a magazine that prints a lot of programming code blocks in which we use only straight quotes. The problem is, InDesign is automatically changing all of our straight quotes into curly quotes because we need curly quotes in our general body text. I’ve discovered the Stylistic Sets option for Glyphs and have made a new set that has the curly quotes removed, but I don’t know how to get our code Paragraph Style to use the Stylistic Set I created instead. Am I even attempting to do the right thing here? How would you go about getting a Paragraph Style using Letter Gothic to use only straight quotes?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or suggestions!\n\n—af\n\n [‹ Fontshop.com - Font Browsing](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511141414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42926 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Embedding Fonts in Flash CS3 using AS3 and CSS ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511141414/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42894 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
