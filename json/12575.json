  "content": "Some words start with an apostrophe, indicating a contraction: the ’60s, ’twas, the ’n’ in “Fish ’n’ Chips,” and so forth. Sometimes you need to set these within quotation marks; for example, if you were quoting the first line of “Jabberwocky”:\n\n“’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves…”\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1. The manual for my word processor rightfully rails against straight quotes, except in the ’Twas case above. It gives an actual example which suggests the use of a single typewriter quote in that particular instance. I wrote them to protest, and they were very amenable to removing the recommendation if I could cite a reference. The Chicago Manual of Style says nothing about setting an initial apostrophe in quotes, and nor does Dowding that I could see. My copy of Bringhurst is on loan. Can anyone point me to a specific published discussion of this case? Where would they have gotten the idea that a typewriter quote was OK?\n\n2. How would you suggest setting an initial apostrophe in quotes? With a thin space before, to visually distinguish it? Suggestions welcomed.\n\n",
