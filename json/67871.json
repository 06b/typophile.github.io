  "content": "Hi all typography lovers!\n\nI'm a new comer here, and I hope to tell you guys about the iphone app we've finished that's called Helvetication.\n\nMy friend Andrew as an graphic/typopgraphy designer himself, always wants to challenge his designer friends about helvetica, but really can't find a good looking one or one that is appealing to him.\n\nWe came up with a simple and elegant app that lets you compete with your friends, and also see how well you actually know helvetica (vs arial).\n\nIt's only 99 cents, but it's really a lot of fun! and I hope you guys can just try it out\n\nAlso please tell us anything we can improve on, as we are going to do upgrades soon and I really hope you all are happy. Thanks!\n\napp.itize.us/wp/2010/helvetication/\n\n",
