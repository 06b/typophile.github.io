      "content": "OK, let’s get into it, then.  \nFirst of all, Mendeleiev's Periodic Table of the Elements is one of the greatest achievements of modern science, structured by an inner logic which, at the time of its conception, not only allowed to organize the chemical elements ALREADY known but also those YET to be discovered (radioactive substances, for instance). Here it is used as a mere \"cool-looking graphic scheme\" with no inner logic whatsoever. Lazy, shoddy stuff.  \nNow to the \"Typophile\" part : in my opinion, making this kind of selection without referencing a specific context (academic, professional, publishing, etc.) is utterly useless — but THIS ONE is really, really, flawed : why include Robert Slimbach's AdobeGaramond AND Franco Luin's Garamond Classico, for instance ? Isn't one digital \"real\" Garamond (i.e. not based on a Jannon model) enough ? Why Griffo Classico and not Monotype Poliphilus ? Why Monotype Bembo AND Bitstream Aldine (which are more or less the same typeface) ? What's \"Realist\" about Baskerville ? And WHICH Baskerville, by the way ? Monotype ? ITC ? Storm ? Isn't Old English more \"Popular, Influential and Notorious\" than Manuscript-Gotisch ? Where's Fournier ? Where's Monotype Centaur ? Where are Bell and Bulmer ? Which Kis ? Linotype Kis Classico, Monotype Ehrhardt or Janson Text ? I could go on like this for hours, but would it be worth it ?  \nThis thing LOOKS LIKE it has been THOUGHT OUT when it has merely been COMPILED — it is thus an insult to its model (Mendeleiev's work) AND to its subject (typographic culture).\n\n"

      "content": "Should I defend? I'm reading all your comments and I can't really come up with something, but I will say, you are all exactly right. Right, but I guess I just wanted my intentions to be known because I love this site.\n\nI had a great conversation with a University of Michigan instructor recently that hated the design that explains much of what the complaints on here are about. It's actually my favorite moment of this whole ordeal (read through the short comments section): [http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/03/11/yet-another-periodic-table/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417163709/http:/punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/03/11/yet-another-periodic-table/ \"http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/03/11/yet-another-periodic-table/\")\n\nBasically what it boils down to is that:  \n1) It was never my intention for it to be anywhere near the achievement Mendeleev's original table was.\n\n2) The design is meant to bear a passing resemblance to the periodic table of elements (simply for familiarity's sake) and when the viewer does a second take, they see typefaces.\n\n3) I didn't choose the typefaces (for those that complained about leaving some out). I didn't choose the ranking ORDER of typefaces. The sources listed at the bottom of the design were used. I chose those sources (granted, some had more credibility than others but I didn't just willy-nilly choose lists to go off of) and annotated each and every typeface mentioned on all the lists in Excel. I then annotated their ranks in each list. Then how many times they appeared on lists. Finally averaged all the scores each typeface received and sorted the columns using the aggregate scores. The first 100 typefaces that resulted were used in the table. So if there's a problem with why certain typefaces aren't on it and why one is ranked higher than another, the sources, again, are listed on the bottom of the design. Ask them.\n\n4) The arrangement is again far far far from perfect. Again, it wasn't my intention to make it perfect. Just to resemble the table of elements. That's it. I DID put groups of same families and classes together because it gives it SOME organization and they look good together. Also, they are numerically sorted WITHIN each family/class groups.\n\n5) Honestly, I had no idea how played out the kitchy \"Periodic Table of (insert anything here)\" was. I'd never seen one other than the actual elements until after I uploaded my design.\n\n6) Finally, the honest-to-goodness truth is that when I uploaded the design on the Behance Network last Monday evening for the first time, I checked \"looking for feedback\" because at best, I thought it would get 30 views maximum and maybe get some tips on improving the design. I never once promoted, sent out the link (except to some friends) or tooted my horn in anyway. I woke up Tuesday morning to 5,000 views on the page and now it's at 37,000, not counting the seemingly endless blogs linking to the large size image (thereby passing up the Behance page completely) and more and more blogs linking to other blogs that are featuring it. Again, not my intention.\n\nI'm sitting here wondering why I'm defending this here at Typophile so much. This site is the only one I've done this with (other than Punya's that I linked to above, but I was much more brief). I guess it's because I respect this site and it's members and would much rather express my views to this group rather than the few sites where the critiques are a bit harsher.\n\nFor those of you that \"get it,\" thank you very much. For those that don't, that's a-ok, I still respect you all and what you do.\n\nI'm sorry but I just thought of one last final defense. I've noticed on many sites in the comments and in many of the e-mails I've received, this design has just slightly opened the eyes of folks that previously took typefaces for granted. They stick with Arial as the default because they never really had a good look at the options presented to them in such a way. Also, there have been many comments from people that never fully realized that typefaces had designers with real names and that people actually cared about when the a particular typeface was designed. So for the design to at least spark a bit of interest in the world of typography and it's history, it can't be THAT stupid could it?\n\nThank you again for all that you folks are doing. Keep it up!\n\n"
