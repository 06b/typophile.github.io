  "content": "Yep, that's what I'm gonna do. Don't even try to stop me.\n\nThe inherent problem with the number 9 is that it looks just like the number 6. I'm putting this on my inner forearm, right before the elbow. If I'm sitting at the computer, elbows bent, the bottom of the 9 will face the desk. I'll be looking at it upside down so it will probably look like a 6 to me.\n\nWondering if there is any font that is clearly a 9 vs. a 6. I'd like something a little rockabilly-ish looking, but not a 9-ball or something like that. Just a 9, plain and simple.\n\nI also like the way Garamond has a break between the ball and stem of the 9.\n\nThanks for any feedback.\n\n",

You could use a larger number with the word nine spelled out below and surrounded by a box to make it look like a flash card, or if you used rounded corners on the box you could make it look like a playing card -- if that appeals to you. Or you could curve the word around the top of the number.\n\nPlease take to heart the earlier advice of others to choose your tattoo artist carefully.\n\nWhatever you decide, please post a photo of the final result for us to see.\n\n"

Upside down it's hard to mistake for a six but still a pretty clear nine.\n\nCan't think of any typefaces that have a 9 like that but I'm sure you and your tattoo artist could draw one that would do the job.\n\n"

      "time": "",
      "content": "\"Wondering if there is any font that is clearly a 9 vs. a 6\"\n\nThink you are going to struggle to find a typeface that will achieve this. The problem is that the elements that make a '9' be a nine are the same factors that are used to make a '6' be a six. Thus changing any of the elements i.e changing the straightness of the leg on the '9' will only ultimately change the 6 in the same way. Saying that I do think that it is possible to make the mark more like a 9 instead of a six, but not enough to use on its own.\n\nFrom what others have suggested I think possibly having a dot after the number will work best. At first I thought the roman numeral idea might work, but then realised that in fact IX(9) upside down is actually XI(which is 11), so might no do the job unfortunately.\n\nGood luck. Let us all know what you decide to do.\n\n"

FWIW there's also a fair number of oddly weighted A's in typefaces as well, having it done in tattooing is most likely due to not flipping the stencil beforehand.\n\n"

Pretty cool, and kind of unique. My son is half Mexican (my wife) and half white guy (me). She suggested I get the nine written out in Spanish.\n\nnueve\n\nI like that idea.\n\nNow I just have to find the right font. I'm tempted to go all Mission San Francisco Latino gangster and swirl it up, but as an average white guy, that's not really my style. I can't seem to find a Latino font that looks like anything but a Chevy's restaurant menu item. So sad.\n\nShould I just go Helvetica?\n\n"
