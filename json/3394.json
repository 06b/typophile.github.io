  "content": "Hello Kids -   \n   \nA few months ago I discovered ambigrams, and soon after that fell in love with the magic that are symbiotograms. I was asked to design a skateboard graphic, and finally! I had a good chance to apply a symbiotogram to a commercial project. The ambidextrous nature of a board leant itself perfectly to such a design, and under the theme of anti-violence, I designed the below graphic.   \n   \n [http://stereotypography.com/other/?src=deck\\_type.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024150601/http:/stereotypography.com/other/?src=deck_type.jpg)   \n   \nIt can be a little tricky to read on one rotation, but I think it just about works. I'm interested to hear what you think and whether you've played around with similar things.\n\n [‹ Has this article already been discussed?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024150601/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3293 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Ahoy Scrappin&#39; Pirates! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081024150601/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3371 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But I think that may have been because the bottom of the F was cut off by the browser window at first, so I'm not sure if it's necessarilly something to worry about.\n\n"
