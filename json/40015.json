[The book title’s pun is lost in translation: ‘Streitschrift’ means ‘(polemic) pamphlet’ _and_ ‘controversial typeface’]\n\n[Rotis](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234746/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rotis), designed in 1988 by [Otl Aicher](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234746/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Otl%252BAicher), tried to bridge the gap between Sans and Serif. It soon became heavily debated and generated polarized opinions. Some found its hybrid system very useful for corporate communication, and so Rotis consequently was used extensively to embody ‘solidity’.\n\nOthers dispised Aicher’s design, claiming he was a great designer (most notably: 1972 Olympics in Munich), but just not a proper _type_ designer. Rotis is said to be defective in running text, as it has a distinctive vertical stress and therefore tends to form undesirable columns.\n\nEspecially the ‘smiling’ (or ‘keeling over’) lowercase ‘e’ gets lots of love and hate.\n\n<cite>The Rotis type family was developed much from Aicher’s own theories on typography and readability, and as such, works better in concept than in practical application.</cite>  \n— Norbert Florendo in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234746/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15785)\n\nThat’s exactly what we call a ‘Kopfgeburt’ in German – a mere mind game, useless in practice.\n\nF\n\n[edit] Oh, I knew I had read this ‘Kopfgeburt’ attributed to Rotis somewhere else: [Robin Kinross](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234746/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Robin%252BKinross) and [Erik Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234746/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erik%252BSpiekermann) on [Is Rotis a typeface?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213234746/http:/www.spiekermann.com/iblog/C1109747452/E1829097339/index.html)\n\n"
