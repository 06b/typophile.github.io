They rarely had  \nrelatives and scarcely had a supporting cast, causing  \nshort-sighted typesetters to seldom use them for much more than  \nfeatherbrained frivolity. Enter Burbank, a coordinated collection  \nof 20 fonts, hand hewn to handle tasks from big to small, wide to  \ncondensed, light to black and countless styles in between. Burbank  \nis ready for anything from hyperbolic headlines on outdoor  \nbillboards and in major magazines to miniscule matters in tiny  \nclassified advertisements.
