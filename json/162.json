Special thanks to Ramsey Margolis for bringing it to our attention.   \n   \nOUR MAN OF LETTERS DRINKS FROM FOUNT   \nBy Mathew Loh Ho-Sang   \nBusiness reporter   \n   \nA world-renowned Wellington commercial artist and fount designer is   \nrejoicing after clinching a deal that will see his art released digitally in   \ncomputers throughout the world.   \n   \nHataitai resident Joseph Churchward, 69, whose fount design Wellingtonians   \nsee every day when looking at The Evening Post masthead, says he is   \n\"absolutely honoured\" that a highly-regarded American-based design firm,   \nchank.com, has decided to resurrect his work.   \n   \n\"I drew my first letters in the sands of my Samoan birthplace way back in   \nthe 40s,\" Mr Churchward said.   \n   \nHe went on in the 70s to become one of New Zealand's most successful fount   \ndesigners, with his work marketed globally by a German company.   \n   \nNow more than 30 years on -- after having had his career stall when he lost   \nhis fortune following the 1987 sharemarket crash -- Mr Churchward is back   \nwith as much enthusiasm for his art as ever.   \n   \n\"In my time I have designed 300 alphabets, which I believe is the most done   \nby any living artist today,\" he said.   \n   \n\"Therefore I am tremendously excited and absolutely honoured that chank.com   \nare treating me so well and have signed a deal with me to digitally release   \nmy 300 alphabets in 20 separate volumes with 15 fount designs in each.\"   \n   \nChank.com founder and chief executive, Minnesota-based Chank Diesel, said it   \nwasn't easy choosing 15 founts for the first volume \"from a collection of   \nexquisite craftsmanship but we believe this initial release is a snapshot of   \nthe innovation and diversity found in Mr Churchward's typography work\".   \n   \nMr Churchward is now busy designing new founts, some based on ancient Maori   \nand Samoan designs.   \n   \n\"At the moment I'm busy on new designs and therefore by the time my 300   \nprevious designs are released there will be another 100 to add.   \n   \n\"My design interests reflect New Zealand and my own rich heritage of   \nChinese, Samoan, Scottish, English and Tongan ethnicity,\" Mr Churchward   \nsaide. \"It is very exciting getting my work back out to the world after so   \nlong and I'm totally inspired.\"\n\n",
