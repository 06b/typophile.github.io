So I am looking for a font that is Chunky but also that has a bit of Child-like Character.  \nApproach  \nAnother approach is to choose typography that was designed around the period of the first world war.  \nGaramond and P22JohnstonUnderground come to mind, but they may be just a little too serious straight looking.  \nImpact also comes to mind just because a lot of the hand-drawn posters were drawn in quite a blocky font.  \nIf anyone has any views/suggestions please share.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826130955im_/http:/typophile.com/files/a-1038-100_6489.jpg)\n\n",
