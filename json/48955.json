I know that for some of Mr. Mayer's stuff (website/iTunes artist page) he uses Avant Garde and I think that's what they're using here but the Rs are DEFINITELY not avant garde.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100719013507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/JM_4675.jpg)\n\nObviously this is a custom font... but what are it's roots?\n\nAfter doing a \"What The Font?\" On the John Mayer album cover for continuum, and it came up as News Gothic BT -- the R from that appears to match so perhaps its a combo of both I don't know.\n\n[john mayer.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100719013507/http:/www.johnmayer.com/)  \n [continuum album cover](http://web.archive.org/web/20100719013507/http:/www.j-mayer.org/images/career/musichistory/continuum-big.jpg)\n\n",

The S on summer looks like Avant Garde, def. not Avenir. Gee..what a mess\n\n"

The ligatures are probably why Avant Garde was suggested, but I think those may be customized from the font used, and not necessarily part of the font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "There are four attributes that I was trying to match: the J (above the baseline and fairly closed); the M (straight-sided, with vertex at baseline); the E (short center arm); and the R (straight leg intersecting the bowl). The closest sample I had in my Sans Guide was Berthold Balken, which I cannot find any more. However, it was condensed by comparison to this sample, so it was not an exact match unless it had been widened.\n\nYehan's suggestion of [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20100719013507/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/avenir/), does not have the uneven E, but it looks a lot like it in other respects, so let's say Avenir, with a modified E, and manufactured ligatures. This would get you very close.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
