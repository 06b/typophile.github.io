The serif one looks to me like Storm Anselm Serif, but I have some doubts.

Great thanks for the help!\n\nStill, judging by the bad karma of Panos in the [**Parachute thread**](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121154704/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39777), cannot help wondering what design has been the ’inspiration’ this time. Even though the case is solved, my curiousity stays.\n\nAt least for the serif there are many similarities to Anselm, but haven’t got a chance to compare the outlines. Borrowing there is (as was in Muse, discussed [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121154704/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43240)), but... not exactly sure about the source.\n\n"
