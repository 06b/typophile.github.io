Very disappointing.\n\nThis one rung me a bell instantly: commercial font, recent, blue background MyFonts font specimen... But no name or foundry. I decided to run WhatFontiS (not using anymore WhatTheFont app as most of the time, it can't even identify fonts sold on MyFonts... Shame...) to get a little help but no valuable clue. Then I remember this type was designed by The Northern Block, a complete different design of what Jonathan Hill usually delivers. I browsed his fonts and found Velik.\n\n"
