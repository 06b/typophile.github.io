  "content": "We were disappointed, but not surprised, that Erik Spiekermann, a noted and respected type designer and author, would knowingly make false and misleading statements regarding Berthold in a public forum.   \n   \nAs such statements affect the reputation of Berthold Types, I am responding with this posting. I attach a letter dated June 3, 2004, to Mr. Spiekermann explaining the actual facts behind the continuation of H. Berthold's type business by Berthold Types. This letter is from Berthold Types Limited's German attorneys because the subject matter involves German law. We arranged for the attached English translation.   \n   \nAlthough the letter to Mr. Spiekermann addresses the myths and misconceptions perpetuated by Mr. Spiekermann's comments, I would like to make a few points:   \n   \n1. Berthold Designers   \nMr. Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original Berthold designers even though he is well aware of the agreement with Guenter Gerhard Lange. Mr. Spiekermann, a friend of Mr. Lange, tried to persuade Mr. Lange against working with Berthold Types but failed.   \n   \nContrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statement, Berthold Types has agreements with Guenter Gerhard Lange, Bernd Moellenstaedt, Dieter Hofrichter, Orjan Nordling and Prof. Werner Schneider.   \n   \n--Mr. Lange (at 83) is working on new typefaces for Berthold Types; having completed Whittingham in 2001 and additions to his other typefaces (Bodoni Old Face and Imago). He also has a new typeface yet to be released and has embarked on another large typeface project for Berthold Types. Mr. Lange as artistic consultant is actively involved in future type releases by Berthold.   \n   \n--Mr. Moellenstaedt has created a new, large typeface family for Berthold Types (yet to be released) as well as preparing additional offerings of Formata.   \n   \n--Prof. Schneider recently completed and Berthold Types released his Senatus typeface.   \n   \n--Mr. Hofrichter works on many projects for Berthold's type program and works closely with Berthold Types to insure the continued quality of the Berthold type program. He works directly with GGL on all his new releases.   \n   \nAll of the contracts between H. Berthold AG and the designers specifically stated that when a typeface design falls into the public domain the obligation by Berthold to pay royalities ceases. Berthold Types offered to pay designers nonetheless. Notwithstanding, Hans Reichel chose to release a reworking of Barmeno.   \n   \nInterestingly, according to H. Berthold's royalty worksheet, Mr. Spiekermann was never paid royalties on an ongoing basis for Berliner Grotesk and LoType.   \n   \n2. Registration of Berthold's Trademarks   \nMr. Spiekermann also implies that any company could simply register H. Berthold's trademarks. This is simply not true.   \n   \nThe Type division of H. Berthold was a separated in October 1991 and the Type assets were \"leased\" back to H. Berthold by a consortium of banks. The Type division was not a part of the H. Berthold AG bankruptcy in 1993 and was separate from Berthold's other businesses. Berthold Types acquired the type assests (e.g. the trademarks as well as other IP rights -- see the attached letter) through the chain of title through these banks, not through bankruptcy.   \n   \nAccordingly, contrary to Mr. Spiekermann's statements, over 80 German trademark registrations, and numerous UK and US registrations, were assigned through the \"chain of title\" from H. Berthold AG to Berthold Types, including the \"Berthold in a red square logo\" and the \"H. Berthold\" trademarks.   \n   \n3. Protection of Berthold's IP Rights   \nMr. Spiekermann states that Berthold Types has been \"suing dozens of people with frivolous cases which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars (and I am not exaggerating).\"   \n   \nIt's a myth. In fact, Berthold Types has filed only twelve lawsuits two of which were against FSI/FontShop (both for trademark infringement). Mr. Spiekermann cannot provide any basis supporting losses of \"millions of dollars.\" Type is just not that large of a business.   \n   \n   \nIf Mr. Spiekermann wants to debate: Stick to the facts, please.   \n   \nRespectfully,   \n   \nHarvey Hunt   \nPresident   \nBerthold Types Limited\n\n<!--attachment: Spiekermann_Translation-37443.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*91.9*Translation*Spiekermann_Translation%2epdf --><!--attachment: Spiekermann_Translation-37443.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*91.9*Translation*Spiekermann_Translation%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Translation<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/Spiekermann_Translation-37443.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Spiekermann_Translation.pdf</b></a> (91.9 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",

      "content": "I am happy to see that the president of Berthold has posted on this forum. Although, I must agree with Mr. Spiekermann and the others here: posting a response on this forum would have been a more polite first step than having an attorney draft a letter and send it to him first.   \n   \nI think that the public exchange of opinion over the internet is one it's biggest perks. While it is obvious that Mr. Spiekermann's opinion of Berthold is not a positive one, I do not think that his statements were libelous or defamatory. (He is certainly entitled to his opinion, and he is also entitled to propogate it politely) Also, we are only looking at _a few short posts on an online forum._ I think, if someone with Mr. Spiekerman's gravitas in the type community wanted to go to war with Berthold, he easily could. And he wouldn't need do it via banter on an online forum. Berthold is certainly aware of this. I don't understand their ultra-protectionary, overtly legal-feeling reaction.   \n   \nB.Gibbs has an interesting point, too. Monotype, Linotype, FontShop, E+F, and many other founderies all have presences at large type events and activities. Their designers all lecture, too. Is Berthold not doing this because it can't afford the costs? At TYPO Berlin, the Managing Director of Linotype, talking about piracy protection, said that the best way to prevent piracy is through technological and design innovation.   \n   \nHe didn't say that the best method was sending out cease-and-desist letters.   \n   \nI wonder what the impression of Berthold on this forum would be if it had spent the money required for its 12 lawsuits, or even the legal and translation fees necessary for the letter to Mr. Spiekermann, on _product marketing_ instead?   \n   \n(However, Mr. Spiekermann, it is well-known that Linotype and many other foundries do file law suits to protect their work from piracy. I am assuming that FontShop does this as well. Can you tell me if cease-and-desist letters are common in our industry? Berthold may or may not have sent out _too many_, but how many are sent out by their competitors?)   \n   \nhallo Titus! sch\n\n"

Their point is to swing the conversation to something else to divert attention and replace it with an attack on either the original source or to dump on anyone close enough.

These are not only off topic additions/comments, they could also poison discussion to the extent that Berthold and/or Mr. Spiekermann would no longer respond to the points discussed above.   \n   \nI would really, really, like to hear from Mr. Hunt, and hear his opinion about Berthold's opinion in the design community. Perhaps he thinks that we are a bunch of nuts, and taht our opinions are not representative. Perhaps he even has sales figures to back that up! _I don't know._ But I would really like to know...   \n   \nI would also like to hear how many lawsuits FontShop has filed, or something similiar, to use as a point of comparison. If FSI has filed 24 lawsuits in the same time period that Berthold filed 12, that says something. If they filed 2, that says something else.   \n   \nHrant, we all know your opinions about the US Government, and its legal system. In some respects, you are right, especially when it comes to Type and its protection. EU courts offer type designs and foundries much more protection, I think.   \n   \nHowever, bashing the US court system, is not so relevant to this topic, I think. Many of the lawsuits in discussion were filed in European courts, so the US and its benefits/fallacies, play little effect.   \n   \nAlso, I think that \"Trademarking\" something is more of an international process now than a national one.   \n   \nAgain, lets talk about Berthold. Perhaps they really are the demon of the type world. Perhaps we are mistaken in our opinion. I don't think that we will learn anything about these questions from discussing the ideals of democracy, or the prelude to the Holocaust.   \n   \n(As I side note, I'll bite that I am very interested in talking about democracy in general, the US court system in particular, or even the treatment of Jews by the Nazi government from 1933 to 1945!

It is much simpler. but going into it may cost me a lot of money in lawyers' fees again. The officers of FontShop International are restrained from discussing certain legal issues. This goes back to a certain foundry in Illinois selling fonts but keeping the money due to some small legal clause in the contract. The licensor in Berlin had to pay the original designers, of course, plus lots and lots of lawyers' fees. This is where me mentioning seven digits came from. While i am not an officer of FSI. but simply a shareholder, that said outfit by the lake is very trigger-happy and even has a family member who belongs to the legal profession, making it easy to issue writs and all manner of legal proceedings which usually require at least a reply by another lawyer, in English. And that costs money, lots. Most of the suits are frivolous: there is a typeface called Signata. There is another face called Signa, the 2 look not a bit alike, but a letter was written asking to change that name as it would infringe upon the rights of that foundry by the lake. Which itself has another font named Signal which apparently cannot be confused with Signata, while Signa can.   \n   \nFSI has pursued pirates, people who simply copy FontFonts and offer them under a different name. If someone offered a font named Unite, i wouldn't give a damn, as long as it wasn't a copy of my own FF Unit. The people who couldn't tell one from the other would never spend money on a font anyway.   \n   \nAnd about the designers who now work for a certain...:   \n   \nThey're all people in Munich who used to work for B and seem to have no choice in order to protect their investment. And some are simply blind to what's going on because they don't want to see 50 years of their lives going down the drain.   \n   \nAnd why would a certain gentleman not appear at typo events? Because he cheated and still cheats designers out of their money, and they all know it and let him know that they know.   \n   \nAnd i do know what goes on at B in C, as i do know what has been going on at B in B since the mid-60s. I designed most of their literature, reworked the logo and the corporate design in the 80s, made my first typefaces for them, wrote a book for them and was friends with their designers, managers and technicians here in Berlin.\n\n"

Maybe it will not work, but at least it will put our colleagues in a position where they will need to choose, make a decision: to go with or against Berthold.\"   \nI think we have not to serve for laws and courts, but the judgement's goal is to serve for people, for community.   \nThank You all.   \n   \nSo,   \n   \n   \nDear Sirs,   \n   \nMy name is Igor Shipovsky. I'm a national of Russia.   \n   \nA year ago I started selling my products (digital typefaces) with the MyFonts.com, Inc. (Cambridge, MA, USA). In August, 2003 I received a complaint from another American company - Berthold Types Limited (Chicago, Illinois). Ms Melissa M. Hunt alleged that the names of my web-site and my fonts do infringe their registered trademark CITY.   \nMy web-site is named 'fontcity.ru'. My fonts are named after Russian cities: 'City of Moskva' (Moskva is Moscow in Russian), 'City of Khabarovsk', 'City of Tsaritsyn', etc.   \nMs Hunt alleged that Berthold has registered the TM \"CITY\" and that my fonts names are a 'colorable imitation' of this TM.   \n   \nI strongly oppose this position:   \n- I suppose the word \"city\" is a generic term and is not a particularly strong TM. Moreover, I am a national of Russia and Berthold has no registered TM in Russia.   \n- My fonts are performed in an original graphical manner and the whole line of typefaces has its own unique style. There cannot be any confusion between my fonts and the ones of Berthold company.   \n- Moreover, I use the word \"city\" in its original lexical meaning, in an illustrative and descriptive way only. This word is a part of a single whole concept I create to present my products. I have created my own unique style including typefaces (the character shapes), their names, description texts, music, animation, pictures, color palette and so on. I invented the new word 'FONTCITY' for naming my web-site.   \n- I understand, that the names 'Moskva', 'Khabarovsk', 'Tsaritsyn' and so on mean nothing to the most of people, not only Americans, but Russians too. I can't delete or substitute the word \"city\" without distortion of the names' sense.   \n- I can't name my fonts in Russian because there are certain rules requiring to use the numbers and English letters only for this purpose.   \n   \nAs I know, many companies and persons were urged to change the names of their fonts by Berthold. All of them do not accept the accusations but to avoid possible costs of litigation had to follow instructions from Berthold.   \nHere are the links to their stories:   \n [http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html) - the victims list   \n [http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/hunt-nazaroff.html) - Berthold vs Jamie Nazaroff   \n [http://typographi.ca/000500.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/typographi.ca/000500.php) - Zang-o-fonts: \"The Schoolyard Bullies Never Go Away\"   \n [http://www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/bertholdvsnick.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/www-cgrl.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/bertholdvsnick.html) - Berthold vs Nick Curtis   \n [http://typographi.ca/000682.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/typographi.ca/000682.php) - Berthold vs Cape-Arcona (typographi.ca's forum)   \n [http://typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16157.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/typophile.com/forums/messages/30/16157.html) - typophile.com's forum   \n [http://www.internet-law.ru/forum/index.php?board=10](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212148/http:/www.internet-law.ru/forum/index.php?board=10);action=display;threadid=196;start=0 - internet-law.ru's forum   \n   \nRecently my American partner, the MyFonts.com, Inc. decided to suspend selling my fonts.   \nI believe Berthold's actions constitute unfair competition and abuse of intellectual property rights.

Typographers, type designers, art directors, graphic designers, and publishers are the gatekeepers of type purchase.

We have many alternative suppliers to choose from and are within our rights for any reason to use and recomend (or not recomend) any typeface or vendor.

The average computer user only uses the fonts that come bundled free with other software or operating system. The concept of buying type is pretty much tied to the design and publishing industry. Corporations use what their design/branding consultants recomend. If you look at advertising by type houses, you can see it is tailored to the same crowd. Ads are placed in the design trade mags with lots of sponsorship of organization events like AIGA or TDC. You don't see type ads placed with broad market strategies in Newsweek or Fortune. Adobe most likely places ads for their products with broader market appeal, like Acrobat, in many more venues than its type collection. Type houses are smart buniness men/women for the most part. They know who the gatekeepers are and would not waste money placing ads in unproductive markets.\n\n"

All of the trouble recently on Typophile came about because some posters recommended not buying AG from **Berthold**. This must have been seen as threat enough by Mr. Hunt; in any event it seemed to have ruffled his feathers enough to pay his lawyer and translator to write a stupid letter to Erik Spiekermann. We all know how much lawywers charge by the hour.   \n   \nWell, what if we just **didn't** buy AG from Berthold anymore. It isn't like the world isn't full enough with similar and/or better typefaces anyway... we could just recommend to all of our clients that they should use (insert your favorite Helvetica/Grotesk style here) instead, because, quite frankly, they should not give their money to a man like Mr. Hunt.   \n   \nMost media buyers/clients won't care one way or another, I suspect.

However, their agreement with Linotype only allowed them to sell the designs, not the names themselves. So, Bitstream had to come up with its own naming system. Swiss and Helvetica were therefore the same design, just with different names. This was not illegal or immoral at all. Linotype, and its designers, got paid. Since then, Bitstream has gotten a different license, which also allows them to name the Linotype fonts correctly. (I think that this is all true)   \n   \nHrant could perhaps make legal Poppl revivals. As most of us know, only Typeface names (and their digital outlines) are trademarkable, except in Germany. In Germany, the DESIGN of a font is also protected by a patent, as long as that patent has been officially registered in Germany. These design patents expire after 25 year, and can never be renewed. The names and the outlines can be renewed, though.   \n   \nSo, if Hrant makes new drawings based off of a Poppl design that is over 25 years old, doesn't reference Berthold's actual files, and names it something totally different, he could legally sell that font as a revival. He could also patent the font and its design in Germany, and have the legal protection of thh German courts behind him when Berthold eventually would sue.   \n   \nBut that would be a suit that Berthold would lose, in any court, anywhere.
