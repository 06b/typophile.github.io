  "content": "\"Normandie\" is a new Art Deco / industrial sans font I've designed, named after the 1930's French ocean liner SS Normandie. I currently have nine weights done, though next I'm planning on adding a set of italics as well as perhaps a condensed variant.\n\nSince Normandie is really only designed to work at display sizes, I've also designed a \"companion\", called \"Normandie Text\". I've toned down some of the more eccentric pieces of the original Normandie design, enlarged the x-height, slightly condensed the uppercase and altered the forms slightly to make it less \"geometric\". The hope is that this will read well at text sizes while still acting as a \"little brother\" to Normandie.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032352im_/http:/typophile.com/files/normandie_6145.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032352im_/http:/typophile.com/files/normandie_text_4411.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [normandie.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032352/http:/typophile.com/files/normandie.pdf) | 109.33 KB |\n| [normandie\\_text.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032352/http:/typophile.com/files/normandie_text.pdf) | 92.99 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Any thoughts on either of these? I'd love to get some feedback on the design. I'm starting to think about reworking the design slightly -- the original intent was to do a blend of French Art Deco and American Industrial, though I think the American aspect of the design comes through a lot more than the French (as much as I love Gotham I am a little uncomfortable about how similar the caps is in some cases).\n\nDoes anyone know of some good resources (online or otherwise) for looking at French art deco typography?\n\n"

Also, x and maybe r and s too are a bit wide, while o seems narrow. Poor e seems suffering a bit of overbite ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you both! I've made a few (minor) changes to the letterforms and it seems to be working a bit better...I'll post a new version of both in a week or so.\n\nI will definitely look into the naming...I certainly don't want to invite confusion (my other font up on these boards, \"Roster\", was originally \"Roster Gothic\" until I discovered Mark Simonson's \"Raster Gothic\"). I really wanted to name this font after the ship (I'm a devoted ocean liner nerd) but I'll run through some other possible names, too. Perhaps \"Pugnet\" after the ship's first captain, or \"Villar\" after Henri Villar, the Normandie's purser who was very popular with passengers.\n\nAnyways, I'll hopefully post a new version soon with some fixes. If anybody else has recommendations let me know!\n\n"
