      "content": "Good find Kevin for the 1944 letterhead. Presumably this was an earlier version and almost certainly engraved. The scale is small, but from what I can see, it is a more flowing rendition. The newer \\_B\\_ is clunky compared to the earlier one. The bottom loop of \\_B\\_ in the earlier version is in a classic Fette Gotisch style, and its top is more elegant. The top of \\_l\\_ is graceful rather than clunky. \\_T\\_ is different, the later version is more flourished, and looks good except for the confusion in the center.  \nBTW I went through my image collection of several hundred blackletter character sets and found nothing that would be worth using as a single source for editing.  \nI agree that its best to re-letter the words and digitize the results. It's up to you whether you want to recreate the later or earlier version, or a hybrid with their best features.  \nDon\n\n"
