Small case and italic designed, some italics are being drawn roughly, some other are (for now) only oblique - that will change however, caps and numerals still to come.\n\nWould be great to have some c&c on it - thank you in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414220412im_/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen_062_600_5731.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [specimen\\_06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414220412/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen_06.pdf) | 226.72 KB |\n| [specimen\\_07.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414220412/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen_07.pdf) | 277.02 KB |\n\n",

The s is a bit bothersome; the lower terminal looks a little weak and the letter is falling backwards.\n\nI think that the straight parts in a, e, d, b—which are working well—could be applied to p, g, q.\n\nI'm not a fan of the i, j curls; I don't think they disrupt the flow of the glyphs.\n\n-Eric MacLeod\n\n"
