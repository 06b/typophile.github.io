As I said, I'm not very experienced in the use of type (not alot was required thoughout my education in design). I'm a fan of swiss page layout and design. Do you have any reading suggestions?\n\n"

I   \nvery much enjoyed the results (very readable with a   \ntouch of character) and have received complements   \nfrom some of the few firms who received it thus far.   \nthe availability of text figures in the standard font (ie,   \nno search&replace for numerals) and well proportioned   \nsmall caps is a big part of the appeal for me.\n\n"
