      "content": "It sure seems to be a font all right, but the odds are high that it was (or might has well have been) a one off creation. Our FAQ talks about how easily and cheaply hand-printed fonts can be made. It doesn't look familiar to me, which isn't surprising considering how common these fonts are. [Part 11 of my Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20141226010910/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html) is where I would have shown this if I collected it, but there are too many of this kind for me to have more than a sampling. I don't think it's one of the ClickArt 300 Handwritten fonts collection, which I do have shown.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
