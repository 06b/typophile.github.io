  "content": "This is a very interesting font I came across and I have been struggling for hours now to find out what it is. Its part of the logo for the BCN pels Drets human, the Barcelona human rights council, a government organization. Does anyone know who designed this font or identity? It reminds me of Klavika, but of course it is not. Thanks very much.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n BetaSemi \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [akira1975](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091032/http:/typophile.com/user/4504 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 10.03.45 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091032/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-07-14%20at%2010.03.45%20PM.png) | 173.23 KB |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-07-14 at 10.04.56 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091032/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-07-14%20at%2010.04.56%20PM.png) | 77.3 KB |\n\n",
