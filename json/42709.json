  "content": "(I am not a lawyer, the following is not legal advice.)\n\nRecently on the OpenType mailing list, the topic of legal restrictions on type designs and font programs came up again; someone said that there is an \"absence of protection for the shapes\" and in my humble opinion this is an old chestnut :-)\n\nThere is certainly no absence of restriction for the shapes! :-)\n\nTypeface designs are subject to \"design patent\" restrictions in the USA, not copyright restrictions, because the US government understands them to be functional works rather than artistic ones. These patents are not granted automatically like copyright now is, but must be registered (like a 'regular' \"utility patent\") and run for 14 years.\n\nIn the UK the shapes are subject to \"design rights\" which can work like copyright in that they are granted automatically, and like patents in that they can be registered. The unregistered term is 5  \nyears but a type designer can register their designs for periods of 5 years up to 5 times. There are also EU Design Rights (cf the Microsoft/Linotype spat over Segoe/Frutiger) which work similarly across the EU.\n\nSo the term of restriction in the UK and EU is 5 years automatically and up to 25 years, and 14 in the USA.\n\nBut I don't know about other countries (eg, Canada) but I hope this post is enough to get people interested to find out what the deal is in your country, and post your findings here if you turn anything up - or if you think I'm mistaken :-)\n\nBest,  \nDave\n\n",

      "content": "Actually, this thread should be titled \"Legal Protections for Type Designs.\"\n\nThe problem with Design Patents is that (except perhaps in the UK) one must apply for them, and this may take considerable time and funding. Also (and my understanding here is limited), I do not think that US Design Patents—as opposed to the European ones—are regularly issued for typefaces.\n\nIf I write a book, or even an essay on typeface design, this content is protected automatically. As the author, the work is my own, and protected by copyright, at least for a certain amount of time. If someone else reads my book or essay, and then republishes it without my consent, this is a violation of my copyright and I can try to collect damages.\n\nBut if I draw letterforms (except, perhaps in the UK, where you state that there may be an automatic protection) these are not automatically protected. If someone else (outside of the UK) sees them and then redraws them closely himself, this is not seen as a violation of my creation, and I may not collect damages.\n\nIf I register my shapes with relevant offices, then I may be able to protect my work more effectively. But I do not appreciate that my letters are protectable to a lesser degree than the words I write. Especially because I hope that I can create type much better than I can write about it.\n\nNote that we are just talking about shapes here, right? This could apply to letters written with a brush or pen on paper. Fortunately for typeface designers, their letters most often enter the world in fonts. Since fonts are seen in certain jurisdictions as literary works (long story), they are protected by copyright. If someone edits my font without my permission, that is a copyright violation, and I could go about it the same as I could were someone to repurpose my book or essay.\n\n"

I should have waited to fact check everything and link it up before posting, thanks Uli for bringing this forward :-) My apologies.\n\nUSA: \" [Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of 14 years from the date of grant.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/design/index.html)\" and [the first ever design patent](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=D1) was for a typeface. I've not yet found out how much it costs.\n\nEU: [\"Community Designs\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/oami.europa.eu/en/design/faq/faq01.htm#600) are either unregistered, which means automatic (like copyright) and those last 3 years (although they only started on 12th December 2001) or they are registered (like patents) which \"confers on the design great certainty should infringement occur\" and last 5 years from the filing date but can be renewed in blocks of five years up to a maximum of 25 years. The cost is variable because registrations can be done in batches but a single design for immediate publication appears to cost €350 - [there is a cost calculator webpage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/oami.europa.eu/en/design/fees.htm) to play with.\n\nUK: [the copyright law has a section specifically for typefaces that gives them a 25 year copyright term](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880048_en_3#pt1-ch3-pb7), and that is the [same length as for \"typographical arrangements\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/ukpga_19880048_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb4-l1g15) (book/magazine/etc layouts). And this is the same length of the maximum term for UK [\"registered designs\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&itemId=1073791345&r.l1=1073858796&r.l3=1073940183&r.t=RESOURCES&r.i=1073791344&r.l2=1073859014&r.s=e) which, like EU RCD, last 5 years and can be renewed 5 times - though it seems redundant. [Registrations cost £60 but may be done in batches where the rest cost £40.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/www.ipo.gov.uk/design/d-applying/d-costtime.htm) You can reduce this to £40/£20 if you wait a year between registering the design and publishing it.\n\n@Dan: If these laws are protections or restrictions is matter of perspective, and we consider each other's terms to be biased against our own views. I welcome you suggestions for neutral terms :-)\n\nThe reason the lettershapes are restricted differently to the words we write are because they are fundementally different things. The terms of copyright vary according to different kinds of things, and many things are not subject to copyright because they are functional; letter shapes are functional - we use them to read. Art, like a painting or a text, isn't used to do something.\n\nAnd yes, this is talking about purely shapes, which may be expressed in ink brushed on to paper, engraved in metal, shaped in potato, as dots of ink lazered on to paper. All of those expressions are considered as the type design directly. However, when a program describes the shapes, that program is copyright, like any other program. That we create our PostScript programs with GUIs for our convenience, may fool us into thinking that they are not programs, but they are programs whic output dots of ink on paper or dots of light on screens.\n\n"

      "content": "Btw, John Hudson wrote on the OpenType list, reposted here with permission:\n\nI'm very familiar with the legal status of type design as intellectual property in US patent and copyright law. Yes, there is design patent protection, but since no case involving design patent protection for typeface design has ever come to trial there is no test of the solidity of the protection. Design patent protection would presumably have figured in the Adobe vs SSi case if it had gone to trial, but SSi settled following the summary judgement on the \\*computer program copyright\\* issue. This is an example of the phenomemon to which I referred: software copyright protection has become the first line of defence, even though the primary value of the font -- what people are interesting in copying -- is the distinctive design, the content of the font.\n\nThe only font developers I know who file for design patent protection for typefaces are large corporations like Adobe (regularly) and Microsoft (occasionally), i.e. people with internal legal departments or external lawyers to do the filing for them. I don't know any small foundries who pursue this protection, and no individual type designers. It is expensive and it is a hassle. One of the arguments in favour of copyright protection vs patent protection is that the former is better suited to protecting the work of an individual creator, including protecting him or her against corporate predation.\n\nIt is possible to register typefaces in Canada as industrial designs for a limited period (I can't remember how long off hand, possibly 15 years). This is similar to the US design patent protection. I'm not sure, however, whether Canadian law specifically excludes typeface designs from copyright protection, as US law does. As far as I know, it has never been argued in court, so remains an open question (and likely one that no one is in any hurry to put to the test, especially after the outcome of Eltra vs Ringer).\n\nMy basic point was that protection of the font as software is effectively seen as the first line of defence of the content of the font, the design. Hence concerns about protection of the design play a role in determining the attitude of font developers to modification licenses.\n\n"

If a big company issues a prewar type family without extra weights, and botches the digital conversion later so that you really have a crappy product not in any way matching the design potential and beauty of the fonts...that to me is a surrender of the company's duty to the public so egregious that smarter type designers should be free to wade in and correct everything, so the public can at last use this typeface fully. We had a thread the other day about one such family, so I don't need to mention examples. And there are plenty of them.\n\nFlorian, thanks for that beautifully uttered mp3 you posted.

In cases where the designs were licensed to us, I belive that it would also have been possible for the designers to register for these patents themselves, although I doubt that any wanted to assume this burden when we gladly did the work for them. I'm sure that other European foundries do similarly as well.\n\nIn my opinion, when a company licenses a typeface from its designer, it has a duty to protect it in any way that it can. One of the benefits of licensing through a foundry is that many foundries do actively protect their typefaces, and make sure that unlicensed copies are removed from websites, etc. Sure, any independent designer can do this on his own as well, but it takes a lot of time and effort.\n\n"

Two! lol\n\nI'm also in disagreement with your proposed purpose of copyright, because it merges innovation with authorship. Copyright is about authorship, not innovation - that is what patents are for. Copyright is not an \"attempt to strike a balance\" either - [a common misconception.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308044058/http:/www.gnu.org/philosophy/misinterpreting-copyright.html)\n\nI hope you'll consider not using the term \"intellectual property\" because it invites confusion like this, because it implies that copyright, trademark and patent laws and others have something meaningful in common. All they have in common is that they are government-granted monopolies, but everything else about them differs - their origins, purposes, terms... every detail! :-) Additionally it carries the assumption that these things are akin to physical property, which invites nonsensical thinking like that they can be \"stolen.\"\n\nRegarding the UN Declaration of Human Rights quote, I understand the \"protection of the moral and material interests\" to concern accurate attribution. Plagiarism is often conflated with copyright infringement since both are colloquially called \"copying\" :-)\n\n"
