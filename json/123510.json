So it's necessary to use imagination to see the shapes of characters not included in the presentation.  \nI considered the idea of making a digital version. I tracked down the patent. Despite the poor quality of the patent image -- bureaucratic masterminds in the Patent Office made crappy quality microfilm of the patent applications and trashed the originals so that this was all that was available for the recent digitization of patent records -- it at least shows the general outlines of the characters not included in the specimen Book. I extracted the full character set and rearranged the letters into shorter lines at are easier to assess.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414061631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SamsomScriptIhlenburgD18735_1888SM_5621.jpg)\n  \nNo further work done on the project.  \nDon\n\n"

See the excellent treatment of his Centennial Script by Rebecca Alaccari for Canada Type [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/centennial-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414061631/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/centennial-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/centennial-script/\") The original metal type of these scripts was extremely fragile and printed text other than the ones in the Specimen Book often show broken, bent or missing connecting lines. It is only with the arrival of digital type that they can be widely used.  \nDon\n\n"
