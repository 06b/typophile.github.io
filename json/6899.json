Cleaner, more regularized digitizations include [ITC Golden](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225233/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/golden-type-ef/golden-type-original/testdrive.html) and [Nicolas Jenson](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225233/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/nicolas-jenson-sg/regular/testdrive.html) from Spiece.   \n   \nFor the last one, try something from Dan Solo. [Excelsis](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225233/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/excelsis/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Best+5c.+cigar) is a decent match, but you might be able to get even closer.   \n   \nThe first one has me stumped. It resembles [Brittanic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225233/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/britannic/medium/testdrive.html?s=DROP+ONE+CENT+IN+THE+SLOT&p=36), but is obviously funkier. G'luck!\n\n"
