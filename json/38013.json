On my PC control + alt + shift changes the arrow to the measuring tool while you hold it down. The only problem with that is that it will sometimes switch the keyboard to another language, as alt + shift changes the keyboard to another language on a PC. As you are on a Mac it's probably a bit different.\n\n"

Open your font, open the Edit Macro panel, put this small program there and click on the Run Macro button.\n\nfl.font.measurement = 400  \nfl.UpdateFont()\n\nThese two strings will set the Measurement line for the current font to 400 units.\n\nRegards,  \nJohnych\n\n"
