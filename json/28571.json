I have all sorts of horrible problems caused by trying to figure out what fonts I need, and what fonts are just worthless junk that some program installed somewhere it shouldn’t have.\n\n"

It’s more annoying when other fonts get dumped into the system fonts directory by applications, as those fonts sometimes have screwed up names that Indesign and Illustrator will jump to when I’m typing in font names.\n\nIt would be nice if Adobe would add an option to just not display any system fonts inside of their apps. FontExplorer X has no trouble picking out the system fonts, so maybe if I ask nicely I might be able to get them to make a nice fix for me.\n\n"
