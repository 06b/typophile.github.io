  "content": "I recently purchased a few weights of Mark Jamra's Expo Serif:\n\n[http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font\\_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019145005/http:/www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09 \"http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font\\_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09\")\n\nNot only am I exceedingly impressed with this font family, or rather, full type system, but I also received a lovely letterpress broadside in the mail.\n\nAll in all it was an excellent customer experience. Among other things, I had a question and it was answered promptly by Mr. Jamra himself. Their prices are quite reasonable, too.\n\nCheers,\n\nChristian.\n\n",
