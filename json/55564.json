  "content": "Hi Typophilian Mates\n\nI just done a new fontface design.. called \"Serifada\" based on concept of Chilean Hitory.. following some aesthetics and synesthetic asociations. Although this can be clasified like display that hard serif and broken shapes help to make a better readable text. I don't an expert but I done some test and run so well on small sizes.\n\nI hope get your opinions and critiques\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414142153im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Serifada_1st-WIP-show_3725.png)\n\nregards..!!  \n=)  \nPedro [PeGGO]\n\nNOTE: The old name \"Politica\" belong to Ale Paul font, an now my design name has been changed by \"Politic\"\n\n",
