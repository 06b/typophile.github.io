Thank you for finding the appropriate declarations.\n\nI am looking for a relatively square and monoline sans serif. \"Armchair Modern\" is a good suggestion (thank you!), as it seems to be a stylized take on Eurostyle. \"Armchair Modern D Guage\" is about the right weight... if only it were available in oblique.\n\nPerhaps I can be more specific by saying that I am looking for a font that is a more stylized/squared version of \"Eurostyle Black Oblique.\"\n\nThank you for your help and suggestions.\n\n"

Purista Bold Italic is close (I'll have to overlook your snarkiness for that suggestion!).\n\nMy only concern with Purista is that the lower case \"a\" is single-storey (see, I'll get the terminology correct eventually). I know it may seem like I'm obsessing, but the logo will be applied to roadside signage. Since the name includes the letters \"oa\" I need a lot of contrast between those shapes.\n\nI figure if there is any community wherein an obsession over finding the right typeface will be tolerated, it must be this one!\n\n"
