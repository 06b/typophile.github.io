  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m trying to make the move form drawing glyphs in Illustrator to Fontlab, but I’m having problems doing things in Foontlab that I would do in Illustrator. I’m drawing the Oslash glyph I wanted to be able to center the slash on top of the O and then rotate it to make the glyph, is it possible to center the slash down the middle of the “O”. I know I can center the glyph in the window, but is it possible the align a shape to that glyph.\n\nHope this make sense I someone can help.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612045054/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_0.gif) | 4.83 KB |\n\n [‹ Best way to place the points](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612045054/http:/typophile.com/node/34474 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [IPA Script Tag? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612045054/http:/typophile.com/node/34511 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
