[Emigre](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Emigre) is a publisher, [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MyFonts) is a retailer. [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) is a publisher, [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop) is a retailer.\n\nIf Hrant’s question is about publishers (AKA foundries) then there are very few that _don’t_ require exclusivity. There are always exceptions like ITC Franklin (an agreement between two publishers) and Eidetic Neo (a revision of an existing typeface submitted to another foundry).\n\nIf Hrant’s question is about retailers (AKA resellers), there are very few that _do_ require exclusivity. Of course, some, like [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop) and [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer) do offer extra promotion or a special contract in exchange for exclusivity.\n\nHybrid libraries include [T-26](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/T-26) and [Umbrella](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Umbrella) (a [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer) label) which include original fonts but also those that are published by other foundries.\n\n"

Most of our [foundries](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326045853/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/foundry/) are available elsewhere, but we do have a few exclusive arrangements with foundries like OurType, Psy/Ops, ARS Type, Type-Ø-Tones, Dalton Maag, Gestalten, Fontsmith, and B&P, with more on the way.\n\n"
