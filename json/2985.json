  "content": "hi.   \ni've been ask to design a bitmap font for a unik device. the problem is that each pixel in that device is not exactly the size of a regular computer-screen pixel: each pixel is 0.33mm, and there should be a 0.03mm spacing between each pixel! i find this quite weird, because a regular pixel size is 0.36 mm. is that even possible to generate this kind of font?   \n   \nthanks\n\n",

      "content": "There is no \"regular pixel size\".   \n   \nBut bitmap displays can vary in different ways, like:   \n- Be formed of non-square pixels (even triangles and such).   \n- Have gaps between pixels.   \n- Use grays instead of just b&w.   \n   \nIn your case the gap is probably something inherent to the device, an area you can neither turn on or off. Probably you just need to design a regular bitmap font, and the gaps will just happen anyway. Because otherwise the device would need 12 times more resolution (to allow you to address the gap).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
