      "content": "Nice concept!\n\nI think b d g p q work very well and show that this thing has potential.\n\nThe m is also a bit tricky, the w is better but needs some weight taken out in the centre (maybe assymmetrical?). Same for the x, and also the k (maybe just move the diagonals away).\n\nThe h needs a lacuna, either on top or at the bottom of the joint (which would be less conventional and fitt better, I assume).\n\nThe o seems a bit too heavy, maybe it could do with an opening (at the botom or left) or at least a lacuna. You have done the right thing with the y there.\n\nThe e is much better than the a.\n\n"

      "content": "wow, so sorry I never got back to this one. Thanks for the input Tim, those are some very good suggestions. I've changed the a since then. The m is tricky indeed. Some reason m always seems to be my weakest character. I'm somewhat rusty on my typography terms, I have an idea but could you explain what \"lacuna\" means? no reasonable google results were found.\n\n"
