I've never seen it before and would like to know more about it. Any digital versions? A quick Google search didn't turn up anything.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419162258im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SpikeGothic_4601.JPG)\n\n",

Even though you already know the name you may find someone who can give you more on the history of the font. There are some metal guys who read that forum and they have good resources to research.\n\n"
