I wasn't working with any grants or anything, and properly prepared end-grain maple can be expensive / hard to come by / slow to cut.\n\nI have been seeing more and more student projects like my own since then, many of them using lasers. The laser method seems very nice, but depending on the machine used, and under which settings, you will often get a slight amount of stair-stepping due to limited resolution. It can also char up the shoulder (again, depending on the machine), which can be tricky if you don't like the idea of getting soot in your ink.\n\nIt's still in very early stages (in fact, it was only made public last week), but I recently started a blog to report on such things related to wood type: [Woodtyper.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120610164612/http:/www.woodtyper.com/)\n\nI have some other ideas I'd like to explore about how to most easily and efficiently produce large printing type with modern machinery, and I'll surely be discussing them there in the future. I'll also be reporting on projects being done by other people, as well as events, books, etc.\n\nIf you're going to be at TypeCon next week, there will be a presentation by Craig Malmrose about his experiments in making wood type. If not, I believe we'll be doing a joint report on his work later on Woodtyper.\n\nOut of curiosity, are you considering cutting some type yourself?\n\n"
