I am looking for anything from specific fonts, to popular styles, to general trends, to examples of work printed in Romania. Or any designers, publishers, websites, books, etc. that you feel are representative of the culture.\n\nHistorical and contemporary examples are both appreciated.\n\nI realize this a very broad question, I am just looking for ideas to get me started. I am designing a piece where I want include some allusions to Romanian culture.\n\n",
