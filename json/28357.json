  "content": "Hi SF Typophiles,\n\nI'm at the end of the development process for Beorcana, my calligraphic sans text and display family (see [www.beorcana.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162638/http:/www.beorcana.com/ \"www.beorcana.com\")). The fonts, in OpenType, PostScript and TrueType, should be available at [www.fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162638/http:/www.fonts.com/ \"www.fonts.com\") sometime near the end of October. Meanwhile I'm preparing to celebrate. Won't you join me?\n\nSunday October 8 I've got a beautiful space reserved for the afternoon/evening, and will have a keepsake type specimen poster available to guests, as well as refreshments and music. This event is co-hosted by Richard Schwarzenberger, who will be celebrating the publication of his first book of fiction, which is also typeset in Beorcana. Copies of the book will also be available.\n\nIf you're interested in joining us, or if you're just interested in a small showing of the typeface, please contact me through the typophile contact form, give me your mailing address, and I'll send you an invitation/announcement.\n\nI'm very excited to finish this project and present it to you; It's been 14 years in the making. I hope you can attend.\n\nCarl\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [beorctease.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162638/http:/typophile.com/files/beorctease.jpg) | 69.14 KB |\n\n",

The caps for one are a refreshing surprise, and the lc holds its lustre all the way to the darkest weight - no mean feat. Warm congrats, which I would actually be tempted to deliver in person during your event, except I'll be in Yerevan that weekend. Oh, and I hope we won't have to wait until 2020 for your next tour de force! :-)\n\nhhp\n\n"

During the day, someone must have enjoyed watching Blue Angels scream around over the various boats in the bay; I don't care for the Blue Angels myself.\n\nTwo of my sisters, several co-workers from Monotype, and several Bay Area typophiles came (among others), and there was a nice mix of literary, garden, swimming, foodie and type people in attendance. Turns out there were 4 new babies there, and I realized they were all my friend's babies (Delve and Jennifer brought flame-haired Donovan). We're getting them started early. ;)\n\nI don't have a lot of my own photos as my camera is useless in any light but full daylight, but if I get some from others I'll post them. I think Zara took some good moonrise shots.\n\nMaybe there will be more Bay Area type events....\n\n"
