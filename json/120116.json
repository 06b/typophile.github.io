      "content": "Thanks Kevin for the ATF Typoscript match.  \nNote that the alphabet in Levien's version has only 23 capital letters and 11 lower case. No numbers.  \nA complete alphabet of the capitals can be found in Ralph Smith's Formal Script, a math symbols font for LaTex, at [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/rsfs](http://web.archive.org/web/20141005160335/http:/www.ctan.org/pkg/rsfs \"http://www.ctan.org/pkg/rsfs\") The files are type1, a format where you need to put the .pfb and .pfm files in the same folder to view the font. Best practice is to repackage it in an .otf wrapper. This is a fairly coarse version, based on a smaller point size.  \nShelly script is indeed a fairly good substitute. Most readers would not notice the differences such as the closed loop where the upper and lower stokes come together on \\_B\\_, \\_k\\_ and other letters, rather than the open loop in Typo Script as clearly shown in Levin's digitization.  \nDon\n\n"
