JY Alia marks its return to releasing retail fonts.\n\nInitially in four variants only, with extra weights, more complex OpenType versions and a second subfamily to emerge in 2009, JY Alia is described by its designer, Jack Yan, as a workhorse serif typeface, based on an aldine model.\n\nIt is meant to complement his 1994–5 release, JY Ætna, which was based around the original Bembo design. JY Ætna was a successful family for the foundry and helped establish its reputation as a source of dependable, traditional designs.\n\n‘The problem with JY Ætna, as I saw it, was that it wasn’t robust enough for text usage,’ says Mr Yan.\n\nHe sees JY Alia, which is stronger but still approachable as a design, as an alternative for other workhorse typeface families such as Adobe Garamond or Monotype Bembo.\n\nIn technical aspects, JY Alia has between 3,200 and 3,300 kerning pairs and a full complement of eastern European and extended Latin characters in its OpenType and TrueType versions.\n\nMr Yan cites both his own JY Ætna, based on designs by Francesco Griffo and Giovantonio Tagliente, and Plantin, by Robert Granjon, as his inspirations. However, he says JY Alia does not slavishly follow any historical model and merely has an aldine skeleton.\n\nThe name originates from a role once played by American actress Alicia Witt.\n\nA PDF specimen for JY Alia can be downloaded from the JY&A Fonts website, currently being revamped, at [http://jyanet.com/fonts/font145.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111335/http:/jyanet.com/fonts/font145.htm).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111335im_/http:/typophile.com/files/alia-homepage_6107.gif)\n\n",
