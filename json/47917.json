  "content": "Hello, everyone! I've just finished a blitzkrieg of digitization, completing two ASCII character sets in two weeks. The result is Solvejg (\"soul-veyg\", for the Scandinavianly-impaired). I welcome critique, especially considering how fast I blazed through the production. Attached is a PDF sample. I hope you enjoy it...even the song lyrics I typed in at the end because they were stuck in my head.\n\nUPDATED 4 May 09. New PDF added (NewSolvejgText.pdf); new post written below.\n\nSlightly RE-UPDATED 7 May 09. After printing out the sample for myself I decided to make a few small changes. Flattened the bottom of the esses some, and made the roman t less cartoony. Replaced previous sample with SolvejgTextNew.pdf.\n\nUPDATED AGAIN 2 May 10. And about time: I finally finished Solvejg Black; I'm hoping to have this ready for distribution within the next few weeks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [SolvejgSampler.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/SolvejgSampler.pdf) | 61.61 KB |\n| [SolvejgSampler.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/SolvejgSampler_0.pdf) | 61.61 KB |\n| [sibilants sibilants.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/sibilants%20sibilants.pdf) | 14.28 KB |\n| [SolvejgTextNew.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/SolvejgTextNew.pdf) | 70.37 KB |\n| [SolvejgInJuly.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/SolvejgInJuly.pdf) | 297.3 KB |\n| [SolvejgDecember.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/SolvejgDecember_0.pdf) | 197.85 KB |\n| [NewlyMinted.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/NewlyMinted.pdf) | 18.65 KB |\n| [SolvejgInMay.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/SolvejgInMay.pdf) | 400.3 KB |\n| [Hamlet.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415031551/http:/typophile.com/files/Hamlet.pdf) | 253.38 KB |\n\n",

In the overall context, the change you've made is infinitesimal and barely perceptible. look at that gif and how heavy the 2 i's look on either side.\n\nThe top and bottom of s are also the lightest features, tapering off to 'hairline' thickness where everything else has either a flared stroke terminal or a horizontal feature. So the s looks like it is too short/small, and it also is lighter overall than the others. This is an example of the trickery necessary to get straight, flaring strokes to look visually the same weight as bowls. They can't all be the same weight in the middle.\n\nThe s is also one of the narrowest shapes in the lot, making it look that much smaller. Your r has this problem too, but it also has a standard flaring vertical stem. In any size less than display, I could see the r turning into an i.\n\nThe wide range of widths or proportions can be toyed with in display fonts, but you'll find as you try to use this, that text faces have a narrower range of proportion that still allows reading to occur smoothly.\n\nYou haven't said what this design is intended for. It's very interesting, as is your other work, but did you have a brief or purpose in mind?\n\nIn overall style, I think some things need to be more related: the exaggerated eyes of g, high waist of k, narrow s and r and some of the tapers lean in a comical, display direction. But the eyes of a and e, which are central shapes to a Latin design, are more conventional and sensible, as are the simple, classic proportions of h, p, o, i, B and W. So there's a dilemma: Make it all more goofy, or all more sensible and conventional? A brief might help with this.\n\n"

That's somewhat a poor way to approach the font, and it's resulted in some far-reaching changes in the past. In my sketches of Newt, the ascenders are impractically high. Most of the fonts I've designed are serif text faces, and such is the case with both the other ones I've put up here (Cyril and Newt), so I've never really had the problem of unclear purpose before.\n\nI think I want to make Solvejg usable for somewhat long text. I'm realizing that it might be a good idea to make a display version of it and a milder text version. But, I think I will make the g, k, s, and r as you mentioned work better with the (more \"sensible\") rest of the font. However, I'm afraid if I normalize them too much I'll lose character. I guess I'll save the most flamboyant ideas for the display version.\n\nThanks--it helped to get clearer about Solvejg's purpose.\n\n"

It would be a fair amount of more work, but I also have some time (for once), so I might be able to deal with making a new weight. I suppose I could cook up a quick sample of something bold sometime soon and see how it looks and post it here.\n\nIs there anything in particular about a and y that you don't like?\n\nI can sense a bit of a disconnect between the roman and the italic, too, but I'm at a similar place--I don't know if there's any way to fix it, especially without losing the character that the italic has taken on, which, it sounds like we agree, is pretty nice. When I post again I'll put up some text with roman and italics mixed for assessing how well they collaborate.\n\nThanks for the vote of confidence on the bold italic.

      "content": "Hi again everyone!\n\nWhat a long design process. I think I'm finally just about done with the pixel pushing. Here, in SolvejgInMay.pdf at the top, is the latest in my efforts to make Solvejg happen. A new weight, and a slight refiguring of the old Display weight to make it finer and more Displayey. I'm anxious to get this font <cite>finished</cite>, but I do want some eyes besides mine to see it before I start negotiations, so I turn to you, Typophiles. How do you like it? Is there stuff that I should fix? Do you want the old bold weight to still be available? Let me know any thoughts you have.\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit: Also, I'm not sure what happened to the math symbols in the Text Italic. I'll fix that at some point. The Display Italic might have the same issue but I didn't put its math symbols in the sample originally because they were the same as the Roman's.\n\n"

      "content": "The roman lowercase “g” doesn’t work for me at all, but the cursive version is lovely. Reminds me a lot of Beorcana.\n\nBy the way, the name Solvejg is usually written with an i (Solveig). Solvejg is so uncommon, at least to me, that I first mistook it for a typo. I had to look up the phone directory, which returned nine hits in Norway (“Solveig” returned 17705). It’s a lovely name nevertheless. Makes me think of blonde farmergirls amongst deep fjords and majestic mountains. The English translation would be something like “a sunny road”.\n\n"

Maybe italic /b/p/h/ too.\n\nThat narrow roman /s/ might need more spacious sidebearings (see \"enthusiastic\").\n\nAre your /e/s a touch light?\n\n"

But as you point out, it's pretty rare... and I also feel like buyers would have a hard time pronouncing \"Solvejg\", which might be important.\n\nEliason, I'll take a look at the characters you've suggested. Frode frank, what sort of /g/ do you think would be better? One with a taller top eye?\n\n"

      "content": "Huh. I think the (Roman) \"g\" is beautiful, and central to the charming feel of the font. I'd definitely keep that.\n\nReally nice work! Great to see you're still working on it. The Roman makes me want to use it for a children's book with great illustrations. I'm not quite as convinced about the angularity and heightened contrast of the Italic (especially in the \"g\" actually), it's a strange way of contrasting with the Roman, but not sure what to suggest. :-\\\n\nA couple of details:  \n- I agree with Craig about making the \"s\" a bit looser, so it doesn't get swallowed up too much.  \n- Overall, the spacing seems not bad but is still rather uneven.  \n- I also wonder about the Roman \"e\" – maybe it's a bit deflated/lazy/soft too (compared to the angularity of the \"a\")? But maybe there's something I'm not getting.  \n- And your c-cedilla isn't merged (white overlap visible).\n\nKeep it up! Looking forward to this.\n\n"
