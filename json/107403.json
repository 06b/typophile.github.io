  "content": "I am trying to fond a good pair for Chaparral Pro, currently I combined it with Brandon Grotesque on my site, but I am far from happy. I am thinking about Prenton or Soleil. Chaparral and Prenton seem to have similar characteristics (look at lowercase a, double story g, etc.) but I am just not sure whether their personalities clash a bit? Soleil's geometric forms seem to play well with Chapparal Pro (I don't want to use Proxima Nova), but I am not sure this combo is exactly what I am looking for. I want to have something professional, yet playful.  \nBelow are examples of both combos.\n\nAny thoughts on these two, or you have some other ideas?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328051910im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ChaparralPro-Prenton_4458.jpg)\n\n",
