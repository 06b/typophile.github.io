These books differ from this model in that they but feature independent firms whose fonts, like their names, are unique. You will discover such foundries as [Letterror](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Letterror), [PSY/OPS](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PSY/OPS), and [Test Pilot Collective](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Test%20Pilot%20Collective), alongside [P22 Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22%20Type%20Foundry), [Typeco](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typeco), [Font Diner](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Diner) and [Astigmatic One Eye](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Astigmatic%20One%20Eye) Typographic Institute. The type styles range from the best of [Matthew Carter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Matthew%20Carter)’s classic designs to the latest irreverence of [Chank Diesel](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Chank%20Diesel). Designers searching for unique typefaces will find what they are looking for, whether historical revivals or futuristic techno faces.\n\n_Indie Fonts_ brings together 18 independent font foundries from around the world creating an invaluable resource of over 2000 fonts for designers, art directors and typographers.\n\nThis book is divided up by foundry so that the user can get a feel for the work produced by each group. This also makes it convenient to order fonts directly from their source. There is a visual font index provided in the front for quick scanning and a fully cross referenced index in the back containing font names, designers, and original designers.\n\nContributing foundries include [Altered Ego](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Altered%20Ego), [Astigmatic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Astigmatic), [Carter & Cone](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Carter%20%2526%20Cone), [Chank](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Chank), [Font Diner](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Diner), [fontBoy](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/fontBoy), [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fountain), [GarageFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/GarageFonts), [International House of Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/IHOF), [LettError](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/LettError), [P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22), [Psy/Ops](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Psy/Ops), [SynFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/SynFonts), [Test Pilot Collective](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Test%20Pilot%20Collective), [Typebox](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typebox), [Typeco](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typeco), [Typodermic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typodermic), and [Typotheque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053645/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typotheque).\n\nAccompanying this book is a Bonus Fonts CD-ROM that contains 33 indie fonts on an unlocked disc located in a sealed package in the back of this book.
