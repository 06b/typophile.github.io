  "content": "I just got word yesterday that \"Behind the Typeface: Cooper Black\" was one of the victims of YouTube's purge of 100,000 videos this week that allegedly violate Viacom's copyrights. (Viacom owns VH1, which owns \"Behind the Music,\" which my movie parodies.) When you're dealing with a number like 100,000, it's awfully difficult to evaluate each one on its merits. Furthermore, it's a privilege -- not a right -- to be on YouTube, so getting kicked off isn't something that I can get that self-righteous about. They don't want to be sued, and I can't really blame them, though I do think they could have taken a better stand than they did.\n\nHowever, as an indirect target of Viacom's bullying, you'd better believe that I am extremely upset that Viacom doesn't recognize the fair use doctrine of the U.S. Copyright Act. This is one more case of a giant corporation throwing its weight around just because it can, and I'm not willing to be a victim of it.\n\nSo I'm taking my case to the street. With any luck, news will spread and Viacom will get the bad press it so richly deserves.\n\nMany thanks to that other company that begins with V for its support. You guys are the best.\n\n",

(Also note his excellent and unorthodox use of PowerPoint.) The talk is a few years old but I'm sure you'll agree the issue is still alive today.\n\nThe EFF video on the topic specifically mentions parody as an example of fair use. This is worth fighting for! Time for me to send some $ to the EFF.\n\nBTW Chesh, Behind the Typeface is a great video and I enjoyed it very much. I think of it every time I see Cooper Black in the wild.\n\ns'marks\n\n"

The takedown notices were a bargaining tactic by Viacom in their negotiations to get licensing fees out of Google.

Citing the EFF has helped protect forum sites and blogs from libel claims. Some people (possibly they're greedy, possibly they're just whiners) still believe that a forum or blog site is accountable for comments and statements made by visitors and contributors. The EFF demonstrates this is not the case and that blogs and forums cannot be treated like editorial publications that have centralized control of what gets \"published.\"\n\nOf course I'm not talking about any specific incident that I'm aware of, but to the general environment blogs and user-generated sites operate in.\n\n"

Copyright Heroes, on the other hand, stick to their posts. Also, the Damage in this potential case, is much more substantial, and the party responsible for this damage by obviously overzealously pursuing protection, has lots of $$$.
