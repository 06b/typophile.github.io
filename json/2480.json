But it really is quite hilarious that it has only started being a priority at this point.   \n   \nHow do the rest of you approach keywording your typefaces? Do you supply appropriate metadata like keywords, categories, descriptive text, etc. when you send typefaces off to distributors?\n\n",

Allowing volunteers to simply make up words that seem to fit is a bit too whimsical a method to describe typefaces. I been through several iterations of brute-force metadata creation where two dozen people involved at an after work 'keywording-party' certainly filled in all of the blanks - but most of the keywords were either too esoteric or convoluted to be useful.\n\n"

Who controls the marketing process and gets to decide what the product should be like.   \n   \nGetty uses keyword demand to develop product; the process is professionized in the hands of marketers, not the content creator or the end user. (And there is no independent \"keywords standards\" body representing all stakeholders.) I don't see type design getting that corrupted by keywording, but the writing is on the wall.   \n   \nThe question is -- whose language, whose keywords are you gonna trust, whose are you gonna use? Whose decision on what is \"esoteric and convoluted\"?   \n   \nI provided a list of keywords for a font recently: Awesome, Badass, Ballin', Chill, Chronic, Dope, etc... which one of my distributors replaced, in my better interests of course. Without a \"no f\"\"k with the keywords\" clause in my contract, they can do that. Pity, I'm not sure the typeface in question was the right one to define the new niche, but still...\n\n"

What's missing from much of the keyword data supplied to us by designers is sometimes even the most basic typographic classifications and historical terms (eg: transitional, calligraphic, incised, condensed, etc.) If we could consistently receive these terms in conjunction with a few mood or aesthetic-based terms (eg: roughened, western, distressed, lively, casual, smooth, rounded, harsh, etc.) - it would make our job much easier. I certainly appreciate appropriately whimsical keywords, but not at the expense of more common descriptive terms.\n\n"
