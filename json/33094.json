When I say this, I dont mean for the whole text box, but only for where the text is, so the background colour is only present when there is a character present... i have attached a very poor picture to show what i mean.\n\nAnd while I'm posting, any ideas for two typefaces to work together for the setting of Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen??? I would like a serif for the libretti, and a sans for stage directions... I also need something for the story which will be presented in novel format........\n\nAny ideas would be great! thanks thanks!\n\nclaire  \n&8\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DSC00003.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20120312001013/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC00003.JPG) | 206.82 KB |\n\n",

Just highlight the text, then choose underline options in the drop down menu in the character palette. Set the underline color to white (or whichever color you want behind the text), then play with the pt size and offset until you create your desired effect.\n\nps: my first post! :)\n\n"

Havn't decided upon the story one yet... might stick with spectrum but go semibold/bold....\n\n_thanks thanks!_\n\n**&8  \nampersand8.co.uk**\n\n"
