  "content": "Hi guys.\n\nI'm a new member, I signed up to ask a question as I have been scouring the web for a week and couldn't find anything.\n\nI'm an artist and was recently asked to make a font for my studio. I had never done anything like this before and other than photoshop could only use freeware. So I used photoshop to make the paths, exported to Inkscape to make the font file and then to fontforge to do the kerning and then generating as a TTF.\n\nI have hit a few snags however and try as I may I cannot sort them out so I have come here to hopefully beg some help from people with much more experience in this area than I.\n\nMy font works in Fontforge metric window. The kerning works perfectly. When I export it and I look at the font preview window the glyphs are kerned. However when I open wordpad and MsWord the kerning is no longer there. What I don't get is that in notepad the kerning works as intended (though in notepad it creates black squares when I hit 'space'). I am certain this is something small that I have just overlooked but I cant seem to figure out what it is.\n\nCan anyone shed some light on this please as I really don't want to have to spend another week banging my head against fontforge. If you need any more info I will be checking this regularly and will be able to post anything that will be useful.\n\nThanks for any time / help. It is much appreciated.\n\n",

Just select it, right click and \"set width\".\n\nThe kerning in Word is not activated by default. To get it you need to select \"Format \\> Font \\> Advanced\" and check \"kerning\" and specify the smallest point size for which you want kerning to be applied.\n\n"

I re encoded it as Windows Latin and then altered the space character as you suggested but it still causes the black box.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n"
