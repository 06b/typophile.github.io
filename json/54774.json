Usually we're told to stay away from the gutter, since your text and/or imagery can be lost, but I thought I'd explore it a bit with this collage assignment. I cut out another batch of C's and put them on the right side of my layout to mirror the first set of C's. I thought it would be interesting to have the little C's bubbling along the spreads' edges and to juxtapose the imagery popping out from the center. But I am quite annoyed with the black line that scars the middle of my collage, which is why I gave this blog its name...\n\n",
