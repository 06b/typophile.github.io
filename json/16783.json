  "content": "Hi there,  \nmy first topic/post. And it’s about an pixelfont I want to use for my website. The name is RT Pixa.  \nI thought it would be nice to have a sans/serif-pixelfont-family of my own with swash italic and a real sc-font. It is quit tall and i think it has a good legiblility. But I don’t know what to do to make it an working font.\n\nMeasurements:  \nAscender 9 px  \nCaps 8 px  \nSC 7 px  \nx height 7px  \ndecender -3 px\n\nSo I have 12 px bodyheight without Cap accents. what I heard about pixelfonts is that i have to divide the postscript square with the bodyheight (1000 / 12 is 83,3 which doesnt work) looking at other pixelfonts like underwares Unibody didn’t help me. The other thing I heard is that I should use the measurements of an 8 pixelfont (125 units) and go over the ps-square. I use an mac but want to make it an free openTypefont for windows, too. So what shoul I do? Thanks, Eric.\n\nP.S.: the italics are raw beta\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pixa.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119123035/http:/typophile.com/files/pixa.gif) | 3.88 KB |\n\n [‹ Suddenly baffled by encoding](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119123035/http:/typophile.com/node/16943 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fontographer Editing Lower 31 ASCII Chars ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119123035/http:/typophile.com/node/16784 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
