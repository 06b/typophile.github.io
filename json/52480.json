  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've an issue with a font I developped. This font is an OTF which contains dingbats. I can't seem to get the font to be recognized by Microsoft so it appears in the function “Special Character” (from the Insert menu) in Word (of course it shows fine in the list of fonts available). I've tried creating a new font containing only the dingbats (which I identified as a Dingbats in the Supported Unicode Range), and that works. But is there a way to make the whole OTF be available in the Insert Special Character function?\n\nAlso, in Word 2008 (on Mac only) the ascenders and decenders are cut off in the preview, any way I can fix that? (prints fine and also export to PDF is ok)\n\nThx!\n\n",
