  "content": "I'm looking for a similar font to the one I have attached. I am restoring/recreating a map drawn after Sherman marched through Georgia during the Civil War. The damage to this old map originally printed on burlap is in such bad shape it can't be cleaned up and restored in Photoshop so I am recreating it. Fonts similar to Rosewood are close. I want to get as close as I can to this one without spending the enormous amount of time it would take to recreate/draw this in vector format.\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nJac\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [T copy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140902092757/http:/typophile.com/files/T%20copy.jpg) | 85.57 KB |\n\n",
