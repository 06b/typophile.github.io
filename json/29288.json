Where they »invented« for car emblems or where there any other forerunners (like neon signs maybe)?\n\nAny information would be appreciated. I could’nt find anything useful about this topic here in Europe.\n\nRalf Herrmann\n\n",

If you look at the amazing shapes of the cars from that time period you can almost see the lettering in some instances. I don't know if there is a technical term, but there must be a car aficionado that can help you more, I'm just here to make sure the thread doesn't disappear.\n\n"

      "content": "This may just be where I grew up but in Pittsburgh during the 50s, we called car nameplates \"chrome script.\" An older guy from Detroit (even older than me) several years ago explained that the joined nature of the heavy script was just due to the technical manufacturing aspect. It was just one piece to cast and only needed 2 rivots to mount on the car. Today, they can do anything so there is no need for that style. It is fun to look at though!\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Chronicle Books may have incorporated it as a chapter into a newer book called Euro Deco, but I'm not sure. The original is out of print, but good reference. You're right about the relationship to neon signs; motel signs in particular.\n\nThen there is also\n\n[http://www.fontdiner.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115035738/http:/www.fontdiner.com/ \"http://www.fontdiner.com\")\n\n[http://www.misterretro.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115035738/http:/www.misterretro.com/ \"http://www.misterretro.com\")\n\nand of course\n\n[http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage2.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131115035738/http:/www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage2.htm \"http://www.flashfonts.com/flashsite/fontspage2.htm\")\n\n"
