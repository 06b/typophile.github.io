The Swiss are much more recent. They also have created different weights. The Swiss probably finetuned this old Belgian typeface, who knows...\n\nBut it’s not because they look ugly that they are less interesting. And I’m intrigued by the flat ’a’.\n\nDoes someone know the name or history or do you know a link or lead to the solution? Please help, it’s killing me!\n\n"

I must say, fellow countriemen, the same font was used very nicely in Switzerland. I think you can find this typeface on old playingcards (80’s), made by Carta Mundi, here in Belgium.\n\n"
