Alternately, if all you need is to try to replicate this cover, then why don't you try drawing the glyphs yourself? It's pretty much all straight lines, so it will be not too hard to do a rough job of it, and you'll gain experience at the same time. Or, one last option: you could easily isolate the letters in Photoshop with such a scan as this.\n\n"
