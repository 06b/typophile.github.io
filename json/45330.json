[Locator](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320151638/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator/) is Locator, but if you want to know which widely available font is most similar, I would say Verdana, although the l is not curved, the C is more closed, and the G is a different style.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
