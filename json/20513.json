I tried adding all of the fonts i want converted into the program by having it scan the CD they were on but it couldn't bring them over into the program. I figured it might create a list of the fonts i want to be converted in the program and then i'd just select the output settings in the preferences and hit 'Convert'. But it won't bring them into TransType. Am i doing something wrong?\n\n"

[FontForge](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002701/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/) may also be helpful. They are both free (speech/beer)and pretty easy to use.\n\n"

The Trick of Mac to PC is to use a PC Formated disk (Floppy, ZIP, Harddrive, etc) and convert from Mac to PC formated disk. Easy as pie.\n\nRodi\n\nThe Truth shall set you free\n\n"
