I'll certainly be seeking a copy of that book now.   \n   \nThe development of scriptura continua to words as individual objects is fascinating. I've never seen those 'mid dots' used in anything other than examples of Roman inscriptions. I refer to them as mid dots as I'm unsure whether they have an established name. We have an overdot, so it seems a reasonable guess.   \n   \n--   \n   \nInteresting reading on the asterisk too HHP. I was with you in thinking that it concerned the playwright.\\</font\\>\n\n"

As an alternative to the vertical bar. Or sometimes in a folio, eg MARCH�2004.   \n   \nThe question for a type designer is: do you give the character the same width as the baseline period? Some fonts vary the width, and some even vary the design. Although the easiest thing to do is just copy the entire period character and nudge it up.   \n   \nThe character actually appears when you hit \"show invisibles\" in Quark XPress etc, so there may be some examples of \"dot spacing\" in Raygun.\n\n"

And as no change is noted in the literature that I know of, the practice is likely far more ancient.   \n   \nI read somewhere recently that in Latin, being a highly inflected language, it is easy to spot word endings, by comparison to some other languages - which would explain the lack of spaces to some extent.   \n   \nAll this makes me question how much of the story Saenger really has.

But Hebrew still suffers from something worse to this day: waaaaay too much homogeny between characters, and too much alignment (like Latin all-caps).
