Below is the Windows XP shutdown screen which features the 3rd and 4th symbols:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019151719im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ShutdownXP.gif)\n\nI've always assumed that's a binary 1 for \"on\" and \"0\" [zero] for off and the standby and shutdown icons combine the two symbols in different ways.\n\n"

      "content": "I think \"I/O switch\" is the technical name for the on/off switch, which I believe predaties computers, going back to the early days of electronics. Either the switch is on or off, directing or stopping the flow of current. (This doesn't address the fact that if the thing is unplugged, its state is actually mu, being neither.)\n\nThis is indeed related to the binary concept. I think elliot100 is right about the 'binary 1 for “on” and “0” [zero] for off'\n\nPretty much all the Macs I've used have the circle halfway intersected by the vertical bar on the on/off button.\n\n"
