  "content": "Hello,\n\nsomething that has been bothering me recently is the discussion of the value of designing prose. Throughout history, the designer has always been a necessary part of the production of prose. The working method is usually choosing a typeface and setting the type. And by tradtion, typography in modern prose is in most cases what Beatrice Warde would call the Crystal Goblet – a perfect transparent vessel in which the fine wine (the writer's text) is contained.\n\nBut with the rise of the digital book, where the reader can freely choose his/her typeface of choice, decide a typesize that suits the reader etc, the role of the designer in prose becomes quite tricky.\n\nWhat can the designer actually do for prose that cannot be done by a robot for example? Is all he/she can do is apply typographic \"rules\" and conventions to a text? Does an \"informed choice\" of a typeface affect the reading process?\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n",

(Hopefully after I'm retired.)\n\nAny process that can be broken down into a series of definable steps has the potential to be done by a computer. And much of the design process is teachable and follows well-established principles.\n\nWhat will be much harder — perhaps impossible — will be&nbsp;for a computer to bring creativity to the process. But that doesn't mean that a lot of everyday design will be done someday by automated systems. It's happening in lots of professions and will happen someday in design, too.\n\n"

The purpose of this exercise was to show that books don't just happen. Books look the way the do because somebody made a series of decisions, some better than others. The goal of my course was to equip students to make those decisions well.\n\nGraphic designers have not, in fact, been necessary throughout history. The term \"graphic designer\" was coined less than a century ago by W.A. Dwiggins. All the decisions associated with book design--choosing a style and size of type and arranging it on the page with suitable linespacing, margins, headers, etc.--were made quite competently by printers until the introduction of the Linotype and Monotype machines in the 1880s.\n\nThe Linotype and Monotype were the first steps toward automating page production, a process that has evolved to the point where these decisions can be made, if not by robots, then at least without human intervention. It's the typographic equivalent of fast food: Quick, cheap, and good enough for many customers.\n\nBut there will always be customers for whom the one-size-fits-all product isn't good enough, and they will want professionals who know how to make custom-tailored designs for specific works of prose.\n\n"

Those of us who have tried ebooks have found that not only does it limit typographic choices, but images (particularly vector based) and tables (especially with rotated cells) are very limited. PDF documents look great (assuming a very high resolution monitor) but have no reflow options with current standards. Although technically one can embed fonts in an ebook, most readers cannot use them. I think the whole thing will be resolved with some future standard, but currently, ebooks are not a good medium for professional typography.

Where it is all going, who knows? The worry about robotic design is the least of the interesting issues that will be resolved. More interesting, for example, is what will happen to \\*publishers\\*? It always amazed me that the initial pricing for ebooks was a bit higher than for the mass-market edition. What happens when that changes?\n\nWe could even see a time when you buy the digital edition for the text only, have it printed out to taste -- maybe after your own personal designer has selected typeface, measure, trim -- have initials drawn in (by hand or computer), choose your own binder...oh, wait, we've sorta kinda done a portion of that a couple hundred years ago...\n\n"
