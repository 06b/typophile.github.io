They either add a copy or a link the fonts when you activate them in the system folder, then when you deactivate it deletes the copy/link.</cite>\n\nThis is only partly true. When modern font managers like Suitcase activate a font on Windows, they do so programmatically by modifying one of two different registry keys depending on the font type. If you look at C:\\Windows\\Fonts\\ it will appear as though the directory contains shortcuts. This is the way Microsoft has chosen to represent the Windows font system. The fonts folder, though, is not a normal directory. The only way files can be added to it are though the Add Fonts dialog. So, the “shortcuts” are really created by Windows to represent the state of the font system, which is reasonable. After a font is added, other API calls are made to update the system and tell Windows to refresh the font menus of open applications.\n\nThis has varied somewhat over time as well. My understanding is that Suitcase 9.x did in fact do something similar to creating a shortcut. Suitcase 11 (Windows) does use the method I’ve described however.\n\nOn the Mac OS X side, there has always been a robust programming interface for font activation. As far as I know, nothing like a shortcut has ever been used.\n\n"

There’s a difference in meaning (verb aspect, in this case) between the “preterite” (completed action) and the “present perfect” (something occurring in past that continues or relates to present) that works mostly the same, so far as I know, in both American and British standards of English. In this case, the latter verb form is useful to imply that the toaster still does not work.\n\n"
