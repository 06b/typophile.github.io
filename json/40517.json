Legibility and the 'colour' are of importance, I don't want some looking too dark.\n\nThere will be no lowercase as this typeface is intended for use on the back of football shirts.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nTom\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [newsample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161644/http:/typophile.com/files/newsample.pdf) | 49.98 KB |\n| [Untitled-5.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161644/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-5.pdf) | 28.76 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I just took a gander at the previous post, there are definitely some very nice improvements with this set.\n\nAre you planning to keep all the fonts the same weight or do a bolder version also?  \nI'd be interested to see what the LJ combination looks like now with the tighter spacing.\n\nSome nit-picky things to consider:  \nI think the W needs to be slightly wider (maybe 1.5 times the width of the X) and the M strokes seem thin compared to the N (consider pulling the inside points down to thicken the M a little more). At least from a distance the M needs to be meatier.\n\nYou might want to consider closing the bowls of the 6 and 9, or at least one of them. The top tip of the 1 seems slightly over pronounced, could you curl it back like the U? The 8 seems squooshed on the bottom (is it as long as the 0?). Finally, the 4 still seems narrow, it's definitely the curve of the stroke. Have you consider opening the top more, like this: [http://flickr.com/photos/rehvonwald/361027843/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161644/http:/flickr.com/photos/rehvonwald/361027843/ \"http://flickr.com/photos/rehvonwald/361027843/\")\n\nThere are my opinions, take them for what their worth. Either way, you have a nice looking font on your hands and will look awesome on a jersey. I love that R! This font definitely has character.\n\n"

This could cause problems, any ideas?\n\nI've decided to leave the K hanging below the cap line, I think it looks more balanced.\n\nHow does the 4 and 8 look now?\n\nAlso, I thought it best to keep the 6 and 9 as they are, but the 6 is beginning to bug me so I may close it up.\n\nApart from that I'm very happy with it.\n\n"

      "content": "Tom: I started a new thread only to attach my suggestions PDF, I'm not attempting to hijack your font or anything alike that.\n\nAnd I mean no disrespect to your lovely letters, I just thought it be easier to illustrate my suggestions by modifying your existing PDF letters. I made adjustments to the L,J,1,4 and 6. Take them with a grain of salt. The spacing isn't adjusted properly to reflect my changes.\n\nWhile making these changes I realized that the LJ combo might actually be First Initial Last Name. In which there would should be more space between the LJ, which would break up the forming \"U\". I can't think of any other times LJ are side by side that you might encounter, but I could be wrong.\n\nI hope you find my suggestions helpful. This is really turning into a nice font.\n\nThe PDF can be found here: [http://typophile.com/node/40559](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416161644/http:/typophile.com/node/40559 \"http://typophile.com/node/40559\")\n\n"

      "content": "Hello, I know your not attempting to 'hijack' it, it's weird somebody messing with it though, weird in a good way I suppose!\n\nThanks for the suggestions, the LJ combination is in fact actually the beginning of a last name, it is Swedish.\n\nThe L you have drawn is pretty similar to the L I had originally designed, before I decided to alter most of the characters to make it more south Asian. You can see it here...

      "content": "Oh I didn't see that post. Interesting.\n\nAnd remember: Good designers borrow, Great designers steal! Feel free to steal any of my suggestions/ideas. Ultimately you'll be the one getting all the credit, I'll be happy to know I've helped even if in a small capacity.\n\nI didn't try a combination of my J with your L, give that one a gander and see if that might sway you more. Anything to help break up that \"U\" that's forming. I actually felt kinda bad straightening your L out, the curves in your letters make the font unique. Straightening the L just made it seem less unique.\n\nWhat about the 1 and 4? I didn't do much with the 4, just extended it slightly more to the left, so the entire shape was maintained. The 1 however, I mimicked the curve of the U more.\n\nI know you weren't planning to do any lowercase, but how bout punctuation? I'd like to see what you do with the @, ?, and & symbols.\n\n"

I would also suggest lengthening the top of the 7. You should want to avoid 1/7 confusion by all means possible.\n\nOtherwise, I think you're done. Good show!\n\n"
