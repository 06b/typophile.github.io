  "content": "Dear all,\n\nI tried a mark positioning feature for an arabic font with the latest FDK, but didn't succeed.  \nFeature looks like this (anchor positions are made up for now), as suggested in the FDK syntax definition:\n\n`feature mark {`\n\nmarkClass [uni0651 uni064B] @TOP\\_MARKS;  \n position mark [uni0631] mark @TOP\\_MARKS;\n\n} mark;\n\nBut the marks don't position (InDesign CS3 ME 5.0.4)  \nEdit: the base and mark glyphs now also defined in GDEF/GlyphClassDef, but to no avail.\n\nAny ideas? Thank you in advance.\n\n",
