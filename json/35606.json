I can't think for the life of me what to use.  \nWorking on a pitch, currently using Rockwell as headline fone... want something similar but different.  \nSomething like the font ImageSource use is quite good, but I'd rather try something not used my a large company.  \n [www.imagesource.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418211238/http:/www.imagesource.com/ \"www.imagesource.com\")\n\nAny suggestion welcome...\n\nThanks\n\n",

In the late 1920s similar faces became popular in Europe, and some were imported into the United States. Morris Benton of ATF added several characters to the old Inland face, matrices of which were then in ATF's vaults, and it was reissued in 1931 as Rockwell Antique. But Benton saw that something more was needed, and redrew it as **Stymie Bold** in the same year. The alternate characters which were added to Rockwell are the same ones in Stymie bold.\n\nMonotype copied Rockwell but erroneously called it Stymie Bold in some liturature, and there has been confusion between the two faces ever since; the latter name is often applied to fonts of Rockwell cast on Monotype machines by secondary suppliers.\n\nect...\n\n"
