  "content": "So here's the situation. I have a client who needs the Keynote (Mac) files I've created converted to PowerPoint (PC). Exporting to PowerPoint and opening them I notice only most of the fonts are still as they should be. So I figure I can change those few, no big deal. (I mean who really expects Keynote and PowerPoint to play nicely?) But, the biggest problem and almost total failure happens when I send them these PowerPoint files. If you look at this image you'll see that almost none of the fonts remain. I'm in touch with someone at Adobe and they tell me it is a problem with out the separate OS map fonts. So, I'm wondering if any of you have had the problem and if there is a slicker way to solve it. And I have to send them PowerPoint so maybe we're out of luck?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130623051226im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Font-Test_5455.png)\n\n",

For example, to get the Semibold you'll need to select the Light, and then press the Bold button. This will get you the Semibold working cross-platform.\n\nFor Myriad Pro, [refer to this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20130623051226/http:/store1.adobe.com/type/browser/html/readmes/MyriadProReadMe.html#A2) to know which font is the base of each 4-font subfamily.\n\n"

But you're getting the PPT files on Mac by converting from Keynote. So it's likely that a few (many) things will fail.\n\n"
