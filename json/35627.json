It is a contemporary Roman font based on the manuscript tradition. The stoic capitals add just the right touch to the slightly fanciful, and unmistakably, “Baker-style” lower case. Digitization of Matador was completed by fellow award-winning calligrapher, Michael Clark. This makes it a font truly from the Calligraphic tradition.\n\nArthur has been drawing letters for decades and has written over 20 books on the subject. His fonts have been used on Coke and Lipton products as well as the Eddie Bauer logo and catalog. His style is admired and has been imitated by many calligraphers and type designers. In addition to his knowledge of letterforms and historic calligraphic styles, Arthur custom designs his own pens and brushes.\n\n[http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070921100641/http:/www.p22.com/ \"http://www.p22.com\")  \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/matador.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070921100641/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/matador.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/matador.html\")\n\nBest Regards!  \nP22 type foundry\n\n",
