  "content": "Hello!\n\nLast year I created the Magical Unicorn Typeface: A typeface, while flawed, still managed to capture the spirit of these noble animals in graphemes. However, it wasn't the end, a continuation of the Unicorn Typeface was a must.\n\n![]()http://www.arthus.nl/pegacorn/pegacornABC.gif\n\nThe Unicorn-Pegasus letters are an development of the Unicorn font. With the translation of the original drawings to the usable Unicorn font, many details disappeared and the hand-drawn character was lost. This series of initials is extremely detailed and compared to the Unicorn Font, no shapes have been cut. Each Unicorn-Pegasus is complete, from the tip of the horn to the far end of the tail.\n\nWhile the images might become available in the future (or become vectorized as a companion weight for the Magical Unicorn & Unicorn Sans weights) I hope this approach towards type might open the discussion about the requirement of horns or hooves for better readability.\n\nMore information and images can be found on: [my portfolio](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720015533/http:/www.arthus.nl/) or for more images on [Behance](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720015533/http:/www.behance.net/gallery/Unicorn-Pegasus-Initials/7721763).\n\n",
