  "content": "i am working to find a substitute font for [swankglossy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232931/http:/www.swankglossy.com/) fashion magazine. The font that i want to substitute is Bodoni.\n\nThe font is similar to Didot,and most fashion magazine use this font such as ELLE, VOGUE, BAZAAR, etc. I`m trying to find something new, fresh, elegant yet still has a sense of fashion in it.\n\nI would really appreciate any thoughtful feedback you are willing to share. Please ask any questions you need answered in order to respond.\n\n",
