      "content": "Hello, base,\n\nI spent 5 years doing multilingual DTP for a translation agency... I can’t stress this enough: **Arabic is very, very tricky to typeset...** And MS Word is not the best program in the world for working with Arabic! You will try to select a character on the right end of a line and will end up selecting the one on the left side... Periods will not behave the way you expect them to... I could go on and on. For any lengthy text, the best thing to do is to send the job to a designer or production artist who knows and works with Arabic text on a daily basis... There are just too many things that can go wrong if you try to do it yourself. And Arabic typesetters are scarce, so they can charge you a bundle!\n\nFlorian already mentioned InDesign ME... There is also Illustrator ME... These versions of the Adobe apps were made to deal with right-to-left typesetting (_i.e._, Arabic, Hebrew). If you have to do the job yourself, try to use one of these programs... Using a Western version of MS Word will just give you non-stop headaches. I kid you not.\n\n"
