  "content": "Hey Hey   \n   \nI am a designer living in Washington DC whose job is driving him insane. I work for a giant engineering firm and people come to me with Powerpoint presentations they've tried to do themselves, and ask me to make a poster / brochure / display out of them. (Oh, the pain.)   \n   \nBut YOU can help!   \n   \nI am looking for advice about the best (for me) graduate programs in graphic design in the U.S. or Canada. I have an undergrad degree in Advertising, but it was more of a business-focused program. So I'm looking for a school that has a practical, professional orientation, as opposed to one that stresses theory / research. Basically, I'd like to take this degree and go work for a design firm.   \n   \nI have several years of design and production experience in in-house design departments at medium-sized companies, (as well as having done a bunch of freelance work) so I don't need to start from the beginning, with a Bachelor's design degree.   \n   \nI am leaning towards Pratt.   \n   \nAny thoughts / advice / resources? Feel free to plug your alma mater or diss other schools -- it's all good.   \n   \nYou rock,   \n   \n--Troy\n\n",

What is important to you? What about the faculty? That was also important to me.   \n   \nYou can also do searches for different schools at [Peterson's](http://web.archive.org/www.peterson.com)\n\n"

Lauderdale) but overall it's a good 2 year AS program and teaches you the basics and helps guide you towards areas that interest you most.   \n   \nThere is one in Pittsburg that may suit your fancy.   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

I was instructed to fire the last one; she was a grad but didn't know how to use any of the layout programs (\"Our instructors didn't focus on that,\" she said) and set an entire project in screen fonts, false bolds, false italics and didn't know why they defaulted when printed.   \n   \nOut of the four or five grads that passed thru our shop, none had strong conceptual skills, most had difficulty working under deadline and none could work without continual direction.   \n   \nIn fact, my CD demanded that our recruitment   \nads state \"understanding of spatial relations a must.\" When asked, one candidate and AI grad said \"yeah, I get along well with everybody.\"   \n   \nThey all had beautiful, beautiful books however.   \n   \nI know somebody who went to RISD and would've killed to have been able to afford him. Also, have you considered some of those fabulous workshops? I'm always getting mailers for them; that's another thing I'd love to be able to afford.\n\n"

If you've already been in-house and done design production then I don't think you need to learn the more of the techny software end. its only going to draw more requests for trade-show booths a-la-ppt-template#10-style   \n   \nI don't see why you'd rule out having a good brain filled with theory (and alot of night-time reading) and aiming for the Art Directors position instead\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Tracy,   \n   \nI don't blame you at all. There is a large contingency of AI grads that do only as much to finish the program instead of taking it seriously and relating it to future career aspirations. I only felt professionally challenged by about 5% of my classmates and took school very seriously.   \n   \nThis perhaps is a good time to get back to Troy's original post and suggest that if you're going to take this effort seriously and make the most of a career in art and design, commit yourself to learning as much as you can, have an open mind, and take it seriously.   \n   \nI can't express enough in today's economy after all the agencies and design firms had mass layoffs how many designers are out there looking to be hired. Many of them just aren't that hireable (see Tracy's post above) and the older set isn't retiring anytime soon. That is why you must take school seriously and befriend designers and teachers to learn all they can teach you about how it REALLY is, ask questions - you'll get answers!   \n   \nI do have one warning for you though . . . The more you learn about design, the less likely you will be fixing Powerpoint files two years from now, and once you do learn design, it's very hard to revert back to seeing things without a critical eye.   \n   \nGood Luck!   \nStuart :D\n\n"

      "content": "hehheh! Death to PowerPoint!   \nThanks for not taking offense!   \nNot to sidetrack from the original post again but , my conscience is pricking me ... to be perfectly fair, my experience with AI grads was two years ago and, shortly before our agency's demise, the school did contact us about how hires were working out and what we thought their program's strengths and weaknesses were. They did seem genuinely concerned about shortcomings.   \n   \nI think some of the best learning of all comes from getting to sit next to wonderful designers. Spending hours observing as a piece goes from concept thru production, is utterly priceless.   \n   \nwhat are the differences anyway? Do roles and functions vary from firm to firm? perhaps it would help to know what the differences are, art director, designer? production artist?   \n   \nThe bitch I've seen in today's economy is that many employers want somebody who can do it all, not just have great ideas and be able to articulate them to staff but more importantly execute them better than just that 50% I know it's cost me several jobs... admitting that I'm a concept person not a production person. I've heard being an idea person but will always get you hired but have yet to experience it.\n\n"

      "content": "If your thinking of Canada - George Brown in Toronto has a good program linked with Concordia U. and resources up the yahoo, support from DX (Design Exchange) and RGD/GDC. I was very jealous of George Brown's program when I graduated. They do have a thesis/portfolio year - 4th that you could prolly jump right into. The courses look yummy. I plan to go back and take it during the evenings just for fun.   \n   \nI went to Algonquin in Ottawa - same feeling as Stuart's- not many taking it seriously and unfortunately there's only a few good profs. There is a fast-track program though run by Janet Menger. 6 months. $6000 I think. She can make you think and teach you what you need. The 3 year program useto be top-rated here - but I donno...I had to do alot of my own research for various feilds of interest the profs had no idea about (and now they ask that I go back and talk to students, I really don't know THAT much, so I'd be worried about their cirriculum) strangely enough very few assignment pieces out of the 3 years made it into my portfolio.   \n   \nOther then that - there's OCAD, in TO or the maritimes. But that's mainly theory.\n\n"

      "content": "just had another thought. If you are considering Canada - make sure you contact the Registered Graphic Designer's Association in that province to make sure the school is recognized, and/or you can ask them which institution will be best for you. You can consult www.gdc.net (The Society of...)   \n   \nThe Associations and Society grant the Accrediations up here - you'll have to take an exam with the board after your program. Canada's Designers are somewhat like Lawyers - half the time you have to be RGD to be hired, or use RFP lists. So once your in your also covered under NAFTA to swing into the States.\n\n"

I've gotta agree, it's not the letters tacked after your name but what you're bringing to the table. My degree was nothing but a foundation (major and minor both helped but have yet to justify their pricetag); I learned more by going to work than I ever did racking up national deficit-sized student loans.\n\n"

The former focuses on graduating   \nkids with a solid body of work, as opposed to   \njust good thinking. In my opinion, the 'portfolio'   \nschools that effectively teach theory have the   \nedge because they teach execution.   \nExecution is 50 percent of good design.   \n   \nThen again, Sagmeister and Carson have   \nmade healthy careers off of great ideas with   \nmediocre execution.   \n   \nRe: Powerpoint. I think it's time the Acrobat   \nfolks figured out how to kill PowerPoint. All   \nit would require is for Acrobat to read and   \nexport PPT format. Bam! No more auto-   \nformatted MS crap.\n\n"
