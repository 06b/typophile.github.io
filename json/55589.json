  "content": "Hello,\n\nI have a (newbie) doubt about the typical 'abstract characters' you find as being part of some typefaces : what's the name of that kind of characters ?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018073917im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sign_5952.png)\n\nThere's also a most common variant, in horizontal sense, sometimes with a double line composing the figure.\n\nThis one is from the Hoefler & Frere-Jones's site.\n\nThanks very much for any input.\n\n",
