I am guessing that the designer started with a non-stencil serif and made it into a stencil.\n\nIt would be nice to at least figure out the original font(s) that got tweaked.\n\n"

      "content": "Eric, I think you're right that it's a faux-stencil. Judging from some of the other samples you posted these guys seem to go for antique/obscure fonts and then cobble them up. Both k's in this sample seem clumsily altered.\n\nWhen I think about these letters, it looks like the lower case letters are a monotone serif (either italic or slanted Roman -- that 'a' style is not a script 'a', and most of the time it's not even an italic one), and the A and S may be from script fonts. The A sort of resembles [Bellevue](http://web.archive.org/web/20110508004924/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/bellevue%C2%AE/fonts/) in having the straight right stroke with the arched left curve. I don't know what to say about that S. Really.\n\nI'll try to think about an italic serif that might resemble these lower case letters.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you, Mike. Your hard work on this series of IDs is greatly appreciated.\n\nYa, now that I look at it, the cobbled parts do stick out a little more. But I think the sloppiness gives it an appealing organic/signish/graf look. And when holding the actual tag, the cobbled parts aren't as noticeable as when it is scanned and placed in 2D.\n\nI will also give this ID a shot myself.\n\n"
