  "content": "I have settled on type design for my senior BFA thesis. Unfortunately that’s not something a thesis anyone has done at my school in a while, if ever, so I don’t know how prepared my professors will be to guide my through this. So as part of my research I am looking into how people handle a type design thesis at schools where such a thing is not a rarity. If anyone has posted a BFA type design thesis online, published it in a magazine, or just wants to [email me a PDF](mailto:james.puckett@gmail.com) I would really appreciate knowing about it—and might even cite it! I would also appreciate any advice on potential pitfalls to avoid, timesavers to keep in mind, or unexpected and overlooked sources of information.\n\n [‹ Is Design School Worth It - Part Deux](http://web.archive.org/web/20080904215551/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36104 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Helvetica: the DVD ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080904215551/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36051 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
