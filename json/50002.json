      "content": "I doubt if any fonts were used to make that logo, and at least two styles were used: sans and serif. The fact that the two L's in BELL are so different supports the idea that these were drawn by hand. Maybe [Letraset Boink](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215061055/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/boink/) could be used for BELL, with some tweaking. [El Vistereo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215061055/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/el-vistereo/) might be a starting point for SAVED, and [Soylent Blu](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215061055/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/blhd/soylent-blu-bh/) for BY THe. You could probably find freebie fonts that would also have some of the same feel as these three lettering styles.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
