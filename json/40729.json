What i think the best approach to implementing contextual alternates in this manner is to fix as many fit problems as possible before you begin fixing problems using kerning. so the fitting priorities would be to 1) ensure good fitting of default letterforms to avoid as many spacing problems as possible 2) once fitting is set, provide contextual alternates in as many places as possible to resolve fitting problems 3) as a final resort, use kerning to solve the most difficult problems. This is not to say that kerning is undesirable and may actually be a better option than 2 in many cases. in the most difficult cases 1, 2, & 3 might need to be employed. of course i haven't had a chance to put this to the test in my current work yet, but i intend to experiment with this as much as time will allow for as i'm developing my typeface project this year.\n\n"

If that's the impression that you or anyone else had I apologize for putting words in your mouth.\n\nMy intent was to rhetorically contrast what I think we have to begin with - which is looking at the problem from the position we occupy now in which contextual shapes are a new idea/opportunity that we are starting to wrap our heads around. A position in which contextual shapes is a question that is likely to be considered near the end of a font's development when we find we could alter our basic shape to solve a problem, or kern or both. Or we could make an Alt. And maybe Kern it if it's used more than once.\n\nThis would be in contrast with a point that we might occupy later where practical experience allows us to integrate what we have learned much earlier on in new fonts design. Maybe even at the earliest moments where we are sketching out ideas. Once we are doing that we might start to include new less obviously problematic letter pairs in our thinking because context has become something we take for granted not something exceptional.\n\n<cite> overagressive </cite>\n\nSorry, I didn't mean to cast judgement there either; just to characterize one process as more confident/intgrated in it's approach than another.

Kerning was nearly impossible and side-bearings were one-size-fits-all. Then. phototype and later digital came along and these old patterns were broken, albeit oftentimes abused. OpenType brings potential for both terrific solutions as well as overuse and butchery. After that experimental plunge, the future will be better. If we don't push the envelope however, we will be stuck with the limitations of yesterday. Old farts like me won't be the ones who make the difference though. Young people who have never experienced the limitations impost by type frozen in metal form will not be stymied by the appearance of a closed door. They will just walk through and do new and better things with type than my generation because they see no boundaries and have no fear to overcome.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I am very fond of serifs on i and j, but they do make bad combinations with r, g and others with a protruding top right. Or the double-decker g (whatever you want to call it): starts getting blotchy at certain sizes, which is what automatic optical sizing could take care of, but also a replacement below a certain size. Or insert one or two different g's in the gg combination. The get really noticeable, and in English, double-g appears frequently. In German, ch, sch and ck are pronounced as one sound, as ck is in English. The c always looks too far from the h or the s, and in metal we had ligatures for these (as for tz by the way), also a time-saving device. I cannot kern the c for these combinations, as they would look bad in all the other languages.\n\nWhen we designed the typeface for Glasgow in 1999, I wanted to have different combinations – kind of ligatures – for the different ways certain diphtongs are pronounced in English. Like ea as in reading or in leading (the typographic type), ow as in low or cow, o as in rose or in lose, etc. Not new signs as in some attempts for more phonetic English, but just different ways to show these letters in context. At the time that would have meant calling up a dictionary and then insert glyphs from separate fonts. That was deemed to difficult for your ordinary graphic designer, as it would have forced him to install many fonts for just the one weight. Today that would be quite reasonable to implement.\n\n"

      "content": "Eben, I just shipped a beta version of a new typeface to a client. I can't show it yet, but it includes a lot of contextual lookups including many that are designed to improve fit. Technically it is a display face, in the sense that it is intended to use at larger sizes, but the contextual rules are worked out with text in mind. There are contextual substitutions for fit in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. In the Latin and Cyrillic these involve variants with entry serifs removed for use after certain letters (f,g,r,x,y); in the Greek, there are variants of pi, sigma and tau with shorter horizontal extensions to reduce the white space between certain combinations of letters. [This is only scratching the surface of what this font does though: the compiled font is almost 2MB and 40% of the font size is taken up by the GSUB table. There were times working on the contextual rules when I thought my head might explode.]\n\nSi mentioned Tom Milo's work with Arabic. Regarding fit, you might take a look at his illustration of the ruqah style on page 125 of the _Language Culture Type_ book, showing five different variations of the same words, each of a different horizontal length. Obviously, this suggests interesting solutions for justified text.\n\nTom asked me a very similar question to yours at a Unicode conference a couple of years ago, wondering if there were any types that applied variation for fit to the Latin script. At the time I wasn't aware of any, other than the above mentioned display face that I was already working on at that time.\n\n"

If you look at the calt feature description in the OpenType Layout tag registry, you will see that it was registered by Adobe. When looking at the early registered tags, i.e. those registered by Adobe and Microsoft often prior to any actual implementation in either fonts or software, one can usually guess what the initial intent of the tag was based on who registered it. Adobe's tags largely cover features that they anticipated needing for fonts in their library, and the only non-Latin scripts they were dealing with at that time were East Asian. Microsoft's tags were much more focused on non-Latin fonts, but they tended, at that time, to define specialised tags for specific script purposes rather than generic tags that could be used in variable ways for different scripts (hence the dedicated Indic layout features).\n\nAlso note that the calt feature, while on by default, may be turned off by the user, so it is ill-suited to situations in which a layout feature is needed 'to adequately display the language'. The calt feature is great for discretionary contextual variants, things that enliven or improve the display of text, but it shouldn't be relied upon for anything like basic text shaping of the sort that makes text decipherable.\n\n"

It is generally considered that even colour depends on a balance of variety in internal and external negative and positive space; however, Softmachine's consistency is in the uniformity of proximity spacing. IMO, this uniformity provides a sufficient matrix for readability.\n\nI conclude that a uniform matrix of some kind is required for reading, a background field upon which the variety of informational form can make sense.

So the question is, how much tweaking is too much, and like all good type design, it becomes a matter of the designer’s discretion, not rule-of-thumb._\n\nIs this curls retract feature bad then, too much tweaking, too selective?

I think the tails adds something.\n\nI would also consider making a shape that is even more specific. So in the case of the ag I might pull it back less than I would with the dg or ig or lg which seem more similar to my eye. I think is if you are going to go to the trouble to do this why not be really sensitive and get the balance to be 'just so'. Also, as I see it the benefit of being subtle and specific about it is that what you are doing isless likely to be noticed which in text is ideal.\n\nThe other thing is I don't know if I am 100% sold on the g somehow. Not generally - it's nice to be sure - but in combination with these other forms. The first turn of the tail of the g attracts my eye a bit too much in comparison with the other forms I think.\n\nWhat do y'all say?\n\nThanks Tim!\n\n"

It is recommended to be on by default but an app with a decent OpenType Layout UI will make it possible for the user to turn off the calt feature (as e.g. InDesign does). You do not want to associate any layout that is necessary for normal display of a complex script language with a feature that can be turned off, because turning off the feature would render the text unreadable.\n\nAside from that, though, most complex scripts require a number of different features for language shaping and, typically, interaction between those features and the shaping engine. In theory one could use something like the 'calt' feature, only permanently active, to perform Arabic script shaping. But it is faster (character processing is faster than glyph processing) and more reliable to allow the shaping engine to analyse the text and call appropriate features such as 'init', 'medi' etc, rather than have the font analyse the glyph string and perform contextual lookups.\n\n"

I will be sure to provide an example of this combination in my talk then. Thanks!\n\nYou also said <cite> Or insert one or two different g’s in the gg combination</cite>  \nI agree in a big way. I think subtly different repeating characters is a great use of contextual scripting. Looking at ff combinations and then other letters I started to wonder if there was any point in considering other letters too. Then I started looking at scribal books from the 15th c. and found that I really liked what they were doing with doubled letters. Partly what happening of course is natural variation; but in the best examples I felt like they were in fact making a deliberately better word form with their variation. Most of the time I found that the 2nd letter is slightly more exuberant than the 1st.\n\n<cite> In German, ch, sch and ck are pronounced as one sound, as ck is in English.

O wanted to try to get what you meant... I think I do now. Maybe. I suspect that for a native reader this sort of thing would be of limited use. But for a reader with english as a second or third language it might be quite useful. I base this assertion ( maybe foolishly) on not having seen what you have in mind.

The design is based on an expansion stroke model, with some natural variation in the presence/absence of serifs anyway (the ascenders in the basic style do not have serifs, for example, following the French rondo model), so removing serifs and changing the way strokes start makes more sense than merely shortening the serifs.\n\n"

This does two things: it clears up the ugly collision of the serif with the top of the r and it also allows me to position the letters closer together, reducing the white space caused by the shape of the r.\n\nA similar thing happens following the г (ghe) in the Cyrillic portion of the font.\n\nThe Greek implementation is different, because there are no serifs, but certain letters create lots of white space when adjacent to each other, e.g. the combination στ as in the word Χριστου. So I have variants with shorter horizontal bars that are used contextually.\n\nI should mention again that I'm talking here about something that is intended as a display face, and it has design features that are more exaggerated than they would probably be in a text face, e.g. the serifs are longer.\n\nBut this leads me to wonder if perhaps you are asking your question backwards? Instead of asking if anyone is making fonts that use contextual alternates to improve letter fit, you could ask if anyone is deliberately breaking the canons of text face design, e.g. with regard to serif length, in the knowledge that such alternates can be used to adjust the resulting word shaping. In other words, are people deliberately setting out to make letter fit more challenging in order to collect stylistic dividends in other areas?\n\n"
