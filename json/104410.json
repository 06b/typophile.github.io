  "content": "Bloomberg Businessweek's international cover for June is, according to the editiors, \"ultra kawaii\" [ultra cute] with a pic of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, bats, crying clouds, teddy bears, bows, life savers etc and a balloon like font identical to the word shown here:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130806031151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KawaiiFontSM_4176.jpg)\n  \nThe word is taken from a pic inside the North American edition. I only have a thumbnail of the international cover.  \nKawaii is not my area of expertise so I am seeking help in IDing the font. If not the exact one, then some close ones.  \nThanks  \nDon \n",

Haley Fiege's vfb embedding settings say \"everything is allowed\" so it would seem o.k. to edit it to lighten the weight to approximate the BBW lettering, to try and capture the creases in letters like the o, and to push letters off a strict vertical axis to get the jumbled together effect.  \nDo we have any other candidates?  \nDon\n\n"

Sniglet is better for the inflated balloon effect, but Boogers is easier to edit than Sniglet.  \nYour suggestion of Blambot has prompted me to also check Comicraft.  \nDon \n"
