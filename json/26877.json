Letters from all three fonts can be used   \ninterchangeably to create just the right style for your needs. We know   \nyou'll find good uses for Operina for invitations to special events,   \narts programs, restaurant menus, and more--we look forward to seeing them!   \n   \nSee the fonts at:   \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/operinaset.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918212527/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/operinaset.html)   \n   \nDownload sample pdf:   \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/files/P22OperinaSample2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918212527/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/files/P22OperinaSample2.pdf)\n\n",
