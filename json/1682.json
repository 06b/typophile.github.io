      "content": "Luciano, the text samples in the PDF look very good, indicating that the lowercase is in a good state. Can you provide some text in a language that uses the letter k? This is the only lowercase letter that looks a little weak. The lower left stroke of the g looks a bit dark compared to the top, diagonal stroke of the lower bowl: try transferring just a little weight between these strokes.   \n   \nThe uppercase has some weight problems: Z, in particular, is very heavy compared to the other letters. Also try making the stem of the J just very slight lighter: it looks darker than the other vertical stems because it is longer. I like the large bowl of the P very much. The middle of the S is a bit heavy.   \n   \nCan you provide a few lines of text set in all uppercase? In the image above and the PDF the baseline overshoot of the C looks extreme, but that may be the effect of seeing it between the B and D.\n\n"

Some of your glyphs are very beautiful.   \n   \nSome things:   \nYour vertical proportions are very good (especially for magazine setting).   \nThe caps are maybe too small. Making them wider is probably best.   \nThe \"a\" and \"g\" are too wide.   \nI'd remove the middle serif from the \"w\".   \nThe \"G\" is too wide.   \nThe \"M\" needs work.   \n   \nI haven't looked at the spacing yet.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "The k looks okay in text, although you could very slightly lower the connection to the upright and make the top diagonal arm reach a little bit further to the right.   \n   \nRandy is right about the horizontals in the uppercase, but don't make them too thin.   \n   \nThe overshoot of the C looks okay in the all caps setting. The overshoot of the D could be reduced by a couple of units top and bottom.   \n   \nI don't necessarily agree with Hrant and Eduardo about making the caps wider. I'm looking at what seems to me a very attractive magazine face, and in that context I think the narrow caps are a good thing. If you make a book version of the face, that would be when to make the caps wider. However, the K should be a bit wider and the G a bit narrower.\n\n"
