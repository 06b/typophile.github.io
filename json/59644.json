  "content": "Greater Albion's Svengali Roman has grown from a single face to a family of four faces:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015035841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Svengali%20Roman%20font%20family_3649.png)\n\nIn addition to the already released regular face, a bold weight has been added, as well as an incised (hand cut) face, and a weathered ‘Newsprint’ face. Try it out for yourself on [Myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015035841/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/svengali-roman/). In the meantime there are some new examples of Svengali Roman in use posted on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015035841/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\n",
