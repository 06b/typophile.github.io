Thanks.\n\nDesigners: (blank), Trademark Info: N/A —\\> this seems to be the case far too often with the Fontshop offerings. Do you happen to know where Holland Title came from and (meant as constructive criticism) is anyone working to fill in these Fontshop blanks?\n\n"

In this case, it’s Monotype Imaging, and [they fully credit Hollis Holland](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119151619/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205066&grab_id=0&page_id=9155&query=holland%20title).

He was an accomplished calligrapher and book jacket designer years before he came to CG.\n\nHere’s a snipet from the archives:\n\n_ **1973** - Compugraphic enters into a new technology with introduction of the VideoSetter® I and II. The VideoSetter has an operating speed in excess of 400 lines per minute, making it particularly attractive to the newspaper market for handling classified advertisements and stock market text, as well as body text. This year marks its first release of a typeface exclusively developed by Compugraphic. Named for its creator, Senior Typeface Designer Hollis Holland, Holland Seminar was promoted for high-quality promotional literature._\n\n"
