Having the dimensions of the other uppercase letters is there is a method to creating this new letter from the existing bunch.\n\nThanks\n\n",

In general, a capital E is a touch wider than an F (about 1.045 times wider in Helvetica, for example), and almost always the right sidebearing is greater. Often the left sidebearing is the same. But at some point, you'll have to dial it in for your font.\n\n"
