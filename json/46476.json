I think the message here for choosing a compliment to Times is: go for strong visual contrast and an equally ubiquitous typeface.\n\nHowever, your client's style is more important than our snipes at their type peccadilloes. Is it mid-century modern furniture? Colonial? Suburban McMansion Faux Neoclassical Victorian Mash-up? TNR is such a non-character for so many viewers, you could probably pair it with any number of sturdy sans, as long as TNR remains at a text size.\n\n"
