I've loved them since I first layed eyes on them in 2006, according to the date on the folder where I religiously kept them. In fact, I have no religion, so this might be exactly what I mean, literally; type is probably the closest thing I have to a religion. :P  \nAnyway, I cannot thank you enough for sharing this amazing work freely. The Fell types really were one of the reasons why I started loving type and wanting to create type in the first place. You rock!\n\nRuben\n\n"

I begun to learn how to build a typeface just after having seen them because I just wanted to use them. And after having digitized them I begun to think about a way to space them (it was so difficult): the seminal thoughts about iKern, the autospacing and autokerning tool I've developed since 2002. I can certainly say that without the Fell Types iKern wouldn't exist: Their typographic “errors” (variable serifs from letter to letter, even inside the same letter, inconsistent heights and slant angles, different weights and many other amenities and lovely strangeties) have pushed me to a deep generalization of the mathemathical model avoiding shortcuts and suggesting paths I wouldn't thought otherwise.</cite>\n\n<cite>For this reason I decided to license the fonts for free. I've received enough. And more: designing typefaces is not my job and, in the end, I didn't design the Fell Types. Peter de Walpergen, Claude Garamond, Robert Granjon did.\"</cite>\n\nThat said: I would like to hear more about why if he has more to say. Also, you could voice your critique of the idea.\n\n"

      "content": "Not everybody who plays the guitar can play the guitar.\n\nFor the beginner it may be unbelievable how someone has achieved good spacing. It takes considerable time and a lot of attempts and mistakes to get an idea of how to do it, and maybe master it. Still this is more or less \"intuitive\", unconscious: being good in doing something is not the same as understanding what one does. The next step is to analyze what the master does and formulate a method. In so far, being creative and creating a machine that does what a creative does is not completely unrelated. And of course once a task is automated, this raises the question, was this task creative at all?\n\nFrom a practical point of view, I do not see why someone should spend days on a task which can as well _and with virtually same results_ be performed by a machine. Would there be a loss if spacing were done by a machine rather by a human being? I cannot tell you a single typeface of which I could say that _its spacing_ exhibits its designer's _creativity_. Rather, some typefaces work, some don't. (In terms of spacing.) The question is not: is spacing/kerning art or technique? but rather: is the applied method ok? It is there that different type designers may have different preferences -- provided that they would ever transform what they merely do into a clear conception!\n\nAnd we should always keep in mind that Gutenberg's one-letter-per-block, one-block-next-to-another paradigm of typography (which implies that the space between two letters is defined by the remaining side bearings) was more or less a necessary evil of this very physical approach to letters/type. Letters _an sich_ do not know side bearings nor kerning, they only know the space inbetween. The real scandal is that digital typography never even dared free itself from merely imitating the one-letter-per-block paradigm. Despite the fact that the digital domain knows no physical constrains. The work of Mr Marini and others could finally free it from outdated paradigms. (Why output sidebearing and kerning tables at all?) Again, what is to be discussed are method and result, but not man vs machine ...\n\n"

      "content": "To put an even finer point on it, many discussions have arisen here about the role of \"white space\", which is exactly what Inigo's program is concerned with. Evading the crucial lessons of spacing sounds initially like a terrible loss in a field where visual discernment has always been crucial. However, this program is not the first attempt to automate the process of spacing and kerning. Though the focus was different, the h-z algorithm Zapf helped develop was intended to produce ideal spacing and kerning of text blocks without direct human manipulation. Though the spacing of a typeface is ideally done by a careful, perceptive human, the presence of a human designer does not guarantee ideal spacing. We've all wished for modules to help us through boring and repetitive tasks in type design, and our software and workflows reflect this. Type design is as much technology as it is art.\n\nI also think Inigo has learned some very interesting things in his experience with the Fell types, things we ought not brush off. Many of us have not had the experience of dealing with highly un-systematic types, though we all appreciate variations and irregularities. The fact is that it is easier than ever for typefaces to be sterile, modular, regular and coldly rhythmic. Cut-and-paste has become a Modus Operandi for too many. I would be very interested to know what the algorithms in iKern are doing and what variables they consider. It might be instructive; might help us remember what to look for.\n\n"

      "content": "To William:\n\n\\> Is IKern a program you sell?\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\\>How does it compare with KernMaster from DTL?\n\nI don't know. Never had the chance to try it! Anyway iKern does autospacing and autokerning at the same time allowing a straight and productive workflow from the design to the font. About the quality I'm confident the output is, at least, adequate. But everyone can judge it by himself. The autokerning stuff rely sometimes upon informations extracted during the autospacing phase. That's why I tend to consider the “only autokerning” a nonsense and I've abandoned three years ago an “only autokerning” iKern version .\n\nTo Kris:\n\n\\> How does it compare to kerning by a human?\n\n\\>\\> I’ve come to the conclusion that spacing and kerning are  \n\\>\\> absolutely not a matter of Art. They’re just a Tecnique.\n\n\\> You could say that about anything! Like playing the  \n\\> guitar, acting, cooking, painting…\n\nHow, I'm very glad you give me the real occasion to say many things. First of all I've to say that for years I have surgically examinated supposedly professional fonts. My conclusion is that only few humans actually are able ro really kern (and space). I'd have to come to the conclusion that a tool like iKern should have suited the needs of the rest of the World. But I've been told that the font industry survive even selling fonts without kerning (and the customers don't even notice!). That said for six years I've tried to analyse the essence of this job and I think that what the few humans do is, in very short terms:  \nfully understand the underlying rules of fitting;  \nhave the capacity, the strength, the time and the will to apply in a coherent and complete manner these rules through all the fonts.  \nI tend to consider this second part of the action more as food for computer. That's why I always heard from anyone involved that kerning and spacing is not, at least, funny. It's normal. We hate repetitive tasks. We tend to be distracted. We like open air. We like many other things.  \nI tend to consider the “full understanding of the rules of fitting” a common quality in many people and not the exclusive gift of a religious caste. And this is the real core question. I don't know at which level the full understanding is. Certainly not in a formal, I would say conscious, level. Otherwise a real usable fitting theory would explicity exist today and we wouldn't here to discuss. What I'm saying talking about iKern is that I think to have found a mathematical model that describes those “underlying rules of fitting”. Am I right? Am I wrong? I'm confident to be right when I'm satisfated with the output iKern produces. I'm not confident when I see something I dislike. But I'm there to make it better. Consider I've sometimes re-elaborated the model just to change a kerning value of two points (I admit it. I'm a geek). But first of all I am confident when other people tell me the output is good, sometimes very good, for some enthusiast perfect. And, as the font industry man would say, I'm confident when I find people willing to pay for this service.  \nTo finally answer I would say that there is no difference between what a human does and what iKern does. But to use myself a metaphor: I'm able to walk. I like it. But I'm often use a car. And a GPS too. And more: the model is not strict. Since autospacing has to be done the whole rhythm has to be reconstructed. And the man (me) says how.\n\nLet's now discuss the “Tecnique” side. I'm actually a good guitar player. I had the fortune to have parents that forced me to study music. The piano seemed to me too much demanding so I fell back on the guitar (girls like guitarists. You know). But I don't consider myself a real guitarist. Because I don't have the music in my heart. I can only mimic. I think that spacing and kerning is like playing the notes written in the outlines. Nothing else. No composition here. Just execution.  \nI'm a decent cook too. But I don't think that nutrition would require Ferran Adrià. My “cuisine” mot is: a cook only needs gram scales (possibly digital).\n\n"

But the most important thing is the model. As my logo cryptically try to express the very core aspect of fitting is not the letter but the white space or, as I tend to think, the void.

But hopefully the program would have enough variables that are adjustable that you could also some batch adjustments, as well as individual ones.\n\nI believe Karsten mentioned somewhere that Lucas de Groot did kerning of triples somehow, which is actually a benefit also, but the whole thing gets quickly out of hand.

Honestly I dislike it and that's why I kerned the font.  \nYou pointed out that the fitting of the “We” couple in Western is too tight. Probably. And I explain why. The first parameter iKern uses is “width”. It's defined for four cases: small vs small (s/s), Capital vs Small (C/s), Capital vs Capital (C/C) and Not Letter. At the time I compiled the Fell Types I was theoretically convincted that a “C/s couple” should have the same width of a “s/s couple”. And I set the input accordingly. Today I've changed my mind and I think that a good starting point for a “C/s width” could be the average of the “s/s width” and the “C/C width” (like I did in the examples in my site). But I say more: I can understand that in the present case with Capitals and smalls so different in weight could be accettable to set \"C/s width\" = \"C/C width2 to let the Capitals more detached (like they where in the metal era). The first line in the example is from the font as is now. The second line follows the last indication. I've made this lesson to show, in practice, that:  \niKern uses (needs) the human factor;  \nthe effort of definition is minimum: there is the possibility to make global choices that are inherited through the font (it's class kerning at the maximum extent);  \na feedback can be part (essential) of the workflow.

The design process is not a unidirectional \"(1) glyph, (2) sidebearings, (3) kerning\".\n\nTherefore, to apply 21st century spacing to facsimile 17th century type forms is inappropriate.  \nOf course, the unspaced Fell italic all-cap setting looks wrong, but it would have looked wrong back in the day, too, and would have been generously letterspaced then, and with discretion, wouldn't it?\n\n"

But this question belongs to one realm (revival ethics), and the question which asks if iKern does a good job belongs to quite a different one (spacing models). It would be odd to criticise iKern because it was applied to the wrong kind of typeface.\n\nI feel reminded of a previous discussions about the goods and bads of DecoType/WinSoft's InDesign plug-in Tasmeem, a layout engine for typesetting Arabic which uses a special font format. Thomas Milo usually presents its capabilities with help of a high-end typeface of a special style. (By the analysis of this style he arrived at the technology, but in the end the technology is suited for any other style too.) To my amusement or regret (depends on my mood) this provoked some critics to blame him for propagating this particular style which they consider outdated -- and disregard the layout engine because of the style of the typeface used for presentations! A layout engine of course is \"mere\" technology and is ignorant of anything like designers' sentiments.  \nSame is true for iKern. If you object to a Fell being kerned at all, then I had preferred if there were no \"automated\" in \"applying _automated_ spacing to pre-designed types\".&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\n\n"

So there goes your argument, k.l.</cite>\n\nVery good. Actually your example _supports_ my argument:  \nLigatures were nothing but a workaround to deal with what I consider the core idea and limitation of the Gutenberg paradigm: that each letter is regarded as a unit, cast on its own block. (For illustration, contrast this with writing which by its very nature is ligated and \"fluid\" as regards black as well as white -- there are no ligatures because _everything_ is potentially ligated.)  \nWhat Gutenberg did was trying to emulate the image of writing, so himself he wasn't aware of what I call Gutenberg paradigm. That Gutenberg's numerous ligatures and abbreviations were finally abandoned from the case however is just a logical consequence, and clarified what this paradigm is about. In so far, from a strict Gutenberg paradigm point of view, ligatures are a reminiscence to writing, a very artificial one, alien to this paradigm.\n\nI am sorry that I was and am not able to make my point more clear. For me it is evident but I admit it took years to arrive there. (And from there, current font technologies are just a subset of what they could be.) As long as you think of type design as filling your preferred font editor's glyph slots with nice outlines, some of them representing single letters, some of them ligatures, some of them diacritic letters, etc, and as long as this works well for you, there is no need to try or adopt an alternative paradigm.\n\nBut this now is really off the topic which was iKern and the Fell type.\n\nKarsten Luecke, KLTF\n\n"

I note that some assumptions about handset type may be incorrect however.\n\nThere are many stellar examples of composition and spacing from the past, right from the beginning, Schoeffer's work on the Gutenberg Bible is an amazing tour de force.\n\nThe transition from Latin based text is largely responsible for the abandonment of ligatures and abbreviations. I worked with a special Latin version of Carter's Miller Text, that included all the characters and ligatures that would have been used in the Aldine work, and it was like being in composition heaven.\n\nThough many historical examples of commercial printing are quite bad, particularly in the 19th century, and that may be the perceived norm, one does need to remember that there were no compositional strategies in place until Tschichold's standardization of typesetting practices.\n\nMetal foundry type in the second quarter of the 20th century (and into the 1960s), especially that produced by the more renown European foundries, was extremely well thought out in the settings. And many foundry fonts did come with alternative kerned capitals, such as a W that did fit tight to the following lowercase letter. Or an A and V that could be adjusted.\n\nKerning was practiced for some long time. Moxon, in 1683, describes a device for shaving letters to fit. Many high-end contemporary letterpress shops routinely kern their type with mortisers and/or glider saws.\n\nGerald\n\n"

Evading the crucial lessons of spacing sounds initially like a terrible loss in a field where visual discernment has always been crucial. </cite>\" I think he hit the nail on the head as he often does.\n\nThis is the question that a user of Igino's sytem has to consider. My interpretation of what he has said so far is something like \"you can use my system to skip ahead and make refinements afterwards if they are neeeded\". This is a tempting idea. But again, if you believe that kerning is not a chore to be dispensed with but a core aspect of type design it is still hard to think of iKern as something to bring into an ideal process. On the other hand, not all typefaces or process' need to be ideal I will admit! Nevertheless, the question remains.\n\nOckham’s razor seems like an odd tool to consider in concert with Gutenburg model of printing which had so very many special versions of letters and so very many ligatures! But this question of fitness of a reference aside, the thing that strikes me is that while your idea may be sound in some respects - that a robust design capable of fitting well with a minimum of fuss has deep utility, ( correct? ); the idea that this is the logical absolute and inevitable model we must consider is something that I ( of course ) am pretty skeptical of. I can sort of see the idea that the Gutenberg process might have an inbuilt tendency towards simplicity over time. That idea is a I think far from being either proved or disproved. In it's favor would be the idea that printed books must have taken on their own validity outside of the context of the written book over time and that once that context was established that the power of economic need would dictate a move to simpler and faster methods.\n\nPart of the reason I object is that I think this idea is what Americans would call \"monday morning quarterbacking\", meaning coming up with explanations and justifications after the fact. It's quality of being \"Ex post facto\" might lead you to the word \"absolute\" in the sense that this model does indeed dominate at the moment. But will that status last? Does it have to? Is it actually best? I am not at all sure about any of these things.\n\nWhen I read Morrison on type design and on Incanumbula and especially on Jenson I get that same feeling. Like I am not reading an incisive theory that explains something in a deep manner but rather that an explanation or story that has the lone virtue of fitting the existing data is being conjured up. Get a bit more data and that story could be tipped over...\n\nReading Van Krimpen give me again, the same feeling.\n\nSimilarly, if iKern is based on fitting certain kinds of forms and has assumptions built into it about what letterforms are probably like ( the story) rather than having a way of sensing them directly, like the Kindersley system did, then it is not going to be a very robust kerning tool.\n\nUnfortunately I still don't quite understand the mechanism of iKern.\n\nMaybe I will eat my words. But that's how it looks to me now.\n\n"
