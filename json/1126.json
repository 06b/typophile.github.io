I have some hunches about what could be the problem, but I'm curious to hear what you all think should be changed.   \nIf you have any suggestions, please tell me. Before I will create the whole family I want that the basic is OK.\n\n<!--attachment: RV_Nordic_pres-15231.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*22.6*Nordic+Narrow+Light*RV%a9Nordic+pres%2epdf --><!--attachment: RV_Nordic_pres-15231.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*22.6*Nordic+Narrow+Light*RV%a9Nordic+pres%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140304210105im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Nordic Narrow Light<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140304210105/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/RV_Nordic_pres-15231.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>RV</b></a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n",

      "content": "Hmmm, I see what you mean, Neil. Do you have any suggestions perhaps on how to spice the Y/y up?   \nAnd yes, I'll definately make a set of lining figures. I want the original type to have the OSF figures because that gives it a little bit flair.   \nYou really think the V is to wide? I agree about the M, N, W. I'll correct them.   \nI'm also thinking about some icons/pictograms or numerals. But I first need some topics on what icons would be sencefull to have in a type like this. Something for later.   \n   \nThe font has a 33 degree angle in the diagonals. Would it be a problem if, by creating the other widths, this angle would change? Because if I stretch the type the angle changes with it. If I correct this the openings in some characters (a, e, p) will become to small, because the endpoint of the angle moved to the right.   \n   \nPerhaps it's me that I want to be more than perfect and can't see that it's finished. I have that problem more often, so...   \n   \nThanks,   \nRen\n\n"
