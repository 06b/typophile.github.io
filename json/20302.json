What is it?_\n\nYou have to realise that this kind of lettering is output device-specific: it is a set of characters that is produced specifically for a certain type of printing machine. This means it has no equivalent in what we know as digital fonts.\n\nOther examples are alphabets available for the stamping machines that produce automobile license plates, for sowing and embroidery machines, for stone engraving et al. It just is a different world. In some rare cases you'll find alphabets that have digital font counterparts, but more often than not they will be unique to that reproduction system.\n\n"
