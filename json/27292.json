That would be a disappointment, considering its lovely form.\n\nFurther, aside from the name, I don't see anything uniquely Spanish about it.\n\n",

The specimen tells me it was based on a type used by Jorge Coci, active in Saragossa in the early 1500's.\n\nIt's a shame the recent Ascender OpenType release of the face didn't include any of the goodies: no smallcaps, no OsFs, no ornaments or borders.\n\n"
