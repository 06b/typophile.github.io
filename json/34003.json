  "content": "I'm looking for an OpenType version of Ehrhardt that has text figures. Does anyone know if such a thing exists?\n\nI see [\"Ehrhardt MT Pro\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131142728/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=433445) on the Monotype site, but it looks like only the Regular weight has text figures. I see a few [Expert weights (Type 1)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131142728/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=243216), but I'm trying hard to buy only OpenType now.\n\nCould anyone that has the Pro version check to see whether the Italic weight has text figures? I've emailed Monotype but no response yet.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

(I much prefer the Linotype or Veer sites for type browsing.)\n\nI gave up on the email and called \"fonts.com\" today; they double-checked and the italic does indeed come with text figures.\n\nAnyone know why only Monotype carries the Pro version? ;-)\n\nTyler\n\n"
