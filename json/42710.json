There are 32 weights/widths, so picking the right one may involve using their test drive, but I think No. 70 looks pretty close to my eye.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Another similar font is [Rhode Medium Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20120124015908/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Rhode&x=22&y=9&sample_text=WALKING%20FOSTER), and it does have the right K, but the uneven arms of the E & F are more like Knockout.\n\nIt may be a customized mix of the two fonts, but more likely it is a customized version of Knockout, if I had to guess.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
