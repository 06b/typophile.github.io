What you then end up with is the same scratches every time you use an character which looks crap.\n\nYou should have a look at some of Vince Frost’s work like on the BIG Magazine covers. Amazing stuff. [www.frostdesign.com.au](http://web.archive.org/web/20090729182940/http:/www.frostdesign.com.au/ \"www.frostdesign.com.au\")\n\nThe best alternative is of course if you get a hold of some old woodtype on ebay and scan them and then vectorize. However I do not know if this is for display use or setting bodycopy?\n\n"
