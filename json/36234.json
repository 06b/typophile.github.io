  "content": "Hi everybody!\n\n1.  \n_Chumbitos_ is an unicase & monospaced ultra-fat typeface I'm working on. Take a look on [**this pdf**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043026/http:/www.fictilia.org/stuff/Chumbitos_070817a.pdf) and tell me what do you think about... ;-)\n\n2.  \nSome days ago, after I've drawn all the basic glyphs -- Caps, lower-case, numbers and some diacritics --, my friend [**Quincunx**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043026/http:/typophile.com/user/14604) told me about some similarities between _Chumbitos_ and [**Deuce**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043026/http:/neutura.org/Deuce.html). In fact, some glyphs are very very similar, but the _intentions_ of mine are far from that, as you can see on the pdf. Well, I don't knew _Deuce_ before to drawn _Chumbitos_, so what do you think about this kind of _situation_? Legally, Ethically, ...\n\nThank you,  \nundr\n\n",

They are not so _consistent_ with all the other glyphs... Maybe I didn't saw it because the '@': it's killing me... ;-D  \nThank you again.\n\n"

      "content": "Well, I already said I liked it! :)  \nAnd I agree with Stephen that similarities are not uncummon. Some of the shapes are almost archetypical in a sense that they can't really be any different because of the grid and general style, which might explain similarities with other typefaces in this style. Which is fine. And your design is different enough.\n\nAs for the 'm', I think the way you constructed the 'w' might give you some ideas.  \nAnd I like the idea of putting the diacritics and accents inside the characters.  \nI'll make a post with more comments on a later time, because I can't right now.\n\nOh, and on a sidenote, on page 2 of your PDF, it says 'cumbitos'... ;)\n\n"

      "content": "After some experimentation and many additions of unnecessary elements, I decided to back to basic and to the original intention of Chumbitos: The less as possible elements _over_ a square to build a glyph. I did a full revision and I'm thinking in release only Chumbitos-Regular and Chumbitos-Bold, without any Alternates. I don't know why, but I think this typeface don't need it with all this ideas behind it...\n\nOn the Regular, I worked always with 10% of the square size for all the elements over the square. On the Bold one, I changed it to 20%, but it affects only some _vertical elements_, leaving all the others unchanged. So, the Bold version don't has all its glyphs different of the Regular, but it offers a considerable increase of weight on use...\n\n[**Here is a pdf**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043026/http:/www.fictilia.org/stuff/Chumbitos_070822a.pdf) to illustrate what I said.\n\nNow I think it needs just some little adjustments and it will be fine to go... ;-)\n\nundr\n\n"
