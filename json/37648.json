  "content": "Dear Typophiles around the world... I’m busy with a research project about Horley Old Style. As you might know, this face was developped in 1922 from Monotype as an answer to Goudy’s successful Kennerley. I guess later (1977?) Robert Norton worked on a revival and today Horley is available as a digitised typeface as well.\n\nIf anybody of you have special background or any information about Horley, the specific designers behind it, Robert Norton or if anybody has access to specimens from the diffrent typefaces (1925, 1977, today....) or if anybody knows where such specimens could be watched... Every little hint or information is very helpful.\n\nThank you very much and have a good time!\n\ncheerz,  \nRoland\n\n [‹ Another logo disaster - Wolff Olins on a roll with Wacom!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905134817/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37529 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontLab problem with naming glyphs ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905134817/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37644 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
