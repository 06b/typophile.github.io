Somehow the unicode is not consistent for all glyphs for all fonts.\n\nI'm thinking of something like 'Paste Special' where you can select all glyphs, copy the unicode from one font and paste special to all other weights thus ensuring consistency.\n\nIs there any way of making it the same for all fonts?\n\n",

When your glyph names are the same, use \"Glyph → Glyph Names → Generate unicode\" in FL Studio to regenerate the unicodes, and they will also be the same in every weight.\n\n"
