  "content": "Hello,   \n   \nit's now half a year that **I am searching for a website that was offering high quality scans (300 DPI) of some really old books** (from the 14th to 19th century I think).   \n   \nAs far as I remember it was in italian or spanish, a kind of an online exhibition of a museum or a foundation. There were italian, spanish, french, german and english books. Per book there were at least 3 scans. Mostly one of the title page, some illustrations and the colophon.   \n   \nAnd I tell you, the illustrations in those books were more than fantastic! As I first saw it I was thinking \"now that's for sure the best way to study old faces online\".   \n   \n**Now, can somebody help me out with the URL?** (I've lost it due to a hard drive crash..)   \n   \nThe only thing that comes close to it is [http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc\\_db/subject\\_library.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522152747/http:/wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/subject_library.html) but it is still miles away of the material offered on the other website.   \n   \nThank you,   \nRoman Schechtel   \n(for german readers: [http://www.designmadeingermany.de/forum.php4?thread\\_ID=3549](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522152747/http:/www.designmadeingermany.de/forum.php4?thread_ID=3549) )\n\n",
