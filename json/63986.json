BUT the prominent use of these letters by the Nazi regime no more than 70 years ago, and it's use afterwards by right wing activists and football hooligans does make use of this kind of letter contaminated/problematic. As type professional it is very important to know the distinction between what is said and how it's said, even when other don't.

He did not like Fraktur and he did not like Tannenberg either. He wanted and needed Antiqua.\n\nWhat about my example with the Door's song The End.

      "content": "Maybe I'm stepping a bit late into this debate.  \nAnyway, Georg, I don't think you can state that Tannenberg simply \"mirrors the epoch - that’s all\".  \nFirst of all, there is the name itself : the SECOND battle of Tannenberg (August 17—September 2, 1914) was a huge victory for Germany against Russia at the beginning of World War I, and was widely perceived at the time as especially significant since it was felt to be a long-overdue revenge on the FIRST battle of Tannenberg (July 15, 1410), where the Polish armies defeated the Teutonic Knights, stopping German expansion in Eastern Europe. Thus, choosing this name for a Blackletter typeface in 1933 clearly hinted at notions of \"German pride\", indeed a significant part of Hitler's rhetoric. It is also telling that other examples of \"Schaftstiefelgrotesk\" include <cite>National</cite> and <cite>Deutchland</cite> (no explanation needed here).  \nSecondly, \"Schaftstiefelgrotesk\" are a conscious effort by German typefounders to find some kind of compromise between traditional Blackletter forms (an integral part of the <cite>Heimatstil</cite> favoured by some of the highest-ranking members of the Nazi party) and Grotesk typefaces promoted by Tschichold's New Typography and Bauhaus designers, at a time when the Nazis themselves hesitated between the two aesthetic camps (modernism was advocated by some as a style which \"would best distinguish the new Germany from the old\", as stated by Steven Heller in <cite>Iron Fists — Branding The 20th-Century Totalitarian State</cite>).  \nFinally, the rejection of Fraktur as <cite>Judenlettern</cite> (Martin Boormann's words, January 3, 1941) comes quite late in the history of the Nazi regime : up to this point, Blackletter was flaunted as the embodiment of \"Germanness\" by Nazi propaganda, even if Hitler himself had a personal taste for Neoclassical forms (in architecture as well as in typography).\n\n"

Especially surprising is that this has even been passed on to young people, whose parents even weren't old enough to live through WW2: some have told me they feel like their opinions on such matters are highly scrutinised. There are those who, perhaps like Georg, seek to break this cycle in their lifetime, but this is not the normal position. I've been in trouble a couple of times with some (perhaps somewhat glib) jokes, which has taught me to think a bit about the feelings I am invoking in saying such things.\n\nOne only has to look at the furor over the publication of [those damned Muhammed cartoons](http://web.archive.org/web/20121128184103/http:/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7247817.stm). Yes, one might say that it was political correctness gone mad, but the fact of the matter is that the cartoonists in question became famous for all the wrong reasons. In other words, your work _should_ be sensitive to such things if your goal is to produce work that invokes the correct responses. Of course, here comes more careful line-treading.\n\n"

Only this victory made it possible to send the troops to the western front, where France with the help of England was attacking Germany.So it was a notation to Germany's pride, how you said it. So, what?\n\nWe know lots of Egyptienne fonts. Named Egyptienne, because Napoleon attacked England in Egypt. All european nations were imperialistic. \"British Empire\" says it clear and loud.\n\nWhen I say Tannenberg was a result of this german epoche, I mean, that this epoche was very national. Germany lost WWI, was pressed under the Versailles contract. The people saw the again upcoming Germany with proud. So Tannenberg mirrored this feeling. The same did the fonts Gotenburg, National, Franken-Deutsch, Herman-Gotisch, Kurmark, Trump-Deutsch. Not all of them were \"New Gothisch\" fonts. But all of it note to be close to the major feeling of this epoche - to think national. I am sure, the foundries marketing departments tried to force it, because like it is today: They want to make profit with their products.\n\nSo: I agree with you. But I said the same before: These fonts are mirrors of the national epoche of Germany. But nothing to do with \"Nazi font\". The Nazi party won the internal national war and ruled Germany for 12 years. But Nazi is not the same as \"national thinking\" is. Berthold Brecht said, Nazism is a way to get absolutely force. I think, that's right. They were criminals, not politicians.\n\n@ murphy.md\n\nYes, its correct what you say. Lots of german younger people (I am born 1955) are ashamed to be germans. I do not agree. I am proud to be a german. I am the \"good german\" and not the f... neo nazi groups, you can find everywhere in Germany. I do not allow them to say \"I am proud to be german\". Germans, who are ashamed of their country give Germany exactly to these neo nazis. I don't. I am not guitly for nothing what happened. But I have a special responsibility for today and for the future. But its my right to love my country in the same way and with the same enthusiasm a guy from France does. And its a big mistake to see all things around 1933-45 being Nazi. Germany was and is much more than 12 years of crime. So Germany was, is and can be proud on the battle of Tannenberg as an english guy on Trafalgar an american on Los Alamos.\n\nHu.... sry, need a cigarette...

They _should_ be proud, especially in the realm of type, where they've made the _best_ fonts, historically and today.\n\nHowever, one key to shedding the shame is _not_ simply ignoring the reality on the ground of what some other peoples -unjustly- think of them.

You can be proud of your own achievements only. Except from that I doubt, that it is true, that many Germans, which were born after the Nazi regime, are ashamed to be Germans because of the sins of their parents or grandparents. The fact, that there are Germans, which go into hysterics, when another German says in the public, that the Swastika is a highly aesthetic sign, has not to do with shame, but with either an unbelievable simple-mindedness or a dishonest political correctness. Or both. Instead of being ashamed of the sins of others or being proud of the cultural achievements of the past, it is needed to invest in education and educational justness, because we have a lot of catching-up to do there. The German educational system is too targeted with regard to career and earning money. There is a tendency to construe culture as a means to an end, as luxury, as pastime or as prestigious object in Germany.\n\n<cite>But Nazi is not the same as “national thinking” is.</cite>\n\nIt is not the same, because the Nazis were trans- or overnationalists.
