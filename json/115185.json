For I am a graphic designer to earn my money and at the moment I have quite a hard time to stand up.  \nI would need kind of a sponsor ;-) to keep on designing fonts for as you certainly know it is such an intense breath and time taking work. Yet, I still love it and will go on as soon as I can.  \nMaybe I am too much into web design right now. So hard to tell these times which direction is the right one to go.  \nFeel free however to comment everything. I promise to put more pictures here over the time.\n\nStefan\n\n"
