  "content": "OK, so it's not really a contest. As FontLab would kick TypeTools ass.\n\nHowever it's time for me to purchase some font software for use at home (I'm still rocking Fontographer at work....gotta love them whoosh and bleeps!) but I'm wondering if TypeTool would be suitable for use at home, or is it gonna be a case of tying a hand behind my back for the sake of a few hundred quid?\n\nObviously, it down to what I intend to do, but; I don't want to count anything out. I have grand intentions for my sketches and scribbles and would be super vex if I found something I desperately want is missing from the cheaper option. So I'm interested in full featured opentype with ligatures galore, serious kerning tools, and also a heavy duty proofing system...and quite probably in the future numerous things I don't understand yet.\n\nSlightly random, but I'm definitely a freehand tool style fan, as opposed to Illustrator style method of handling points etc. Do either lean towards one of those methods?  \nFrom what I've picked up reading the forum, a majority of you use FontLab, I rarely see anyone discussing TypeTool. I guess it's case of you get what you pay for?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice imparted, and apologies if there's already an existing thread discussing this.  \nPeace y'all!\n\n",

Eventually I was sold on the fact that FontLab's interpolation could take the Regular and Black faces I had done and instantly produce the corresponding Bold for me with very little cleanup needed. After I upgraded, I found that I had put a whole lot of unnecessary work into many things that would have been a lot quicker and easier with FontLab.\n\n"

They support us, just as we support them. FontLab employees visit online forums, hold lectures and workshops at virtually every conference, and help sponsor events, too. Many of the changes they build into their products are based on feedback from paying customers. I think that a company like that is worth my support, and I'm proud to be one of those using their software.\n\n"

I only meant to remind end users to keep an open mind and not disregard the competition out of hand. Even in a niche market, competition is healthy for keeping product development and maintenance fresh and creative.\n\n"
