This time, assuming Trend Hand Made Ltt is for 'QUALITY' and 'GOODS', that let us:  \n- 'ANNE & GLEN'/'NAVARRO': 3 /E, 4 /N, 2 /A and 2 /R, all different so most probably hand-drawn  \n- 'Far web': as usual close to [That's Font Folks](http://web.archive.org/web/20141006211010/http:/www.dafont.com/thats-font-folks.font)\n\n"
