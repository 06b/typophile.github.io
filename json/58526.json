Does anybody know which typeface is used for these indications? I do NOT need typefaces used for writing musical notation!!! because there isn't any \"a\" in it. I need a typeface that looks like the one in which piano, forte and mezzo-piano are written.\n\nI will attach how they look here.Pay attention that they are written in CURSIVE so I need my \"a\" in cursive as well:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653im_/http:/typophile.com/files/400px-Dynamics_svg_4146.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653im_/http:/typophile.com/files/6d9f75b5188c8824a1254dae144bf36e_4648.jpg)\n\n",

Many Bodonis/Didots don't have the soft/\"scripty\" instrokes in the italics; but then [some](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/baskerville/) [Baskervilles](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves/bold-italic/waterfall.html), which would seem like good matches otherwise, have the semi-ascending \"p\".\n\nHere are a few faces whose bold italic cuts look like they might work:  \n [Scotch Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/)  \n [Century 731](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-731/)  \n [Berthold Bodoni Old Face BQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/bodoni-old-face-bq/) (quirky \"p\")  \nAlso nice: [Teimer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150306084653/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/teimer/) (no foot serif on the \"p\")\n\n"

However, Altaira makes some good suggestions, so hopefully one of those is close enough.\n\n"

There's really no way to tell that by staring at a single \"a\".\n\n"
