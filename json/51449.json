  "content": "For those who are unaware, Igino Marini has developed what he calls \"Ikern,\" a program/service/concept that generates kerning for type. According to most everything I've read about it, the entity that is \"Ikern\" works quite well. But it raises questions for me.\n\nFirst (and should he visit this site perhaps he could provide a response), Mr. Marini has been particularly vague when it comes to, well, pretty much everything other than generic explanations of the hows and whys of IKern, choosing instead to focus more on the positive reviews given by designers for whom IKern has been successful.\n\nSince these are designers I would tend to believe, I can only assume Mr. Marini has developed what to some could be an extremely valuable program/service/concept. The only problem is, as of today IKern is still very much the man behind the curtain. And as far as I can tell, the only real way to find out anything about it is to contact Mr. Marini directly via email.\n\nAm I the only person who feels uncomfortable about this? All I really want to know are the essentials: is this or will this become \"software,\" available for purchase at some point? If it's a \"service\" only, what are the costs? What is the turnaround time? How in general terms does the program/service work?\n\nI also am one who believes Mr. Marini has created something that stands a chance of becoming quite successful in a variety of ways, but for my own personal reasons I simply don't feel comfortable going on fishing expeditions, regardless of how friendly the fish might be. Not just in this case, but at all. Therefore, does anyone have the kind of basic information on IKern I've asked above?\n\nAdditionally, if IKern was able to produce quality results - and I have no reason to doubt it does - would it be something you'd use? Would you buy it if it was released as software? I just find the whole thing intriguing but strangely mysterious.\n\n",

Igino Marini has contributed to two or three Typophile discussions and answered this and other questions already.\n\nRe _generic explanations of the hows and whys_:  \nAs far as can I see, iKern is based on abstract ideas about spacing. A description of this tends to be \"abstract\" too. Yet the [description](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232501/http:/ikern.com/k1/?page_id=9) is not abstract-as-business-talk but abstract-as-technical. (Designers hate abstraction, I know.)

Speaking for myself only, I can say that I was surprised how good iKern's results are. (To put it this way: After trying test words on the MyFonts site I think that iKern may help you improve the spacing of Morning Sans.)\n\nOther issues have been dealt with by beejay and others already.\n\nIf you feel more comfortable with an application that you can install on your own computer, there also is [KernMaster](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232501/http:/fonttools.org/). Whether service or application or manual work, or a combination of two or all three, really depends on you, your expectations, or how much you want to control everything.

This is said on the website.\"\n\nI realize it's a service in regards to interaction between Mr. Marini and a designer. My question was more along the lines of, does he go into a font and kern it after applying some script/formula/whatever, or has he created actual software for it? I'm thinking in terms of compatibility here.\n\n\"After trying test words on the MyFonts site I think that iKern may help you improve the spacing of Morning Sans.\"\n\nNo kidding ... I totally suck at kerning and spacing. But not for lack of lengthy, frustrating effort. What especially drives me nuts is the difference in the appearance of kerning just between two different applications. If I test the kerning in Quark, it's almost guaranteed to look different how it appears in Microsoft Works. And that's just kerning. Even checking the spacing in Notepad vs. Wordpad is mind-boggling. All of which of course fails to even mention how it all looks in print. In many ways it's like a house of cards. As an aside, I think you'll see an ongoing correlation between my confidence and knowledge in kerning with the cost of each released typeface.\n\n\"I can’t design a typeface without taking its spacing into account, and often adjust the shape of letters to address spacing problems.\"\n\nI'd love to hear some examples of this. I would assume this also means you often adjust the spacing to address problems with the shapes of letters, correct? Just curious, because relying on one without the other, in my mind, makes one more important than the other.\n\n\"Do not invest money trying to find short-cuts. Work hard. For a long time. It will be worth it in the long run.\"\n\nI work very hard and am definitely improving at it, if not due to sheer repetition. However I'm not sure I'd call effective automated kerning a \"short-cut.\" I wouldn't call it the end all, be all either. At this point I'm still trying to feel my way around because I see so many different avenues both taken and available. For example, I've seen highly talented designers turn over an entire typeface to be kerned by another individual, who then does it manually and not by applying automation. Is that considered a short-cut? If I had a partner who was a kerning whiz but didn't like drawing letters, would teaming with him/her be a short-cut? There are all kinds of considerations and approaches; and while I continue to grind away at learning the concept as you suggest, ultimately my goal is discovering what works the very BEST, all things taken into account.\n\n"

Just curious, because relying on one without the other, in my mind, makes one more important than the other._\n\nAn example of adjusting the shape of a letter might be changing the position or size of the ear or the bottom loop on a two-story lowercase \"g\". When it stands alone, it might look great, but it might not fit well next to other letters, and cause gaps or crowding.\n\nKerning is meant to address problems with spacing letters with irregular profiles. Some letter shapes have unavoidably irregular profiles (T, L, Y, A, etc.). Sometimes these shapes can be altered to lessen the need for kerning.\n\nI don't see how anyone can design a typeface by only considering the shapes of the letters in isolation. Characters in typefaces don't exist to be seen in isolation, they are meant to look good next to each other. Spacing is not more important than character design, or the other way around. They should ideally be considered simultaneously.\n\n"

There’s no reason to assume that no preliminary spacing is being done by people working this way. I see no suggestion on the part of Igino or curious designers that automated process are not being performed in a vacuum and that if a pair doesn’t work when the spacing is generated, that the flaw goes unfixed. Just like when using a computer to interpolate weights, autospacing is still going to need watching. But it does allow for designers who can’t be font designers full-time to finish typefaces in much less time, and perhaps do a better job than they would if they can only fit in time between work/kids/etc..\n\n"

      "content": "Okay, so that was a bit of a straw man.\n\nWhen I started making digital fonts, I would draw the characters in Illustrator and then import them into Fontographer to do the spacing. I didn't realize until I started using FontLab and had to abandon working in Illustrator (because Illustrator import was seriously deficient back then--it's better now), that I was making a lot of work for myself by separating the drawing from the spacing. When I draw a font now, I keep the metrics window open and space the font at the same time I'm drawing it. When I'm done with the drawing, I've also done most of the spacing. The only spacing step left is the kerning. The only reason the kerning is done separately is because it has to be done systematically. If you do it as you go along, it's easy to overlook combinations. Plus, you can't know what the problem combinations are until you get the normal spacing and drawing finalized.\n\nTo me, it's all one organic process. When I'm finished, everything is just the way I intended. I love finding ways to save time and effort, and I use every short cut I can, but not on the design part. I see spacing primarily as a design activity, not a routine task I can leave to an algorithm.\n\nI'm not saying there's no value to Ikern or other auto-spacing/auto-kerning services or applications. For some situations (maybe yours), it probably would save time and effort. I just can't imagine working that way.\n\n"

I really think there is an enigma: why Mr.Miller has spent more time on this thread than he would have spent writing me directly? For the other readers I could copy and paste at this point: on the very first page of my site I wrote: “I’d be glad to let you test iKern”. After everyone's own eye, testimonies are what more nearer to the direct experience I can conceive. I would like all the type designers I worked with would describe their experience. Some did and I thank them. Some don't want to go public this way. And I can't blame them: there's no lack of judges. And people ready to put in a bad light other people's work.  \nHas anybody experienced the whole iKern's process so to say that feedback between metrics and shapes is impossible or adversed? Karsten tested iKern and his opinion is important for me. Who said that using iKern means designing without sidebearings in mind? In my site I wrote: the designer remains responsible for “having primed” the metrics themselves. iKern is just a tool: it won't add originality, style, expertise or mastery. It will serve you with the best metrics possible whenever you want. For your utility and advantage only. Usually I send 1 or 2 intermediate versions. Lately I sent 9 final versions in a period of 2 weeks. It's not to push a button.\n\nTo Mr. Simonson: obviously when letters have to touch, design and spacing are the same thing and it's not the iKern's game, but... One year ago I've been challeged to space a font with letters some touching and some not. In that circumstance I added instructions to selectively force contacts and change sidebearings accordingly so to have no kerning. That development stopped there because it was just a trick really out of the core concept and less elegant than just setting manually. About adjusting shapes for letterfitting purposes. I have in mind the Fell Types: a good result can be achieved even with some of the most technically wrong typefaces ever. Are you sure that, if one would dare to “optimize” them, they would still shine? You also wrote: “I see spacing primarily as a design activity, not a routine task I can leave to an algorithm”. I wrote on my site explanations, and I will add more and more, trying to make understand that iKern is like a car, not an automatic pilot. It's alternative to the feet, not the brain.\n\nTo Mr. Reynolds: You wrote: “The way to properly space a font is to do it yourself”. Do you think that the type designers fully satisfied of my work are less competent than you? How would you consider a type company willing to “invest money” in a “shortcut sad to look for” like iKern?\n\nIgino Marini\n\n"

Rather there are two issues discussed at the same time:\n\n(1) _Designing type._  \nAn experienced designer does work as Dan, Mr Lozos and Mr Simonson describe, he designs with both black and white parts in mind. And of course he would space letters as part of the design process, to determine the overall rhythm, and be able to evaluate the word image and check individual letterforms' integrity.\n\n(2) _Learning to design type._  \nBefore even considering to use any automatism, one should have learned -- the hard way -- what spacing and kerning is about. And this is what Dan wrote: \"The way to learn how to properly space a font is to keep designing and spacing new fonts.\" There is no way around it. One doesn't _learn_ by being served results nor by reading one or two books about type design.\n\nAs to (1), Igino acknowledges this.  \nAs to (2), Igino's concern is not teaching type design but spacing letters.\n\nRelying on automatism or service -- what about human assistants? -- still requires that a designer knows what he does and wants. He must look at the work and criticise. Of course one cannot criticize without having trained the eye before which, again, requires practice, not just being served results or reading books.\n\nIn so far, I do not see any controversy here. The point that is of more interest to me is another one: That in type design praxis one may not get around making use of some kind of automation, in the long run.\n\n"

On the other hand, I would express my skepticism. First of all, a large type foundry is unlikely to enjoy giving a typeface to space and/or kern to an individual using their own software. If in XX years, that foundry wanted to reproduce the workflow, and said designer/service were no longer in business, that would be bad. Second of all, many typefoundries are proud of their spacing and kerning habits, because they produce a sufficient level of quality across their product range.\n\nPersonally, as a typeface designer (and I am one, albeit a young one), I do not see the benefit in any method of spacing and kerning other than spending lots of time doing it yourself.

When foundries release designs produced by external designers, they still stand behind the data, it is part of the brand they work with. While each font in a foundry may have been designed by separate designers, the fonts are still produced and released uniformly. A foundry may have an \"art director\", who looks over designer submissions and makes suggestions for improvement. It has long been the case that many designers do not submit one round of completed files, but several different, improving versions. When a foundry or a library releases a new typeface design, the fonts represent a process between the designer and the foundry. Even if the foundry does not do the spacing and the kerning (and they shouldn't), they still do care how their fonts are spaced and kerned, and how they appear in print, onscreen, etc.\n\n(1) It is always important how products you distribute come into being. Companies with traditions or with \"long tails\" very often go back into their archives. Perhaps a custom client wants to have a version of a typeface, with just slight variations, or more weights/styles/etc. It is good to be able to go back into the native files, and be aware of how things were produced, as well as to be able to repeat these results (or at least closely repeat them). Sure, you could re-kern a font so that it had the same values as an iKerned font. But if a foundry used iKern for all its new releases, and it then canged the character set of a font five years later, it would ideally want to send the new font data back to re-iKerned before its re-release. With one man operations, this is difficult to guarantee.\n\nI should state that of these two points, number two would be more important to me if I were a foundry/distributor/reseller/etc. than number one.\n\n"

There simply is no difference between iKern output and manual output, in formal terms, both is a kern feature, i.e. kerning + class information. If you expand the glyph set, you'll end up doing some kerning additions, regardless of who/what the kerning in the first place.\n\n"

I'd get all excited about the whole thing and find out I couldn't afford it.\n\nIt would be different if I knew IKern might be released as software, at which point even if I couldn't afford it at first I'd at least be able to rearrange my already minimal finances and \"splurge.\" I guess my whole point, then, is with more up-front information, many of my questions could be answered without the need to disclose any proprietary information. I'd suspect there are many people who might consider this service but would be embarrassed should they realize it was not affordable for them; and those same people might not feel comfortable with accepting any \"service\" for nothing.\n\n2.) I thought this comment was profound: \"This first time I felt I had to do it all to develop my eye; in future I would judge a computer-generated result better.\" I believe this is important as well because no one is saying designers are frothing at the mouth to completely eliminate the kerning process via automation. I think most if not all simply feel like they have a better chance at success, kerning-wise, if they are provided a \"launching pad\" so to speak and then make adjustments from there.\n\nBesides, the bottom line is this: even for those who insist on doing things manually, I would think amidst a thousand kerning pairs there would have to be at least a few identical ones between your manual work and that of a program. And if that's the case, then how is it different to kern a typeface with X amount of space between characters (pre-kerned) and Y amount of space between characters (after automated kerning is applied)? Even if the latter was off, certainly it would seem to have pointed a designer in the right direction. I can't imagine IKern creating a +44 kerning figure to a pair you'd actually kern at -50. However if IKern generated a value of -26, wouldn't you still be closer to the final manually generated value than if you'd started at zero?\n\nIn the end it's all about analyzing - be it what IKern produces or what you do manually. I think if one were to fully understand the results IKern generates and adjust as needed - even if it requires adjusting every single potential pair - in the end you'll still have the kerning you want for your typeface. As for me, if obtaining the best kerning for a font required me to sing the national anthem and manually kern only the letter \"G,\" I'd be at \"OH say can you see,\" before anyone knew it.\n\n"

If Ignio can't see that or admit it, that's his problem, but it shouldn't be Dan's problem.\n\nDo you people think you can handle that? Evidently you can't deal with it without abreacting, since the response has not been rational, and typically full of logic holes. I don't think I am asking or driving at a lot. It isn't exactly harsh criticism. I'm trying to reason with you guys, and it looks like at least one of you is determined to turn a polite discussion into a pissing match.

If there is an 'enigma' it is: why every time the word iKern appears on Typophile the same discussion raises? Since nobody questions the quality of its output, then is the context that have to be wrong. The metrics are in charge of the designer when he designs and also of the typographer when he set: these are the latest remarks. Every time cristicisms consist in traditional paradigmas applied to a process that's different and there's no way I could let envisage that difference. There is no discussion when someone says: I did so for years so this is the right way. It's just like writing posts in the critique section without having seen the fonts “discussed”. This is what I don't like. Anyway I'm the first to admit that my communication could be not enough. I've already begun to write new texts focused on these themes that, I'm sure, will make the picture clearer. Just wait. In the between I keep asking: test and judge yourself. If we were to find two parties in this thread they would be, in the end: those who didn't test iKern and those who did. Is this meaning something?\n\nIt seems to me that Dan essentially described Linotype that surely have one of the most, if not the most, wide and structured “production department”. On the other side there are one-man companies that probably don't sell licenses to institutions, banks or similar (for the moment). All the rest is in the between. I think that spacing and kerning are costs in any case. I can only say that to have, for example, an 800 glyphs font spaced and kerned in a few hours could make some difference somewhere. I'm not only referring to costs and timelines (that are money too). I'm referring to the fact that this possibility could shift the (market / dimensions structure) ratio and the (quality / dimensions structure) ratio to higher levels.\n\nAbout iKern being a service: I don't think it will be a service the way it is today forever. iKern consists of two parts: an engine and a post processing module. The tuning of the engine really depends on the glyphs' shapes. The typographical choices are mainly done inside the post-processing module. I wouldn't be worried to give it away as a program so that designer could craft their own fonts by themself. Or maybe one day as a plugin for InDesign or Quark. Who knows? It will be the argument of one of my next texts.\n\n"

Sorta like, \"This a light bulb and it creates light through electricity. Though in the test stages, we expect it to be released for general consumption by the public in X years/months, at an approximate cost of $X.XX.\" Or, \"we plan to provide light bulbs to everyone who'd like to have one before the end of the year 1903, at a cost of $X.XX per month, or X.XX per usage hour.\" As it is now, all that's being said is, \"We've got this thing, a light bulb, that will light your home like nothing before it.

After all, I did not want to dampen anyone's reputation (especially Igino's, whose name in fact was so often misspelled in this thread that it sounds really humiliating).\n\nBut - just for the matter of discussion: you can in fact compare the results of iKern and KernMaster in quite simple way: take a typeface that is known to be kerned with iKern; save the kerning to AFM and strip the values to have a set of kern pairs to load into KernMaster. Then try to kern the same font. With same set of kern pairs I think you can judge which one is better.\n\nI have to admit Fell Types are not the best examples to use, but the results with same list of kern pairs differ substantially. I have done this comparison quite long ago, and I haven't kept the results, but sometimes KernMaster offers negative values where iKern has calculated positive ones for the same pair. So, I trust the intentions of the developers of such algorythms, but no software is perfect.\n\nPersonally I do not feel comfortable outsourcing kerning work, and although it is a tedious task, I often rewrite so much the KernMaster results that I ask myself why I attempted to automate the kerning in the first place. Of course I heavily suck in spacing and kerning, so I need a crutch to get the thing halfway, but I do not rely on such software that much, so I still do the spacing/kerning by hand - not least to improve my skills.\n\nPersonally I would prefer seeing iKern at least as a web-based service, served by scripts on a webserver, if Igino does not want to distribute it as a software. I would prefer to do the things myself, alter some settings and see the results in real-time. But after all, this is Igino's work, so the decision about how it should be used is left to him. If iKern was offered as a software, surely I would try to scrape my savings and 'splurge' (hope this happens someday). Until then, I'm not that much interested - just curious.\n\n"

In March 2008 I read the\"from Moleskine to market\" article on iLT from Kris Sowerby where he mentioned he did his kerning with the help of Metrics Machine from Tal Lemings. I tried to contact Type Supply, but again didn't receive a response. Karstens site put me on the trail of DTL Kernmaster, which I thought I should keep i mind because it looked like a great option. When I was working on a new version of Anivers Igino contacted me via my blog and I recieved a reworked version of my earlier Anivers regular. I wasn't aware at that moment that iKern could also do auto-spacing. Igino was able to capture the spirit of Anivers with a spacing and kerning that made it sing. That really convinced me and we decided to collaborate on the iKerning of the complete Anivers family. In the process different versions were send to and from and always I felt I was in control of the workflow.

So if I had to spend six years developing a project to make some money being this project an autometrics tool then I wouldn't be that smart. If I wanted more money I would have worked more. Just simply. I spent a lot of time on iKern because I don't sleep too much! But, mainly, because it satisfied an inner exigence. I've conjugated an ideal of beauty, simplicity, essentiality, lightness and truth with logic, method and complexity. My arid talents. I've found my personal way to create something. It still makes me somewhat happy. This is the real reason. What's more I'm also an engineer. That's why I had to make something that works well. Having this thing in my hands it seemed natural to me to propose type designers to enjoy. I thank Chris for his wish of success. My success already is when the iKern's output is defined “fantastic”, “amazing” and so on by everyone used it. My success is when someone thanks me for having solved his problem. My real satisfaction is when Jos says: “Igino was able to capture the spirit of Anivers with a spacing and kerning that made it sing”.  \nI have already said that today iKern is a service.

Not in this phase when I have still a lot to do defend my job itself! I still think the service it's a good way. On my site I've tried to explain, and I will do more, why it's not a conceptual error to conceive an intermediate figure between the type designer and the typographer. Type designers and typographers permitting! About the costs. I have to say it's not me who decided my basic fee. So I'm confident it's correct. I say basic fee because I keep the freedom to decide case by case.
