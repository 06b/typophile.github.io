I am sure the same happens to many of you all too.\n\nI am just curious of everyone's opinion of the drop shadow.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [nav\\_logo4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312040540/http:/typophile.com/files/nav_logo4.png) | 3.88 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Drop shadows have a purpose, usually to add contrast between letters and background. Google's primary-color theme stuck them with a yellow **o** that disappears into a white background unless you give it a shadow.  \nDrop shadows used to be laborious (and therefore expensive) to make, so designers didn't use them very much. When PageMaker, Quark, and Photoshop made drop shadows available at the click of a mouse, designers and designer wannabees went crazy putting drop shadows on _everything_. (The same thing happened with gradient fills.)  \nProfessors and art directors who lived through the Great Drop Shadow Epidemic of the early 90s often have a phobia about them, but you have nothing to fear if you practice safe specs.\n\n"

Use it well and it will look ok, but 90% of the time it will look amateurish. Personally I can't really pull it off so I tend to tell my client that.\n\n"

The search portals at the time when Google first appeared were slick, busy, techy looking pages then Google came along with its simple search box.\n\nIt _looked_ like the logo had been knocked up in thirty seconds using a pirated copy of Word by a spotty Jolt-drinking adolescent who dreams in HEX algorithms.\n\nI used to think drop shadows could look great, making text float above a page. It's so hackneyed and worn-out now though. Like Nick I'd only really consider using them to help text stand out over a busy picture.\n\n"

It is sometimes useful to drop in what is effectively a soft outline around type to improve contrast over a busy background.\n\nIf it's done gently enough, most would hardly notice it's there. Too many people, though, are not so delicate in their use of these effects.\n\n"

      "content": "From the view point of the sign industry, it is always best to create a basic version of any logo without effects. At some point, your client is going to want a sign. If it is a flat, digital print on a substrate, soft drop shadows and textures etc. are not an issue. If it is going to be a back lit sign, or routed sign these special effects pose a problem. If your logo doesn't really look good without the effects, it isn't going to look that much better routed out of brushed aluminum, mounted on a brick wall. Exterior lighted signs with special effects generally turn into visual noise from any distance. Designers don't generally take these conditions into account when creating these really cool effects.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[_...from the Fontry_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312040540/http:/www.thefontry.com/)\n\n"

Likely more the fact that I happen to work in a mediocre design company that's stuck in a \"desktop publishing\" style rut where my boss once told me something to the effect of \"we aren't here to make innovative design\" and how he has a certain \"look\" for the design we produce at our studio. Sure I'm not totally satisfied with the way the company works and that is also part of the problem, but at the end of the day I have to pay the bills like everyone else. Two and a half years later I've found that the design we output has actually risen in quality, which I'm proud to mention. Still little of it has made it's way to my portfolio due to lack of concept.\n\n@jwchen&nbsp;touché!\n\n"

I also added a \"casing\" (is that what you call it?)--a hard white line, technically a drop shadow too, between the type and the vignetted shadow. That can give a vignetted shadow more \"pop\", so that it can be quite discreet--light in tone and without much spread--and yet still do its job.

Blackletter for a newspaper masthead can be a cliché, but the drop shadow gives it a fresh look.  \nBlackletter is so unlike the letterforms that modern English speakers are used to reading that we often see it as a decorative pattern before we see it as words. For some reason I don't completely understand, the drop shadow makes the masthead easier to read as words.\n\n"
