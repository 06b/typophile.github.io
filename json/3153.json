The \"War is Over\" ad campaign he and Yoko did was brilliant. Part of the strength of his songs was their recognition of his imperfection, he was a jealous guy and not afraid to admit it.   \n   \nThe text in the image file at the top of this thread was taken from an army recruitment ad (complete with missing apostrophe). Lennon may have been rich, but he never went to war or started one. I wanted to see how it would look.   \n   \nAnd it seems that typographic culture completely overwrites any graphological status (the personality or politics of the writer) that may reside in handwriting. In other words, even if you know Lennon's politics, you just see \"natural\" sloppy handwriting, in a sloppy font. And the context in which the type works, ie the layout and the images it works with, creates far more meaning than can ever be inferred from the script.   \n   \nIt's like we've spent many centuries investing subtle differences in typeface with particular meanings (type as formalized writing?), but perhaps now what we're trying to do is figure out something similar for un-formalized scripts -- that may be one reason why they're so popular as fonts.\n\n"
