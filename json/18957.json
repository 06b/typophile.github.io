The spacing sorts was meticulously digitized from hand set sources including ATF and Lanston type. We performed research in vintage printing shops to develop this indispensable type setting tool.\n\nThe cost of such a precision assortment of spacing materials in lead, copper & brass from the 1912 ATF catalog was over $10 (approx. $188 in 2006, adjusted for inflation). Order your piece of type history now! We are offering this digital asset for only $19.95.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/spacing\\_sorts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809002343/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/spacing_sorts.html \"http://www.p22.com/lanston/products/spacing\\_sorts.html\")\n\nBest Regards.  \nP22 Type Foundry  \n [http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809002343/http:/www.p22.com/ \"http://www.p22.com\")\n\n",
