In addition, they add further distortion to create variable letter forms. Now, while it is well done and puts captcha efforts to good use, there are still potentially interesting results that can be created via this contest.\n\nSo, is it possible to create a font that humans can read but computers can't (or have extreme difficulty with) without the added benefits conferred via reCAPTCHA? Ultimately, nothing we create will be able to stand up to a program written specifically for that font, but there is still plenty of room for creativity and kooky concepts.\n\n"

Clever fonts for captcha don't work. You can instruct the program to look for certain patterns in the text so as long as those don't change, it's really not complicated to break the captcha  \n2. Animated captchas don't work either because you can easily extract and merge all frames in a GIF.\n\nSo the only valid concept thus far is to have a set of rules from which you can generate fairly different shapes so that a single program cannot deduce the rules.\n\n"
