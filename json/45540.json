The script (Marvin Berry) is harder to match, but there are a number of fonts in Part 7 of my Script Font ID Guide that are possibly close enough. I looked mainly for the M and B, then for a similar ’r’ style. Closest choices to me were: [Sarah Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143245/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg6.html), [Swingdancer](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143245/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg7.html), [Snapper Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143245/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg8.html), and [Nitro DNA](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143245/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg10.html) (if you stretch it vertically).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
