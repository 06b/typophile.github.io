If anyone could help me out, it would be greatly appreciated - all the handwritten fonts I have come across lack the neatness and structure of this one.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130409102751im_/http:/typophile.com/files/handwrittenfont_4212.jpg)\n\n",

It's not nearly as condensed as the sample above, though.\n\n[This](http://web.archive.org/web/20130409102751/http:/type.fargoboy.com/) (Pablo Skinny) is somewhat more similar to the sample in proportion, and seems to be based on the work of that same lettering artist who did the Strangelove titles.\n\n"
