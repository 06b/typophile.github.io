Its just one page really.\n\nThis is what it looks like right now: [http://img.skitch.com/20100219-tpjdn2re3sbmsnps8qn46cph5w.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100224082421/http:/img.skitch.com/20100219-tpjdn2re3sbmsnps8qn46cph5w.jpg \"http://img.skitch.com/20100219-tpjdn2re3sbmsnps8qn46cph5w.jpg\")\n\nI am pretty satisfied with it already though I dont really know what I am doing HTML wise (nor typograhphy wise haha).\n\nI'd appreciate if some of you could share their knowledge and help me to further improve the design. Which web font for instance do you think works the best with Gotham Bold?\n\nThanks. Jake.\n\n",
