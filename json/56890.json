  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been doing some research to find a typeface to match my 1946 chris-craft race boat that I am currently renovating. I haven't found the right one yet though. When it comes to typefaces I realize it was popular with sans-serifs and bold display type. Which is not too bad but I want something with a bit more edge. So either that or if anyone could put me in the know of some hand lettering inspiration/fonts popular in the 40s?\n\nLooking forward to some input, thanks!\n\n-  \nMax\n\n",

      "content": "Wouldn't script be too similar to the Chris Craft logo?  \nWhy not have an all caps roman type (sans or serif) to contrast with the logo?  \n [Stellar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/stellar/) is an interesting mid-century American face, a little more animated than Optima.  \nI like the look of colored lettering on wood, but with a fine gold outline, the metallic effect acting as a buffer zone.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick, the CC logo goes on the hull side, and doesn't really interfere with the transom type I think. Stellar is an interesting choice but perhaps more for a cruiser kind of boat.\n\nI'll try to explain what I am looking for...\n\nFirst please have a look at th boat. One of the smaller pleasure crafts/ski boats that CC built at that time. One of the models were named rocket and had a hand drawn rocket silhouette on the hullside. My boat will hopefully look [something like this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/www.mlvr.com/cc/carrot.jpg) one day. The rocket model: [http://www.mlvr.com/cc/cc2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/www.mlvr.com/cc/cc2.jpg)\n\nMy intention is to have a simple, kind of naive and cartoon-esque feeling on the type. That's why I am looking at hand lettering - to add that homemade look to it. Here's some references of what I'm into:  \n'Thunderbolt' [http://www.mlvr.com/cc/thunderbolt.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/www.mlvr.com/cc/thunderbolt.jpg)  \n [http://www.mlvr.com/cc/type1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/www.mlvr.com/cc/type1.jpg)\n\nThe name of the boat is Libertine and will perhaps be typed with year i.e. \"Libertine '46\" and followed by \"STOCKHOLM\" where it is located, set in a complementing sans-serif.\n\nWhat do you think about Charbonne, any of the oblique styles: [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/charbonne/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/typeart/charbonne/)  \nOr [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/superheterodyne/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/superheterodyne/). When it comes to scripts I like these, without none of them being the right one: [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/alphabetsoup/metroscript/) and [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/coffee-service/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093815/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/coffee-service/).\n\nCheers,  \nMax\n\n"
