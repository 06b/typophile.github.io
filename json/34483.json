I was browsing through some of the fonts mentioned here on the forum and quite liked Bickham Script Pro and Avalon but it's rather far from Garamond and this logo (the latter could be amended though):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113073557im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RN_flower_4194.jpg)\n\nAny ideas?\n\nAL\n\n",

      "content": "Garamond is a rather formal (Classic) typeface, so I am assuming that you are thinking of a rather formal script (Bickham and Avalon are a mix, with Avalon less formal, in my opinion). However, your logo has a more modern, casual look to it (and it's nicely done, by the way). Which way do you want to go?\n\nFrankly, I think Bickham gets overused, especially with the huge swash initials. No complaints from me about the regular Bickham though, as a classic script. But if you are wanting to find something that might work with your logo idea, possibly Font Bureau [Sloop](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113073557/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/sloop/) would give you a somewhat similar R in an elegant script that I think would go nicely with a classic serif like Garamond. This is very subjective, of course. Only you can tell if you think they look OK together.\n\nFor more ideas, you might look at Parts 1 & 2 of the [Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113073557/http:/bowfinprintworks.com.scriptidguide.html/) for more formal styles and Parts 7 and 8 for more casual styles. Another idea is to use Antique Handwriting, as if from the Garamond era of the 1700's, and for those styles See Part 10 of the Guide.\n\n[edit: My mistake. Garamond is really 1500's, but the idea still applies.]\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

On the other hand, something more inline with the monogram could also be nice, as long as it isn't used at too large a point size as I think that would dilute the monogram.\n\nAs for a script to complement the monogram. Will it be used very close to the monogram?\n\n"

As for your question - no, the logo won't be used too close to text. I'd like it to have its own space (the stylised flower partially doing this).
