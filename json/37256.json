  "content": "Hi,  \nI’m looking for examples of rounded contemporary typefaces in use, either from the web, printed matter, signage, your holiday photos, whatever (e.g. General Electric identity, Thisnext.com website, Telewest identity (rip), images of Bryant in use from Process).  \nTypefaces suggestions are welcomed but not really necessary since I already made a good list of them. Now I’m looking for images to support my font researches with something real and concrete.  \nYou know, a pdf specimen is rarely enough to persuade a client of a good typeface!  \nThank you all!\n\n [‹ The best typeface you can think of...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37169 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-gh!!!
