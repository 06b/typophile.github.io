And an attempt at suggesting  \nhow to use our brains better – still the most powerful tool around.\n\nErik Spiekermann is author, information designer and typographer. He  \nfounded MetaDesign and FontShop, is Honorary Professor at the University  \nof the Arts in Bremen and has an honorary doctorship from Pasadena Art  \nCenter. In 2003 he received the Gerrit Noordzij Award from the Royal  \nAcademy in Den Haag and in 2007 he was the first designer to be elected  \ninto the Hall of Fame by the European Design Awards for Communication  \nDesign. Later that year he was named Honorary Royal Designer for  \nIndustry by the RSA in Britain. Some of his typefaces, among them FF  \nMeta and ITC Officina, are considered modern classics. He lives and  \nworks in Berlin, London and San Francisco. His studio,  \nSpiekermannPartners, presently employs some 30 designers.\n\nBridewell Hall is at the St Bride Foundation. This is the same location as St Bride Library.\n\nST BRIDE FOUNDATION  \nBride Lane Fleet Street  \nLondon EC4Y 8EQ  \nT 020 7353 3331 F 020 7353 1547\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\n",
