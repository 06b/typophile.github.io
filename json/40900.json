(or do i just think it's sexy b/c it is used for this pin-up artist?)\n\nanyway, any help is appreciated! thanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214110219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/13782578_5456.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214110219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/9783822829301_5165.gif)\n\n",
