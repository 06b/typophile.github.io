  "content": "I've recently started working on a new serif font, which doesn't have a name yet. This began as an experiment with Serifs of a kind I've never done before, and this came out of it:  \n [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/experimental.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042325/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/experimental.png \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/experimental.png\")\n\nThese first few letters I did worked out well enough that I decided to keep going and produced some more:  \n [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/allcaps1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042325/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/allcaps1.png \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/allcaps1.png\")\n\nAt this point, I think I'm starting to have problems with weight not matching up, but I went ahead and put together some more:  \n [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/moreletters.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042325/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/moreletters.png \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/moreletters.png\")\n\nI haven't done any lowercase yet. I'm playing with just using small caps, but the ones I have at the moment are just scaled versions of the capitals and will need to be redrawn eventually:  \n [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/smallcaps.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042325/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/smallcaps.png \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/smallcaps.png\")\n\nSo my question is this: Are there any glaring problems you see, and what suggestions might you have?\n\n",

Love it.\n\nThe bowl reminded me of [TextDrive's wordmark](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123042325/http:/www.textdrive.com/).\n\nI'm not sure if the upper beaks are in their best condition when faced inward, though, particularly in _G_.\n\nAre the glyphs aligned properly? _C, G, O, Q S_ and _U_ should dip, while the down strokes in _N, V_ and _W_ should move up. Basic, right?\n\n_O_ and _Q_ looked not quite at home in the face. Increase the pen angle, maybe? _H_ might also be too wide, but it's a matter of personal taste.\n\n"

      "content": "Nice shapes! However:\n\n- the V is too fat;  \n- the thin stems of A, N and Δ are slightly too heavy;  \n- the pointed below of the N extends a bit too far below the base line;  \n- try to straighten the inner contour of the thick stem in the bowls of B, P and R (i.e. no backeted serif at the right); this doesn't need to be done elsewhere (e.g. in D), because there is enough white space around;  \n- the same goes for the inner serifs of W;  \n- make the bowl of G bigger so that the upper serif optically matches the width of the character in the lower half;  \n- compensate for ink squash / blackness in the joint of the Q tail with the bowl;  \n- the curled, tilde shaped cross bar of E and F is somwhat disturbing; if you want to keep that feature, make sure this matches the cross bars in Ð, Θ and ł.\n\n"
