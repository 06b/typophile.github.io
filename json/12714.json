Most of the other geometric sans serf are not elegant at all.\n\nToo bad it's overused but people is much less sensitive to this than us.\n\nHéctor\n\n"

They are inherent in the design of all regular geometric sans. At least Futura has the sense to avoid Avant Garde's absurdly large x-height.\n\nOnce you've decided to use something \"Futura-like\", you're basically assuming most of Futura's flaws anyway, so you might as well go ahead and use it. If you have **specific** problems with Futura (like \"I prefer two-storey 'a's\") then please voice them.\n\n_that the most often used digitization (Adobe’s) is a disgrace_\n\nSo use Bitstream.\n\n"
