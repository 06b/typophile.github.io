The book is now available through Lulu.com:\n\n[http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/coming-together-font-aid-iv/6553234](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042307/http:/www.lulu.com/product/paperback/coming-together-font-aid-iv/6553234 \"http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/coming-together-font-aid-iv/6553234\")\n\nI ordered a copy last week and I'm really impressed with it. The cost is $25 and all profits will go to help victims of the Haiti earthquake.\n\nThanks everyone for your help and support!\n\n",
