Cassandre was finishing his Peignot for D&P when Excoffon came to visit. Upon seeing Cassandre's drawings, Excoffon quickly took the first train back home and drew an imitation. And it was released \\*before\\* Peignot. Excoffon's imitation didn't adopt Cassandre's reformist efforts, however, so it actually sold better too...   \n   \nBTW, this incident was actually one of the main catalysts for the foundation of ATypI.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

He was beside himself with grief because nobody took his alphabet reform efforts to heart, even taking his work, stripping out the reform, and selling it like hotcakes.

Scratch that.   \n   \nSeriously though, Hrant is right about any copyright expiring. Setting aside the whole issue of whether typefaces are covered under U.S. law, the longest term of protection offered under U.S. copyright is 75 years. So anything older is in the public domain. Less than 75 years and you'll have to research.   \n   \nI would not consider digitizing images from the 1923 ATF book for personal use as pirating -- especially a design which is not currently available in any other way.   \n   \nIf you want to turn your scans into a useable font, then there's always Streamline and Fontographer. But, if you're thinking of trying to set a decent paragraph of text, then you're in for a bit of work to get the font really up to snuff. You won't get professional outlines from a tracing program. You won't get good spacing from an auto routine.   \n   \nOn the other hand, if you just want to set a headline, then skip the font. Set your letters manually.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

ITC revived Blair, Font Bureau has a number of ATF-derived designs, and what have you.   \n   \nReviving one for your own personal use is kosher inside the US. Selling it can be harder depending on the design. Proceed with caution.   \n   \nAs for the technical question, which was (I believe) the original question, buy ScanFont fron FontLab. I digitized a whole character set (in my case J.M. Fleischmann's Groote Canon Duits from 1748) inside of a weekend. It's amazingly intelligent. And that one I did with the three-day demo version, which led me to then purchase the full version. Worth every penny! I use it in conjunction with FontLab, but you can also use it with the cheaper TypeTool.\n\n"

It does or does not have a complete set of letters. (I'm specifically \\*not\\* talking about specimen books where the letterforms were designed for printing, etc.)   \n   \nQuestions:   \nis there a set period of time before letterforms become public domain?   \n   \nIf it's an old company logo, does the company have to be out of business?   \n   \nwhat if the handwriting is a public figure and part of their \"trademark\", like John Hancock sort of thing?   \n   \nor what if it's an image like P22 has Maxfield Parrish, Van Gogh, William Morris ornaments? Do you have to get permission from estates, museums?   \n   \nthanks for any assistance! I've been wondering about this stuff for quite some time.\n\n"
