  "content": "So I thought I had a decent handle on the use of small caps... until I started working on an annual report for a state chapter of the ACLU.   \n   \nOn one hand, the name appears so frequently that one could make a good argument for small caps: overall color, less visual disturbance, etc. But on the other, this is _their_ annual report, and one could make a good argument for not wanting the organization's name to disappear into the text.   \n   \nBringhurst and other orthodox priests call for small caps in this situation. The other ACLU materials I have here don't use SC, but they make lots of other typographic faux pas, so I wouldn't base my decision on that, necessarily. On the third (?) hand, it's likely that if I use SC, the clients will just think it looks wrong since they're used to regular caps.   \n   \nIt pains me, but for practical reasons I'm inclined to use real caps. Yet on the fourth hand, if I do, then I'll have to set PATRIOT Act in big caps too, which pains me more. What to do?   \n   \n--Meredith with four hands\n\n",

However this usually means the x-height is too big for good readability (at normal text sizes).   \n   \n- If the smallcaps are too small (like they so often are) then they might indeed not work.   \n   \nThat said, typically the smallcaps are less bad than fullcaps.   \n   \nBTW, you might check out FF Atma - a smallcap size for every season!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The right stuff has become wierd and 'wrong' to a lot of clients. I say do it all with SC as your judgment and references stipulate (if the face you choose allows). Make a typographic argument for it if they notice and if they don't relent just change their name and not the rest. Arguably, you'd just be choosing a typographic solution that best fits the situation. And that's what we want, right?   \n   \nI've had the same battle both internally (in my head) and externally (with the client) about client acronyms.
