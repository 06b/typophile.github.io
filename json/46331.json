I think it's a very approachable logo, that's still clean with a strong concept. As Nick pointed out \"Saving to the Cloud\" and for years, the Internet was always visualized as a cloud, especially in data flow diagrams. It's interesting that Apple took that visual idea and made it more \"congruent\" and \"tangible\", instead of this implied empty space that things just \"happen\" in. It's now a destination, that seems very welcoming and more importantly, safe. Since you'd be relying on it to keep all your important data (contact info, calendars schedules, files...) there, secure.\n\n"

They're doing this on purpose, not because they are naïve, but because they are going after a certain look for a certain \"audience\" or \"target\" (as they say in advertising).\n\nI have problems with design that deliberately dumbs things down, because I think that involves a negative value judgement of others (I feel that it is akin to \"talking down\" to someone), but maybe other people have problems with design that tries to educate or elevate, or that simply tries to be well-made or appropriate (maybe \"good taste\" is not always \"right\"). And I know I'm opening a huge can of worms here, because how do you define \"well-made\" or \"appropriate\"? No matter how much theory and objectivity you can come up with, there is always a human being making decisions, be it at the design-decision level or at the money-making level.\n\nMaybe I should give a concrete example. I once designed a book about a professional soccer team, and I wanted to print the cover with a matte finish. When the printer found out, he said, \"Oh, just make a glossy cover; that's what soccer fans (the audience for the book) are going to go for.\" (I should mention that this all took place in Argentina, not the U.S., but maybe it is still a valid story.) I ended up having my way with the matte finish, and the book sold well -- I don't think the cover's finish would make it or break it. But that doesn't prove or disprove anything -- it's just one little example, and it bears no comparison to something as massive as the iPhone or .mac accounts.\n\n"

The cynical view is a product of the 20th century, which made mainstream culture cynical.\n\nI was aiming to go beyond cynicism. I was sarcastic and satirical with my list of descriptive words. At the same time I was 90% neutral—the words I chose describe the logo's qualities, but that doesn't mean I hate it. It just isn't for me.\n\nThe point: Apple are catering to the lowest common demoninator, and that philosophy produces awful design. The same kind of philosophy produces awful industrial design like the Ford Crown Victoria. It's a bad logo, and anyone who defends it as having aesthetic merit is defending bad design and the philosophy of pandering to the lowest common demoninator.\n\nIt could also be said that this badly-designed logo reflects Apple's willingness to pollute the world with such banality in pursuit of the almighty dollar, which is not so mighty these days. When I called it \"visual pollution\", I meant it. It looks like rubbish and it stinks. That last bit really is cynical.\n\nI still think they could have captured their target market sector with a more tasteful design. We could be living in a more tasteful world if only marketing people stuck to their job and let designers do theirs properly.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
