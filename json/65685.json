  "content": "I have been trying everything but nothing works. Ihave most of my files in Pagemaker and need to use them on my new Windows 7 computer. Need some help. thanks  \nThanks for the tips will try it again.  \nPagemaker 6.5 runs fine in Vista, I have it installed on another machine.  \nAlso, cannot uninstall CS3 without deactivationg it. Cannot select deactivate since it will not run. To remove it I have to delete everything and then delete all Adobe from registry to get it to reinstall.  \nGetting Ultimate to put on, maybe that will let me run virtual machine.  \nthanks for all the help.\n\n",

In fact I'm working with a client to move them from PM6 to InDesign (and Unicode fonts), since they realize the tightrope they're walking on is getting thinner by the week... The tricky thing with them is that the Armenian hyphenation plug-in has to be re-written.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Select the app icon (or a shortcut, even), right-click, get \"properties,\" go to the \"compatibility\" tab and look at your options. You could for example try setting compatibility to \"Windows XP\"....\n\nNo promises that this will help, but it's the one other thing to try (besides a virtual machine) before giving up.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

(I'm a Microsoft Certified Network Engineer and former 3rd level desktop support guy.)\n\n1) Try installing under the Administrator account. Even if your user account has Administrator privileges, I've seen problems. Makes no sense but such is Windows.\n\n2) Uninstall CS3. And then, find the msi or, more probably the exe intallation file, right click it, and select Properties -\\> Compatibility Tab -\\> Run this program in compatibility mode for... and select Vista or XP or whatever.\n\nThis way, the whole installation gets done in backwards compatibility mode.\n\nOnce that's done, try it. If still no luck, add Thomas's step to the process and run the program executable in compatibility mode, too.\n\nrich\n\n"

The company flat-out said it wasn't Vista compatible and no update was on the way - not enough of a market, I suppose. Her entire class was going nuts over this. Everybody had Vista.  \nInstalling in compatibility mode was a Hail Mary Pass, but Windows actually reached back and used older dll's and such and the sucker actually installed. Spent hours at it.  \nAmazed me, I thought I'd seen it all. I wrote up directions and it worked on all the student's Vista machines so no fluke.\n\nrich\n\n"
