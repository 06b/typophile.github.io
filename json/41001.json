Great stuff!  \nJames, my “lighting up” may be due to the reflection off my vacant dome bouncing across the globe :-)  \nJackie, tell Lauren and Ollie I am flattered, even if I got itchy and scratchy due to cat allergy :-)  \nThanks, poet laureate Linda, for your hairlines of verse—Yves knows where I am coming from on that one :-)  \nHiroshige, yours takes the cake for biting sarcasm and Florian, that was just a scream! Chris Rugen gets the rimshot requested. Special thanks to my dear friend André who will soon have his sans released.  \nTo that OTHER old Fart Norbert, I about blew a gasket after seeing your old codgerism cartoon, dude! (my wife wanted to know who the young tart was though).  \nGrazie, Lore and to Tiff, Patty, Haley, Sharon, and Tamye. Hi fivin Paul, Kent, Eben, Nick, Bill, David, Stuart, Alex, Thomas, James, Jelmar, Andrew, Marc, Don, Craig, JEdward, Simon, Si, and the Beatled Ricardo—and anyone I missed!!!  \nA special thank you to the wonderful Mili for starting this thread! xoxoxox\n\nYou have all made me happy!\n\nChrisL\n\n"
