Only lowercase now, capitals and numerals are to come soon, but before that i want to see clearly how lowercase looks.\n\nMore images here: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/fabergraph/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090506122831/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/fabergraph/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fabergraph/\")\n\nCould you let me what you know please?
