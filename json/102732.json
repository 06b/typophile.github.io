  "content": "Stockholm city council has launched a new identity system, replacing the current one which includes Karl-Erik Forsberg's 1961 seal and a rather 90s-ey (but good) visual look with a lot of airy Gill Sans.\n\nThe new identity includes a new logotype and a custom typeface, Stockholm Type, based on Swiss Typefaces' Euclid (which is one of those trendy \"new clumsy\" experimental geometric sans types), but significantly neutered here into something rather Museo Sans-esque. Not sure what it's supposed to say about Stockholm. There's little info on [the new website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055432/http:/www.stockholm.se/) (which has the new typeface as a web font, look a those numerals!) but it's apparently by Swiss Typefaces' [Emmanuel Rey](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055432/http:/www.emmanuelrey.ch/), with the identity by [Essen](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055432/http:/esseninternational.com/one-city-one-vision-one-statement/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055432im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Stockholm_nygrafiskprofil3_4561.jpg)\n\n",

Here, though, they've taken the least interesting part of the design – the style of typeface, which isn't [even](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055432/http:/sthlmmayday.se/?attachment_id=103)\\* [essential](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414055432/http:/imgur.com/PZdhc77) anyway – neutered it still futher by dropping the ubiquitous always-on medium weight, and placed it in the middle of a standard formula A1 brand identity. All of the other elements of anti-design are gone, rendering the type choice just awkward.\n\n\\* Nice rotalics in this one. Anyone know what they are?\n\n"
