      "content": "Another way of looking at this though, is that Windows fonts are relatively untested on Mac OS. If a font developer is developing a “Windows” TrueType font, they may not bother testing to see if it works properly on Mac OS. This may be particularly true for greymarket/free fonts, which I’ve experienced problems with. In the case of legacy font files, I’m not sure there is anyone necessarily at fault. It may be that the font worked fine on the OS for which it was intended.\n\nIn general, if the font was built according to spec, it should work. However, I think it is perfectly rational for for a printer to want to avoid them. Licensed fonts from major foundries are not likely to be the problem, of course.\n\n"

      "content": "A TrueType font must contain a ‘cmap’ table for the platform you want to use. In the old days, this meant that a TrueType font that only had a Windows ‘cmap’ table would not work on Mac OS and vice-versa, because without that table, the OS couldn’t figure out how to map characters to glyphs in the font.\n\nThese days, almost all recent-vintage fonts have Unicode ‘cmap’ tables, and current versions of both Windows and Mac OS X know how to use them. However, older programs may not react well to fonts that are missing the ‘cmap’ for your particular text encoding. In general, though, if it _looks_ like the font is working, it’s working. Just keep these things in mind (for example, if you send a job using such a font out for printing, then if the printer is using an older OS or older version of the program, you may run into difficulties).\n\n"
