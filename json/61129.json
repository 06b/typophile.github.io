The mac somewhat randomly picks a few fonts in the ttc file and adds them to its font list. Font Book's Validation command claims that all the fonts in the ttc have \"Serious Problems\" in \"System Validation\" -- whatever that may mean.\n\nIf I extract a font from the ttc file, including all tables unchanged, then Font Book will happily validate the resultant ttf file.\n\nIf I take a standard ttc font (I used gulim.ttc) and subjected it to Font Book I got exactly the same problems.\n\nI have tried this on 10.4 and 10.5 with similar results.\n\nAnyone know what might be going on?\n\n",

At one time I was going to look into the possibility of a format 2 'post' table with name indices \\>= 32768 being an issue, based on a very strict interpretation of the OpenType spec (\"Index numbers 32768 through 65535 are reserved for future use\") but I never chased that down to confirm.\n\n"
