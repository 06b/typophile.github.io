Monotype [Ionic Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141902/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205343) seems to have a similar amount of contrast.

The original sample is also distorted quite a bit (looks almost like every character was rotated separately, maybe it's an italic after all?:-o), It's difficult to say why because we don't have any info where the sample is from.   \n   \nYves, I thik it might still be some version of Century, like Expanded Bold (it has a different r)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141902im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23345.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "OK, I tried the various Centurys that I have. The C serif isn't the same, but I think you can see that something like this was used. I did what I did with the Ionic sample, which I think is where Jan was going too. It's not the italic face of any font, I am convinced. Century Schoolbook Bold looks the closest to me, but I think some other Century version will be the answer, like Madison or some odd foundry's version.   \n ![Concorde Centurys](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141902im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23368.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "I think it's fairly clear that this was a custom lettering job.   \nThe letterforms have typical modern characteristics, but I   \ndoubt you will find an exact match among existing fonts.   \n   \nThe distortions you're seeing have to do with the fact that it   \nwas drawn as an italic, not simply slanted from upright   \nartwork. When you slant ovals, you get an unnatural looking   \nsouth-west to north-east diagonal stress. Correctly drawn   \nitalics are designed to compensate for this distortion. (You   \ncan see the compenstaion if you back-slant them to   \nupright.) In this case, there appears to be a bit of over-   \ncompensation.\n\n"
