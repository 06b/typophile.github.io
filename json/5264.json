  "content": "Someone please help me !   \n   \nI have tried several font managers recently . I did not like them, removed them, but the trouble is that during an uninstall process my Windows Font Viewer has lost its PFM file association. Double-click does not work any more and I can't even reassociate it still sais it's no font file . When (wherever) I write \"fontview A.pfm\" it works of course but I'd like to have the double-click back . If you had the same trouble and was able to solve it please help me .   \n   \nThank you for your help in advance   \n   \n\\*S\n\n [‹ Question about windows postscript fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121092506/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4636 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Analog or digital--how do YOU start a glyph? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121092506/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4822 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
