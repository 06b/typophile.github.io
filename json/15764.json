Main headline is set in Neutra and another one with Fayette.\n\nWhat i need is good Readability at such small sizes. (I’m must say I prefere san serif face, tho I’m open to suggestions).\n\nThanks,\n\nL.\n\n [‹ Need information about Chicken Plain Font !!!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222004916/http:/typophile.com/node/17214 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Yet another Van Doesburg? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222004916/http:/typophile.com/node/17368 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The problem is, that it needs to support **estonian, latvian, lithuanian, cyrillic, swedish and english**. Actually cyrillic might be from a different typeface but other languages should look the same.\n\nCurrently i’m using an opentype version of Arial [:(] , because it’s the only font i’ve found that has all the characters i need. Unfortunately, it’s not very economical.\n\nMost of the packages are printed using Flexo technology, which means that dot gain is quite big.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n"
