      "content": "Peter,   \n   \nI applaud three things:   \n   \n1, The caps are a good height - shorter than   \nascenders. Too often designers of pixel fonts   \nforget what's been learned from traditional   \ntypography.   \n   \n2, The extensive character set. I suppose we   \nshould expect a good number of accented glyphs   \nfrom a Swede. ;)   \n   \n3, The uc 'W'. It's nice.   \n   \nIt's great to see you here. I admire your work   \nand often point to Mercury's little 'g' when   \npeople ask why I love typography so much.   \n   \nWelcome.   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "I like this a lot.   \n   \nTo echo Stephen, the UC height is great. The   \nnumerals are nice too.   \n   \nThe 'serifs' on the lc f and l as well as the UC I   \nand J are a nice touch. The lc r is also nice.   \nThese nuances illustrate how attentiveness to   \noptics at this scale is more important than   \nhow it's 'supposed' to be drawn.   \n   \nI have to get knit-picky and say that I don't care   \nfor the fat arrowheads hanging on those thin   \nstems. Perhaps they don't need stems...   \n   \nOut of curiousity, what are your plans for this   \nface? A bold version?   \n   \n//joe\n\n"
