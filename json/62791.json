  "content": "Hey this could be an incredibly stupid question, but I am working on a job for a client that is using a handwriting inspired typeface. It took a long time to select one and we finally settled on a free one from DaFont. I am now slightly regretting this decision as the font is not fully built including all of the glyphs, especially a hyphen which is really the only thing I need added. If someone has the time to explain, what would it take to add a glyph to this font? and is this illegal even though the font is free? I know nothing about typeface design or working with font editing software, I am mostly versed in Adobe products. Any info would be helpful, Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "The cheapest and easiest way to add a hyphen to the entire font is with TypeTool from Fontlab: [http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223160115/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/\") It costs $99 and is fairly easy to use. In TypeTool simply open the font, add the hyphen, and export (only exports truetype fonts though). I'm unsure about the legal concerns. I've been wondering the same thing myself.\n\n"

      "content": "This depends on the foundry (or designer or whoever who owns the rights of the font). Based on my little experience with Dafont, I can tell you that every font comes with some kind of text who tells you if it is allowed or not (it is called EULA = End User License Agreement). If there is not such text, or if the text doesn’t talk about this, you can contact the author via email. Most of the times, he/she will allow you to make the change if you explain your situation.\n\n"

      "content": "Whether it's legal or not depends on the terms of the license. You can always e-mail the font designer and ask them. There's always an outside chance that they'll add the hyphen for you.\n\nAn alternative to TypeTool is FontForge ( [http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223160115/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/ \"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/\")), which is free, somewhat tricky to install (unless you happen to be on Linux), and not totally intuitive. The FontForge website includes detailed installation instructions and, once you get past that, tutorials, which you may not need for the task at hand. Adding a glyph is mostly a matter of drawing Bezier curves; beyond that, you just set the sidebearings and generate the font.\n\nYou may still decide that TypeTool is the right tool for you, but you should at least consider the alternatives. On the one hand, the effort required to install FontForge may not be worth it for a single hyphen; on the other hand, $99 is a lot to pay for a hyphen.\n\nI guess a third option is to pay for a font that already contains the characters you need...\n\nIf you do decide to go with FontForge and happen to run into problems, send me a message and I'll do my best to help. I'm no expert, but I think I can handle adding a hyphen.\n\n"

      "content": "With my somewhat limited experience, I've to say that using fonts from Dafont can get very messy down the road. It's not the first time I see this problem happen with accents, punctuation or even numbers. In one occasion, one of my partners used a font from Dafont and after finishing the job he was going to export a PDF (from InDesing). The font didn't allow embedding so he had to change the font, the text reflowed and he had to redo all of the text fitting. The funny part is that this typography was advertised as \"free\". Sometimes paying for a good font or downloading one free but better will pay itself several times when you start to work.\n\nIf you tell us what font you're using I might be able to help you further. Some of the fonts in that page are public domain so editing permission is not needed.\n\nRegards.\n\n"
