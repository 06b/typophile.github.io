I’m sure you can  \nfind one. ;-)\n\nI’ll send you the photo (you might need a higher-quality one, which we can talk about) and I’ll try to get permission to pass along a jaw-dropping hi-res macro of an original punch (it’s the “G”) for your use as well. Also, I have [my own] decent macro shots of the Monotype and ATF cuts (text sizes). In case it matters, how are the rights to such submissions considered?\n\nBTW, this  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/73042013@N00/2895427251/in/pool-847442@N25](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019093713/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/73042013@N00/2895427251/in/pool-847442@N25 \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/73042013@N00/2895427251/in/pool-847442@N25\")  \nof course is not a Baskerville; it’s a De Vinne.\n\nOne other thing - the official logo of Canada is in a Fry’s cut:  \n [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Canada\\_wordmark.svg/...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019093713/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Canada_wordmark.svg/250px-Canada_wordmark.svg.png \"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/83/Canada\\_wordmark.svg/250px-Canada\\_wordmark.svg.png\")\n\nWhich makes me add: you might want to distinguish between the two versions in your project (especially in the “identification help” part) since they’re so different.\n\nOh, one last thing: would you like JB’s family tree, going back about 5 generations?\n\nhhp\n\n"
