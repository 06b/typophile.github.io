Also, I have only just started using ID, so apologies for ignorance in advance!\n\nI have placed a white Illustrator .eps logo file into ID CS1 in front of a dark red background, and the logo keeps appearing with a tint of the colour behind. It will just not appear white. I have also tried an .ai file, and even a rasterised Photoshop .eps with a clipping path, and the same thing happens. When I produce a PDF from the ID file it appears the same again. I just wondered if anyone could tell me anything that I am doing wrong that is obvious? I have gone through every menu I can think of re background, transparency, trapping, etc. I am at a loss!\n\nAny help gratefuly received!\n\n",

Dumb question but you never know.\n\nStick with .ai in ID, it loves native files.\n\nSince you have tried so many formats already, it almost seems like the transparency has to be coming from ID. Make a new container box and re-place the file. You've probably already tried this but you never know…\n\nYour container box is set to Normal blending mode in the transparency palette?\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now…\n\nBest of Luck!\n\npeace\n\n"
