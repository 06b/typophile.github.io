  "content": "I am working on an Editorial project about analog creative practices, and would like to design the spreads as independent from the computer as I can get. As a student educated solely on the computer I am excited to explore these practices.\n\nSo I need to create a body of text in 9pt Adobe Caslon regular. I have looked into Chartpak and Letraset and have yet to find my exact needs.\n\nCan anyone suggest a resource or a practice to achieve my desired result? I am also considering phototypesetting, but don't know much about it.\n\nAny information would be helpful!\n\nThank you!\n\n",

      "content": "Well, Adobe Caslon is of course an Adobe version of Caslon, and inherently digital.\n\nIf you want to go truly old-school, then you want hand-set metal type, and you should set it yourself. If you tell folks where you are based, perhaps somebody can suggest a school or something where you could get access to metal type.\n\nIf (as your profile suggests) you are based in Rochester, NY, then of course you could see if RIT has any classes or workshops that would give you access to one of the old-fashioned letterpresses they have. There is a lovely Washington 1830 cast-iron handpress in the Cary Graphic Arts Collection....\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "maybe you should search after a letterpress or try to carv the letters by yourself into wood. if you really want to use caslon you could print your text mirrored via a laserprinter and then you could transfer the print on another surface by grinding some nitro-cellulose combination thinner on it.\n\n"

      "content": "FYI: Dry transfer letters were never used for setting body text. At least by anyone sane. I used dry transfers mostly during the pre-digital, photoype period, after metal was obsolete. You can still set metal type (or get someone else to), but I don't imagine anyone has an old Linofilm or Compugraphic Editwriter in their basement setting cold type old-school. IBM Composer, maybe. I don't think anything is as dead as typesetting technology between the metal and digital eras.\n\n"
