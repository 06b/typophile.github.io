  "content": "I hope this is fitting for this forum. It's more logo-related than logo-type-related, but seeing the great critiques here compelled me to post. Plus, I'm the only graphic designer in the building, so it helps to get other's input.   \n   \nThis is a logo for our branch of government here in MN. I've come up with 3 variations that I (and a few others) seem to think are the strongest. I now need your harsh, honest critiques!   \n   \nThere's one disclaimer, and one I'll probably take some heat for saying...but I an limited to only free fonts and whatevers on my machine (gasp!). As our state is in the hole a few billion, getting darrel a few licensed fonts isn't really on the priority list.   \n   \nSo, here they are.   \n   \nLogo one (uses Tanek, from CSA) represents the state (duh) and the 10 court districts rendered in a stained-glass-like way. This also hints at the stained glass ceiling installation in the supreme court. PROS: nice double-meaning, simple CONS: not as nice in one-color.   \n   \nLogo two (uses Futura, from Apple, and Covington, from apostrophiclab) is the more 'elegant' of the bunch (if not just a bit hokey). It's the state bird perched upon a roman column. (bird = MN, column = courhouse) PROS: most 'regal' of the bunch CONS: is it hokey? (Most have said 'no' but I still wonder...)   \n   \nLogo three (uses Futura, from Apple) is a simple rendering of common iconography...the state and the scales of justice. PROS: recognizable iconography CONS: cliche? Too trendy?   \n   \n ![Logos (GIF)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417145833im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7047.gif)   \n   \nnow, let me have it!\n\n",

I had a buddy over at CSA critique it and suggest a lot of what you see there...not to mention that (coincidently) the face I was using was from CSA as well. ;o)   \n   \nI have some other variations of that that I'll work on...the fine-etched engraving idea is a good one.   \n   \n\\> Is there a classy way to render the loon,   \n\\> so it's not so cartoony?   \n   \nDo you think it's the illustration style, or the fact that it's just a loon? I'll work on that some more.   \n   \n\\> #3 is way too trendy...even though, we could all guess that the client asked for it.   \n   \nIt kind of goes without saying that one of the options needs to be a state/scales of justice. Yea, it's incredibly cliche, so I tried to at least have fun with it. I do have several other style variations that I'll post when I get the chance for comparison.   \n   \n\\> I think the logo has to say strength and durability.   \n   \nCould you say a bit more about that Brennan? I assume you were referring to the column logo. Were you referring to the style? Line weight?   \n   \nAgain, thanks everyone. I'll try and post some more this afternoon (if not new stuff, some of the sketches up to this point...)   \n   \n-Darrel\n\n"

Criminal court is just a segment of the court system. There's juveniles, divorces, bankruptcies, child support, etc. So it's more about 'fairness for all' than the courts being 'against' anything in particular.   \n   \nThat doesn't mean it shouldn't be a 'strong' mark, though. ;o)   \n   \n\\>But if it works with the attitude of   \n\\>Minnesota and the state's other identity   \n\\>schemes, go for it.   \n   \nWell, in some ways I am fortunate in that I'm starting from scratch.

I did try and simplify it a bit so it wasn't quite as trendy and hopefully the lock-up in a color block will be used consistently.
