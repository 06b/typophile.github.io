The \"is\" ligature is beyond the line for me, it doesn't look very clean and helpful.\n\nMaybe you didn't ask, but I suggest to correct the condensed effect on the thinnest weights.\n\nNice job!!!\n\nSergio\n\n"

Basically I just started making glyphs, and see what they'd look like. I went back and forth a bit, and evenutually got the book weight.\n\nAndrés; with this amount of change in weight, I could keep the weights and widths closer together, but I don't want to make a condensed/extended family. Any suggestions how to do that?\n\nEben: 'a' gets too dark as well. And I'm not happy with the colour of 'e' and 'o' either.\n\nWith sans serif it's enough to draw three weights: the thinnest, book, and the heaviest. With serif this method no longer applies. I have to figure out how to work this out.\n\n"

      "content": "just a beginner but:\n\nthe diagonal-contrast of the \"semi-bold\" is a little bigger than the others, non?!  \ni mean the proportional rate(anyway in comparison to \"bold\" and light\").  \nlook at the \"o\".\n\nand in my opinion the serifs between \"n\"/\"m\" look bizzare,  \nbecause they realy tight in comparison to the rest \"white-room\"(?).  \nanother detail: the right serif of the last stem of the bold \"m\".  \nneedn't it to be highter than the left serif of the \"i\" (or)  \nthe the serifs of \"i\" should be \"more open\".\n\nbut the last two points also can be a result of my LCD.\n\n"
