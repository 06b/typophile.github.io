  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nAlright, we’re doing research on producing material for an Olympic bid.  \nWe do have some research collected, but there’s so much nice stuff out there i’m sure that you guys know of.\n\nAnything from fonts made for different olympics, graphic manuals, moodshots, anything you can think of.\n\nOur project is a winter olympic, but all the stuff that’s integrated into summer olympics are also relevant.\n\nTypography is very interesting, i know there was a font at fountain.nu that was bought by (Vancouver’s?) olympic bid to be their proprietary font, but i cant seem to find it any longer.\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Sackers Heavy Roman for logo? - companion fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31172 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Eurostile ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821142142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31147 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
