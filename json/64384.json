  "content": "Hallo everyone. I have an interesting question.\n\nI am designing a photo book with lots of photographers contributions from different countries. It is a dutch publisher, but the book is in english only.\n\nOne section contains one contribution per photographer, and it is in alphabetical order according to the names of the photographer.\n\nThere are a few of them which have last names starting with W, and one of them is Wåhlstrand.\n\nMy dutch colleauges sorted it as if the å was an a, but the photographer is swedish, and å comes almost lasst in the swedish alpahabet. While it is not in the dutch and english alphabets at all.\n\nSo my qusetion is, should I treat it as an å or an a? The book is in english, the photographer is swedish, the publisher is dutch. How do I treat an å in english alphabetica order?\n\n",

Since the book is in English, then the order should be in the English alphabetical order: [http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/english.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131082718/http:/www.evertype.com/alphabets/english.pdf \"http://www.evertype.com/alphabets/english.pdf\")\n\ncheers  \nClaus\n\n"
