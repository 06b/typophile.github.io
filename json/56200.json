It has about 17 events from about 600 C.E. to the present. The students are to place them in chronological order and then they are to note the implications these events had on visual culture.\n\nGood Lord, do they hate this exercise. They say \"we're design students, not history students.\" I respond that the two are not to be separated.\n\nTo perhaps ease the pain a bit I include \"instructor's birth\" and \"student's birth.\" No one has attributed anything of importance to my birth, which is fine and accurate. I have gotten some pleasingly egocentric predictions of student accomplishments. After the quizzes have been passed back to me and we begin to discuss them, I note that anyone who places my birth earlier than it is will automatically fail the quiz.\n\npowers\n\n"
