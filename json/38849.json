Is there an official ’unofficial’ list of characters which a designer should start working on first, both in l/c and u/c?  \nThanks!\n\n [‹ Reading assessment tests](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203113153/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38852 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Italic and Roman ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203113153/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38756 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

After two or three letters, you’ve got a lot of the typeface’s ‘DNA’, enabling you to create a good deal of your characters.\n\n"
