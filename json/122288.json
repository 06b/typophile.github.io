      "content": "Is 1983 a typo? If not, you need to take into account the technology of the period. I'd guess a law firm would have more likely used a Wang or IBM word processing machine for preparing long documents, rather than an MS-DOS machine, and for printing the document would get fed into a daisywheel printer or Selectric. Fixed-space type was still predominant, and choice of proportional fonts was limited and determined by the printing device. And Cambria wasn't released until 2007.\n\n"
