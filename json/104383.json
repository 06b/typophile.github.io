  "content": "Hello all! I recently launched a new font design project on Kickstarter: [http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/59648831/uniform-a-revolutionary-new...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421062419/http:/www.kickstarter.com/projects/59648831/uniform-a-revolutionary-new-geometric-type-family \"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/59648831/uniform-a-revolutionary-new-geometric-type-family\")\n\nThe font is a geometric sans serif type family, but what makes it unique is that the condensed weights are straight-sided, not squished ovals like all other geometric type families out there.\n\nPlease pass the word along to your designer/type loving friends! I really want to be able to create this cool new typeface but without the funding there is no way I will have the free time to work on it.\n\nThanks!\n\nRichard Miller  \nMiller Type Foundry\n\n",

      "content": "Nice project!\n\nOf note: Uniform is a typeface already, although it is custom and proprietary to UniformWares (the watch company). You can see it in use here: [http://www.septemberindustry.co.uk/madebysix/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421062419/http:/www.septemberindustry.co.uk/madebysix/ \"http://www.septemberindustry.co.uk/madebysix/\")\n\nUnfortunately, they seem reluctant to credit the type designer in the above mentioned portfolio showcase -- Micheal Hernan.\n\nIn this case I'm not sure if the name over-lap matters, but I thought you would like to know. I'm not sure if Mr Hernan will release this font one day due to licensing and other extenuating circumstances.\n\nThanks,  \nTodd\n\n"
