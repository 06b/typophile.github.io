Are there new guidelines about what kind of links NOT to post in the forums? Or are y’all just encouraging us to use our generous blog bandwith? :-) Inquiring Typophile minds want to know!\n\n"

Many users still go there, I suppose, especially if they have the latest operating systems and Web 2.0-friendly browsers (like Ill Sans, I am not one of those at the moment!).\n\n"

A solution might be to add a directory called “Blogs” along with the General, Design, Build, etc. It would have a current post listing like the rest and perhaps not be overlooked?\n\nChrisL\n\n"
