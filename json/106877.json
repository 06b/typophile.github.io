I particularly love the one used on the Krug label, as it has the lightest footprint. Any suggestions for compressed romans with a more charigraphic nature rather than transitional/modern which would be suitable for the alcohol percentage and volume would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRobert\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Times, Garamond 3, New Century Schoolbook, Diotima \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [R.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021819/http:/typophile.com/user/57325 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [krug\\_680.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021819/http:/typophile.com/files/krug_680.jpg) | 147.64 KB |\n| [lanson\\_680.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021819/http:/typophile.com/files/lanson_680.jpg) | 91.8 KB |\n| [Bertand-Delespierre\\_BrutTrad\\_680.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021819/http:/typophile.com/files/Bertand-Delespierre_BrutTrad_680.jpg) | 84.16 KB |\n| [champagne\\_moet\\_rose-680.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021819/http:/typophile.com/files/champagne_moet_rose-680.jpg) | 86.61 KB |\n| [Screen-Shot-2013-10-18\\_680.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021819/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen-Shot-2013-10-18_680.png) | 272.52 KB |\n\n",
