  "content": "This is a general question for typefaces developed in FontLab and generated in OTF, TTF and maybe TT format:   \nSince, unless there's someones who does it for me, I generally did not need accurate hinting, I never went into it. So I was wondering: since my drawings are always in Type1, and so my automatic hinting (which in FL stinks a bit, anyway), do I need to autohint for the TT environment as well?   \n   \nDo the two instruction sets exclude each other mutually or are they kept both (I suspect so)?   \n   \nSorry for the ignorance...\n\n",
