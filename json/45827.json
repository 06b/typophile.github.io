  "content": "I have never designed type, but for the project that I am working on, I want to design a capital 'Ω' in Blackmoor LET, which does not have an 'Ω' as part of its character set. I thought to combine the capital 'O' and lower-case 'g' to make an 'Ω'. This is what I've come up with so far.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824124540im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blackmoor_omega_4762.png)\n\nThis will be used for a logo treatment for a youth group called \"Omega Student Ministries.\" I like the sort of tattooed / distressed look that Blackmoor has. I am a bit worried, however, that it could have too much of a \"Pirates of the Carribean\" feel to it, however. If someone would like to suggest another font, then please do.\n\nThank you in advance for any suggestions you may have.\n\n_Edited for grammar._\n\n",
