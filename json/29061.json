  "content": "Hi,  \nI am searching for a sans face to pair with Stempel or Adobe Garamond.  \nEither will do if you know a match. In the example below, there is ITC Garamond paired with Akzidenz Grotesk. I am looking for something similar. Please let me know if you've got something!  \nThanks a lot.  \nOk, take 'er easy\n\nJ P H\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221091210im_/http:/typophile.com/files/img0032_5028.jpg)\n\n",
