  "content": "hello\n\nthe situation:  \nfriends of mine gotta do a “faked ad” for a condom producer in school. they asked me for some creative and technical help, so here i am to help them.\n\ntheir approach is that most condom brands dont really have a brand strategy, a good remembered name, most people cant say you more than one or two brands.\n\nthey want to brand their producer with “Condoms are cool, its fun to use them”.\n\nfonts to use:  \nwhat fonts would you suggest for the text? i thought of:\n\na.) something very light weighted, a bit sophisticated (for the normal user..) like Gill Sans in a light weight.  \nor  \nb.) something like VAG Rounded, more weight on the fun-part.\n\nany other ideas?  \nTHANKS alot.\n\n",
