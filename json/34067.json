It's closer to Monotype's version of Benton's [Eagle Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011012834/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/eagle_bold/&sample_text=%E2%80%9CHEROES%E2%80%9D&sample_size=72). Font Bureau's [Eagle](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011012834/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=eagle) is a bit more narrow, but a better digitization with more weights and decent spacing.\n\n"
