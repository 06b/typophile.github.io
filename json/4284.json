I was trying to achieve some kind of baroque feeling.   \nI was fooling around with some of my favorite typefaces - Garamond, English and Bull. Your opinion, please.   \n   \n ![example](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023222818im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33458.jpg)\n\n",

Or napkins, menus, gift bags, etc?   \n   \nI think if you're going to use the Latinized spelling of FATVM, then you should use an \"obvious\" Roman stonecut font, like [Requiem](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023222818/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/requiem/index.html) or similar. You might want to spell 'Eurydice' in the modern fashion to avoid people seeing Every Dice.   \n   \nAlso, I think the 'ae' ligature looks a bit much like an 'oe'.\n\n"

Is there another lc Y you could use to avoid/minimize that hole between 'r' and 'y'?   \n   \nI think this marque is great for printed materials, but you might have some translation issues when going to clothing or vinyls for a window. The size difference between Fatum and Eurydice would make the former very small on an embroidered shirt or apron, and the 'grunge' face might not be easy to cut out of vinyl.   \n   \nGood progress.\n\n"

I Think you need to consider the historical implications of your typefaces. The average member of the populace won't know that Garamond is a Renassaince face, but the subconscious association is probably there nonetheless. If you're doing something with historical meaning, why not consider a face from that period?   \n   \nIf you're stuck on the sans/serif combination, you might try a lapidary like Sophia or Lithos with a display Roman like Trajan.\n\n"

The thing is, I didn't want it to look Roman (or Grecian), I wanted it to look early Baroque, Classical in Louis XIV kind of way. Fatum Eurydicae sounds to me like a title of H. Purcell's play, or some of his conteporaties.   \nThink about it like that movie Gladiator - although it takes place in ancient Rome, theme, characters, costumes etc. are Baroque, not Antique.\n\n"
