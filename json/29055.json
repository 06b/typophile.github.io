  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI’m wondering if someone can help me identify the attached font. It’s almost identical to Rian Hughes’ [Wormwood Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108175055/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=DET0000269#specimen), being sold by Veer. However, I’m looking to identify the original face, without the degradation and roughing up that Wormwood has.\n\nI’ve seen it used in a few recent commercial applications, but I recall seeing it most often used in boxing posters from the 1950s and forward.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [divergent\\_historical.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108175055/http:/typophile.com/files/divergent_historical.gif) | 27.34 KB |\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Snoop Dogg goth font - Cloister Blackizzle, know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;? {BJ}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108175055/http:/typophile.com/node/7572 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Eurostile-like \"Cinema\" magazine header - House Gothic 23 {Mike Y} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108175055/http:/typophile.com/node/29056 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
