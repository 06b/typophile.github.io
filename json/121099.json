Thanks for your feedback.\n\nI posted this on the general discussions forum also to try to get as much feedback as possible, so that I can progress with this job.  \nI gave some feedback here: [http://typophile.com/node/121098](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416154355/http:/typophile.com/node/121098 \"http://typophile.com/node/121098\")  \nWhen you say you don't really like Л, ы, у do you mean they are incorrect?  \nDo you have any examples of the Serbian cursive alternates for г, п, т, ш that show how they should be?\n\nThe letters in the initial post are from MacOS Cyrillic codepages.\n\n"
