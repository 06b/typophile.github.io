  "content": "Here's a little something I literally built over the the weekend. It's inspired by the broken antiqua signage in the old Berlin subway stations. Backstein is German for \"[baked] brick\".\n\nThe idea of a squarish gemetric font is hardly original, but I hope I brought in some fresh air with those rather unconventional letter forms (especially the {r} and {s}).\n\nHere's a PDF specimen: [http://www.cinga.ch/type/backstein\\_specimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203015/http:/www.cinga.ch/type/backstein_specimen.pdf \"http://www.cinga.ch/type/backstein\\_specimen.pdf\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/astro_4909.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Jürgen,\n\nthose forms don't strike me as particularly German. The script-style {r} and {s} are internationally widespread in hand-writing (though actually I learned a more Antiqua-like {r} in school in Switzerland), and {e} is pretty close to the Antiqua shape anyway.\n\nOr do you mean the letters are generally not very legible and depend on context to be read properly? I'm deliberately pushing the boundaries of legibility a bit here in favor of a fresher look. It's certainly not meant for body copy.\n\nI do feel the {s} is not quite finished yet. I'm thinking of cutting off the spur to the top right to clear up that join a bit — let's see if it's still legible then (or maybe even more so?).\n\nGruß\n\n"

      "content": "@ Jürgen: I agree on the {S}, not so much on the {T}. I like the fact that the current {T} needs no kerning other than with punctuation. I made a simple-stroke {I} as a stylistic alternate (.ss02). The .ss01 now houses a few alternate caps that eschew descenders.\n\n@ Hrant: I'm not sure a font that was made on a weekend deserves a \"full crit\". It's made from rough wood, and ain't no polish gonna make it sparkle. ;o) But do tell me if you see anything stick out sideways, especially in terms of color or kerning.\n\nI don't know the first thing about Hebrew, so I'm wary to dabble in it. I've been thinking about a Greek and/or Cyrillic, though. And different weights... but most likely I'm going to publish a single Latin weight first, see whether people like it, and then decide whether or not to put that kind of effort into it.\n\n"

V?) I think it would read more easily if it were shortened some.  \nOtherwise, I think you've made strong choices overall. Maybe get more creative with {$} to go with the classy os figures.\n\n"
