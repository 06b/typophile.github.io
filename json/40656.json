It has been set in that face surely since 2002 till present.  \nThe similar I found is Rhode Black Condensed, which actually isn’t.  \nI know it could be a custom design.  \nAny hint is welcome, no need to tell you.\n [‹ What Font Is Used On The Front Of The MasterCard Credit Card logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080110085159/http:/typophile.com/node/40658 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Moominvalley In November published 1971 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080110085159/http:/typophile.com/node/40674 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
