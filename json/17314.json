  "content": "Hi there. I’m converting an OpenType Indic‐script font to AAT, which uses mark‐to‐base and mark‐to‐mark positioning (I think) and I was wondering if there was an easy way to use these positing data when generating AAT tables? I’m rather a novice at this so any help along these lines would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \n– Nicholas.\n\n [‹ How do I count glyphs in FontLab?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808060721/http:/typophile.com/node/17522 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [having trouble loading font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808060721/http:/typophile.com/node/17698 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
