  "content": "Hello typophiles,\n\nI'm looking for a sans font that would look between a humanist font and a gothic/grotesk font. Serious and elegant.\n\nFor example, FF Meta is too humanist for my purpose and Helvetica Neue is too cold.\n\nIt's for a stationary so it should be legible in small sizes, but it should also work for body text. In addition, this font should be \\*slightly\\* condensed in its regular shape (like Meta or Frutiger).\n\nFrutiger seems like the right choice right now, but I'd like to test with a font a tad less humanist.\n\nBy the way, please do not suggest any fonts that only come in 200 euros + bundles (DTL, I'm thinking about you). As beautiful as they may be, we're a small design studio and we can't afford them !\n\nThank you for your help !\n\n",
