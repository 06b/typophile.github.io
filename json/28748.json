The UK seems to have a different style.\n\nI found another thread on this subject too...  \n [http://typophile.com/node/27727](http://web.archive.org/web/20110618060803/http:/typophile.com/node/27727 \"http://typophile.com/node/27727\")\n\nI should add that I'm a traditionalist on this score - but I come from book publishing where the editors are real sticklers for Chicago. It is most important (in my book pardon the pun) to be consistent in your use of dashes so as not to confuse the reader. The em and en dashes should be distinct from one another both in style and usage. Unfortunately their length varies widely from font to font.\n\n"

Having spaces around dashes appears to become more and more popular in anglo-american countries, too, as of late. I think there's a thread on here where your topic was discussed in full length…\n\n"
