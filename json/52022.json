That doesn't mean your friend can't stick with their concept, they just need to find a way to distinguish it from all the other bubble logos.\n\nPerhaps they could make the accent on the A more of a feature, for example try having the bubbles growing out from the top of the A. The bubbles have been done, but I'm sure they can be explored a bit further to create something more original.\n\n"
