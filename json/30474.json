      "content": "The new Saks Fifth Avenue type layout seems so corporate -- it is cold and lacks the personality of the former logos. Maybe they want something to reflect how it feels when you go inside to shop?\n\nI love the one from 1955. It's so, so... European, fun and playful. Or maybe, I'm just so familiar with it, as the 50s were a time for me to play in Saks and get invited to their Christmas parties for employees' children...\n\nWith lettering like they want this January - well, they might as well be a bloomingdale's.\n\nAnd Sakro - please answer Bald's question. Are you looking for a similar font - because a few of us are brave enough to start looking for one for you.\n\n"

You can do some of your [own research](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012030147/http:/typophile.com/forums/typeid/faq/#Q_14) using Mike Yanega's impressive [Script Font Identification Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012030147/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html). With its accompanying [Script Font Reference List](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012030147/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html), it covers over 3,000 Script and Hand-drawn fonts. It's a very valuable visual reference tool, which allows you to find about any script known to man in a number of handy categories.\n\n"
