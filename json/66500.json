  "content": "Hello,\n\nLooking to get some feedback on a logo I've been working on. The company is called Edible Adventures - Mobile cooking classes for kids. It's pretty self explanatory. Client is looking for a simple execution of her logo. It has to communicate food in a fun way and easy to read. Could be used as signage on vans/store front/stationary/marketing materials.\n\nPlease take a few minutes to look it over. Let me know your thoughts/suggestions.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017175802im_/http:/typophile.com/files/EdibleAdventures_6299.jpg)\n\n",

Your bite on the \"v\" seems a hair awkward as well, it just sort of shortens the letter and I think will get lost as a \"bite\" as smaller sizes.\n\nI really like the overall feel, but I think there's be a bigger impact with less chewing. Maybe even just one bite? \"Edible\" already clearly implies eating and probably doesn't need one. Just thinking out loud :)\n\n"

It might also be a bit small, depending on target size/application of this. Did you try using a secondary font that's less loud for the subline, which could also allow for it to be subordinate without being tiny?\n\nBTW, how about a few crumbs lying around, from the nibbling?\\* I'd think adventurously eating kids don't leave clean white space… :-) But maybe that's too much.  \n(\\* Maybe those could click with the subline in some way, size-/placement-wise.)\n\nEdit: Cross-posted, this post is in response to the first version.\n\n"

I might even make a custom \"v\" (a roundish form) to fill its space better.  \n- The crumbs are spaced a bit too regularly.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Perhaps you could try keeping this connecting strip a bit thicker, or try what happens if you completely let the lower left terminal 'snip off', so to speak. Perhaps rotate the bite by a few degrees counter-clockwise so the lower left bit of the S doesn't become to small, either.\n\nI'd probably also slightly nudge 'edible' to the right, so the space between the ascender of the d in 'adventures' and the e of 'edible' isn't so tight.\n\nAnd I was also going to suggest chopping off the top of the t, as hrant already mentioned.\n\n"
