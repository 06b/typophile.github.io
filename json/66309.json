However, the W does not match in upper or lower case. The sample shows a lower centerpoint than Camingo has for its w's.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The W,w difference, the way the y tail connects, and the i dots are the only immediately obvious differences to me (recognizing that I lack the calibrated eyeballs of some of you folks) :-)\n\n- Mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120303123011im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Soho-Camingo_4590.gif)\n\n"
