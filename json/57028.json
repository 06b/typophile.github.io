  "content": "First time poster/font creator here.\n\nI have designed a simple handwriting typeface for a project, it's not much but it's a key element of a brand I'm creating. I used Fontlab Studio and generated a Truetype font which works perfectly on my Mac and has been tested on a PC too, no problems.\n\nUnfortunately I've encountered a label printer who is using an antique PC running Windows 98 which is telling her that there's a problem with it, but is of course being vague about the nature of the problem.\n\nI don't have a PC so can't run any diagnostics on the font to see what might be causing this incompatibility. If anyone out there can have a quick look at the font file here [http://www.mediafire.com/file/r2ozdj2mgdx/G&S Script 02.ttf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203174755/http:/www.mediafire.com/file/r2ozdj2mgdx/G&S%20Script%2002.ttf) and tell me what's wrong I'll be eternally greatful.\n\nI know the font doesn't look like much on its own, but it's an integral part of a brand I'm creating for a new client.\n\nThanks  \nT\n\n",
