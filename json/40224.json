Why did they have to use Arial here? If they have Frutiger, they must also have Helvetica.</cite>\n\nThat really was the first thing I noticed after I realized that I had been accepted.\n\n [‹ Agate lines](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706171526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44944 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What is the font in Typophile's headlings? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706171526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44949 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

They could have used Frutiger for the banner too, but maybe they wanted it to look different.\n\nOf course, the person who created that banner probably chose Arial just because it was the default. If the person had had more time, he probably could have gotten someone else with a license for a better font to make the banner. (Of course, I don’t care **that** much about the font they use in the banner.)\n\n"

Standards design standards can be pretty much up to each faculty and within faculties, it can be a dog’s breakfast. Academic staff don’t want to be bothered with such details. Admin staff are too busy to care.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
