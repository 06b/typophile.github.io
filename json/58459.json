My pirated copy, but not by me, is called AlchemyGoldA24, version 4.1 (according to SuitcaseFusion). The only references I can find are Czech, and no designer or foundry is mentioned.\n\nDoes anyone have information regarding this font?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140320151754im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Alchemy_4403.jpg)\n\n",

Font Bureau has Sofia, and I think I have seen others. Parts of your font seem familiar, but I don't know where I saw them before.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
