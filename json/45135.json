  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI once had this crazy plan of assembling an international, all-star typejam band that would perform on TypeCon. As it turns out this could very well happen in Buffalo. That’s why I’d need as soon as possible a complete list of people attending this year’s TypeCon who play (a) musical instrument(s).\n\nCould you please send me an e-maill with:\n\n(a) your name  \n(b) which instrument(s) you master  \n(c) which is your preferred style of music (for playing, might be different from what music you like to listen to!)  \n(d) your proficiency for each instrument, ranging from promising amateur over semi-professional to seasoned pro (I’m really sorry, but beginners can’t apply)  \n(e) if you have experience with playing in bands (very important!)\n\nWe will try to cook up a set list, which every musician will have to rehearse autonomously. Please keep in mind this will be an experiment, so I really don’t know where this will end.\n\nThanks everyone for your co-operation.\n\n [‹ Black print problem](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708211809/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45419 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [some los angeles apartments ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708211809/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45511 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

A similar predisposition?\n\n"

I’m good at it, but outside of that arena I don’t do much. Thought I’d mention it anyway.\n\nI would imagine there are lots of type designers that are also musicians. Seems natural to me. Get yourself a singer and maybe guitar or keyboards and you’ll be in business. Myself, I’ll probably just keep playing to the 4 walls or maybe look for an Irish session in buffalo.\n\nGood luck,  \nStephen Rapp\n\n"

My preferred method is to fit lyrics up to songs with in-progress instrumentals; sometimes I start from vocal melody. Since it’s a one-time gig I get the feeling that we might end up moving in the direction of parodied pop covers. I hope not, but if so my voice is still all yours.\n\n"
