      "content": "Nice start!   \n   \nTwo things to note:   \n1. Pay attention to the thickness in the horizontals vs verticals. The horizontals start looking too thick... see your Friday, May 21, 2004 - 3:40 pm post. The black makes it look more pronounced. Thin those up a bit (or thicken the verticals). Slanting makes the problem worse so you'll need to over-correct for it. Work in black (not outline). It won't hide the problems.   \n   \n2. Know when to break your grid. Not all caps are meant to fit in the same width. That N for example is looking cramped. A is a little cramped. L a hair wide. C is wide. E maybe a hair wide.   \n   \nNot super excited about the style of wings. They look kind of like a hair comb! Nice guitar BTW.   \n   \nKeep at it!   \nRandy\n\n"
