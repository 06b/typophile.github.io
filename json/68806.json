  "content": "hello. i wondered if anyone could provide any help or advice with fontlab? at the moment it seems to have set a default descender of -250pt. the typeface i've created drops below this and when i test/generate the font all the descending glyphs are clipped slightly where the tails exceed the descender line.\n\ni imagined dragging the descender below the lowest point would have solved the problem but it didn't seem to affect it. perhaps there is another way?\n\nany help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
