  "content": "Hi all,\n\nIt's my first ever post here on Typophile. Apologies for not presenting me further, but for now my frustration over Fontographer is getting the most attention.\n\nProblem:  \nI can't import EPS-files into Fontographer. When I import it says Syntax Error... I've tried the backwards compability in Illustrator too. I've exported to EPS 3.0, 8, 9, 10 - and still same Syntax error.\n\nI can't cut & paste Illustrator vectors to Fontographer either...  \nIt becomes pixel out of the vectors and it put's itself on some kind of invisible layer OR nothing happens at all. The funny thing is that it HAS worked one time...\n\nIs there some kind of trick I have to pull here to get the vectors from illustrator to Fog?\n\nHope anybody can help me.\n\nI have Illustrator CS1, Fontographer 4.72, OSX 10.4.5\n\nThanks in advance and regards from Sweden.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nI just found the sollution for your CS2 problem when trying to import eps files created in Illustrator CS2. I can't waith sharing it with the world. Its a bit stupid, but it works fine. Fontographer needs level 1 postscripts to import, CS2 can't make those. Maybe there are other sollutions, but this one could be the one to use when everything else fails.\n\nYou create your vector thingies in CS2. Make your path as simple as it can get (no overlapping and such). Copy it and paste in Photoshop as path. Then you export the path in Photoshop as ai. This ai file is ideal to import in fontographer. No error messages what so ever, not when importing and not when creating the font files.\n\nI work with windows and fontographer 4.1, but i think this will work on a Mac too.\n\n"
