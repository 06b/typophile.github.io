  "content": "Hello all!\n\nI'm wondering if anyone could help me.  \nI'm doing a logo project and need a sans serif.\n\nI'm thinking something geometric like Avenir and Futura, and something classic like helvetica and Akzidenz-Grotesk.  \nBut still it needs a twist of personality to it.\n\nPrefferably I would like a quite newly released font (not that wildly used), but I'm open for everything old and new.\n\nAnyone who have any good suggestions.  \nIt would be appreciated!\n\nSiriSiri\n\n",
