      "content": "The drawback in linking to FontFonts at MyFonts is that it requires   \nthe user to use more clicks to buy because it eventually sends   \nthem offsite to FontFont.com which is pretty antiquated and not   \nas usable as FontShop.com. So if possible, I'd link to FontShop   \nfor all FFs.   \n   \nPatricia - About [FF Nexus](http://web.archive.org/web/20091119060156/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=FF%20Nexus) and [FF Seria](http://web.archive.org/web/20091119060156/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=ff+seria): they are indeed   \nvery similar. Both from the same designer, Martin Majoor.   \n [FF Scala](http://web.archive.org/web/20091119060156/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=ff+scala) is also similar, but with a larger x-height.   \nThe key differences lie in the fact that FF Nexus is newer,   \ndesigned from the ground up in [three styles](http://web.archive.org/web/20091119060156/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=virtual.content&area=sf_fonts&content=fonts/ff35/index.html) (slab, serif, sans)   \nand available in OpenType Pro with lots of features.\n\n"

I actually did go to Fontshop first but you don't list the designer (or I couldn't find it easily) so I ended up at Myfonts. Also, as Yves mentioned in an earlier post, I'd use your site a lot more often if you had a good keyword search.   \n   \nYves, think of all the money you save on shampoo.\n\n"
