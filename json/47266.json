  "content": "I am a graphic design student currently working on airplane cockpit displays. I wanted help with choosing a font that would work well in a cockpit environment. I was wondering if anyone here has information about efforts made in designing fonts optimized for cockpit displays.  \nThe closest thing I could find was - The Design of an Optimum Alphanumeric Symbol Set for Cockpit Displays by the Air Force Institute of Technology, Ohio School of Engineering. While I came to know of its existence through the internet I could not get hold of the document to see what’s in it.\n\nAny information would be helpful. Thank you!\n\nVinu Chaitanya  \nNational Institute of Design  \nAhmedabad, India\n\n",
