Especially in the image provided by Adam it looks as if these are just attached circles without any optical corrections. The horizontal strike in the middle of B looks funny to. The upper outline seems to be slightly diagonal instead of horizontal. Or something is wrong with the transition from straight to curve.\n\n"
