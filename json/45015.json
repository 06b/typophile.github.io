  "content": "I recently finished both upper and lowercase letter forms for a new geometric sans-serif I'm working on. Similar to Gotham & Futura.\n\nI've included two alternate character ideas on the third line. I kind of like that Univers inspired Q, wasn't as fond of the R (it was just the first one I made), I think I might just delete it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122201753im_/http:/typophile.com/files/handgloves_3958.jpg)\n\nI intend to complete punctuation marks, some common ligatures where they may be needed, then different weights\n\nLooking for tweaks to be made, specifically on some of the lowercase letterforms.\n\n[view full size](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122201753/http:/i29.tinypic.com/21j4qvp.jpg)\n\n",

They look like they are from different typefaces.\n\nIt's weird, but as I read left to right, it seems like the letters have different influences from other typefaces. I see a little Gotham next to some Avant Garde, then some DIN.\n\nThe \"g\" looks like it has an underbite.\n\nDavid\n\n"

      "content": "thanks David. I think you make an especially good point about the M. Looking at it now, i think the pointed N works, but I feel like I should rework the M to flatten just the top points.\n\nIt's true the face does have a few different influence, mostly Gotham and Futura as I mentioned, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Do you?\n\n"

Same thing woth \"G\". **Very** obvious.\n\nAny you also mix styles. Sharp tappered M (second version) compared to flat top A. K and R (second version) too different... etc.\n\n"
