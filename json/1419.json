  "content": "I work for a small magazine and I am using Adobe Minion as a text font. My problem is that the Minion Regular style uses lining figures instead of text figures (oldstyle figures) which I feel is more appropriate for running text.   \n   \nNow, I could just go through all 80 pages of each issue and manually change every instance of the lining figures of Minion Regular to the text figures of Minion Expert, but that seems a little inefficient.   \n   \nSo, I thought I�d just get a font editor and do a switch between the lining and text figures, this didn't work out to be as easy as I thought.   \n   \nExperimenting in FontLab I ran into problems.   \nMostly my problems deal with the mapping of the Expert styles.   \nI couldn�t seem to retain the original mapping upon opening. Comparing the original Hex. codes in the Font Reserve character map to the newly opened font shows discrepancies. In the Regular styles this is no problem because I can use the default Macintosh encoding, but there are no defaults for Expert styles.   \n   \nI could build a new Expert encoding map from scratch in a text editor but what a pain in the neck.   \n   \nAnd if I don�t remap and just copy and paste glyphs in a default encoding with disregard to the naming structure my the kerning tables don�t match up, so then I have to go in and change the kerning tables for each and every style.   \n   \nSo before I get neck deep into this, which has already been quite an effort for a novice, I�d like to ask some advice:   \n   \nIs there a better way to get text figures?   \nMy layouts are in quark and I use a Mac.\n\n",

Except for a few figure to period/comma kernpairs I doubt your in for much work. Adobe fonts are spaced rather well, and most Adobe fonts contain less than 300 pairs, so..... what's the problem.   \n   \nActually the best advice I can give you is:   \nHire a Professional!   \n   \nThen you can do what you do best, and they can do what they do best,   \n   \nAnd everybody makes a few bucks and has some spare time to enjoy themselves.\n\n"
