      "content": "Hi Eduardo,\n\nThis is amazing, it's a great work. One of my favorite letter is \"t\", and \"w\" is lovely too. Well, I love almost everything.\n\nThe crashing beak of the \"s\" is a little bit disturbing for me. I suggest also to release the gutter of the \"r\", it looks very condensed. The upper join of \"d\" is too wide comparing with \"b\" or \"g\".\n\nI think some straight terminals of the uppercase letters should be replaced by the \"A\" right terminal.\n\nSergio\n\n"

      "content": "many, many beautiful glyphs  \nlove the j, k, q, z, 9, B especially  \nq's a little hard to read but I find it so appealing that I don't mind!\n\nspine of S looks weak  \nagree about crashing on s; Y too  \nagree about r - appreciate that you don't want to open up too much space underneath, but the arm looks a bit like a squooshed ellipse.\n\nI wonder if the angles are a touch too sharp - the humps at x-height (bhmnp) and the flicks at the baseline (adhilmntu). Of course you don't want to make it too sloppy, but letters with those angles stand out a bit against letters without them to my eye.\n\n"
