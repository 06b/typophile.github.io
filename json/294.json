Comments? Is there a reference guide that may discuss this vexing issue?   \n   \nThanks in advance.   \n   \nCP\n\n",

The   \nimplication in your approach (both 1 and 3 in your   \nexample) is that the entire sentence (or at least the   \nclause \"call Acme\") is the trademark.   \n   \nI would set the sentence order as Acme., then   \nkern the period under the , but not so far as   \nyour #3 example. This way, also, your text is not   \n\"broken\" when repurposed into an environment   \nwithout kerning.   \n   \nThat's my opinion as a designer, typographer, and editor.   \n   \n_\\>Crazy dedicated typographers do the   \nsame with quotes over periods._      \n   \nCrazy dedicated typographers who use well crafted   \nfonts shouldn't have to, as the quote-period kern pair   \nshould be present in a good font. I also include kerns   \nfor period-quote in my fonts. I have not, however,   \nheretofore built a kern pair for trademark-period.   \nBut perhaps I will include it from here on out.

Then I would tuck the period in so that it would match any other e. combination.   \n   \nI'm more concerned with the flow of the sentence as it is read. The TM is going to be ignored by the reader, so I try to make it as inconspicuous as possible while still meeting the legal requirements of the corporation.   \n   \nJMHO\n\n"

I recognize now that my idea of building this into   \nthe font is problematic. Such an extreme kern of the   \nperiod under the  will pull the following spaceband   \nand subsequent letters up tight. This won't work.   \n(Except maybe with an OT contextual table or something.)   \n   \nI must admit that from a practical standpoint, setting   \nthe period first is more effective. I still don't like the   \nidea of breaking the underlying text.   \n   \nAnd I agree with Kristin, I'd like to see the  at   \nleast as close to the preceding word as the period, so   \nthat, if anything, they seem to occupy the same space,   \nwith neither character before or after the other.   \n   \nMy revised opinion.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
