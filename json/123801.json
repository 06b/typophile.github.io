  "content": "The HapticScript family is a connected brush script with a warm, personal and soft character. The typeface family has five styles from Light through Black. It was designed as a companion and extension to the Haptic sans-serif family.\n\nHapticScript has up to 14 variations for each glyph. The almost 2,000 characters per font including 40+ ligatures enable designers to give each word an individual look. Many swash characters for initials and word endings make words looks as if they were hand lettered.\n\nFive Styles: Light, Regular, Semibold, Bold and Black\n\nOpenType features: Ligatures, Contextual Alternates, Stylistic Sets, Old Style figures, Tabular figures\n\n[http://www.henningskibbe.com/hapticscript/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215/http:/www.henningskibbe.com/hapticscript/ \"http://www.henningskibbe.com/hapticscript/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/henning-skibbe/haptic-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/henning-skibbe/haptic-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/henning-skibbe/haptic-script/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript_banner_01_6483.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript_banner_02_4827.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript-word_3_6295.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript_banner_03_6053.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript-word_9_4240.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript_banner_04_5738.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript-word_15_5876.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript_banner_05_3559.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript-word_17_4850.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150329054215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hapticscript_banner_06_5409.png)\n\n",
