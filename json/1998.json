Eastern and Western calligraphy are just so different in style and spirit. I'd like to see your CD cover design, if you don't mind, in order to give you any meaningful suggestions... You need a display face, am I correct? You probably want something that's more obviously Japanese in flavour, without being too clich\n\n"
