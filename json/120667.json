I am aware the artist is modern - in fact the print in question was done in 2006. I'm thinking that they might all be hand-drawn? I'm trying to match to fonts for another print - I will probably have to just choose something close. For the script font I'm considering Shelley Script or Old Fashion Script Regular.\n\nThe CINCINNATI looks very familiar, but the N is very unusual. I've attached another sample of that font in case that helps.\n\nI also have not tried font recognition software, but that might be the next step.\n\nThanks for your efforts!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317113906im_/http:/typophile.com/files/portland_font_3777.jpg)\n\n"

Spencerian script handwriting became the dominant form of penmanship in the United States for the rest of the century. As you can see, strokes are graceful and rhythmic, and letterforms are characterized by flowing loops and flourishes.  \nA search for Spencerian script produces other similar fonts.  \nDon\n\n"
