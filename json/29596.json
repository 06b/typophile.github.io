  "content": "I am trying to determine the various typefaces used by Domus magazine on its cover throughout its history and would appreciate any help you folks can offer.  \nThe first one was introduced in 1947 and has remained constant since. It looks like Akzidenz Grotesk bold condensed to me, but I'm certainly no expert. The image is from 1950.\n\nThe second is from earlier, from 1944.\n\nThe third is from earlier still, from 1933. In that one, I'm paricularly interested in the typeface used for the subtitle, Arte nella casa.\n\nThese may well be easy identifications for you, but I'm giving a talk about cover design of architectural periodicals, and want to avoid slipping up on this particular element of it!\n\nmany thanks-Linda\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [245A50.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131005052615/http:/typophile.com/files/245A50.jpg) | 14.22 KB |\n| [203N44.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131005052615/http:/typophile.com/files/203N44.jpg) | 8.41 KB |\n| [061G33.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131005052615/http:/typophile.com/files/061G33.jpg) | 8.01 KB |\n\n",

I'm prepared to go with Yves' suggestion that the logos were custom designed. There was a stretch of Domus in the very late 30s and early 40s when the logo changed with nearly each issue, and was very much \"handmade\" or even \"handcrafted\". Yet the editor of the magazine remained constant. I am wondering what contributed to the radical changes—fashion, yes, but there must be more to it.\n\n"

Thank you so much in advance.\n\n"
