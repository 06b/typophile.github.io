Can we keep it up?\n\nI think it deserves a time-wasting yet difficult challange:  \nWho can design their own avatar to perfectly mimic that of another person’s? You gotta do it from scratch or if you do swipe parts, do it cleverly. (Which is the motto of design, no?) No cheating!\n\nCategories are:  \n1) Most Difficult – Repeat the impossible  \n2) Quantity – How many can you do?\n\nThe winner gets to claim the title of “AVATAR MASTER”.\n\n [‹ Companion font for Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20070708121854/http:/typophile.com/node/31131 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [wayfinding ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070708121854/http:/typophile.com/node/32013 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
