You could use a number of Techno fonts, such as [Space](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623023809/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/space/) just by slanting the letters and adding the white line.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

You should however, try to find smaller [Wholesale Stickers](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623023809/http:/www.emanprinting.com/sticker-printing/Wholesale-Stickers.php). That way you get more for your money and they'll fit into the squares on the calendar.\n\n"
