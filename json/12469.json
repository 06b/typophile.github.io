  "content": "Hi gang,\n\nI’m trying to sell my director of marketing and head of company (neither of them typographic or even particularly visual people) on the idea of spending thousands of dollars for a typographic update. I’d love to have in my back pocket a few examples of typographic redesigns (before and after shots) that really show the idea of small changes making a big difference. I seem to remember seeing someone’s site who redesigned a lot of newspaper mastheads...\n\nSo please throw me some urls. Titling fonts rather than text is more appropriate, brands rather than magazines/newspapers are more appropriate. Subtle changes are best, but the ’wow’ factor of the After pic being way nicer than the Before, even to untrained eyes, is key.\n\nThanks!  \n-obsolete\n\n [‹ Financial Services Text Face?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080215235215/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12503 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Clean Modern font for Medical website ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080215235215/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12491 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
