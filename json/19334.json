I’m putting together a fan site for the really quite good British band Pure Reason Revolution, and am stumped when it comes to the font they use in their graphic profile. Nothing that follows the general lettershape of the font has a an A or U like what I’m looking for.\n\nHere’s a URL for their logo (Hope it doesn’t break the forum):\n\n[http://www.brick-yard.com/base%20images/library%20images/bands/pure%20re...](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141407/http:/www.brick-yard.com/base%20images/library%20images/bands/pure%20reason%20revolution/PPR%20-%20logo250.jpg \"http://www.brick-yard.com/base%20images/library%20images/bands/pure%20reason%20revolution/PPR%20-%20logo250.jpg\")\n\nI’d be grateful for any assistance, as this band has such an awful offical site that a professional fan site is direly needed.\n\n [‹ (x) \"I've come a long way...\" very familiar connected script - York Script {Patricia}](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141407/http:/typophile.com/node/19333 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Oil tankers on the New Jersey Turnpike - custom painted (similar to Futura, Century Gothic) {Yves} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141407/http:/typophile.com/node/19325 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
