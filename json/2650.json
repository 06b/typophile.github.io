The only think that i want to keep is the size, because for a big pixel fonts, can be a complete and new option for designers.   \n   \nI understand that the name was used for companies like the Apple Records or for Apple software, bacause of the relation with Chicago, is illegal to keep the name?? can be a trouble, i am walking on ice?   \n   \nmh\n\n"

I post the first new Apple image to get your feedback.   \n   \nI build and test this font in a LCD screen at 1152 x 768 (powerbook g4 15\"), for been used in similar screens,small pdas, cellphones and in E-Ink, who uses grayscale colors.
