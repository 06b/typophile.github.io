  "content": "I have fairly recently switched from PC to Mac. Last night I tried to transfer a folder of fonts that I had on my pc over to my mac, but they are all in the format pfb and pfm..\n\nI googled it and found out that I needed the program Adobe Type Manager Light, so I went and downloaded that, but it has come in a weird format that wont open.. (the full filename for it is \"atm462.sit.hqx\")..\n\nDo you guys know what I need to do to get these fonts? From what I can gather, pfb and pfm are sort of zip formats.. Please correct me if i'm wrong!\n\nHappy Christmas also!\n\n",

OS X can't deal well with a lot of fonts on its own before stability problems start popping up. Since it comes with hundreds (almost 500 in the newest factory-installs!) to begin with, it's important to use a font management tool to handle your fonts, [Linotype's FontExplorer X](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215060606/http:/www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX) is free, seems to be the most stable app out there, and has some useful cleanup tools for when fonts go bad. Stay away from ATM—it's old and being phased out, so when bad stuff happens with it you're just sort of screwed.\n\n"

They should have identical file names except for the extension.\n\nThat aside, you have a more basic problem. The private Adobe fonts folder only enables fonts for applications that use the shared Adobe font engine. This includes InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop and AfterEffects (among others), but Fireworks is not part of that group. At least, not in the CS3 version.\n\nI don't know of any way, short of converting the font, to enable a Windows Type 1 font to work with Fireworks on Mac OS.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

Though I don't get the font in ANY of the CS applications (not even in InDesign when both files are placed within its own fonts folder) and I was wondering if there's any other reason for which they might not (e. g. they have to be of a certain \"version\", etc.).\n\nI'll look into the IIRC.\n\nThanks again,\n\nEmiliano\n\n"
