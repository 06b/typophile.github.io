Because I figure everyone needs a stencil typeface in their library and I'd rather make my own rather than use someone else's creation.   \n   \n ![Equanimity Stencil](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414222859im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1079.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I agree. The way those letters ended up is a result of having such a narrow width. When diagonals come together separated by the stencil support (whatever they're called) it looks like it's one big geometric shape with a line through it, rather than a couple of bars coming together.   \n   \nThe way other stencils have solved this is to have the support diagonal rather than vertical. When I first created the typeface, however, I was hoping to avoid that because I wanted it to be more uniform... I may have to reconsider that.   \n   \nAny comments on the \"Q\"? It gave me some trouble and I'm not sure I like how it turned out.\n\n"

However, the changes are more pleasing.   \n   \nIf you are going to make this change througout, then the 7 and Z are also candidates.   \n   \nAlso, the R might look better if it follows from the B form.   \n   \nThe only other thing is the H. The small stubs almost disappear.   \n   \ngood job   \nbj\n\n"
