It was somewhat difficult to balance a) blackness, b) extendedness, and c) a reversed stress, and some letterforms that might otherwise have shared a quasi-analogous construction, such as the X and Y, here do not.\n\nI'm going for a more fun, ultra-black vibe than anything mannered or historically reverent.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [marne-spec.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416065832/http:/typophile.com/files/marne-spec.pdf) | 24.77 KB |\n\n",
