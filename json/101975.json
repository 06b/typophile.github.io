  "content": "Hi to all,\n\nI am building a code font using Font Creator ... I am amazed how easy this software is to use (so far). One of the elements of the 'code' is to replace all the glyphs with alternates, including the 'carriage return' or 'enter'. So far, I haven't found a way, and wondering if it is even possible.\n\nIn application, I would simply take recognizable test, and within other applications, change the font to the 'code' font.\n\nAny thoughts or help to this novice would be most appreciated.\n\nKind regards ...\n\n",
