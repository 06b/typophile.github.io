Receiv­ing the can­vas bags stuffed with font sup­ple­ments from T26 was cer­tainly a high­light of my first year. Why? Well, firstly, type sup­ple­ments are nor­mally _beau­ti­ful things_. They didn’t neces­sar­ily make me look at type any dif­fer­ently, but they made me want to _col­lect_ type…. [I]t’s a mind­set that leads to a shal­low under­stand­ing of the broader craft. You get dis­trac­ted by the next beau­ti­ful typeface. You’re con­stantly on the search for the typeface that is _just right_. Font choice is not the most import­ant decision you make when design­ing with type.**\n\n",
