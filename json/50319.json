[Ngoc Ngo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009203256/http:/typophile.com/user/33598/track) is a seasoned consultant and an MFA candidate focused on graphic design at [Academy of Art University](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009203256/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Academy%252Bof%252BArt%252BUniversity). He has joined [Punchcut](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009203256/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Punchcut) at our San Francisco office and will be engaged on a number of initiatives for this site and for the Typophile community.\n\nWe’re looking forward to the traction that he’ll bring to our modest world domination plans. Please say hello!\n\n",
