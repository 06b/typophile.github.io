I was thinking about using RoboFab, but I’d really prefer to write the script myself in this case, and their list apparently claims to be non-comprehensive and not guranteed to be accurate.\n\nAny idea where I can find a comprehensive, accurate list?\n\n [‹ help needed- which typeface would pair well with Clarendon?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210055252/http:/typophile.com/node/39855 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Alternative to Papyrus ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210055252/http:/typophile.com/node/39867 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The best part is that I’ve also got the unicode indices in each character as well. I’ve now got about 200+ diacritical pairs formatted for use in my script. I think this is everything I need to build sufficiently broad character sets with my glyphs.\n\nThanks guys!\n\n"
