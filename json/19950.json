  "content": "So, I went to a talk in London recently by the diminutive italian Massimo Vignelli and his lovely wife Lella. I'm by no means a modernist in the vignelli sense, but nonetheless enjoy some of their furniture and product design. I've never been the biggest fan of his graphic design -- it always feels a bit sterile -- like the humanity has been intentionally stripped away. It could be argued that this is a necessary part of facilitating clear communication -- something I don't agree with however.\n\nSo Vignelli says that all we need as typographic designers are 6 typefaces, and no more. I got a little offended by this, and felt that he, well, missed the point of variety in type design. I find this quasi-utilitarian position a little strange. One typeface could theoretically function suitably (ie we could read it), but 6 is apparently the precise number that will cover the gamut of human emotion in the present, and oddly, in the future too. He claims to detest 'sameness' in design, but he contradicts his own polemic when his typographic designs are the very epitomy of this. They all borrow from a specific and unchanging box of modernist visual language. Heavy horizontal bars, grotesk types, a blind allegiance to the grid etc etc. It's not even as if he is using these 6 typefaces in a variety of ways either. Furthermore, despite hundreds of years of type design, he finds it suitable to include one of his own creations -- our bodoni -- in this elite club. I just don't get it.\n\nRant over.\n\n",

I wouldn't want to live in a primary-colored world, but Mondrian and the DeStijl crowd nevertheless had a cool new way of expressing themselves.\n\nWhile Vignelli's work operates within a consistent vocabulary, I don't agree that it looks dated. In fact, when you go through design history books, his designs from the 1950s and 60s look startlingly contemporary, which can't be said about much from that period.\n\n(Also -- why refer to him as \"diminutive?\" Does his physical stature have any relevance?

Phototype for setting books in the 70's seems like a bad dream now. The absence of size-specific designs, new, klunky typesetting technology, the limitations to character sets, badly-converted \"classics\", all contributed to a measly palette for designers to work with. Vignelli wisely constrained himself well within this limited range. But his attitude now is simply eccentric and ossified. His comment about Helvetica's proportions also indicates his focus on display typography.\n\nI also have similar queasy feelings about some of the designers you mention. It isn't necessarily their work or their impulses. The modernism bug was still going around, mutating and breeding with the Art Deco and Art Nouveau bugs, and I can't make myself like it. I suppose it was a trend, like everything.\n\nI also don't say we have oodles of terrific graphic designers now, compared to then. Though there's a wealth of well-made type now, very few people operating as graphic designers actually understand how to use it. I imagine Shahn, Rand, et al could run circles around newer designers in their understanding of how type works.\n\n\"If youth but knew, and age but could\"\n\n"

I definitely agree with Tiffany regarding Vignelli's use of the grid.\n\nI try to approach his views on typeface selection in a not so dogmatic way, rather I try to take from it the importance of knowing a few select type-families really in depth and learning to use them well. I think sometimes it can take some time to warm up to and learn to use a typeface beautifully. So I try not to see it as 6 being some sort of magic number, or the 6 he chooses, but more so about being able to use some of the 'few' well designed typefaces effectively (not that I think there is only a few, but the number is small in the grand scheme of all the badly designed ones imo). I still think taking the time to choose the most appropriate typeface is really important as well.\n\nLast fall I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Vignelli while he was in Toronto; picked him up from where he was speaking to take him to our school. During the ride we talked about typefaces and I had explained that I was interested in designing my own typefaces and asked him if he thought new typefaces should be designed to accomodate new mediums or to improve functionality in existing mediums/applications rather than just modifying the old types to work. To my suprise he supported the idea of a new typefaces providing that its improvement over the old was significant. This was good to hear but I suppose this also puts forth the question of how you measure the functional aspects of one typeface over the other, not always so easy; it could very well become a subjective decision resulting in Helvetica again. Nevertheless, it was a really fun and inspiring talk that he gave to us!\n\n"

      "content": "I don't know much about Vignelli's graphic design work, and in general I'm not terribly interested in graphic design. But I don't have a problem with someone saying that he believes only six typefaces are necessary. In order to be even internally consistent, the statement presumes the context of a particular kind of design -- presumably the kind Vignelli practices and advocates -- since it is easy enough to conceive of a kind of design that would require seven typefaces, and another that requires eight typefaces...\n\nThere is a very find book designer and publisher in Germany, whose work I have admired, who has used only the Janson for many years. If he were to tell me that only one typeface is necessary, I wouldn't argue with him, since he has demonstrated this to be true in the kind of design he practices.\n\nThere is an aspect of Vignelli's statement that I find quite refreshing: it suggests that he views typefaces as tools to be used in design, rather than considering the design of the typeface to become integral to the design. This is a legitimate view, usually indicating an understanding of design focused on spacial arrangement rather than stylistic evocation. Often, a distinctive typeface is used as a kind of stylistic shortcut by lazy designers. Limiting the typographic palette forces one to work harder at other aspects of design.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Limiting the typographic palette forces one to work harder at other aspects of design.\n\nThat may be a useful educational exercise, but as a general principle it seems to me to put an ideology ahead of the needs of the text. It seems to me that graphic design should communicate the text in the most effective way possible, where that 'effectiveness' will vary greatly with the text and the purpose of the author and publisher. For example telephone address and number listings will call for a different approach than an advertisment for a pop star's new record. Yes, you can use Helvetica for both, but I really doubt that today this is the best solution for either one.\n\n\\>book designer ...whose work I have admired ... has used only the Janson for many years\n\nNote that they are publishing books, and probably of a similar genre. Also, generally speaking book faces are quieter and less differentiated than display faces. Further, many books don't need to be trendy or fashionable in their text, which some magazines and many advertisments will want. So I don't doubt that a book publisher could use the same typeface very effectively for years. But this doesn't make Vignelli's principle valid.\n\nI think that the '6 faces' thing is narrow minded, and I don't like Vignelli's work on the NY subway. However, in the thread last year someone posted a link for the guidelines for the National Park brochures that Vignelli designed. And these were excellent. And here a designer notes how good his lay-out guideliness for his magazine are.\n\nSo it seems to me that here is a guy that is both talented and dogmatic, and the result is a mixture of good and bad work, but in any case there is probably a lot to be learned from him.\n\n"

To say that the nature of a clean modernist aesthetic creates cold, inhumane graphics is probably true of most, but I don't see it as an absolute. I suppose it depends on what you personally consider constitutes humanity in graphic design -- for me, modernism can still make an emotional connection and warm the cockles of your heart. I am not looking to bash anyone, just start a little discussion, and to try and understand the situation better.\n\nConsidered font selection only improves good layout and concept beyond stylistic trivialities (in my mind at least) -- I suppose this is the crux of it -- he doesn't seem to believe that to be true. (well only if he's designed the font himself). Don't worry, I'm certainly not gonna lose any sleep over someone else living their life how they want to -- just trying to understand -- but if ever the term zombie modernist should be used, it is here.

The two are vastly different approaches to design, and you need to know a designer's approach before you hire them. I'm in the latter category for sure and it has backfired on me from time to time - people saying my 'look' isn't right for them when I really don't think I have a 'look' and in fact think I could probably do nearly any type of design except perhaps the David Carson illegible look.

Rather than the designers trying to conform to a certain aesthetic or to leave their visual mark on a project. I respect that, and this is what I like about many of the past modernist designers.\n\nListening to Massimo talk he brought up an interesting point. I don't necessarily agree with it since I don't feel it is relevant for every project be said he felt that here was no target audience. As soon as you determine or direct your design to a specific audience you are already starting to narrow down its effectiveness, and when you have something being implemented that will be viewed by people of many different cultures like the material for the national parks, you need to keep it as universal as possible. So I think when your have a firm view on visual communication like that, there is bound to be a strong continuity between your work.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics I see a lot of designers today I think trying to emulate that \"swiss style\" and often very poorly, just seems to come off like faux modernism; very shallow and not based on strong principals that they have a firm understanding of. One of the few studios that I think pulls it off quite nicely is Experimental Jetset. They recently contributed a very interesting article about modernism today for our school magazine called Verso. (email me if you are interested)\n\nI find graphic designers like David Carson have more of a look, he’s obsessed with himself, and does whatever the heck he wants which is why all of his work usually ends up looking the same, and at the same time I can’t really see what the ideas behind his work is in the same way I see it with Massimo, aside from the fact that he wants to make it one way so he does.\n\n"

In literature and music almost all were cultural conservatives intent on reimagining a European tradition from within the mass culture they despised. The tone was lower in architecture largely because the arbiters of taste were lightly educated socialist politicians with limited budgets. Historians of the visual arts have tended to remake all modernism in the image of architecture's holy fools, but Gill and van Krimpen were more representative of the main stream of modernism than early Tschichold or Vignelli.\n\n"

      "content": "If you lived through modernism, you would see that it was an attempt at utopian design that tried to grasp the new mass-production world of the time and create design which was more system and process oriented rather than the single item as work of art theory which it rebelled against. Vignelli was a man of system design and he was good at it. His critics look at his single works and compare them to others' single works rather than the production system that they were. Hindsight is easy but modernism did a great service to the design profession. It brought it out of the \"Just make it pretty\" artiste school and into the \"just make it communicate\" school. This elevated the profession in the corporate world and brought about what we now call branding. You can debate the success or failure of the aesthetic that now remains of modernism in retrospect but the truth is, modernists were trying to make design devoid of style. Sadly, its major critics complain about it because of style!\n\nChrisL\n\n"

There are the wonderful Heller-Filli books, but these are about the look of advertising and display. I would be interested to see the differences in design and typography, as seen first by those in the movement, and then from a current perspective.\n\nMy feeling is that modernism in archicture was mainly a disaster, but in type some good products and ideas came out of it. I would like to read more about the conflicts and changes within modernism--such as Nick has pointed out--and its real accomplishments and failures.\n\nThe ideal of being devoid of style, which Chris interestingly points out, is obviously naive in hindsight. I do think as Chris notes, they were in the later phase on to something in their thoughts about 'system', which photo type enabled them to think about in a new way.\n\n"
