  "content": "Hello everyone.   \n   \nI've just discovered this wonderful forum in search of a place for some help. I'm a graphic design student researching logos and symbols that contain numbers in them, preferably something people can recognize. An example would be Baskin Robins which is known for the 31 flavors logo or Seven up and Seven Eleven. Please post anything that comes to your mind.   \n   \nThank you for the help.\n\n",
