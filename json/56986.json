  "content": "So I’m currently looking to create a personal mark for placement on resume, website and possibly a business card. As much as I need this, I’m also looking to make this a good learning experience so please feel free to be blunt and honest.\n\nI’ve decided to show a variety of samples just to see if anyone sees any potential in a particular direction. The focus thus far is on my name and my initials ’KM’ as I don’t particularly want to brand myself as a company, just as an individual. (Is there a danger in doing something as common as your initials?)\n\nAny and all feedback and comments are appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170557im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kmlogos_3676.gif)\n\n",

As for the type, none of that is finalized, I just wanted to show placement.\n\n@graphicurious, I will definitely try that. I just want to make sure it works in 1 colour first.\n\n"

Though I think there is potential in “A” if you play with the mark a bit more (fill colors).\n\n“F” is a great option, and I like the first one you posted in this thread, you’ve turned it from a scripty “m” into a spiral. A spiral can mean a lot for design. “motion” “moving” “progress” “progress bar” “controlled creativity”, etc.\n\n"

Anyone else see the italic A?\n\nF is gorgeous. I guess I don’t see too many anagrams that are just one letter. I think its rather useful to have a mark recognizable from another orientation. I also get the read that these are waves—the creative flow.\n\n"

One, the angle of mark doesn’t match the angle of the italics. Two, second line is overpowering the top one. I think smaller type in the second line might work quite a bit better. I’d also consider setting both lines in italic or dropping the italics altogether.\n\n@bemerx25: [This one](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515170557/http:/www.hyperic.com/images/customers/mosso-logo.png) ? Even if they were not deprecating its use, it is pretty far from Kevin’s version. As in “impossible to mistake one for another”. Three vertical strokes at a slight angle is a very generic pattern, so it all comes down to the styling and decoration. And these are different between these two logos.\n\n"
