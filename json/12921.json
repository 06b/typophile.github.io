  "content": "I’m sorry, this isn’t type related . I had to tell somebody. I just found this incredible foreign film, called A Tale of Two Sisters, based on a Korean folk tale. This movie was infinitely better that any of the recent crop of Asian Cinema remakes. I almost had, and I mean HAD, to hit the power button on my dvd player a couple of times. Also better than Ju-On, and it’s remake The Grudge. Genuinely classy, creepy and scary, all in the right places.\n\nCiao\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [2sisters.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905100924/http:/typophile.com/files/2sisters.jpg) | 47.27 KB |\n\n [‹ Best of Type-ID (Pssst, Yves)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905100924/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12846 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The birth of something new... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905100924/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12969 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The stories may be familiar but the way they are visualized is just awesome.  \nToo bad that the regular channels don’t carry many Korean movies.\n\n"

Interesting side note: the [poster (cover?) looks a bit different on Netflix](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905100924/http:/www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70020305). I guess it makes sense: bloody vs. not bloody = Korean vs. American (we like the killing, but don’t want anyone to see it...?).\n\n"

I’m almost afraid to watch the hollywood version to see what they’ve done to it. i myself am a bollywood fanatic. for a good B horror movie with great music and dance sequences you gotta watch “Gumnaam,” part of which is featured in the opening of “Ghost World.”\n\n"

It’s usually the other was around tho, isn’t it ? Don’t we usually get smacked with the dumbed down version of things, other than vice versa. The cover was one of the reasons I picked it up. Non-bloody version. Just seemed to have a little more of a ’what is happening in this picture’ feel about it.\n\nSeems stronger message wise to not have the blood. Hmm?\n\nLet me know how you like it ...\n\nOh, and BTW, that new film ’Dark Water’ w/Jennifer Connolly, is also a remake.\n\n"

I guess I assumed that because I’ve gotten screwed by U.S. rental and retail video chains renting/selling the not-very-clearly-indicated edited/censored versions of foreign films and not even offering the full versions.\n\nThough, now that I think about it, it’s really the sexual content that gets snipped out. Which is true over all U.S. media. I should’ve guessed.\n\n(I’m also resentful of the coverage of the Iraq war, so that’s the big reason for my little gripe.)\n\n"

A theory has it that the censorship actually contributed to enforcing the people to visualize or to extend those parts that had been cut off, which explains well some of the success of Korean films that they enjoy these days. For Koreans had been trained en masse in audio-visual communications in that way for some decades.\n\nJust kidding.\n\n"
