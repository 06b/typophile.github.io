  "content": "Hello folks,\n\nJust watched the trailer for the upcoming film \"Babies\" and it has a fantastic logo/logotype. I'm fairly confident its not a custom job, since several things are typed out in it.\n\nI have attached a couple samples.  \nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 10.35.13 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115953/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-01%20at%2010.35.13%20PM_0.png) | 18.23 KB |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 10.38.42 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115953/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-01%20at%2010.38.42%20PM_0.png) | 49.52 KB |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 10.39.22 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115953/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-01%20at%2010.39.22%20PM_0.png) | 57.06 KB |\n| [Screen shot 2010-02-01 at 10.40.02 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012115953/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202010-02-01%20at%2010.40.02%20PM_0.png) | 69.3 KB |\n\n",

Maybe there’s a different digitization.  \nF\n\n"
