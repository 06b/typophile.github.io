      "content": "AllGiggles, since you seem to be writing from the UK, you may not be aware of the unique aesthetic that has developed amongst American college athletic logos. A perusal of the myriad designs at [this site](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/www.logoserver.com/College.html) will show you some of the trends that have developed — bold, oblique, and high-contrast type (often with pointed serifs), everything on an angle, every mascot sneering, etc. There are some historical marks presented at the site (Alabama’s all-smiles elephant from who-knows-when comes to mind) to give you a historical perspective, too.\n\nAs for official logos for colleges and universities, there does seem to be way too many marks that include [a torch](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/www.und.edu/) (signifying knowledge), [complicated seals](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/www.northwestern.edu/) (asserting legitimacy by harking back to European institutions), or (almost exclusively) serif type.\n\nSome institutions have worked hard to update their identities, often giving a modern facelift to their crests and seals ( [Loyola Chicago](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/www.luc.edu/logo/about.shtml#) and [Cornell](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/www.cornell.edu/identity/) come to mind).\n\nMy institution, the University of Notre Dame, has done the same, recently updating their identity to include [this simplified mark](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/mark.nd.edu/). However, it should be noted that the [university seal](http://web.archive.org/web/20061113112335/http:/nd.edu/aboutnd/about/sights/images/wall_seal640.gif) — a more complicated, historical version of what’s seen in the new mark — is still used for official business and can be found many places on campus.\n\n"

The clincher is that they had a new building made in the last few years, and the signage on the entrance still bears the previous logo. So, their marketing department have created a de-personalised, bland, modern-looking logotype to represent a red-brick university steeped in heritage. Nice one. (There are 2 unis in Nottingham, the other is an old poly which has, incidentally, rebranded to appear more established).\n\nIt comes down to design by committee, and letting everyone in the place have their say on it… I can see why it happens, but you would think that a marketing department should really know better.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/before_5843.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/after_4326.gif)\n\n"
