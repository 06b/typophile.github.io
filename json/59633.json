  "content": "Dear Typophile,  \nI am building Open Type features on Volt for a Devanagari font. I understand the basics of the software but some bits remain blurry. Right now, I am wondering on an efficient way to group the few glyphs I have. I do not need to build features for a large range of signs; I have in my font 45 conjuncts as well as the inde vowels, the vowel signs, the consonants, the half-forms.\n\nI hope it could be simple and straight forward!\n\nThank you\n\n",

But you have my VOLT project file, so you can take a closer look.\n\n"
