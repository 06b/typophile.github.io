  "content": "Hello\n\nI recently got in to a heated discussion with a designer friend of mine, who believes \"Zapfino\" can never be used in graphic design or art to produce \"amazing\" work.\n\nI personally think typefaces are like tools, each with a spectrum of uses or applicable scenarios. Some typefaces have a wide spectrum of uses while some have a much narrower window. I think to suggest that a typeface can never be used to produce beautiful work is underestimating human creativity and the infinity of creative possibilities.\n\nI have tried to find examples of Zapfino used amazingly but have not managed the knock-out punch. I would greatly appreciate help in locating these.\n\nPlus what do you guys think about this debate in general.  \nIts my first time here so be nice. Thank you.\n\n",

      "content": "My guess is that most designers would shirk from using it not because the typeface itself is bad – but because it's a common typeface found on consumer computers, and thus is used in endless amateur publications. Combined with its distinctive looks, this has the unfortunate and rather unfair effect of making it associated with amateurism; all typeface \"meanings\" are, of course, socially contructed, and this would play into that.\n\nZapfino is certainly not the only good typeface that's underused for this reason.\n\n"

      "content": "I went to Identifont to have a look at Zapfino.\n\nIt doesn't seem to have been as popular as Times Roman or Papyrus, or even Palatino and Optima. But I did find it scary.\n\nBoth Zapfino and the completely different Zapfino Two are _script_ faces. While I think one could make good use of them, say, on an album cover, and it certainly is narrow to think that script faces are only good for wedding invitations, their narrower domain of applicability reduces their opportunities to be used well.\n\nUsing a face for a wildly inappropriate purpose, after all, is using it badly. Being popular hasn't stopped Goudy Old Style from being used well on occasion.\n\n"
