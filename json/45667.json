Maybe someone took the logo and just added the “Welcome to” in the default font on his software or just some font he liked.\n\nThe ITO EN is definitely quite close to Helvetica, and I would guess it is. Those characters aren’t particularly characteristic of most fonts, however, so you’re going to have some difficulty determining the exact font with just these characters, and you should probably choose the font by looking at the more characteristic characters.\n\n"
