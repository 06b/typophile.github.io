I know that some sans faces have them, but many don't.\n\nI have altered the numerals for the Trade Gothic Condensed to make the numerals look better with the all lowercase text. Still, I know better than to alter a typeface.\n\nI would like to know if this is just dead wrong, is it okay? I didn't squish any letterforms.. I actually manipulated some of the anchor points. Part of me is ticked with myself for thinking about it, and another part likes the way it looks.\n\nPlease tell me what you think?\n\nThanks,\n\nevan\n\n",

None of it too far of, but far enough to make them look odd.\n\nAll this could be be fixed. I've done it for several fonts with reasonable success, and I'm not that good at originating glyphs. FWIW, the \"2\" is usually the hardest.\n\n"

      "content": "FWIW, I think these old-style numerals tend to look nicer in styles where the ascender of the 6 and the descender of the 9 are just gentle sweeps (as in most of Chris' suggestions above), and not so good in those where they curl back inwards – as in the Trade Gothic Cond that you've been working with.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working.\n\n"
