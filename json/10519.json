This is traditionally one of the wider letters, so perhaps you could make it one pixel wider, and then lengthen the foot on the right?

I know too little about Yontef to appreciate his work in full.   \nHis Erica Sans is an \\*incredibly beautiful\\* hebrew version of Gill Sans and I'm intentioned to mail him and buy it.   \nOn the picking of Maya: well I'm surely not enough familiar enough with Hebrew letters to judge it properly. I tend to prefer other faces from Oded, but Maya seems good. Maybe Bringhurst (sorry I called him Gary!) picking Maya has the same problem of many of us latin-based guys. He's not a \"prophet\", even if his \"Elements\" has become a \"Bible\" for the old as well as the new \"Elite\". (this is a personal joke). But Oded submitted Maya only I think, so...   \nBTW: Hey, that Narkis Mem is beautiful! Where do you find Narkis?   \n  \nOn your Asa: Reverse also the question mark: we must challenge conventions if we wish to make more sense: if it's right-to-left, it's right-to-left. I agree with John on the Aleph. The Mem, well, I would like more one of the softer versions, since it becomes too uniform if you \"square it\" all along. Maybe it's just my taste, but I like variability in forms which are supposed to be similar. This helps the reader, too.   \n  \nJohn: can you tell me why in occidental packaging (I do pack design, you know), the weight of the product, when expressed in arabic, uses the numerals in reverse order?   \n(left-to-right)?   \nAlso, where I work in the mornings, I've recently typeset a series of cereal boxes in 16 languages and the translator provided us tiff images for Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and Chinese.

The year I judged the competition, I selected Vladimir Yefimov's Kis Cyrillic as my judge's choice. It is a very good design, but probably wouldn't have been my choice if my task had been to select the very best overall design in the competition; indeed, selecting an overall winner would have been very, very difficult. Rather, Vladimir's design struck me as an interesting and important project to which I wanted to draw additional attention and about which I appreciated the opportunity to say something extra in the TDC annual. Interestingly, the same year, Barry Deck and Kathleen Tinkel both used their judge's choice to make critical comments about designs. I don't know what Robert Bringhurst's reasons for selecting Maya were -- and I can't remember what he wrote about the design in that year's annual -- but the selection doesn't necessarily mean that he thought Maya was the best piece in the competition.\n\n"
