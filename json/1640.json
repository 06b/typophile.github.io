They tracked how much students 2nd year students progressed over then new two years, by class academic quarter. The top quarter advanced more than two years. The lower quarters progressively less, with the bottom quarter knowing less than they did two years before!   \n   \nThis confirms my feeling that the hostility to learning doesn't affect top students that profoundly.   \n   \nI have read that some black students are ostracised by their peers for 'acting white' if they excel in their studies, but this is a special (serious) problem for one group.   \n   \nThe hostility may well affect the middling and poor students, but in a way that is hard to tease out. Two of my children have been top students, and but one couldn't have cared less about her studies. Her view was that in high school most kids were just turned off by school in general, and found it boring and pointless. She feels that the youth mass media does have a big impact, but that a bias against academic excellence is hard to differentiate from the general malaise.   \n   \nAnother problem in understanding the impact and what to do to counteract it is that different schools are very different. For example, poor urban and rural areas have much more severe problems than suburban schools.\n\n"

In other countries, including the US, it isn't._   \n   \nLots of people in the USA, including professional historians, refer to the Armenian genocide. Many also point out some differences between the Armenian genocide and the Jewish genocide, e.g. that the Armenian genocide was not racially based in the sense that race was understood by the Nazis (i.e. as genetic rather than ethno-linguistic), and that the Armenian genocide was territorial: the Turks massacred Armenians in a particular locale and did not express an interest in killing every single Armenian anywhere in the world. These distinctions are important -- good historians should always identify distinctions and nuances, since the particular is by nature more precise than the general and so more likely to be accurate and supported by specific evidence. People who claim that these distinctions are sufficient to deny the term genocide in relation to the Turkish massacre of Armenians are indeed pursuing an agenda. Then one must ask what their intent is. If they are concerned that using the term genocide for territorial, non-genetically\\* inspired mass murder might diminish the full horror of the term when applied to universal, genetically inspired mass murder, then we should seriously consider that concern. One way to address that concern is to remain clear about the distinctions, and to acknowledge that there are different types of genocide. In fact, the nature of genocide -- literally, people killing -- depends on how the perpetrators define the uniqueness of the people that is their victim (genetically, ethnically, linguistically, culturally, or a specific combination of these), including the definition that those whom they kill are not people at all.   \n   \n\\* I dislike using the term 'racially', because this accepts a distortion of the traditional meaning of race, which is ethnicity, applied by the very 19th century proto-geneticists whose ideas informed Nazi 'race science'. Since I can't use the term race to mean ethnicity without risking confusion with genetic concepts of race, I try to avoid it altogether.\n\n"

The Newcastle report recommended this type of education on the grounds that the labour market required a supply of \"persons thus minimally qualified\".   \nMeanwhile, the Public Schools Act and the Endowed Schools Act (both concerned with fee-paying schools\\*) were shaped by the Clarendon report, which suggested that \"classical literature is the staple of English education\".   \n   \n\\*In England, both public schools and private schools are fee-paying. The equivalent what Americans call 'public schools' are known here as 'state schools'. (The fee-paying schools have recently started referring to themselves as 'independent schools'.

The word \"genocide\" on the other hand is indeed usually used for the Armenian Genocide, but it's not exclusive - and of course the Holocaust was also a genocide.   \n   \nAs for the Turkish ambitions (which have in many ways remained the same), there was Pan-Turkism, which was the desire to create a large empire that spanned all the Turkic peoples all the way to Mongolia (where they came from less than 1000 years ago), so the racial basis was in fact there. But it was an excuse. The real reason is the usual reason: money\\*. The _visible_ Armenians (in Constantinople) were wealthier than the average Turk (although our rural majority was in fact getting increasingly poorer, due to harsh governmental repression) and that caused resentment. The resentment was amplified with religious differences, and exploited. The poor Kurds were even recruited to massacre us - little did they know about choosing sides... We had been living peacefully under the Turks for 600 years at that point, and the resistance efforts in the far East of the country were only a result of repression (just like in Gharapagh). Just look at the names of the towns in the eastern third of Turkey: they're Armenian - and they're where my grandparents were born.   \n   \n\\* In fact the same could be said of the Holocaust: all the \"racial purity\" business wouldn't have appealed to the average German - they were in an economic frenzy, never having recovered from the brutality of the victorious Allies from WWI.   \n   \nNot to engage in one-upmanship of tragedy, but we lost much more than the Jews: not only didn't we end up gaining a new country, but we lost much more than a big chunk of our population - we lost our _land_, which we had kept for almost 3000 years.   \n   \nWhat's the real twister though is that Hitler used the example of the \"eradicated\" Armenians (they didn't know they couldn't get rid of us that easily) to justify the Holocaust!

I would refer to what you describe as ethno-linguistic, not racial (although prior to the 19th century race was simply a synonym for ethnicity). There is a significant difference between ethno-linguistic genocide and genetic genicide. Intermarriage, assimilation and religious conversion -- all of which are recognised ways to destroy an ethnic group -- are insufficient 'solutions' for Nazi genetic ideology, because of their belief that race is genetic and survives intermarriage, assimilation and conversion. Hence the logic of the 'final solution', which was really the only solution that would satisfy.\n\n"

This has led to endless debates about whether such-and-such a group of murderers are terrorists or freedom fighters. Terrorism is a strategy. It should be defined by the action, not by the perceived status of the person commiting the act. Militant Palestinian organisations pursue a terrorist strategy in their war against Israel.

      "content": "to go back to the topic � if someone is still interested by it � i have some questions :   \n� what is french \"radical philosophy\" ? If it's relativism, well, it's really not the main point of it. Yes it's a part of the debate, but there's a lot of theories, of analysis methods etc. that don't need to agree with relativism idea to work. You can't throw out all structuralism thinkers because you hate relativism.   \n� one said a derive would be to focuses on differences more than ressemblances, like i did with derrida and foucault. Structuralism, which use structures (how strange) and categories, is far more bounded with ressemblances in comparisons than differences. Some ask for changes to introduce more complexity � humanness, as physical presence etc. � precisely because they though it was too simple.   \n'Cause this synthesis magic is as interesting to understand things and give a valid analysis as dangerous if comparison criteria are not strict enough. Huntington Clash of civilisations is a goos example of something stupid because of abusive \"synthesis\".\n\n"

I was indicating the (mis)influence of French thinkers on North American academia, and the fact that the same thinkers have not had the same influence elsewhere indicates that the problem is largely in the culture that receives their ideas rather than the ideas themselves.\n\n"
