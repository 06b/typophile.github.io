I also don't think that Futura would be such a great mix with that building… the Reichstag comes from an early time, which had its own architectural (and lettering) style.\n\nThose letters were designed by Peter Behrens, who was probably the country's most renowned designer at the time. But I think that Behrens' work became less popular in the 1920s and 1930s…\n\n"
