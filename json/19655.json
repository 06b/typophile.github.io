  "content": "This is my first attempt at designing a typeface. This is for an assignment in type class and I drew my inspiration from an R I saw on a headstone in a cemetary. The name comes from the fact that some of the letterforms are a combination of regular and small caps. I'm still working on a few of the letters...the Q, S, G, and O in particular...so any feedback is welcome.

If there isn't time, I'd be even finishing off a few lowercase letters to show the feel would probably get you a better grade for extra effort (unless it doesn't work that way anymore)  \n: )\n\n"
