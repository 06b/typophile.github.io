In 1950 the power of this unmediated route from original text to printed sheet caught the imagination of a young returning serviceman, Desmond Jeffery. He saw in the work of Anthony Froshaug what could be done with hand-set letterpress. Unlike Froshaug, for whom it was a matrix upon which to develop a design programme, for Desmond the practice was the programme. He equipped himself with an Adana, an Albion and a collection of foundry types, most of them imported, then in 1956 took over a jobbing letterpress workshop in Marylebone, where he installed a Heidelberg platen. Customers ranged from the Stevens Shanks foundry to Mayfair galleries, the Goldsmiths’ Company to the Partisan coffee house. This is the first public exhibition of his work.\n\nIn a talk on 27 October, Paul Stiff, James Mosley and Ian McLaren will contribute personal views of Desmond and his work, to be followed by discussion with other speakers.\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nStay up to date with our events feed  \n [http://stbride.org/events/events.rss](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135442/http:/stbride.org/events/events.rss \"http://stbride.org/events/events.rss\")\n\nView event photos  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/friendsofstbridelibrary](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135442/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/friendsofstbridelibrary \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/friendsofstbridelibrary\")\n\nGet event reminder tweets  \n [http://twitter.com/stbridelibrary](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103135442/http:/twitter.com/stbridelibrary \"http://twitter.com/stbridelibrary\")\n\n",
