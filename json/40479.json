  "content": "First of all: Happy 2008!\n\nThis year I would love to hear your critique and advise about the typeface to use for correspondence and legal papers. I’m a lawyer at a small firm (my own), and the last 2 years a passionate typophile.\n\nAs for years, we’re using Times New Roman. No wonder I would like to change that soon.\n\nI truely like the look and feel of the H&FJ fonts like Gotham and Mercury, but for long text it doesn’t seem right somehow.\n\nI love Scala too, but untill now I must admit that Minion Pro has the best look on print. And Minion is again well used and hardly exiting....\n\nDoes any of you have good suggestions? Thanks!\n\n [‹ Examples of Serifa?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192705/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31962 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Suggestion: Irish Pub Fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192705/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40569 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

[Century Old Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192705/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=century+old+style) is plenty invisible, generally attractive in an average sort of way, and for those reasons, readable. All that and classically handsome! (Average handsome.) Schoolbook is a little too childish for a law firm...it was designed for school books and made famous by Dr. Seuss. If you’re looking to present a more casual image, you might want to look at Comic Sans.\n\nAnd back to seriously...this [Arno Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192705/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=arno+pro) that [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192705/http:/www.myfonts.com/newsletters/iyf/200712.html) is featuring is fresh and clean!\n\n"

Neither flashy or dull, it was designed for modern printing techniques (unlike Times) and comes with several weights, has Old Style figures if you want to use them. Dante (Monotype) would be excellent too. Adobe has it packaged up nicely in OTF at a better price.\n\n"
