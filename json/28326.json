  "content": "Hello,  \nI have been trying for the past week to contact the author who created the font \" A Yummy Apology\" every time I find an email address I get a failure response mailed back to me.  \nThe authors site is supposed to be \"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/gemnew/\" I've also tried to contact him by the various sites that stock this font but with the same response as above.  \nIts strange as I actually want to buy the commercial liscense to use this font for a project but I can t get hold of the Author, most would jump down your throat to sell you a license.  \nAnyone got any suggestions?  \nI would be open to using another similar font if anyone has any suggestions.  \nAny help much appreciated  \nMartin\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014094815/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_46.png) | 25.98 KB |\n\n",
