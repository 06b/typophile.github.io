      "content": "Honestly it's best to get a website because it's kind of a pain for people to download your pdf for viewing especially when there are several applicants. It also clogs up their inboxes and makes it hard to share your work around the office.\n\nThere are some sites that you can upload your work to like portfolios.com or foliolink.com.\n\nWhat you send should be examples of your best work that show your strongest skills as a designer.\n\n"

      "content": "Consider what kind of work the studio specializes in. Obviously, you'll want to showcase any online skills you have for an employer that does a lot of web work.\n\nWhen I'm looking for magazine designers, I prefer a PDF for the very reasons Haley cites in support of online portfolios: easy to share via e-mail (or place in a \"candidates to consider\" folder on our server), easy to zoom in to see detail, easy to look under the hood to see what type was used... ;)\n\n"

      "content": "[http://indexhibit.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041301/http:/indexhibit.org/ \"http://indexhibit.org/\") is a cool project, and I've seen a lot of designers use the format. Just buy a domain and some server space, and you can plug in your images. Make sure to follow the instructions on the site very carefully, though, if you do decide to go this route.\n\nIn terms of what you should show, 10 pieces is plenty. If you don't have 10 strong pieces, show 5, or 6, or however many you think can stand on their own outside the context of your portfolio.\n\n"

      "content": "I rarely find anyone accepting unsolicited PDF portfolios from prospective interns; most people don’t want their emails getting jammed up with gigantic files from clueless students who output everything from Indesign as a “High-Quality Print” PDF and so all PDFs are ignored as a matter of priciple. If a design firm is requesting PDF files, try to get it under 500kb before emailing; you can always post a hi-res version online somewhere and email a link along with your small PDF.\n\nIt’s much better to have a web site that people can just browse, and you can post any crazy files you want to on a web site linked from images. [My horrid little web site has brought me three internships in as many years.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015041301/http:/www.jpad.biz/) Indexhibit is nice, but if you’re really desperate you can just tweak one of the Dreamweaver templates (most designers don’t even look at them and won’t recognize them).\n\nAs for the work, pick the best pieces you have, if you really don’t have a clue what to pick ask your professors and fellow students. Keep in mind that when people say 10-12 pieces that means 10-12 (or whatever number) pages of stuff to look at, not 10-12 multi-page projects. If you talk a lot at job interviews put more stuff online and take less in person—I run my mouth so much I’m lucky to get through five boards before I’m out of time. Lastly, go to any portfolio review days put on by local design organizations. Drag out every wild piece of crap you have; one good suggestion can take a real turd and turn it into a great showpiece.\n\n"
