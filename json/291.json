Can you give me more information about Hebrew?   \n   \nI knew that as of Windows 2000 you could use Hebrew MS Word, whereas before you had to have the special Hebrew Windows. I didn't mention this above as I believe Hebrew Word would be more expensive, and more than what Kyle needed.   \n   \nI have been using DavkaWriter, but was looking for a better typeface than offered there. One does, I believe, need a Hebrew word processor, because of the right to left text, and expecially for the nikudot. Even Israelis regard putting in the nikudot as incredible hassle. Without a Hebrew word processor, I would think that it would be a nightmare. (Teamim are a double nightmare, but there is only one book for which they are needed, the Chumash - the Torah and Haftarah with the vowel and chanting symbols - and of course the text is already available digitally set.)   \n   \nI am doing a modern commentary (in English) on a classic Jewish text that I can get on CD rom, and I am also designing and setting the book (to be published by a commercial house). Davkawriter, which I am now using, has their propriatary system, not compatible with others, but I believe the Israeli CD roms with my text will work wherever Hebrew Word works. I suspect Dagesh also has their own system. Will your new typeface, and regular fonts from Israel paste with nidudot correctly into Word?   \n   \nI am also buying InDesign for the project. I noticed that there is also an InDesign ME (middle east) for Hebrew and Arabic. Will everything work OK for me pasting the Hebrew that goes into Word into regular Indesign, or do I need InDesign ME? Do I need an open type font, or will regular PS or TT fonts also work on pasting the nekudot properly?\n\n"

You can also do quite a lot just with Wordpad. The only thing you would be lacking would be Hebrew dictionary support. MS have an Office 'Proofing Tools' pack that includes Hebrew dictionary, sorting algorithm, as well as a whole pile of pretty good OT fonts from Gutmann in Israel.   \n   \nI have not used DakvaWriter. Is it Unicode? The really nice thing about the MS approach is that it is all Unicode, so the text is interchangeable with other applications and across platforms.   \n   \nIf you want to do Hebrew typesetting, you need the ME version of InDesign. The regular version will not do right-to-left text, and it will not do GPOS mark positioning. [The current InDesign ME will support _nikud_ positioning, but only clumsily handles _teamin_; I am corresponding with Winsoft, the makers of IDME, about this and hope to have it improved.]   \n   \nRegarding fonts, you really need OpenType if you want marks to be positioned really accurately. However, IDME has pretty decent algorithms for mark placement, so does a reasonably good job at 'blind positioning'.\n\n"

I don't need to compose in InDesign, but I do need to include nekudot as my book is for Americans, and most who know some Hebrew need the vowels. Do you know about this?   \n   \nRight now I am pasting Hebrew from Davkawriter into PageMaker. Each line becomes a paragraph, and I force justify all of them, except the last line of the paragraph right justified. This works. Davka actually in the past year or so also got Guttmann fonts, so perhaps switching is not going to help me that much, for my purposes. But there was a font on one of Luc Devroye's links - 'Poeta' - that I thought might work better with my design. Your design is nice - I gather it is designed to harmonize with matching Greek and Roman fonts - a feat!   \n   \nDagesh and Davka writer are legacies of the time when regular Windows couldn't handle Hebrew. I believe they use little-used slots (is that the right word?) in the ascii table for the nekudot, and then somehow have programming to position them correctly.   \n   \nHowever, I haven't heard about people in the US Jewish community who use these programs switching to just using Windows XP and Word. This could be because the dedicated English-Hebrew programs are designed to switch back and forth between languages easily, paste into Word etc. Also they have an on-screen Hebrew keyboard you can click with a mouse, so you don't need to know the Hebrew keyboard. Or maybe people just don't know about the new Windows options.\n\n"

The Latin is a kind of Dutch oldstyle, and the Greek is related to the Clio Greek that I presented at ATypI in Rome -- and hence to the Granjon St Augustin Greek --, although that will be the italic and there will also be an upright version influenced by the later Dutch Greeks.

Also, there is an established tradition in scholarly typography -- the target of the SBL fonts -- that Hebrew letters are taller than the Latin x-height but shorter than the caps. This has been the norm for a few hundred years. Interestingly, in Israel, the developing norm for mixed modern Hebrew and Latin text is for the Hebrew to match the x-height of the Latin.   \n   \nAt the moment, there are no plans to extend the SBL fonts for Cyrillic, although it might happen one day.

But really, even a preference for such cognates doesn't have to preclude making the vertical proportions different. You might say it's too much trouble scaling up the Latin cognates to a larger x-height, since you'd have to then make them lighter too; but with a little bit of technique it could be a breeze - here's what I'm thinking:   \n   \nIf you have a weight axis in your font (and one with a light extreme [sufficiently] beyond what you're actually releasing in the Latin), what you could do is simply scale up those cognates for Cyrillic use, but use a slightly lighter weight to match the Latins.   \n   \n\\> the developing norm for mixed modern Hebrew and Latin   \n\\> text is for the Hebrew to match the x-height of the Latin.   \n   \nYes, I've noticed - and it sucks.   \nI wonder why there's been such a regression. I have to suspect an unhealthy infatuation with the West.   \n   \n--   \n   \nI guess what you're saying is that you're simply following established norms, in each script. Norms are important, but functionality itself even more so, no? I mean, if the contemporary Hebrew method were to become the norm, would you then start following it, even though you knew it skewed the apparent sizes? And if you admit that vertical proportions do affect functionality (something the old Hebrew designers realized\\*), then why not push Cyrillic towards that too? Do you fear you'll be blacklisted by the Russian font mafia or something? ;-) Users don't even consciously realize what's going on, so they'd never complain; but under the surface they'd certainly benefit from better functionality.   \n   \n\\*   \nHere's an example of smart Latin/Hebrew proportions/color\\_matching, from an old Lino metal catalog:   \n ![linohebr.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081020051102im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11553.gif)   \n(Thanks again, Gerald.)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It has dual export mechanisms - one to Hebrew programs and one to English programs. The export to English programs goes into regular InDesign fine - in fact better than into PageMaker. It makes each line a paragraph, and I guess reverses the order of storage. (It also has a twin sets of Hebrew fonts for pastes into Hebrew and English programs.)
