For example »1960’s newspaper headline face« or »Lost in Translation movie logo« or »retro script« will do nicely. Whereas »Please help me identify this font« is pretty pointless as that’s the only thing we do on the Type Identification Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline would say »Stuff happened!«</cite>\n\n"
