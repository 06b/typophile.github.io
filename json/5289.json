  "content": "Has anyone here seen _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_? There's a magical map in the film (and book) called the Marauder's Map. The film version is very cool. The whole map is, if I remember correctly, a calligraphic or typographic construction (it's meant to appear hand-rendered, but uses a lot of type forms). The map shows the grounds of the school, and the locations of everyone inside, but instead of line drawings of structures, the walls and rooms are made of words.   \n   \nYou can see a few abbreviated versions on [the movie site](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525001547/http:/www.azkaban.com/), but they pale in comparison to the one in the film (which is much more detailed). Has anyone else noticed this great prop? Any thoughts? Any other images?\n\n",

      "content": "If you can abide it, stick around after the movie; the credits are a 10-minute walk   \n through the \"school grounds\" trailing fading footsteps along a close-up of the map,   \npast the hundreds of people involved in the production. I didn't have the stamina   \nto seek out the amazing calligrapher who made the hand-lettered map,   \nor who made the rustic font used for the titles, but I imagine there is a neat easter egg   \nwhen the footsteps arrive there. The footsteps sometimes take on unique characteristics so watch closely....   \n I found this one of the best parts (characters) in the movie.\n\n"

It looked a bit like oragami created by M.C. Escher and a calligrapher. At one point you see Sirius Black's footprints wander by and turn into paw prints (or maybe the other way 'round?). We usually watch the credits anyway, but this one was worth staying for more than most.\n\n"

I know that if I had to write hundreds of lines of unreadable latin, I'd include the names of friends and family, subliminal messages, the ending to the seventh book, etc.   \n   \n[1] In another scene, one of the doorframes is covered in runes. One rune that stood out was the [Dead Kennedys](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525001547/http:/www.deadkennedys.com/)' logo.\n\n"
