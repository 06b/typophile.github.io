  "content": "Situation: purchase load of fonts, realise you can get free merchandise with Veer based on the merchandise deal at that time... DOH!!! nothing out side of North America..! eh?... charge me the international shipping then... nope. See a merchandised product on Veer... live outside of North America?... sorry no can do. It is not electronics or country restricted software, just shipping costs would make it expensive... then I will pay... nope.. sorry.\n\nWhen noticing fonts on Veer I like and as I cannot get little incentives 'like some typographically designed merchandise' I either try to find at the actual designers site (as I hope 100% of the money makes it direct to that font designer or foundry), or myfonts.com as they sometimes have little specials or I order more that Veer does not have... so Veer misses out?...\n\nI like incentives, when they are presented.\n\nAnother question, what foundry or font supplier gives more of the margin to the font designer, would too prefer to support that.. I tend to go designer first, then foundry... then the myfonts, veer, fontshop etc...\n\n",

Many distributors drop to a 10% royalty on negotiated OEM licensing . . .\n\nIn addition, any sale that comes to the Font Bros by way of a direct link from the foundry garners an additional 5% of the TOTAL sale made so for instance if somebody came from BVFonts.com, MichaelDoret.com, HaroldsFonts.com, or MS-Studio.com to purchase fonts from us, we give that foundry an additional 5% of the total sale EVEN if the customer ended up NOT buying any of their offerings specifically . . .\n\nThat translates to a more than 70% royalty on every font sold through these folks and as far as I'm aware, is the best royalty offered through a 3rd party distributor . . .\n\nStuart\n\n"

Font Bros is often comes after other vendors in my mind because the web design builds such a strong association to the Mr. Retro and Font Diner products that I forget the fonts aren’t all retro designs. It’s not that I don’t know better, but the whole jukebox theme can visually overwhelming and makes it harder to judge the types on their own merits.\n\n"

And thanks Stuart (re: royalties)....\n\nI have purchased from House Industries, got the book all fine no problem, the House Industries book would weigh more than the cushions and a t-shirt. An idea for Veer, throw the cushions, the t-shirts and maybe a hat into the bag and ship it to me. Then I will get some photos done with me wearing the t-shirt and hat, with my House Industry book in my Veer bag, while relaxing on my Veer merchandised cushions.\n\nReally how sweet is it to get stuff like that in the post... we outside the US are being denied the experience of opening a FEDEX or other carrier 'signature required' parcels. Because sometimes the unzipping, un-stuffit, un-compress.... just does NOT cut it.\n\nWell looks like I may go to Amazon, House Industries or even sterling style HTFR (Hard to Find Records) and get myself some 'signature required' parcels so I can have some delight in opening them...\n\nI hope you understand... and in part jest\n\n"
