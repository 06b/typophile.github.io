It is quiet in its presentation and meant to allow clarity and legibility while adding its own character. It is intended to be used at text sizes in book settings, but is also suitable for a variety of design purposes.\n\nPro Opentype features include ligatures, oldstyle and lining figures, alternates, Central European characters and Swash Caps for the Italics. Stickley Text Pro is a feature rich workhorse with international functionality.\n\nThe Stickley Text Pro Family contains four 4 Pro and 8 basic OpenType styles- a total of over 3,000 glyphs.
