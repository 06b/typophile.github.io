  "content": "This is my first post, so: Hello! I'm not a type designer by trade, but I've been interested in typography for 25 years. A few months ago, I finally bought Glyphs and started noodling around. I had no goal, and wasn't looking at any references, but what came out was this friendly blend of Avenir and Akzidenz, with capitals that are more upright and American. Somehow, the more I tried to remove my own hand, the more of a self portrait it became. Has anyone experienced that?\n\nAnyway, it has already been a fascinating process, but at this point, I'd love some feedback. I'm open to any type of comment or critique. I have 3 masters so far.\n\nRegular  \n ![regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/abc-regular.jpg)\n\nHairline  \n ![hairline](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/abc-hairline.jpg)\n\nBlack  \n ![black](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/abc-black.jpg)\n\nHairline  \n [![hairline](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-hairline.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-hairline.jpg)\n\nRegular  \n [![regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-regular.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-regular.jpg)\n\nMedium (interpolated)  \n [![medium](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-medium.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-medium.jpg)\n\nBlack caps  \n [![black](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-black.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-black.jpg)\n\nBlack  \n [![black](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-black-mix.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-black-mix.jpg)\n\nBlock text (Regular)  \n ![regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317095621im_/http:/bensyverson.com/images/2014/07/demo-block.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "For a first-time effort, in an ambitious genre, that looks surprisingly good! You do have experience of bezier curve drawing from before, obviously. It's not the most innovative thing but it's a good start – I think you need to consider the personality of the typeface more, what direction you're taking it, because especially with the black it seems to hover between some chunky, fun characters and some that are more straight-laced.\n\nIf possible, could you upload a PDF specimen? With the inherent limitations of pixelled bitmaps it's hard to tell whether something is, say, a major spacing issue/a black blob of a stem width, or just a result of the bitmap itself. Not to mention curve wobbliness, hard to tell at this magnification level.\n\n/u/ is, at least, too wide. The black /t/ looks somewhat too heavy compare to the other characters, and it's a pity (though perhaps unavoidable) that the /y/ loses its connection to the /j/.\n\n"

      "content": "It's looking solid. But maybe too solid... What I mean is, unless you intend this simply as an exercise in learning how to make a polished typeface, it seems to need _something_ to stand out for its potential users, to be worth buying, or even just selecting. Which is hard to do without gimmickry. But don't fret about your work turning out as somewhat of a self-portrait; you're a person, making something. Just make sure the _objective_ isn't self-expression, because that becomes mere art; you want to make something useful to others.\n\nBTW, I like the mirrored AKA \"rationalist\" (as opposed to 66/99) quotes.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "@eliason: Good catch! I made it taller for contrast with the /I/, but neglected to propagate that change to the other ascenders. Thank you.\n\n@Birdseeding: Thank you so much for your feedback. I'll upload a PDF this weekend. It's interesting that you mention the /u/. I think it's the same width as the /n/—is that typical?\n\nI agree about the black /t/ and /y/ vs /j/. The /t/ can be saved, but in the black weight, the /y/ is a challenge. Maybe I can thin out the curve of the /j/ a bit to match.\n\n@hrant: That's interesting—I'm definitely hesitant to make the face more idiosyncratic simply to make it stand out, but I see your point. I suppose that's the challenge of this style: to tread the line between \"understated\" and \"boring.\"\n\nI'm still torn about the quotes. Sometimes they feel too cartoony, but I like that they're clear. As opposed to, e.g., Univers, where the contrast between open and close quotes can be lost at small sizes.\n\n@George: The overshoot is perhaps too subtle. I admit it's hard for me to notice it on the samples I posted. It's an overshoot of ±10 units with an x-height of 500, which is about the same as similar faces (I just measured two at ±12). However, it's consistent from the hairline to black—should it overshoot more in the black weight?\n\nI haven't even begun spacing or kerning yet. I'm dreading it!\n\nThank you so much, everyone—I truly appreciate your input.\n\n"
