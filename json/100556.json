  "content": "Prumo is a new type system by DSType. With 92 fonts, Prumo is based on a unique skeleton that flows, like a pendulum, from high contrast to low contrast fonts, is a sort of typographic journey, from the eighteen century typefaces to the nineteen century slab serif typefaces, gathering information from the scotch roman fonts on it’s journey. Prumo is a type family with classic proportions, that takes advantage of the recent type production technology while looking carefully at the most important historical references. Prumo Poster contains 4 styles that can be used as layers. Check it at [www.dstype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033415/http:/www.dstype.com/ \"www.dstype.com\")\n\n",
