This is because I have multiple subs for lowercase letters and they can’t be easily accessed if the letters are uppercase,\n\nI don’t want to copy the lowercase glyphs to the uppercase character map as I’d have to do all the subs again.\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n [‹ Small Capital Eszett?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121163451/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48746 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Reassign Keyboard Shortcut for Quick Preview in FLS5 Win? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121163451/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50073 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
