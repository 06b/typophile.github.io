Have searched all the places I normally look (Da Font, Font Squirrel, Identifont, MyFont image identifier thingo) and have had no luck. Have found similar fonts, but there would be one character that was different.\n\nHoping someone here might recognise the font. Sorry the sample is so small\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Wendy LP \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317174341/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
