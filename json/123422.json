  "content": "Hello,\n\nMy first thread on here so I guess I'll open by saying that I've worked in design for some twenty years and I'm writing my dissertation for my postgraduate in graphic design and typography. I've been asked to research the papers of John Peters, designer to Cambridge University Press, creator of Castellar, Petrus and Fleet Titling. Peters has some 7 boxes of his papers in the archives at the University Library in Cambridge but he is proving very elusive. I've yet to find his obituary or a record of whether he had children. An obscure query for a forum such as this but maybe worth asking. I'm off to track down any contacts in the city. I have found a beautiful, tiny specimen print of Petrus - the 4 1/2pt bible print that he created and his original drawings which are wonderful to see.\n\n",
