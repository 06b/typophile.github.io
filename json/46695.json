  "content": "Hi!\n\nI want to ask some help. I made a logo design last week with AI CS3. I saved it  \nonly in an \"ai\" file. Last night, my complete system crashed and I had to reinstall  \neverything. Now I tried to open my work and it sad, that Lily UPC font is missing, and  \nit opens the file, but the text is full of with missing character boxes.  \nCan anyone tell me, where can I download Lily UPC (or just simpy email me the upcll.ttf if you have got it), or with whitch program comes it together? (On my previous system there was a lot of demos installed, with Windows Vista Ult. Now i installed WinXP. Prof.)\n\nIt's very important for me, becouse the customer has already accepted the plans and waiting for the finished work...\n\nThanks and sorry about my poor English.\n\nMate\n\n",
