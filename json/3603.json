      "content": "You're right that the MLB logos are custom. Some were designed by artists long before digital fonts; some were designed my digital font designers for the Leagues or Teams, but the safe assumption is that few of them are going to be found in actual fonts, although sometimes you might find something close (Like using [Quentin](http://web.archive.org/web/20121128184052/http:/www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=Quentin), or a similar font for the Red Sox).   \n   \nWe have talked about having an FAQ for this, since we get so many questions about commercial and Sports logos, and almost all of them are custom artwork or custom fonts in order to increase the exclusive marketing potential and/or identity aspect of the logo.   \n   \nIf anyone could easily duplicate any look, the Sports teams would lose millions in souvenir sales and corporations would be suing people for trademark infringement (which does happen anyway).\n\n"
