Is that right?\n\nAny chance of a So-Cal Typophile lunch or something?\n\nMay 19th to the 23rd are the dates I have potentially available.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

But if you focus on the downtown area of LA or San Diego you find a richer experience (typographic or otherwise)...\n\nWhat kind of things do you want to see? Old signs/buildings, graphic design schools, people, museums?\n\nMikey Diaz\n\nPS... If you come out here you must try Mexican food! Avoid places that have lots white clientele as this is a big indicator that the food has been watered down for the American palette. Or upscale mexican restaurants. If you want the real deal you have to go were the all the brown people are. The holes in the wall are the best- they have lots of customers. All our restaurants have health ratings on the front of the establishments- eat at places with a big A on the front!\n\nHrant is from LA too maybe he can chime in on this one. I've always wanted to try Armenian food but every time I'm in the Glendale area I never stay long enough to explore.\n\n"

Thanks for the advice Mike!\n\nAs far as type tourism / resources are concerned I suppose I would keenest on:\n\n- Libraries with special Type & Calligraphic collections  \n- Bookstores of note  \n- Type-people who are maybe not on Typophile who are in that area & who I might like to meet & talk with  \n- And any general advice for the area you might want to pass on as you ( Mike) have done.\n\nFor context I should perhaps also say I have been to the LA / San Diego area before 4-5 times before but usually for just 3-4 days.\n\n"

Eben, the way I'm picturing an Alaskan driving to somewhere he'd enjoy ending up, it'll be over 2 hours, with medium traffic. With heavy traffic it could take over 4.\n\nMexican food: from San Diego it takes like 20 minutes to get to Tijuana! Which is not to say that they don't have the gringo problem there too... BTW Mike, an \"A\" rating is actually a similar problem. :-) I once filled out a complaint card at a Fatburger that it was too clean. They called me back. I'll tell you the rest one day.\n\nArmenian food: you'll have to make it to Hollywood, Glendale or Pasadena.\n\n\\> Libraries with special Type & Calligraphic collections\n\nWhat you want is the Clark. But since they don't let you check anything out (they MIGHT let you take flash-less photos, maybe) bring a sleeping bag. Bookstores: are you buying or browsing?\n\nIf you can hook up with Margo Chase, do it.\n\nGeneral advice: bring a swimsuit and your driver's license.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I have tried to find better and couldn't.\n\nCorner of Brand Boulevard and California.\n\nClose to there is Brand Books  \n [http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/StoreFrontDisplay?cid=66145](http://web.archive.org/web/20120421233542/http:/www.abebooks.com/servlet/StoreFrontDisplay?cid=66145 \"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/StoreFrontDisplay?cid=66145\")  \nHonestly I can't tell you if there's lots of typographic resources - haven't been there in a while but it is one of the last standing used book stores. I like it a lot.\n\nBest fast food in LA is also Armenian - Zankou Chicken. There's one of those in Glendale on Colorado near the 2 freeway. It is REALLY good!\n\nOK - real Mexican food with a wide array of not commonly seen sauces:  \nLa Cabañita in Monrovia (actually your could just say Glendale) - lots of different kinds of mole and other sauces you won't find just anywhere - it's excellent.\n\nGuelaguetza - A Oaxacan restaurant in the middle of Koreatown - they specialize in mole (which the Oaxacans are known for) - try the mole negro if you've never had it - it is fantastic. You could also try some edible bugs while you're there if you are really adventurous.\n\nThere is now an area in the middle of Koreatown that is known as Little Oaxaca.\n\nSo that's my input for LA.\n\npeace\n\n"

It's very nice, although a bit pricey. Zankou: that's actually where I took Norbert during his visit last hear. It's definitely delectable, especially if you like garlic. BTW, really traditional Armenian food tends to be hard to cook and sort of anachronistic, so virtually any \"Armenian\" restaurant will mostly have dishes of general Near-Eastern origin (mostly either Lebanese or Persian, depending on the owner). But that's not bad news at all!\n\nAnd you know La Cabañita too! (You probably meant Montrose, not Monrovia, right?) It's actually 2 minutes from my house. It's a small place (recently expanded actually) that's as authentic as you can get in these neck of the woods. The last time I went they still didn't have a liquor license, so they were making their margaritas with wine, but the food is super super. Guelaguetza, I'll have to try. Then there's King Taco in East LA: the best/worst time to go is late late.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I guess they also have a club because there were a group of people that seemed to be waiting to get in. What were they doing while waiting? Listening to Oaxacan music on a boombox and performing group folk dances in the parking lot. Really cool.\n\nCorner of Normandie and Olympic. There's another one on 8th Street but it's full of TVs and when soccer is on - it's on and poppin' if you like that sort of thing. Not really for me.\n\nKing Taco is the real deal - carne asada tacos to die for. Lengua too if you're into it - I like it a lot.\n\npeace\n\n"
