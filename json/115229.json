It looks like a mash-up of different fonts to me: Avant-Garde Gothic, Akzidenz Gotesk, Proxima Nova...  \n'MICHAEL': definitely based on [ITC Avant-Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724123413/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/) (Demi)  \n'KORS': something close to [Akzidenz Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724123413/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/akzidenz+grotesk), [Chalet London 1960](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724123413/http:/www.identifont.com/show?FRF) or [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724123413/http:/typophile.com/wiki/%5B%5Bhttp%3A/%252Fnew.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova)\n\n"
