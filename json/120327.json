I'd love to know how this beautiful typeface is called and where I can purchase it. It has some neat features, for example the minor »r« has a dot-shaped terminal, the minor »t« has that interesting figure. I would be greatful if you could help me out, here. Thanks in advance :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317131734im_/http:/typophile.com/files/humanist_touch_grotesque_3815.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Circular LL \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317131734/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
