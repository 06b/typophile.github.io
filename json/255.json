  "content": "So here's the latest from Friday Fonts, which has creeped into saturday, monday and   \ntuesday fonts! oops! A dangerous game I'm playing.   \n   \nI moved in a different direction from Neweue Helpetica. I was feeling like it was too close   \nto helvetica and others. Simply adding a few alternate letterforms would not do. I haven't   \ntotally scrapped what I was up to. If there's a   \nmajor outcry, I will keep working on it.   \n   \nSo now I have a complete upper and lower case for a new font. But, I think the caps are a   \nhair too dark for the text! Overall though I like the flair of this one. A few things are still there:   \nnotably the k. Stay tuned for a glyph chart.   \n   \nRandy\n\n",

Based upon my first and immediate reaction, I prefer the second of the three lower case \"a's\".

To me the only reason not to have it descending is for display work, and only if the \"Q\" is also non-descending (which rarely looks good though). Some people say that a descending \"J\" doesn't really help spacing, since it rarely occurs except as the first letter of a word/name - but of course that's a highly Anglo view - type designers from LJUBLJANA (they do exist) probably have nightmares about non-descending \"J\"s...
