I do most of my banking online, there is an ATM everywhere you look, who is using all these banks? And gawd they add nothing to the neighborhood. I guess it’s appropriate, tho, in a city only bankers can afford to live in. And like banks, bankers do nothing to enhance the neighborhood.\n\nIn Chase’s defense, they were here first (and swallowed up Manny Hanny, Chemical, etc back in the 80s). But WaMU? Wachovia? What the...?\n\n"
