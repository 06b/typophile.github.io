  "content": "Greater Albion has just posted design concept illustrations for two forthcoming releases on their [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018040748/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\nAdantine is a display face in late Victorian decorative style, gently oblique and with a sense of refined movement, all capitals of a single height but with subtle distinctions between the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ case glyphs. It offers an air of delicate distinction combined with legibility.\n\nCorvone takes us to the heady days of the 30s and the heights of Art deco. It’s heavy, forceful and clear and yet has a subtle sense of fun. It lets you shout loudly in a refined sort of way!\n\n",
