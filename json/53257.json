I am researching the revival of neo-grotesque  \ntypefaces in the last decade. I found several typefaces in the last  \ndecade like Akkurat by Laurenz Brunner, FF Bau and Graphik by  \nChristian Swchartz inspired by revivals of German typefaces in the  \n19th century. In other cases the alternatives to Helvetica and Univers  \nlike Recta by Aldo Novarese and Mercator by Dooijes created in the  \nMid-Century, inspired several revivals as well as your Mercator.  \nUnfortunatelly there is not much information available on the original  \nMercator, and it surprised me a lot to find a digital version. So I was wondering if you can  \nsend me information (images, texts, sketches, typespecimen…) on the  \nprocess that has followed in the revival of Mercator. If you  \nhelp me I'll always be gratefull to her. Of course I promise to  \nmention your work in my research. Can you send me your email?\n\nI just found other revival of Mercator. The designer Daniella Spinat [www.daniellaspinat.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319141706/http:/www.daniellaspinat.com/ \"www.daniellaspinat.com\") creates Mercator Roman.\n\nFinally, I would like to know your opinion about the revivals in  \ntypography. Why do you think a lot of typographers are re-designing  \nold sanserif typefaces?\n\nThank you¡¡¡\n\n"

      "content": "_Why do you think a lot of typographers_ [sic] _are re-designing old sanserif typefaces?_\n\nFor the same reasons that we (type designers) are always re-hashing every cliché in the book.  \nSpecifically, typographers continue to use them.  \nThat provides the economic incentive.  \nAlso, there is technological change, a constant in the graphics industry.  \nAdapting older forms to new media presents creative challenges and opportunities.  \nThat provides the aesthetic imperatives.\n\nWhile it's true that there have been many typefaces in the grotesque genre designed recently (a sans-centric era), I don't think this is historically significant. The grotesque genre has been constantly available since the 1830s, with old staples being refitted, and new additions. Recently the genres of geometric and humanist sans have also been well populated--more so, I would say, than the grotesque, where the old staples seem most entrenched.\n\nHave the type designers responsible for recent grotesques also reworked old serif types? I would think so, I know I have.\n\nIf you want to prove this is a significant phenomenon, you will need statistics to convince me, because otherwise, the field is so large that's it's very easy to pick and choose examples to corroborate one's subjective preconceptions about what's fashionable--which are always subject to recency. In other words, if you are interested in modernist design and the grotesque, you will see it everywhere.\n\nMy preconception is that genre specialists (like Ale Paul) are the minority in the type design business.  \nIn the digital era, now that so many independent foundries are established, most type designers have \"their\" old-style serif face, their didone, their geometric sans, their grotesque, their script. Every foundry a department store, not a boutique!\n\nOf course, this varies by market, but in as much as the commissioned market in newspaper and magazine types requires all genres (but few scripts), so does the retail font market (but heavy on the scripts).\n\n"

I probably 'sense' the same trend you are talking about, though I am wary that I am simply looking for evidence of it because that is what interests me - finding this thread for example. Maybe it is very hard to assert any kind of trend in a pluralistic environment.\n\nThat said, I am always pleased to see work in this genre, revivals and interpretations - I think it is important to distinguish. There probably is some room in this genre more so than humanist sans-serifs for example which most people (I assume) would agree have seen a lot of recent interest - maybe this does explain a small trend.\n\nI'm not sure that economics offers a complete explanation of said trend. A lot of revival work is motivated by academics!\n\n"

It is not available from the Lineto.com website, though, potentially because Linotype has once acquired the rights of the Lettergieterij Amsterdam from the Tetterode company.\n\nWith colleagues I also took a stab at it once. We made a modern Grotesk that shares some of the nice characteristics of Mercator.During that process I've come to see that Mercator _isn't actually that good a typeface_, and its many flaws get in the way of the text. All \"real\" revivals look a bit amateurish in my opinion, and that's because Mercator itself is a bit amateurish. And thoroughly adorable.\n\n--K\n\n"

I discovered the typeface when I first moved to Amsterdam in 2004, in the letter-press workshop of the Gerrit Rietveld Academy. The designer Dick Dooijes, in fact was a former director of the Rietveld Academy and is responsible for the Lettering on the facade of the iconic building.\n\nThe typeface Akkurat was already completed when I first encountered Mercator but I must admit it I was surprised myself to see that it shares some attributes. I've digitised Mercator during my time at the Rietveld and have used it since for the publication \"Adviezen 2009 – 2012\" by the Amsterdamse Kunstraad and occasionally for Rietveld related communication. (See for example [www.rietveldforrietveld.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319141706/http:/www.rietveldforrietveld.org/ \"www.rietveldforrietveld.org\")). Alex Shoukas, a former student of mine, has done a great job with his design for the Rietveld school identity and has used the typeface in a sensible way (along with an clever colour-scheme, sampling Gerrit Rietveld's interior colour palette). Big up's again Alex!\n\nI've always believed that the typeface should somehow remain close to the academy and it's source, which is why I've hesitated to publish the font, but we're currently considering different options for Lineto.com.\n\nDrop me a line if anymore questions,  \nLaurenz Brunner\n\n"

The forms of the C, R and S are much more attractive than in either Helvetica or Univers, in my opinion, as are the numerals, and I like the proportions and spacing. As the icing on the cake, Mercator has a wonderful Q design unlike that of any other typeface I have seen. I find it very simple and beautiful, and am surprised nobody has copied this Q idea in any newer sans (though Puyfoulhoux's Q in Alinea Sans is similar). The Univers Q always looks like a mistake to me, and most sans Q's are boring, but Mercator's is lovely.\n\nIs a revived offering, as mentioned by folks above, likely to make commercial headway anytime soon?

It all boils down to a matter of opinion. So what: pay attention and you'll learn something.\n\nHowever, one aspect of the discussion does not make sense. If you're looking for something truly unique—which is kinda OTT, since “unique” is like “pregnant\" in its all-or-nothingness—it will be so for only so long. Which is to say, it will be unique up the time that until other folks looking for something unique learn from your discovery. In which case, more and more people who are convinced that “unique” means buying all the same stuff the cool people buy—in other words, Apple’s whoel marketing strategy—the net result is, what was once unique is no longer so, and you have to start out on your Grail quest all over again. Still: it's the journey, not the destination, right? Unless you actually have to be somewhere at a specific time on a specific date.
