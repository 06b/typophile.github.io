Long time listener, first time caller.\n\nI have a client who hates the overhanging terminal on the lower case \"a\" and has requested that I use a sans serif font without said terminal in creating her brand. In my rather small font collection I'm only finding Futura and House Chalet NineteenEighty having truncated terminals on the a. Does anyone out there have any other suggestions that I might consider? Many thanks in advance.\n\n",

My current college had a nice wordmark built using Avant Garde Light, and the braintrust in marketing later decided that for \"branding\" they would use the similar Century Gothic as the default font for everything. The website, the college calendar (in 9 point, in many places) and all brochures.\n\nAnd I wonder why there is no design program at this college.\n\n"
