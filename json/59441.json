Honestly, I think about myself as a poor calligrapher with basic knowledge learned during studies, actually my last contact with calligraphy was in Calligraphy class, a couple of years ago.\n\nI made only a couple of letters (uppercase), and I was thinking if anyone could give me some constructive comments, am I on right direction, does this seems interesting to you etc...\n\nI made quicky version with \"serif\", take it as an attemption. :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805014920im_/http:/typophile.com/files/WindWagon_5650.jpg)\n\nThanks\n\n",
