You could start from [Helvetica Neue](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725021719/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/helvetica+neue) to [Myriad](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725021719/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/myriad), [Trebuchet](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725021719/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/trebuchet) or [Arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725021719/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/arial)...  \nMy choice here, Trebuchet Bold, 15 min reworked\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725021719im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4691.png)\n\n"
