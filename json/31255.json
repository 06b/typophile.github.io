      "content": "I was able to download it then, but if your question goes beyond merely interest in who was able to download it and you're asking if someone can send it to you, I don't think that most around here would consider that to be ethical. Foundries like FontShop make fonts available for free at their own discretion, so if they decide to only allow a font to be available for download for a limited time, then it is not up to one of us to decide that it should be downloadable in any other context. Sorry if that's what you're asking; maybe you can scrounge up the money somewhere to buy it, as there's nothing better than buying the perfect font for a project.\n\n"

Fedra really has some quirky details: the dot over the i, the capital R, lowercase k, lowercase b. I would say its very special. Milo is much more neutral and utilitarian but it is gorgeous anyhow. Have a gander Kievit- from the same guy a Milo- Michael Abbink.\n\n[http://www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/FedraSansPro.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110022638/http:/www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/FedraSansPro.pdf \"http://www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/FedraSansPro.pdf\")\n\nI see this is your first post- welcome to Typophile.\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"

If you do not download the font while its available on FontShop.com then you must purchase a license for use. If you do download the font while it is available from our site you may keep it indefinitely however you may never send it to anyone else or distribute it in anyway.\n\nI've contacted Typophile and the recipient of the posted email to have both removed to avoid any future confusion.\"\n\n"
