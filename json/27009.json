It is a face in development by   \nFlorian Ribisch, a Viennese designer, currently working   \nas an art director for the Italian magazine GLAMOUR.   \n   \n==========   \nHi, my name is Florian Ribisch.   \n   \nThe typeface of the album [\"The Eclectic Sound Of Vienna -](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082442/http:/www.mic.gr/cds.asp?id=25016)   \n [Vol. 5\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082442/http:/www.mic.gr/cds.asp?id=25016) is called LABOR and was done by me. [Oliver Kartak](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082442/http:/www.oliverkartak.com/),   \nthe designer of the sleeve, did use it exclusively, since the   \nfont is not 100% ready yet.   \n   \nHopefully it will be soon - I'm working on it.   \n   \nSincerely, Florian Ribisch\n\n",
