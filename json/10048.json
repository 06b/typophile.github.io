      "content": "The German Supreme Court recently had to decide this case:   \n   \nA bus tourism company invited people to a bus tour. The company said in advertisements that the bus tourists will be given \"a delicious meal\". In fact, they got a meal, but it was \"a soup with beans\". The Supreme Court judged this as \"criminal advertising\", and the business manager of the bus company got a one-year stretch (see German Supreme Court record BGH 3 StR 11/02).   \n   \nNow compare the \"delicious meal\" buyers to the \"Basic Commercial\" buyers. Do the font buyers get the \"original\" designed in 1900 by \"the source of the originals\", i.e. do they get \"a delicious meal\"? Or do they get a clone made in 1958, i.e. do they get \"a soup with beans\"? It is most likely that the German Supreme Court will decide that the \"Basic Commercial\" buyers get \"a soup with beans\".   \n   \nW.O\n\n"
