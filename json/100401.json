I'm looking for something much more like a Didone, or at least a Garalde, in terms of stroke weight, but a sans-serif. Has anybody got any recommendations? Thanks!\n\n",

So many of these have an Art Deco slant that will pull too much focus. The sans-serif part of this design is more of a subheader to the main title, which is in Jenson. Anyway, please keep ideas coming! Thanks! :-)\n\n"
