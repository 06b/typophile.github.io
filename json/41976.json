Can anyone think of an automated way (as in accessible via script) to make this work without having to write a an eps interpreter or worse, a script for Illustrator?\n\nJust in case any Postscript hackers are reading this, I’m attaching the output from potrace. If there is a simple thing in the output that is offending Fontlab, I wouldn’t mind parsing the eps to strip it out.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [a\\_a.eps.txt](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907045236/http:/typophile.com/files/a_a.eps.txt) | 0 bytes |\n\n [‹ How to display Text NOT antialiased on a webpage (HTML)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907045236/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41544 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Locking handle directions in Fontlab ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907045236/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41961 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
