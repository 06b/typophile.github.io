  "content": "Hi\n\nI am looking for a serif face that works with Avant Garde. Avant Garde will be used in headings, (mostly bold and in all caps) but I am looking for something a little more refined and readable as body text, as I find Avant Garde too hard to work with for this purpose. (It always ends up as a one-trick pony when I use it in body)\n\nAny suggestions? I want something a little machined, masculine and serious as I am using it in a brochure for outdoor furniture for public places (lots of wood and steel). It also has to work well on glossy paper.\n\nThanks\n\n",
