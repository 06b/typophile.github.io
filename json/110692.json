Don't know how well it would work in plain word processors.  \nDon \n"

      "content": "bojev: To me it looks like Adobe more or less generated a Latin counterpart to Kozua Mincho using Adobe Serif MM. On the other hand, I get the impression that many Latin counterparts to Japanese typefaces are designed in a similar style. Especially those who are designed in Japan. A kind of middle-of-the-road Century Old Style design with a large x-height and a weight that is too light. The weight and proportions of such typefaces may be a good-enough-match to Japanese Mincho, but they are often too light to serve as a decent text typeface for readers of the Latin script.\n\nTGabriel: The typeface in the sample you posted looks as if someone tried to create a monospaced version of Times Roman. Smells like ‘default design’.\n\n"

      "content": "Very helpful Albert. So lets look for a version of Times Roman that fits the letter-forms better than the usual suspects. There is a matching g in the version designed by Francesco Simoncini and W. Bilz in 1965, for Ludwig & Mayer and now sold in digital form by Bitstream as Life. So lets try a compressed version of Life [80%]\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211448im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LifeCondensed_6351.jpg)\n  \nPart way there. Closer than Kozuka Mincho Extra Light.  \nCan see how selective widening of some glyphs, such as j, and narrowing of others, such as m and w, while keeping the weight could make a monospace.  \nDon \n"
