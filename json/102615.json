  "content": "Forgive this newbie, I know very little; just beginning to learn. Sample is low quality; no lowercase given as only uppercase is needed. Scanned from early 70s era source. Manual typesetting given the jagged look, correct? That has a certain appeal; unknown if the typeset 'sloppy' effect can be mimicked. Thanks for any help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130526021908im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fontsample1_5443.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "More likely, the jagged look is due to the sample having been set on a coldtype/strike-on machine, such as a Varityper. If so, the typeface used would probably be Varityper's equivalent of Futura Bold Condensed.\n\nYou can mimic the sloppy effect in Photoshop or similiar by selectively applying Gaussian blur, then adjusting levels to pure black and white.\n\n"

      "content": "oldnick, cool... that is a fine match-up... definitely will try your PS ideas... sure appreciate your reply.\n\nBut is there some way (beyond individually positioning characters) to mimic the uneven 'baseline', that is, the slight vertical variation in character positions? Likely I'm not using the correct terms but hope this makes sense. I will research the Varityper as I have never heard of it... perhaps there is something like a Varityper simulator for purposes of recreating that funky look. Thanks heaps!\n\n"
