They actually use a bespoke typeface called 'Exception' (see image below) which shares the same design backbone with your sample though not matching. Your sample is narrower and some adjustments (mainly on /B) have been done to make it more contrasted and more symmetric, essentially to emphase resemblance between 'LOOK' and 'BOOK', being the mirror of each other. Still believing it has been created from scratch, too many type design errors: inconsistent x-height over glyph set (/C looks too large comparing to the other letters), poor kerning, no optical correction...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803010724im_/http:/typophile.com/files/02_5068.png)\n\n"
