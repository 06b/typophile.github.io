He is a very versatile and productive font designer, but since producing Voz Gotica five years ago has not released -- as far as I know -- any more fonts in this genre, except for Hades, a \"dark contemporary blackletter\" and Albo, a 16th century derived lowercase, enveloped in a flood of calligraphic swirls.  \nI wonder if there are any more capital letters available for viewing other than the ones now on the DST website.  \nDon\n\n"
