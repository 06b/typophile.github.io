  "content": "The new [TypeOff](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106074425/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeOff) website launched today. Although it is mostly in German, I still recommend a visit. Some posts are in english, for instance the site's dedication piece.\\* We reformatted the site; it is now a blog of sorts. All seven members of the collective act as authors. We are pleased to finally offer comments as a feature, even though the whole concept of comments and interactivity is so not new. Even those who cannot read German at all are invited to post comments. More interesting that way. We also added an RSS feed.\n\nAnyway, let me know what you think!\n\n[http://www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106074425/http:/www.typeoff.de/)\n\n\\*The new site is dedicated to Filip Blazek ;-) Visit us and find out why.\n\n",
