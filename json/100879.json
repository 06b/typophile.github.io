I am having some second thoughts on deciding between Lyon Text and Plantin. Both are quite beautiful fonts. Which do you think is better for reading on an online PDF?\n\nAny ideas?\n\nBest,  \nS\n\n",

      "content": "I’m working with Lyon in a biggish project right now (print and web, text and display, various media etc), and it’s been fabulous to work with. I don’t know if this is relevant for your case, but one big asset of Lyon is that it has both a Text and a Display variant – the latter looks great in headlines (especially in the Italics with activated swashes); I’d say while Plantin is a very good design too, Lyon arguably has a greater range. Good range of weights too. I love Plantin, but Lyon is fresher. (And really, it isn’t all that expensive.)\n\nIt’s hard to say more without knowing more about your content and context. Check that both typefaces have all the characters you need, and yes, like Hrant says, check the EULAs.\n\n"

      "content": "Regarding some of your choices: there is a major difference in x-height between them. Personally, I think a bit bigger x-height works best for on line viewing but is less elegant for printed output. Leaving out descenders and just comparing the height of \"x\" to \"H\" as measured in Illustrator, here are some ratios:  \nBembo Book: 64%  \nSabon: 64%  \nStorm Baskerville 10: 65%  \nSina Nova: 65%  \nPlantin: 66%  \nWhitman: 66%  \nAdobe Garamond PP: 67%  \nTrinite No2: 67%  \nCalisto 67%  \nDante: 68%  \nAdobe Minion Pro: 68%  \nMiller: 68%  \nDocumenta 69%  \nIowan OS 69%  \nScala: 69%  \nAlbertina: 69%  \nElena: 70%  \nMercury: 71%  \nLyon: 71%\n\nIt is just one factor to consider, but you can see that Plantin has a lot smaller x-height than the others you've mentioned.\n\n"

      "content": "> comparing the height of \"x\" to \"H\"\n\nBut that isn't a good reference (especially these days) since cap height varies a lot, without affecting the end-result much. You should really factor in the ascender height instead of the cap height.\n\nHmmm, where's that long, involved discussion we once had about that?\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "The height of \"x\" to \"l\" is also at the high end for Lyon and Elena, but apparantly it is for Plantin as well. A rough order based on x/l height:  \nBembo book: 54%  \nSina Nova: 58%  \nGaramond PP: 60%  \nMercury: 60%  \nBaskerville 10: 61%  \nLyon: 63%  \nElena: 63%  \nPlantin: 64%\n\nHowever, Plantin looks smaller and is harder to read due to its overall character widths. (which TNR reduced substantially). I think some reduction in character width, so long as it is not too severe, helps with online reading. Newspaper type fonts are reasonably good for online viewing. Since the original poster was not planning to print the newsletter, a larger x height might be good.\n\n"
