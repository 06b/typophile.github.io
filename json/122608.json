  "content": "Hey Guys...\n\nI have a big problem and I know there are a bunch of smart font people on here so I sure you can help...\n\nI'm building an icon font in FontLab Studio 5.1 and for the life of me I cannot get the font to show up in Microsoft Applications (Word, Powerpoint etc.). Shows up in every other professional app like Illustrator, InDesign... I read all the docs on Microsofts website pertaining to output when making a typeface by MS standards and I followed it perfectly (I think).\n\nDOES ANYONE KNOW THE TRICK TO GETTING CUSTOM FONTS TO SHOW UP IN MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS?\n\nI'm hoping someone can lead me in the right direction...\n\nThanks a ton in advance :)\n\n",

      "content": "It's literally not showing up at all? My experience is that Office 2011 is not keen on large numbers of fonts. A while back I had a huge number (thousands) installed and fonts kept randomly disappearing from the dropdown menu for no reason. If you think you have a lot of fonts that you rarely use on your machine, try deleting them and rebuilding the font database as per Microsoft's instructions. It worked fine for me once I'd trimmed things down. Also maybe try clearing out alternate builds: I once had a problem where I'd modded an [open-source font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318000412/http:/www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/) to make the infant a and g characters default and the new version wouldn't show up as I hadn't changed the font info properly.\n\nMicrosoft's take isn't entirely unfair, IMO. What they're effectively stating is that while they undertake to debug against system fonts supplied with OS X and the set supplied with Office, the onus is on a font designer to make their font work, not on Microsoft to find out why some font they've never heard of isn't working (the likely answer being because of a bug in it). It's a bit lame (and I would love if they actually undertook to fully implement the OpenType specification, seeing as they actually co-wrote it), but you can see their perspective.\n\n"
