If you think sans serif is still what you want, then pick a sans style that doesn't resemble your logo.   \nThat's my two cents.\n\n"

Neutraface Text works wonderfully well: I'm   \ncurrently setting a congress book in Neutraface   \nand Aurora, and the fun part is when you start   \ncombining NeutraText Book (Avenir-mode) with   \nNeutraText Alt Bold (Futura-mode). Brilliant stuff.   \n   \nBut Grant I must agree that Paralucent is a beauty   \n(though a bit pricey).\n\n"
