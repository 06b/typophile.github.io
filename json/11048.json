      "content": "a typeface is a generic term encompassing all type. font is a family of one specific typeface. there are countless ways of classifying type. i prefer the vox method, but on a very broad level you can make the distinction between display face or text face. in the post i made earlier i suggested that a trademark should be created with the ideal of display in mind. this is not just a preference but a rule. i don't find this extreme in any way. creating original display type can be very easy. it's not at all a horrible task, for god sakes we are designers, we should enjoy this stuff. over all it's the distinction between text and display that is important. a text face is used for setting copy this is what they were built to do. in the days of metal type one face had many different cuts. it was different at 10pt then at 32pt. this is because as a type face gets larger and becomes a display it needs to become more robust in it's joins and horizontals. making it more of a display face then text face. the fact that the computer makes no compensation for this in a typeface as it gets larger is apparent in the fact that large computer type looks so bad. no one would dream of setting a book in a display face so why should one be as ridiculous to make a trademark out of a text face. yet this is done all the time because most designers are lazy or naive.\n\n"

In the meaning I associate with that term, I'd say the opposite. Display type [generally] requires finer detailing, higher contrast, even delicacy and elegance on occasion.   \n   \nBasically, the difference between the two modes of type is parallel to the duality in the reader\\*: conscious versus subconscious. Display type needs to appeal more to aesthetic preferences (which change all the time), while text face needs to appeal more to our reading \"firmware\" (which changes extremely slowly - in fact never over the [adult] life of an individual). Of course nothing exists in a pure state, so even text type needs to worry about looks, and display type about basic legibility.   \n   \n\\* And many other things, like the duality in the structure of the retina.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I think what you saying is, text type need to accommodate things like ink spread, so details like ink traps at 'joins and such' have to be considered, am I right? Reading in the traditional sense is precisely as you put it - 'skimming over and formed together into concepts'. We don't read letter by letter but 'word-images'. We take jumps and periodically stop at points of fixation, picking up the meaning as we go along.   \n   \nSo, in terms of features, text typefaces are less refined, because they are prone to unpredictable reproduction qualities. Besides, we don't really see the details very clearly unless we use a magnifying glass. Display type, on the other hand, have to be delicate and a lot more refined, because everything is exposed right in front of our eyes to see - there's nothing to hide. So display types are usually have higher contrast, thinner serifs, more refined features so we don't get this chunky slab serif when we blow it up. Think this way for a moment: reading text type is like looking at objects at a distance: they are less sharp and less defined. Display type, on the other hand, is like looking at objects right in front of us, so everything is sharper and more detailed.\n\n"
