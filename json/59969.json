  "content": "Dusan Script is a new set of handwriting style fonts from the Tour De Force font foundry. They were created by Serbian graphic designer Dušan Jelesijević.\n\nDusan Script is a wonderful set of handwriting script fonts that captures the graceful flow and idiosyncrasies of Dušan's penmanship. They have an airy, natural personality, with open counters and features that make it legible at small and large sizes. Dusan Script is available in TrueType and OpenType formats at AscenderFonts.com - [http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/dusan-script-family-2-fonts.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023245/http:/www.ascenderfonts.com/font/dusan-script-family-2-fonts.aspx \"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/dusan-script-family-2-fonts.aspx\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023245im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dusan-Script-pr-01_4498.png)\n\n",
