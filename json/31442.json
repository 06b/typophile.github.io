  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nLast night while experimenting with type, I came up with this idea of having a 3d wire frame typeface. Although its very graphic but can be used for some specific purpose, like in posters and the magazine headings. But the problem is that each glyph is becoming too heavy and dunno whether it will be possible to export them as a typeface or not. I have all the drawings in the vector format. What do you guys think\\_? Is it possible anyhow\\_? Anyone\\_??\n\nThanks!  \nSatya\\_\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080724234955im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/2_6291.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080724234955im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/3_4975.jpg)\n\n [‹ Titulata Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080724234955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34528 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [First Typeface - Need Feedback. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080724234955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27383 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "They are very nice forms. To be fonts it would depends on the number of points - they would have to be truetype and in the past some complex fonts have used more than one glyph window for one character. I digitized some ornate Victorian typefaces a few years ago and had problems with them not printing or having bizarre lines develope. Your forms look to me like they will have to remain vector art - just too complex.\n\n"

I have absolutely no clue as to the feasibility of what you’re suggesting, having had little experience actually creating fonts, but I’ve never seen anything that looks remotely like this. I especially love how you’re able to create a real sense of depth with the crossbar of the t and the overlaps of the “fabric.” One thing I’m not crazy about, though, is breaking off the “serifs” of the s, as you’ve done here; I’d rather if the letterforms were all unbroken. Again, good luck, and sorry I couldn’t answer your question.\n\n"

Obviously, they’re quite different, but the three-dimensionality of Calypso was striking — especially since Wikipedia says he designed it in 1958.\n\n"
