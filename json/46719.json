It seems like this font identification thing might look easy, but I know for sure that it is not, I'm writing this 'cause nobody has replied to my post, perhaps this font is a custom job? I'm positive that this is not the case, maybe I have to wait a little longer 'till the right person recognize it and help me with some useful information...\n\nI'll be here forever if I have to... he he he!!\n\nThanks to all...\n\nQ™ Says: It's All About The Fonts!\n\n"

I think Disney has used certain typefaces as starting points, but customizes them to suit their readability needs. Perhaps all they did was borrow the idea of the Edwardian n (although the C matches pretty well too).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
