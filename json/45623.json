As Knockout has no italics or obliques, this takes it out of the running. This pains me deeply, as Knockout’s range of styles and the historical design references its making are all perfect otherwise.\n\nIf you had to replace Knockout with a type family that sports obliques/italics, what would you choose?\n\nI’ve looked at a number of Grots and Gothics and haven’t hit anything I like. I think its wood type pedigree makes it unique, and I’m having difficulty finding another sans with that characteristic and range. I want to the bullet and try to make it work anyway (specing single quotes rather than italics for titles), but I don’t think the client will go for this restriction.\n\n [‹ Apple says Web designers can post \"any font\" for use with Safari.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43971 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Anyone create any Ambigrams before? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125231/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45896 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the recommendations, everyone. These are great.\n\nI admit I’m a timid designer who blanches at the thought of pushing and pulling type like that, but now you’ve got me interested in going a few rounds with Knockout (last boxing pun, I promise). The usage is primarily display work, but not exclusively. We did consider other methods of pulling out the titles, but the client was not excited about that prospect, and the battle was ultimately not worth waging.\n\nI like Balboa, but Knockout has a quality to it that Balboa doesn’t quite hit for me (Not a pun! I swear!). It’s also possible that I’ve simply become so enamored with Knockout that I’m blinded a bit.\n\nI remember Maple now, from seeing it in [Typographica’s Favorites list of 2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125231/http:/typographica.org/001045.php). What a fantastic family. Now I have to find a place to use this family as well. Its character is great, but that same character moves it away from the specific sort of visual references we were looking for.\n\nPart of the reason I was so remiss in responding to your recommendations is that the project’s visual direction took on a different emphasis after my post and the work began to pile up, keeping me away from Typophile. In the end, I went with everyone’s favorite ubiqui-sans of the early 21st century, [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125231/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008). It works ideally in this case, particularly with its wide range of weights. It turns out that the late 19th/early 20th century grot look of Knockout ended up being a bit too far back in the history books. We began looking for something that was a bit less forceful in its tone without losing its ability to proclaim its message boldly, as well as being more at home around the geometric influences of the 30’s and Deco architecture, without going as far into the style as [Neutraface](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905125231/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=615) does.\n\nThank you all for the suggestions. They’ve given me some great options to have at the ready for work needing distinct gothics.\n\n"
