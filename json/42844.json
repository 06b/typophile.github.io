  "content": "Hello typo nuts!\n\nI've made this poster for a public debate society, called [Hvadharvigangi](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/www.hvadharvigangi.dk/) (\"What are we doing?\"). It's meant to hang around in universities, libraries and the like to draw attention to the monthly debates. I've tried to convey a both fun and serious mood, because that defines the society: serious topics (this particular one: \"Genetics and ethics\"), presented and debated in a friendly and \"fun\" way.\n\nI recognize that you won't understand much of the text, because it's set in Danish. But I hope I can get some feedback on the overall layout/composition anyway. I'll be happy to explain anything in the text that might be important.\n\nMy main concern is the potential over-use of different sizes in type. It might appear a bit too messy. What do you think? The font is [Knockout](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013) + a wee [Auto](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=auto&id2=overview)\n\nAlso, the header is my additional proposal for a _new logo_. So this element is important in it self. [Their old logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/www.hvadharvigangi.dk/) appears at the top of their webpage.\n\nI've attached 3 similar variations of the poster.\n\nThank you so much!\n\np.s. The picture is just an example of how I want the future ones to be placed and cut. This one is completely irrelevant to genetics obvisouly\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Hvadharvigangi\\_a.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/typophile.com/files/Hvadharvigangi_a.pdf) | 152.61 KB |\n| [Hvadharvigangi\\_b.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/typophile.com/files/Hvadharvigangi_b.pdf) | 151.19 KB |\n| [Hvadharvigangi\\_c.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924/http:/typophile.com/files/Hvadharvigangi_c.pdf) | 150.94 KB |\n\n",

Although i think that there is an opposite heracy between the topic and the secondary informations such as date and time. I would suggest to use one primary, first level reading size for the topic, and a secondary, smaller one of all the secondary informations by using some other weights from HTF Knockout (combining for example HTF Knockout70 FullWelterwt and HTF Knockout30 JuniorWelterwt, or using the Upercases in some cases also)\n\nP.S. What's the real size of the poster?\n\nDimitris Papazoglou\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310025924im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Knockout_3789.jpg)\n\n"
