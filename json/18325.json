Not to be used for commercial purposes.” I’m pretty sure that covers the font software as well as the card software. I don’t think you have to limit use of these fonts, however, within the card program, but you should be able to use the fonts in any other programs (as long as you’re not making money off their usage). At least that’s how i interpreted it.\n\n"
