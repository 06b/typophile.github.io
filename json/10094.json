  "content": "It is a very blocky, solid style, with hard edges and 90 degree angles. Very much like impact. The main difference is that the m doesn't have a hard straight line on the left side and instead it's two symmetric rainbows. And the W is more like an upside down M, it doesn't have hard corners, instead it's rounded. Overall is a very thick font with straight edges, symmetric, rounded edges. Any names come to mind? Thanks\n\n",

It's got the round/hard edges and the M/W you describe:   \n   \n [http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ogra.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054534/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/ogra.asp)   \n   \n(You know you're a freak when you: a) are using the Indie Fonts book as bedtime reading, and b) leafing through the Fountain samples in said book causes you to get out of bed and post a message on the Type ID board.)\n\n"

It seems to match every description he's given: the blockiness, the sharp edges and very rounded and symmetric overall feel.\n\n"
