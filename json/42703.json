It can be rigid, with critique comments being noted for future revisions, or it can be enriching, with a primary goal of exposure to new ideas and subject matter. It can even be a connector, with campers making friends and professional colleagues that last far beyond the event itself. We welcome you to the camp that you’ve always wanted — we welcome you to Type Camp.”\n\n- This year’s fellow instructors announced and introduced  \n- 4 events listed for this year including London, Galliano Island, India, and Information Design  \n- Registration information\n\nType Camp London: 9-16 May 2008;  \nFeaturing: Dr Rathna Ramanathan, Dr Shelley Gruendler, Martin Andrews and others\n\nType Camp Galiano: 3-8 August 2008;  \nFeaturing: Tiffany Wardle + Dr Shelley Gruendler\n\nType Camp Information Design: 10-15 August 2008;  \nFeaturing: Jay Rutherford, Ben Weiner + Gustavo Soares\n\nType Camp India: 8-20 Dec 2008;  \nFeaturing: Dr Rathna Ramanathan + Dr Shelley Gruendler\n\nFor more information visit [http://www.typecamp.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306010505/http:/www.typecamp.org/ \"http://www.typecamp.org/\")\n\n",
