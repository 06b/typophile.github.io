  "content": "I am very much a beginner at any graphics oriented stuff. I am trying to put together marketing material for a new company (logo, brochures, website) and am finding it much more difficult than I imagined. It all looks easy until you try to put one together. Also the foudner of the company is stuck on oranges and reds for everything. Please help me out. My logos have been all over the place adn when I found one I liked I realized it wasnt usable on colored backgrounds. Learning slowly. VERY SLOWLY! SO if its really horrible, just tell me its horrible.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Orange Logos - COrel.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203425/http:/typophile.com/files/Orange%20Logos%20-%20COrel.jpg) | 166.89 KB |\n\n",

Please, don't use Arial. So many great san serifs out there! Also, pick a typeface that has a wider range of weights... The two weights you are using in \"EKT Group\" are not different enough from each other.\n\nIn the second example, the \"M\" overlapping the orange circle doesn't look very good, because it's just the tip... It looks like an unwanted accident. Consider aligning \"Managing Success\" in some other way, rather than centering it exactly the same as in the first example.\n\n"

It's easy to fall into the trap of adding a few photoshop filters here and trendy widget there.\n\nI'd step back a bit and work conceptually for a while. Sketch out some ideas...no matter how crazy you might think they are, and then look at them and see if if an idea begins to sprout.\n\n"

I think that you need to educate yourself and your employer here, because there's not much we can do to help you without doing the work for you. There's a reason that it is a professional skill. It's hard. It takes practice and education and sacrifice. If you had more experience, I'd be more encouraging. But I strongly suggest you hire a professional.\n\n"
