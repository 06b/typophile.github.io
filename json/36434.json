If anyone would like to meet up to chat about type, designing fonts, open source, art, typosium, snarks, design or anything else interesting, just send me a message. In return, I'll buy the first round of coffee or beer! Sun or Mon is best. If I can fit it in, I'd love an excuse to visit SF.\n\nYou can email me through choz at exclamachine dot com, or pop a message through typophile if I am on.\n\n",
