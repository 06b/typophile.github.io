It was published in 1950 and written by H D C Pepler (I have posted a photo of the cover at [http://www.typographer.com/egletter.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140220/http:/www.typographer.com/egletter.jpg). Being a bit of an Eric Gill fan (I blame him entirely for my interest in the field), I quickly bought it for some ludicrously nominal amount.   \n   \nAmazingly, there was a loose slip of paper in the back that had somehow managed not to get lost detailing that there were two versions of it made. One for STA members bound in paste paper by R H Middleton (400 copies) and one for non-members (600 copies). Presumably, judging from the cover, its one of the paste paper copies.   \n   \nFirstly, does anyone have any knowledge about this particular keepsake? I'll happily type up and post the foreword if anyone is interested.   \n   \nSecondly, how I can protect it from any further damage? I am not a book expert and have no experience of looking after this kind of thing, so any advice would be welcome.\n\n",

I see a couple of copies available through abebooks.com.   \n   \nYou might try contacting James Mosley at the St. Bride Printing Library in London. He may be able to help you with both questions. I believe he's quite a Gill aficionado.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"
