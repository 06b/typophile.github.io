  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nMy first Typophile crit: So I'm finally at the point to be designing a personal logo, stationery, etc. I'll be graduating in May (finally!), and am ready to go out into the \"real world.\" I've been working on this mark for a while now, and I feel it's at a point I'm happy with, so I'm ready for your insightful critiques to improve it further! I'm going to start soon on my name placement, typography, etc., but I wanted to nail this mark first.\n\nMy design style _tends_ to be, in a few words, complex, clean and somewhat delicate/elegant, but not really feminine (unless the job calls for femininity). I also have a slightly unhealthy obsession with typography (as opposed to other design elements). I hope that makes sense; let me know if it doesn't...\n\nThanks in advance for the help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023183138im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CassieLogo_5455.gif)\n\n",

Thanks for pointing that out. It is constructed solely out of lowercase italic c's and a modified lc italic f (my initials). I hope the g's aren't too strong ...\n\n"

That's not necessarily the point. It's nice to see a logo someone has clearly put time into refining.\n\nSomething beautiful and something ugly almost always works.\n\n"

      "content": "So I brought up the \"g\" thing in class, and it was a general consensus that that should be fixed, if possible. Here's my solution, which I think has much nicer Gestalt, anyway. I agree that the letters don't need to be über-recognizable, but I'd like to keep some nuances of them, if possible. Thoughts on this one? Better? Worse? Ways to improve it? Is the center too strong of a focal point (I kinda feel like it detracts from the nice flow of the outside of the shape...)? I know I'm into the final tweaking, but any suggestions are helpful.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023183138im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture4_3424.gif)\n\n"

It is also my initials. And it shows type more as image than as type, which is a great interest of mine.  \nAs it is a personal mark, it is very difficult for me to explain its communicative value as I would any other mark. I guess the above is as good as I can do, without revisiting all the \"who is the brand called Cassie\" stuff I figured out before starting on this mark... it's so true that designing something for yourself is the hardest thing to do as a designer.\n\n"

I understand and appreciate your concern, but I don't think this says \"swastika\" at all. However, I don't want to ignore the possibility that some may see that, as it is something to be seriously considered.\n\nDoes anyone else see this? Is it something that should be addressed? or is the mark far enough from that to hold any sort of connotation? That would be, of course, the last thing I would want any logo (especially my personal mark) to imply...\n\n"
