So I have some familiarity with the Shakers' aesthetic.\n\nYou'll have to decide whether you want to use type that evokes the qualities that we ascribe to Shaker furniture or whether you want type that is authentic to the Shaker community itself and the period in which original Shaker furniture was made. These are two \\*very\\* different things.\n\nThe qualities that most people associate with the Shakers -- simplicity, spare elegance, functionalism, etc. -- have been mentioned and there are a lot of contemporary typefaces that evoke those same qualities. I'm sure you'll get plenty of suggestions for these.\n\nHowever, the Shakers themselves were products of their Victorian environment when it came to their own printing and advertising. You can see this most readily in the seed boxes, seed labels, and herb labels, such as shown in William's link above. Lots of different faces in quite a cacophony of styles, ironically.\n\nAs far as their bibles and such, these were printed with the text types that were current in the day -- the DeVinne that Patty suggests is an excellent example. (This one: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120622233205/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/de-vinne/\"), not some of the others that come up in a search.) Nick Shinn's Scotch Modern (serif) and Figgins grotesque (sans serif) are good contemporary versions of designs from this same period.\n\nHTH\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"

The book I have uses Bauer Text initials as the display font which works beautifully.\n\nIt's a trick to marry the concepts of simplicity, elegance, and craft. If you choose something too simple you run the risk of it looking dull (IMO Tankard's Shaker falls into this category). Too \"crafty\" and it starts to edge towards kitsch. Personally, I'd use a serif and make sure it's very carefully kerned.\n\n"

[Here you can see some good pictures of the real stuff.](http://web.archive.org/web/20120622233205/http:/www.antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request)\n\nAs you can see, it is light where the latter \"mission\" and arts and crafts stuff is relatively heavy. In fact it generally looks fragile, but in fact is quite strong, as it was so well made. One of the things they consistently did to change existing designs was not only to remove ornament, but to make everything lighter and finer, and have elegant proportions.\n\nIt is really a unique aesthetic, and one that I don't think has really been created in type. So probably Patty's ideas here are the best.\n\nThe closest anything comes is the early Danish modern furniture in the late forties and early fifties, which was influenced by the Shakers' work. The Danish stuff is more slick and posh--though also very nice.\n\n"

They are only a quarter inch thick. Also the arch is because the sides have been cut down. In a usual chair they would be straight across and as thick at the sides as the middle. The middle being wider is probably for comfort. These chairs are incredibly comfortable to sit in, though they don't look it. For a start they slant back and are relatively low to the ground.\n\nThe straight-on look here also looks heavier because of the shrunken scale of the picture.\n\nAlso those legs and rails are maybe half the diameter of usual ones.\n\nThe 'mission' stuff, by contrast is often built of square, heavy oak planks.\n\nI have a reproduction Shaker 'taped' rocker I always read my morning paper in, and love it. Our dining table is a reproduction of a Shaker trestle table, now in the Fruitlands Museum. The top is only 3/4 inch thick and the legs 1 1/8 inch thick. And the usual heavy cross bar between the two legs is removed, and replaced with two light angle pieces. And the usual heavy bar foot is replaced by a light arch. It is the lightest dining table I have ever seen. The rocker is also much lighter than normal rockers.\n\nI just checked on line, but all the reproductions they show of the trestle table are heavier, and often totally wrong. Many furniture makers call anything un-oramented \"Shaker\", but there is a lot more to it. The authentic light dimensions are harder to make, and still be strong.\n\nAs Chris quoted above from the famous Shaker hymn, their belief was \"tis a gift to be simple\". For them simplicity was a kind of sacred ideal, and the best of the real stuff just radiates that aura.\n\n"

      "content": "'tis a gift to be free...\n\nLooks like a typical Shaker chair to me William, well except the cane seat and the caps on the feet of the back leg's ;) Those slats look right to me.\n\nShakers mastered the stylish slim tappered vertical while keeping horizontals under check (accent on upward movement of line), and adornments like pommel finials, and my favorite mushroom caps, (etc.) are neat touches to those lines. So I think Patty suggestion of De Vinne is just about right, the caps though seem a little bit too wide(?).\n\nAs fate would have it, I just ordered a copy of 'Seen and Received: The Shakers' Private Art', which is a book about the groovy graphic designs produced by the Shaker's spirit Interpreters as they were known as (a.k.a. graphic designers). Hannah Cohoons kick @ss designs (tree of life, tree of spirit, etc.), would make an interesting theme for a Shaker font. So too would Semantha Fairbanks flouishes, almost blackletterish to me.\n\n'Tis the gift to be simple,  \n'tis the gift to be free,  \n'tis the gift to come down  \nwhere we ought to be,  \nand when we find ourselves in the place just right,  \n'twill be in the valley of love and delight.  \nWhen true simplicity is gained  \nto bow and to bend we shan't be ashamed,  \nto turn, turn, will be our delight  \ntill by turning, turning we come round right.\n\n"
