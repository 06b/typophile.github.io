  "content": "I have been trying to find anything reasonably similar to the font used by dog tag military embossing machines for days now. The font itself must be lighter than the embossed result. Answering Identifont's questionnaire i says that Briem Mono, Century Schoolbook Monospace or Computer Modern Teletype (CMTT10) are a good match, but I do not agree. Particularly letters O, G, Q and C are different, for example, the O on a dog tag looks like an athletics race track.\n\nDoes anyone know what font this is?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [desc\\_307320919\\_00.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/typophile.com/files/desc_307320919_00.jpg) | 38.88 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Your answers are fonts with serifs.  \nThe lighting on the dog tag may make the letters appear to have serifs, but they could perhaps actually be a sans serif with the light hitting some sides of the raised lettering more than others, which could give the impression of serifs.  \nIf you have the original and not just a photo, close examination with a magnifying glass should resolve this point.  \ndon\n\n"

      "content": "I knew I had seen these tags before. This was the answer I gave then:\n\n---start quote---  \nStamped tags? If so probably not made from a conventional font.  \nGood matches for appearance are two fonts based on engraving systems. Lineto's Gravur Condensed [http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/ \"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/\") and Optimo's Gravostyle Basic [http://optimo.ch/typefaces\\_Gravostyle-Basic\\_all\\_CharacterMap.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/optimo.ch/typefaces_Gravostyle-Basic_all_CharacterMap.html \"http://optimo.ch/typefaces\\_Gravostyle-Basic\\_all\\_CharacterMap.html\") Only major difference that I spotted is the open top 4 and the tails on 6 & 9. There are other engraving/machine plotting fonts, but they are generally wider than the letters on the tags, particularly for O, C etc. which usually are rounded without the parallel stroke section on the sides.  \n---end quote---  \n [http://typophile.com/node/115178](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/typophile.com/node/115178 \"http://typophile.com/node/115178\")  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Comparing the present image with the one in node 3286 I conclude that both are monospaced fonts, which makes sense for stamping keys.  \nBut I see significant differences, even with this ambiguous image, in letterforms.  \nLook for example at the center strokes in \\_E\\_ and \\_F\\_. Much further in this tag than the one in node 3286. Huge serifs on \\_I\\_ in node 3286, but none detectable in this image. A letter by letter comparison reveals other differences.  \nBased on this image I still don't see serifs, or at the most I could perhaps see the hint of tiny ones.  \nFor a substitute you could use either a Sans serif, as suggested in previous posts, or a monospace version of a tiny square serif like Cushing Two [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/cushing-two/\") or Bushing [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/bushing/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/bushing/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/bushing/\") or Knubi [http://www.verg.com.au/portfolio/knubi/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119211845/http:/www.verg.com.au/portfolio/knubi/ \"http://www.verg.com.au/portfolio/knubi/\")  \nUnfortunately, the more I look at this I am, persuaded that there is no close digital font.  \nDon\n\nDon\n\n"
