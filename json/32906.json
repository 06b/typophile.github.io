Is anyone familiar with it? Does anyone make a digital version?\n\n [‹ Font ID Help](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009211643/http:/typophile.com/node/32990 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Heavy Italized Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009211643/http:/typophile.com/node/32978 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The blurb at the MyFonts page just linked includes some research hints. Not sure if they’re of much use. From them, I came across [LTC Jenson](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009211643/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-jenson/). Neither of these match the ’W’ from your scan. (The short tail of the ’Q’ also distinguishes your face from others. Edit: the ’G’ seems even more distinctive.)\n\n"

      "content": "Tupper: thanks!\n\nNot an exact match, but LTC Jenson is pretty close — and it, I learn, is based on William Morris’s “Golden Type” of 1890, also a close match. This makes perfect sense, as Austria looked to England for much of its progressive design at the time. The Poppelbaum “ver sacrum” type was certainly just a local variation based on the Kelmscott original. I agree that the “G” is its distinguishing mark; I’m curious where that little spur came from — I can’t recall seeing anything like it.\n\n"
