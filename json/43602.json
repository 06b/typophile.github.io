I can see now that I overreacted. Let's forgive each other and put it all behind us.\n\nI will be taking a break from Typophile over the next four months. I've got so much work on my hands I can't spare the time, and it pays to be pragmatic when grappling with the slippery dynamics of online fora. Life can be very strange at times. I've had eight of my teeth extracted in the past six weeks. That's six weeks of swollen gums and throbbing pain as the gums heal. I'll have dentures fitted around about May. A musician friend of mine is dying from cancer right now and it's making me miserable. Life can be very strange.\n\nBefore I depart, I want to thank the following people:\n\n\\* Tiffany for her good grace, marvellous judgement and big heart  \n\\* Eben for his practical outlook and solid moderating skills  \n\\* Stewf for his coolness and ongoing support of my type career  \n\\* Dan Reynolds for his very existence---you're a beautiful person Dan and I like you  \n\\* Nick Shinn, John Hudson, William and Hrant for their immense knowledge and experience  \n\\* Ricardo and Chris Lozos for their generosity and wonderful humour  \n\\* Linda and Patty for their great artistry and professionalism  \n\\* James Puckett for his dynamism and obvious potential  \n\\* Ben Mitchell and Jelmar for being great sponges and teaching me how better to teach type design  \n\\* Darrel, Haley, Zara, Yves, Russell, Tim Daley, Paul Hunt, Sharon, Richard Kegler, Joshua and every other regular here---you're all wonderful people whose hearts are in the right place  \n\\* Everybody else I've conversed with, whether we've agreed or disagreed, that's not the point. The point is it's all good. You are all good people who expand my mind and strengthen my heart  \n\\* Most of all to Joe for making it all possible.\n\nI'll leave you with the words to the chorus from the Stone Temple Pilots song Still Remains, written by Scott Weiland. It's very significant for me right now because I don't know how long the repaired arteries inside my head are going to last. I'm experiencing head pains every time I cough lately. That's a bad sign, and if one of 'em bursts I'll probably die. I'm not kidding, nor am I making it up to get sympathy. Life can be very strange.\n\n_Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  \nTake a bath I'll drink the water that you leave  \nIf you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend  \nPick a flower hold your breath and drift away_\n\nWhile I'm away, please keep in mind one thing: It's the spirit of the rules that counts, not the letter.\n\nj a m e s\n\n",

But isn't meant as condescension. Instead I am trying to see if I can (re)establish common/shared ideas about this.\n\na) It's James' thread not Joe's and the more you ( or anyone ) pounds away at Joe the more it becomes about Joe albeit in a negative way. To me this seems unfortunate. This was in part the reason I asked James to make his own thread - this thread.\n\nb) A very related point is that information which is too random/mixed becomes less valuable to the users of Typophile. Granted this isn't a Type heavy thread, (it's personal) but the point is applicable to Typophile threads in general.\n\nThis why the guidelines say <cite> Don’t hijack other threads:<br>\nDon’t post irrelevant queries within another thread; create a new thread. You can post a new topic by scrolling to the bottom of one of the main forum pages and clicking on the “Post a new topic” link. </cite>\n\nb) James himself\\* is an advocate of avoiding extending conflicts bad feelings on Typophile or elsewhere. One way of extending these bad feelings is to reply to negativity with ire even if you are fully justified.\n\nd) That Typophile is a bit too full of \"pounding\" is in part why James is taking a break.\n\nTypophile will be the kind of place we make collectively it.\n\nAgree or disagree but please make a new thread about it if you want to reply to me. It's valid to link to that new thread here.\n\n\\*He can correct me if I am putting false words in his mouth when he gets back, but I I think I am very probably on safe ground here.\n\n"

Everyone on this thread owes it to themselves to listen to what Eben is saying and take it on-board. I mean it. Let Joe's comments stand and stop making personal remarks about him. I was uncivil and made many personal remarks about people here the other day in an attempt to draw attention to incivility and the problems that hubris creates. That was the wrong way to go about it. You may not agree with Joe but berating him for his remarks is just more incivility and does nothing to create an environment of trust and good faith.\n\nAn uncivil environment is a poor environment to discuss typography in.
