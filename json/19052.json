Tad buggy and slow at first, but it seems to learn as it goes (and speeds up?).

It may convince some to scale back their Mac-specific development. Why, after all, would you invest in two development teams when the product of one will work on both platforms? And then there are all those companies that have a niche market developing applications for the Mac, who will suddenly have competition from often larger and better funded companies making similar Windows software. I suspect the impact will depend on how seamlessly Bootcamp allows Windows apps to run within a general Mac environment. If developers for Windows apps start shipping them with Mac-like skin options, the competition will be even stiffer. It could be the death knell for a lot of Mac-specific software development.\n\n"

The specs on Apple’s website state that the Windows XP OS you install must be a full-install disk and not an upgrade. Under this arrangement, one might presume that current windows users who want to take advantage of this opportunity would have to purchase a new license, whether or not they were eligible for an upgrade. Perhaps they should consider a special upgrade package that works like a new install to the Mac OS.\n\n"
