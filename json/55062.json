I'm just concerned with legibility.\n\nThe radio station name is Y101 FM.\n\nThanks very much.\n\nJoseph\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [radio\\_logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020041832/http:/typophile.com/files/radio_logo.jpg) | 37.31 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Yeah... it took me quite a while to figure it out. I would definitely try to make the \"m\" in \"fm\" more connected—because for a while it looked like the letter i followed by a backwards n. If it's a \"rawk\" station and you want it to be a little broken, then the brokeness should show up in other places besides the first part of the m.\n\nAlso the \"upside down\" palindrome kind of idea is a little confusing too. Is making the 101 a separate color an option?\n\n"
