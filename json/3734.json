But if it says: \"take this font and do whatever you want with it\", i guess that is to be considered as \"open source\"... ¶Speaking as a type designer, I can imagine it is a sour experience if somebody else custom-modifies your font and sells the custom work for more money than you will ever earn just by making the font in the first place. ¶The Swedish phone company [http://www.telia.se/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013154248/http:/www.telia.se/) had their design bureau change Bliss, so that the upper case W was a bit different. I can imagine that wasn't cheap, and what does J. Tankard think about that? Ericsson Mobile [http://www.ericsson.se/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013154248/http:/www.ericsson.se/) apparently has \"their own\" cut of Helvetica Neue (or is it Akzidenz Grotesk?) - anyway, I can't see the damn difference. And where does the money go? In the design bureau's pocket? Not to the type foundry or the type designer, I believe... Contact the type designer if you are able to find him/her. I think that is the morally right thing to do.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> When does a \"revival\" become ethically unsound?   \n   \nThat's a very interesting question. For example, one of the entries in Bukvaraz was just disqualified because it was based on Stone Sans. I don't know exactly what line the designer took, but to me the result is so different that it's almost a moot point. Nobody would use that font instead of Stone Sans. Sure, the intentions matter too, but don't we have bigger fish to fry? And I wonder, would it have been OK fifty years from now? If I had a dime for every type designer who's benefited from the fact that Jenson is dead...   \n   \nBesides the ethical stance, there's also the \"cultural\" one: overly literal revivals are good for making money, otherwise they suck. There have only been two fonts I've wanted to revive so far, and one of them I'd never do. The other is actually in the planning stages, but only because it's a totally unique text design that simply doesn't exist in digital form, in any guise.   \n   \n--   \n   \nJen, it would indeed be good to have a list of \"open\" fonts, with sources. By \"open\" I mean fonts that you can just download, modify, resell (or at least redistribute), etc. Not that there's a lot of them, certainly not a lot of quality ones. But for example isn't there a \"Times\" like that somewhere?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Why? For one thing, the fact that the guy is not dead shouldn't be the determining factor - he himself copied from others, without permission - any design is part of our cultural landscape, and the \"original designer\" is not entitled to absolute control, just some control (like requiring adherence to the contract). Also, because the original designer might be an unreasonable, senile hogger.   \n   \nThere has to be balance - don't put your head under the guillotine.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

If you want to make something derived from the **digital outline data** in Adobe Jenson or FB Hightower, you damn well better contact Adobe or Font Bureau and talk to their staff. Yes, most enduring type is historically informed, but this does not mean you can pillage someone else's **programming**.   \n   \nTreat type designs as you would treat any other intellectual property: with respect for the owner. Those looking for professional advice would do well to know that Hrant's opinions are, shall we say, not very representative of any major type designer other than Hrant. He continually demonstrates a need to see colossal, labrynthine complexity where there never was any. But THIS STUFF IS NOT HARD. Don't let anyopne convince you otherwise.   \n   \nTalk to the font's originators (and by \"font\" I mean the digital outline) before you mess with their **files**. And yes, scanning printed output of their fonts is still derivative work.   \nDerivative work without authorization is ILLEGAL. And if you simply take the time to ask permission, you may be surprised at how cool the designers really are.   \n   \nI had a request just like this today. Someone wanted me to add CE glyphs to a font package they bought. I told them I'd be willing as long as I get formal permission from the original foundry.

They are _licensed._ You can _license_ a font package for generally between $0 and $150 a weight.   \n   \nActually _paying for_ a font, also called a _commission_ or a _work for hire_, generally will cost you several orders of magnitude more, depending on the nature and scope of its use, whether you want exclusive use rights, whether you want exclusive _distribution_ rights, or what have you. I suspect you already know this distiction, Hrant, and find it baffling that you seem not to acknowledge it.   \n   \nAnd yes, some designers will let you add accents and other new features to their design, and others will be hesitant. Too bad. That's their right.   \n   \nFortunately for you, Trajan is not the only clasically proportioned imperial capitals font available. Try Friz Quadrata or Weiss. There are umpteen digitizations of Weiss floating around. Perhaps one of them is maintained by a mellower company.   \n  \nA good metaphor, for Those Who Seem To Require Metaphors, might be font-as-child. Do not graft new limbs, organs or eyeballs onto a child without the parents' explicit consent.   \n   \nNeither Hrant nor I are lawyers. I suggest anyone still not convinced you should approach the designer/programmer get a Real Opinion from a Real Intellectual Property Lawyer before taking any risks you may come to regret.   \n   \nI will offer a wager, though, for anyone interested in losing some money.
