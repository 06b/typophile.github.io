Is it just me, or is anyone else diggin’ Obama’s website, typography, and overall design aesthetics?! Granted, they may be going a bit overboard with all of the 2.0-ish reflections and what not.

All politics aside of course.\n\n[http://hillaryclinton.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/hillaryclinton.com/ \"http://hillaryclinton.com/\")\n\n[http://www.johnedwards.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/www.johnedwards.com/ \"http://www.johnedwards.com/\")\n\n[http://johnmccain.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/johnmccain.com/ \"http://johnmccain.com/\")\n\n[http://mittromney.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/mittromney.com/ \"http://mittromney.com/\")\n\n[http://www.mikehuckabee.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/www.mikehuckabee.com/ \"http://www.mikehuckabee.com/\")\n\n[http://www.dennis4president.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/www.dennis4president.com/ \"http://www.dennis4president.com/\")\n\n[http://www.barackobama.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/www.barackobama.com/ \"http://www.barackobama.com/\")\n\n [‹ which fonts can I use](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41521 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [OpenType 1.5 draft spec & 1.6 suggestions ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080330093502/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41507 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
