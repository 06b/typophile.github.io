Tantalus, with its alternate (from T-26), is sort of similar, but there are differences. Your sample's 'a' could have been made from the Tantalus 'o'(almost), but still the s and r are not the same in either face. I suppose it might be a customization of Tantalus, but more likely it's a new font I haven't met yet.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
