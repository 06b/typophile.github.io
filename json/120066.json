For title, I'd have said something close/like Alternate Gothic but many details are off and mainly /J over curved terminal. Best one I could get is [Knockout](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317183327/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview) (from No. 66 to 68) using the alternate /R (as seen [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317183327/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/characters/knockoutno-68fullfeatherweight)). Still searching.\n\nEDIT: Seeing now Kevin took the same track with Knockout so probably not so bad. But nothing about Arial...\n\n"
