  "content": "Hi Guys ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140827im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nI created this mock up type treatment for a logo. It's only really for practice in letterform construction, but I'd really appreciate your feedback on it, so as to tighten it up. Looking at it now, I'm starting to think the 'a' is optically a little narrow. What do you think?   \n   \nthanks! ![logotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140827im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47436.jpg)\n\n",

Maybe you should try to incorporate some more of the 'a' letter forms into the 'e'.. )   \n   \n_By the way, there is a mighty bank in Austria, named ' [Raiffeisen](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140827/http:/www.raiffeisen.at/)'.. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140827im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)_   \n   \nEdit.: The 'a' slightly reminds me of ' [Pill Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140827/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000039)', by fellow Typophile Christian Robertson..\n\n"
