The fonts only go through the GW monogram right now so I guess yours are to come.\n\nI have a JR but no JD although I have two DJ monograms; no stand-alone D though. Also, while the shapes are the same as your sample, in my book one letter is filled in so they differ in that respect. If you like I can scan them and post them here.\n\nThe book I have is also available on abe.com for $170.00. It dates to the latter half of the 19th century, probably somewhere along in the 1880-90 range.\n\nGeorge\n\n"
