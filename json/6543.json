  "content": "hello folks   \nfor my uncles winery (in the french part of Switzerland) i would like to digitize some old wine-labels (see attachment). does anyone have an idea what fonts were used � especially the one for �CR�T-DESSOUS� and �Epesses� as they been used for ages now. probably i'll have to redraw though. The font/s for the other elements are open to discussion, so suggestions are more then welcome.   \nThank you all in advance   \nYves ![wine label](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126212903im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48288.jpg)\n\n",
