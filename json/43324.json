  "content": "Greetings, fellow typophiles. I have a question that verges on the edge of legality, but I believe remains within the realm of moral responsibility. If you believe that this is not so, let me know, and I'll gladly withdraw the request. My situation is this: I've bought a suite of Mrs Eaves a while ago, with ligatures and small caps as separate TT files, and would now like to combine them into one OT font. I know of the existence of the official OTF version offered by the foundry, but can't justify spending so much for something I already own. I've just started learning FontLab, and wonder if the process would have to be too labor intensive, of if there were a trick in combining fonts.  \nThanks in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "Legalities/morality aside, it also depends on how much your time is worth. I've changed a lot of our old Adobe Type 1 fonts into OT, and I started much closer to the final product that your proposed starting point. For example, we had already made \"database\" Type 1 fonts -- all glyphs in one font, but not named properly for OT. I also used programming to do the name changes (in a PFA font format), so once I had a list of names I had used consistently in Type 1 fonts -- like oneoldstyle -- and the proper OT name to replace it -- like one.op (for \"oldstye, proportional\") I just ran the program & the names were changd in both the font & metrical data.\n\nTo make an roman and italic OT font, writing all the features, making up & kerning extra stuff for fractions, superiors, etc. etc, takes me 2 to 3 eight-hour days. And this is with flat, pairs kerning, not class-based kerning.\n\nIf your time is of much value -- that is, if you can sell it for anything -- you are better off re-buying the fonts. So why don't we do that? Ah. We're in a specialized business, and and I have to rework even the most recent OT fonts from Adobe, like Arno. Arno, roman and italic, standard only, took me one flat week (40 hours). To be fair, much of the extra time was due to the complexities of Arno (including the changed naming system used in it), but some of those complexities are also in a font like Mrs. Eaves. For example, how do you handle the small-caps numbers? Switch them along with the small caps? Not a good idea in our line of work. Switch them separate with a Stylistic Set? Now you have more documentation to keep track of & write so me plus our other 2 comps will know to access them. Petite caps. And on & on.\n\nWith \"our\" Arno, I wound up with far fewer features & less kerning, but I did have what Adobe had left out that would cost us six hours per book in our specialized work. If I could have just paid Adobe an extra $500 to add what we needed, we'd have been money ahead. But Adobe is sensible; I doubt they could do what we needed for $1,000 or more, so we are money ahead. Plus I now have a font that i can go back into & add characters when one of our customers decides they want to use Arno for a text with transliterated Devanagari.\n\nUnless you have this kind of need, and are far more experienced with writing OT features & using Fontlab than you say, I'd suggest you spend the money to buy the new OT font.\n\n"
