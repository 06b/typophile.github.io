  "content": "TypeTogether is happy to release this gorgeous font family, designed by Pilar Cano. It is a gentle typeface, humanistic in concept yet with a contemporary feel, where softness and fluidity play a very important role. Originally intended for art, design and architecture books, Edita can graciously work alongside photographs and images alike, producing an amazing synergy. Furthermore, Edita is a legibility workhorse, whether it is used in a few paragraphs or in a 600-page novel.\n\nAvailable exclusively in our online store More info [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012212736/http:/www.type-together.com/Edita).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012212736im_/http:/typophile.com/files/edita_4596.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Dear forum of experts on typography.  \nI find this design very intriguing. It seems to me like a fresh typeface with a slight “soft roughness” to it, but subtle enough for it not to stand out too much in longer text, but to present a body copy in an modestly elegant way. (No, I try not to promote it, I try just to describe my associations.)  \nBUT: I am by no means an expert, rather I merely appreciate good design. So I can’t really estimate how others would perceive it, an anonymous ‘uninformed recipient’. I would like to make us of this font in a bit more conservative environment than the indicated “ art, design and architecture” field. Although definitely not as conservative as legal or banking. My concern is, would this face “stand out” too much by itself as a “too different than normal” typeface and therefore distract the reader? Would it appear as unexpected?\n\nI hope somebody can give me some estimation. Thank you very much.\n\n"
