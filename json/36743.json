  "content": "This is my first post, and also the first typeface that I have designed (other than several partial alphabets in school). I have completed the upper and lower cases, and am working on drawing the numbers. At this point I feel like I could use some crit.\n\nThe letters are all traced using type tool with auto metrics and auto kerning applied, and generated as open type ps. I am not sure about some of the character widths, and also could use some suggestions as to how the language of the upper case should translate to the lower case (for example if an upper case letter has an angled terminal, should the lower case as well? As is the case with the X). If it is helpful I can set a block of text with the face, and post it later.\n\nI look forward to your critique.  \nThanks in advance\n\nandy\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [revolvo character set and specimen.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124133835/http:/typophile.com/files/revolvo%20character%20set%20and%20specimen.pdf) | 412.3 KB |\n\n",

The lowercase alphabet seems more grounded than the uppercase, which almost seems to be leaning and wobbling, although I think some of that is due to the letterspacing.\n\nTo nitpick: G looks like it’s tipping to the left, and I’m confused by the terminals of U angling to the reverse of everything else. The same goes for the terminal of the upper horizontal in E and F slanting differently.\n\n"

You may need to taper some strokes as these junctions, or have them connect differently.\n\nEchoing James' comment, the upper case isn't as consistent as the lower. The A and the M especially don't match the rest.\n\nI would like to see some sample text set in your font.\n\n"

I knew that I had some dark spots going on in some of the connections, I will be refining those shortly. As for the A and M, I am not sure in what way they stand out. Do you mean because they lack the slant?\n\nI have set a short block of type at 24pt., these are the same characters as in the original set. I welcome any additional comments.\n\nAny suggestions on how to approach kerning pairs for the entire font?\n\nThanks  \nandy\n\n"

      "content": "Regarding the A and M: although your A has a lower-than-normal bar which matches the font, it doesn't have the quirks that make the other letters interesting. Perhaps the top should be narrower and angled. Likewise, the M looks too \"normal\" when there is opportunity here to give it more personality, such as angles at the top of the stems. The V as well could use that treatment, as most of the other letters where that can be done have it.\n\nPersonally, I like the G; if you extend the upper terminal, perhaps still keep it a bit to the left of what would be \"normal\".\n\nOn the lowercase e, you might move the lower terminal a bit to the left; currently it looks like you're not sure if it should align with the top. Make it definitely align, or obviously not. I think the latter would suit the font.\n\n"

I am also going to try to adjust the crossbars throughout the upper case so that they are optically more consistent. I should have changes up by the weekend.\n\nThanks  \nAndy\n\n"
