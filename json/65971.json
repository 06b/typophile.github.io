  "content": "I am designing a magazine and I am looking for a text font. I will need to squeeze a lot of text. I have been testing a few ... but sizes and leading are getting really small:  \nArno (10/11), Diverda Serif 9/11, Leitura news 8/11.  \nIt seems that at that point sizes fonts are losing their identity.  \nSo ... I was thinking of trying a bit taller/narrower body text font.  \nI would be thankful, if you could post some suggestions ... classic or contemporary - both are welcome!\n\n",
