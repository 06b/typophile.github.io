  "content": "I'm currently building my portfolio up to apply at some art and design schools so I decided to create an identity for a fictional museum of art based in Mexico. I am now debating on the logo and have created several versions:  \n1. [http://droplr.com/43FfS+](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084949/http:/droplr.com/43FfS+ \"http://droplr.com/43FfS+\")  \n2. [http://droplr.com/4yB6u+](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084949/http:/droplr.com/4yB6u+ \"http://droplr.com/4yB6u+\")\n\nAnd I have now pretty much started over and come up with this (also attached):  \n3. [http://droplr.com/8nkb4+](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084949/http:/droplr.com/8nkb4+ \"http://droplr.com/8nkb4+\")  \n4. [http://droplr.com/8nZ4Q+](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084949/http:/droplr.com/8nZ4Q+ \"http://droplr.com/8nZ4Q+\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084949im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Centro-de-Arte-4_4939.png)\n\nThe \"brief\" for this project is to create an identity that would be a re-birth of a dying organization. It fails to attract the younger, sophisticated visitors it needs to remain open and fund services for the public. It needs to change its damaged image (no existing or marketed identity) and represent itself as something clean, modern and luxurious without losing its historical significance.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any honest critique. Thank you!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Centro de Arte 4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084949/http:/typophile.com/files/Centro%20de%20Arte%204.png) | 19.63 KB |\n\n",
