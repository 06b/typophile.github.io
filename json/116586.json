Some awkward features, but they could easily be adjusted.  \nNote that the letters and numbers are not in the standard locations for a Windows font . For regular use it would best to rename them to the standard locations and regenerate the font.  \nDon\n\n"

Bearing in mind that most persons are not be able to match the unique shapes of the fraktur uppercase with the letters of the Latin alphabet.  \nBut I take your point on the unsuitability of this font for use as the mathematical bold fraktur font. Anyone using the fraktur symbols in a mathematical context would not appreciate their transformation into Latinesque forms, which would introduce ambiguity as to meaning.  \nDon\n\n"
