  "content": "I just bought the Freight Sans and Freight Text packages after some serious decision making process.  \nI happen to need the text book italic k in a fairly large size, and noticed, that it seems to have a little problem with it. There seems to be a drawing mistake in the right leg of the k. All the other ks are ok, as you can see.\n\nWhat can I do about this? is this very common? I don't own FL, so I can't fix it permanently myself, only one-offs in Illustrator.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Freight\\_ks.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20141224232529/http:/typophile.com/files/Freight_ks.gif) | 6.14 KB |\n| [Freight\\_bi\\_k.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20141224232529/http:/typophile.com/files/Freight_bi_k.gif) | 2.75 KB |\n| [Freight\\_bi\\_k.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20141224232529/http:/typophile.com/files/Freight_bi_k.png) | 3.58 KB |\n| [Freight\\_ks.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20141224232529/http:/typophile.com/files/Freight_ks.png) | 6.35 KB |\n\n",

There is an apparent bug in the font, which he will surely want to know about and fix, and he will be able to provide you with an updated font file. He may, of course, want to confirm that you have a legitimate license, but it sounds like you do and it should be easy to confirm.\n\n"

Evidently, some distributors have implemented the update less swiftly than others.\n\nI've responded to Mili directly on this, but if anyone else should encounter the same problem, I would like to hear about it.
