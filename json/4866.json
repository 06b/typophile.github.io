  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nI've got a typeface I'm working with that was designed at 100 em units. For Flash to render it properly as dynamic text, I've been told that the typeface needs to change to 125 em units. I own FontLab 4.6, but cannot figure out from the manual how to do this. I would rather not have to redraw the typeface, do any of you have any suggestions for me? I appreciate it.   \n   \nThanks.\n\n [‹ Pixar Typestry](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122110403/http:/www.typophile.com/node/6209 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Pasting From Illustrator is easy however... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122110403/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4859 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Change the UPM to 125 and select the 'Scale all glyphs according to UPM change' option.   \n   \nNote that changing the UPM will destroy TrueType hints. Also note that scaling from 100 to 125 will produce rounding errors.\n\n"
