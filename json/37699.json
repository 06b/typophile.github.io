A weird pattern of hash marks superimposes it self over the above items driving me nuts!  \nSo far, I have booted from other volumes, run a plethora of utilities, zapped my Pram, rebooted all to now avail. None of my utilities show any problem. Except for where the mouse is pointing, all application windows look fine. Anything on the desktop or any navigation item including the Dock gets whammied, though. The splash screen gets a full dose for all aps.  \nThe problem began after waking from sleep last friday (not my sleep, the computer's sleep).\n\nHere are a two screen grabs:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108090144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/drive-icons2_5359.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108090144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/inDsplash2_6546.png)\n\nAnyone seen this before or know how to fix it?\n\nChrisL\n\n",

If you can send a normal video signal to an external monitor that’s a good sign, if external output does the same stuff, the video chip is fried and you’ll likely need a new motherboard. If you have a desktop, try replacing the display cable.\n\nIn my experience, the Apple store in Clarendon will probably be the easiest in the area to get a repair appointment at.

Safe Boot is often recommended by Mac techs because it is an Apple-designed, safe, mechanism for resetting certain specific settings. My guess is that if you're already running 10.4.10, you'll be in a position where you might need to start swapping bigger things out to diagnose the problem--really stuff that's outside the scope of this type of forum. The fact that these are standard screen shots implies that the issue is software related. Apple's support forums might be a good bet because there may be people who see far, far more Mac issues than we do. With more eyeballs there's a better chance someone has seen this before.\n\nIf it were me, I would probably also try resetting system caches using a free utility called OnyX. I've never known [OnyX](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108090144/http:/www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/onyx.html) to cause any problems, but there are lots of options to do goofy things.\n\nI also obsessively back up my hard drive with a free cloning utility called Carbon Copy Cloner. It creates completely bootable backup partitions. That would be handy in a case like this because one could boot a recent backup and test to see if the problem occurred. I recently survived a hard drive failure on my laptop without losing any data. My backup disk was a month old, but my email was still on the server and my other backup files had copies as well.\n\nI guess my final comment on this is... yeah, it's weird. Gremlins maybe?\n\n"

Best bet would be to run the Apple Hardware Test from the OS DVD that came with the G5:  \n [http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/aht.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108090144/http:/www.thexlab.com/faqs/aht.html \"http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/aht.html\")\n\nRun the extended test. This may or may not be able to diagnose a bad video card – it may appear to function correctly to the computer, but produce a garbled visual output – but it should rule out other things, such as bad system memory (though you'd most likely be getting kernel panics with bad memory).\n\nAssuming that comes up fine, it's the graphics card. If memory serves me correctly, the G5's had an Nvidia FX5200 64MB dual DVI. Here's a guide for swapping out the card (it's really easy):  \n [http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/PMG5\\_AGP:PCI\\_Card\\_DIY.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108090144/http:/manuals.info.apple.com/en/PMG5_AGP:PCI_Card_DIY.pdf \"http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/PMG5\\_AGP:PCI\\_Card\\_DIY.pdf\")\n\nBefore you go out and buy a replacement, try this: switch off the G5 at the plug (but leave it plugged in so it's earthed) open up the case, take out the graphics card and _use an air duster to thoroughly clean out its heatsink_. Put it back in, boot up and check to see if the corruption's gone. Frequently the heatsinks clog up after a couple of years under a desk, making the card overheat and causing this sort of visual corruption. Give the rest of the G5 case a good blast of air while you have it open, too. Oh, and make sure to keep the air duster vertical, you don't want to spray freezing propellant everywhere ;) (Though it shouldn't be harmful.)\n\nIf you do have to replace the graphics card, you can use a good few different models as long as OS X has the drivers for them, but it'd probably be easiest to use the same make and model again. You should be able to pick up a cheap retail FX5200 128MB dual DVI (non–Mac–specific) for around $50 at the most.\n\n"

I wouldn't bother with the fancy silver or ceramic stuff, though, tests have shown that it's no more effective than normal compound, it just costs ten times more and looks prettier in the packet.\n\nRemove the heatsink, clean off all the gunk, thoroughly clean the fan & heatsink (if the fan still even works?), apply a tiny amount of thermal paste (scrounge it off a geek friend) and reapply the heatsink. Leave the side of the case off if you can, so the heat doesn't build up and you can see if the graphics card's fan still works.\n\nIf it seems to make a difference, it may be worth shelling out for a new heatsink such as this:  \n [http://www.arctic-cooling.com/vga2.php?idx=125](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108090144/http:/www.arctic-cooling.com/vga2.php?idx=125 \"http://www.arctic-cooling.com/vga2.php?idx=125\")\n\n(Though I'm not sure that'll fit in the G5 case.)\n\nWorth a try on the off chance it fixes it?

So if anyone could tell me the conclusions of this \"video-card-destruction-epic\" I would be very glad.\n\nI would like to use this Power Mac G5 (first gen) for a little longer. And eventually when I buy a MacBook (Pro) it could serve for holding at least one copy off all my precious data. Or it might be just for a shorter term because I might end up with an all brand-new Mac Pro where my old hard drives can live their second live and leaving the old one hard drive'less.\n\nSo now I'm in the stage where I'm thinking of fixing my until-a-couple-of-days-ago-very-loyal Power Mac so I could hang on a little bit longer for buying a new Mac and eventually use the old one as a back-up beast or leave it as it is and go to the store to buy a MacBook (Pro) or Mac Pro. It all depends on the availability and price of AGP 8x video cards in Europe and the risk I could be taking because the new card good get the same problem.\n\n"

Did he eventually saw the problem return?\"\n\n3art, No, my problem has not returned since I got a new video card. I am still running Tiger and probably will untill the next bugfix comes out from Apple. I can't imagine that Leopard would be the issue anyway. It is hard to find a workable video card any more so I hope mine hangs in there for a couple more years. I wish you the best of luck solving your problem. Let me know how it all turns out.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
