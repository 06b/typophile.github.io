Thing is you posted this one twice and nobody identified it. Even Fivos' fantastic software ' [Find my Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701140112/http:/www.findmyfont.com/)' was defeated.\n\n> Isn't Quaint made by James Lewis, by the way? Or am I missing something?\n\nJørgen Grotdal and James Lewis are both credited on this font (check 'owners', top of the [page](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701140112/http:/www.behance.net/gallery/Quaint/15535095)). Both work for 'The Ligature Collective'.\n\n"
