Lyons’ archive of antique types. Later I believe it had to be “retired” from the library since I don’t see it anywhere now... but in my old CG specimen book it’s as plain as day.\n\n"

Just thought it was interesting to share. I have seen earlier ads where the face looked closer to what we know as Packard Antique or Packhard.\n\nIn the old Compugraphic specimen book I have, there are two weights of Packard, the lighter is similar to the weight in the auto ad. If someone has a ready reference on the designer and origin of the face, it would be nice to add to this thread.\n\n"
