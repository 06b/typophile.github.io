  "content": "Greetings, all,\n\nI have a handful of fonts that I have created, and I want to file the copyright for the computer code with the U.S. Copyright Office.\n\nThey ask for a certain number of pages of the \"source code\" from the beginning and the end of the \"program\" to accompany the application for the copyright.\n\nI have no idea how to get to the \"source code\" of a font in order to do this.\n\nCan anyone suggest a method for creating a listing of source, or anchor points and coordinate information, or something that I can submit?\n\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nBrian P. Lawler\n\n",

If it's OpenType CFF or TrueType, you could use TTX to dump the code in text form. If it's Type 1, I would use an unencrypted PFA file to treat as the text/code form of the font.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "Yup. Download the TTX tool, and use it to dump your fonts into XML source files (which can also be recompiled into fonts with TTX).\n\nTTX hasn't been fully maintained, so it doesn't deal with some new developments, like new formats of the OS/2 table, etc. But I don't think FontLab does any of that stuff yet, though Adobe's FDK can produce fonts TTX can't handle.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"
