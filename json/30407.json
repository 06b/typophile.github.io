Its my first try on a sans serif non-display-font and I would like to know if you like it before I go on with it.\n\nGreetings:\n\nSteven\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [001.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123232343/http:/typophile.com/files/001.pdf) | 16.31 KB |\n| [002.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123232343/http:/typophile.com/files/002_0.pdf) | 17.89 KB |\n| [test - old and new E.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123232343/http:/typophile.com/files/test%20-%20old%20%20and%20new%20E.pdf) | 34.35 KB |\n\n",

I think the s isnt drunken anymore. Also I extended the descenders a bit, and made some minimal changes on some letters.  \nI will post a new update when Im ready with loosening some letters.\n\nbest wishes:\n\nSteven\n\n"

The w is gorgeous, but I guarantee you that someone will use it in a typography book as an example of a serifed letter in a sans-serif font.\n\n"

I bet it's going to cause some \"there's something different about this sans, but I don't know what it is\" reactions :)\n\nPersonally, I haven't encountered something like this recently, so it's a refreshing direction.\n\n"

It's got a very cool Zapf/Chappell vibe to it, but it still seems fresh. I can't decide whether I like your old 'E' or new 'E' better - they both look great.\n\nI agree that the kerning needs tweaking, but since it's a work in progress, you probably know that already.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing more.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

But i hope that you dont want to say that my letters are such amateurish like these are :(\n\n:)\n\nI think I will go for the new style. I could try making an other Version later.\n\nAfter you are the second person that mentioned it: No I havent done the kerning yet :) the letters were just a early vectorised version of my idea how the letters could look. I will take notice on the kerning later when I made the whole alphabet.\n\nGoodnight to you all\n\nbest wishes: Steven\n\n"
