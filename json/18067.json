  "content": "If your sample is available online, you can link to it via a hyperlink, though we prefer you upload an attachment in the thread itself. There are two options:\n\nTo attach an image in your original post.\n\n1. Click **edit** in the black bar at the top (right under the thread title) if you're adding an image to a pre-existing thread.\n2. At the bottom of the page you'll see **Attachments** in red.\n3. Click **Browse** and select the image on your hard drive.\n4. Click **Submit**.\n\nTo use the inline image upload feature you will need a current version of the [Flash Player](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317185106/http:/get.adobe.com/flashplayer/). Once you have it installed you will see an “Insert image” link on the post form. After clicking that link, browse your hard drive and select the desired image.\n\nMake sure your sample image is compatible with this board:\n\n- **RGB** only, no CMYK\n- **GIF** , **PNG** or **JPEG** only, no TIFF or BMAP\n- although **PDF** s are supported, we _really_ don't like them (unless it's a vector file)\n\nIf you do not comply to these specifications, there's a high probability your sample won't show up in certain browser versions.\n\nMind the size – don't post unnecessary big images and do not exceed **590 pixels** in width.\n\n",
