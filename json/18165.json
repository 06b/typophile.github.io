  "content": "I have recently completed a master's thesis dealing with Paul Renner and Futura. It is available as a PDF down load from [http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222005-152053/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125013521/http:/etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222005-152053/ \"http://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222005-152053/\"). If that is too much to remember use etd. gsu.edu and browse by author (leonard).\n\nI appreciate any serious commentary and input. The abstract follows:\n\nThis thesis reviews the circumstances that led to what Paul Renner called �the inflation of historicism,� places his response to that problem in the context of the Weimar Republic, details how the German attributes with which he began the project were displaced from the typeface that emerged in 1927, demonstrates that Futura belongs to a new category of serif-less roman fonts rooted in Arts and Crafts lettering, and considers why the specifically German aspects of the project have gone unrecognized for over seventy years. Renner�s writing is compared to ideas prevalent in early twentieth-century German cultural discourse, and Futura�s design process is placed in the context of Renner�s personal experience of Weimar�s social and economic crises. Objective measurements are employed to establish the relationship between drawings attributed to Renner and are used to compare features of Futura with other fonts of the period.\n\n",

But I have to ask, did you investigate the possibility of setting the thesis itself in Futura? Do you have another version set in Futura?\n\nThis isn't entirely crazy, because it would be nice to be able to meditate on the font intermitantly while reading your thesis. A cynical take on this might change your title to: \"Paul Renner and Futura: Times New Roman Is The Only Acceptable Typeface, So Why Bother Discussing Others?\"\n\nRecently, a Typophile made some T-shirts reviving an old advertisement for Garamond consisting of the word \"Helvetica\" set in Garamond. Seeing page after page of information on Futura set in Times New Roman makes me feel the same way as seeing that ad.  \n [http://www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat.44022032](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125013521/http:/www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat.44022032 \"http://www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat.44022032\")\n\nAlso: I don't necessarily agree with my own arguments.

As I worked on the thesis, I produced a version of Futura that used the glyphs developed by Renner and the Bauer Foundry in the period up to the Summer of 1925, and had hoped to use that for setting the thesis. However, Times Roman is the standard for GSU electronic theses.\n\nTo a certain extent the phrase \"The Only Acceptable Typeface,\" in your pastisch on the title, expresses one of the critical points made in the concluding chapter of the thesis, e.g. fonts like Times Roman disguise their modernist premise through appropriation of authority accrued to historic models. Further, such appropriation has become such a standard feature of 20th century typefounding that its implications frequently go unnoticed. Worse, appropriation of obvious historical authority obscures the true nature of fonts that, like Futura, have their own clearly discernable historical antecedants but access them in ways not in agreement with the \"official party line.\"\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for this interesting read, Charles. I spent more than a week ruminating over your thesis, and it has actually motivated me to register for Typophile after a year of merely listening in to discussions, so this is in fact my very first post and I apologize for posting so late.\n\nYou deal with a fascinating subject in an almost exhaustive manner - the wealth of material that has gone into your dissertation is amazing. I particularly like your approach of situating the design process of Futura in its wider social, political and economic context; I think this is very effective in this case.\n\nThere are just a few points where your thesis puzzles me, probably because I am too mired in an insular German perspective. You stress the \"specifically German aspects\" of Futura and the peculiarities of \"German typographic practice in the first half of the twentieth century\". I am not always sure what exactly you mean by this, or how it relates to the design of Futura. You sometimes sounds as if, typographically speaking, Germany and the rest of the world, or Britain and the United States at least, were on different planets in those years. I think that is to some extent contradicted by your own account how people like Johnston or Gill were hired by German publishers to do work in Germany. Of course, there was the prevalence of blackletter, which was clearly a significant as well as highly visible difference. But this was never as all-dominating as you tend to make out - I think there was more of a typographical bilingualism than you give credit for, and the acceptance of roman type developed much earlier than \"in the five years between Typographie als Kunst and the issuance of Futura\".\n\nWhere your thesis fails to hold water in my view, Charles, is in your claim that the \"German aspects\" of Futura, i.e. the connection to blackletter, were somehow toned down during the design process. While your account of that design process is admirable (my only quibble would be that the lecture on 3 July 1925 was obviously not in Munich but in Frankfurt), I do not think the characters a and g in Renner's original design would have struck any German at the time as particularly \"German\", any more than it would today, and in fact their replacements in the version of Futura as used today are actually closer to their Fraktur equivalents. The \"ball and post\" r is ambiguous: where you see Gothic, I see Bodoni. In any case, Renner's stated aim with r, as well as with m and n, was to make these characters more static, to eliminate any horizontal movement which Renner considered an obsolete remnant of writing by pen. While this worked to some extent with the t (although that character in Futura is still a bit of a show-stopper inside words), it did not work out with those other characters, so Renner grudgingly had to make them more conventional. The only thing that bugs me in this context is the h. It is clear from your account that, while Renner was experimenting with an angular m and n, the h had a rounded edge from the beginning. Maybe Renner thought that the long stem on the left made the h sufficiently static anyway. Or one might argue that Renner was thinking in blackletter, where the designs of h and n are not necessarily based on each other, which would of course be another argument in favour of your theory. Where I think you are right and where Renner may to some extent have sold out to international marketability was in the inclusion of an oblique, as an afterthought as it were. On the other hand, I don't think the fact that there was originally no plan for an italic necessarily had to do with German peculiarities - if you try to design from elementary principles of typography, as Renner did, you would not necessarily want to emulate the relationship between roman and italic, which is just an historical accident.\n\nThe spelling of your German quotations and book titles would, I'm afraid, require quite a bit of retouching, but the most grievous point is the fact that the name \"Mergenthaler\" is consistently misspelt \"Merganthaler\", even in a quotation where I suspect it might have been correct in the original. Of course, this stuff is trivial in itself but it tends to distract the reader. I confess that the occasional use of the word \"Teutonic\" as a synonym for \"German\" also grates a little on my nerves. I also stumbled over the term \"Bruchschriften\" for blackletter which sounds a little derogatory to me, similar to \"Bruchbude\" or \"Bruchpilot\". You've probably got it somewhere from the contemporary literature, I expect, but the more usual German term these days would be \"gebrochene Schriften\". \"Wortbild\" is not a play on \"Wortbildung\" but just the standard German term for word shape. Where I think you are seriously inaccurate is in some of your claims on Nazi Germany. It is an oversimplification to claim that \"Futura was effectively banned from wide use in Germany\" after 1933, or even that \"on their accession to power in 1933, the Nazi party effectively banned roman type from German printing\". It seems that Futura continued to be quite popular under the Nazis, particularly for technical applications. Only the other day, I saw one of those famous Enigma machines in a museum here in Berlin which had a printed sheet of instructions for use affixed to the inside of its wooden lid - no prizes for guessing what typeface those instructions were set in. I think other examples would be easy to find. The fact that Futura, presumably to Renner's chagrin, wasn't used much for books may have had other reasons than a boycott by the Nazis. Similarly, to talk of \"the post World War II silence that surrounded anyone who remained in Nazi Germany by choice\" is inaccurate. The people who had a hard time after the war generally were the emigrants who returned, not the vast majority who had stayed. Renner's book on colour, published after the war, was apparently quite popular and an English translation was published in the US - maybe his interests had to some extent shifted from typography to painting. I do not think that in Renner's case there was any serious suggestion that he was tainted by collaboration with the Nazis - quite the opposite. And to suggest that he somehow had problems after the war because he was a \"handsome, blue-eyed 'Aryan' male\" is simply inappropriate - I do not see how this description of Renner's physical features advances your argument.\n\nBut anyway, these are just minor quibbles with what is otherwise excellent work - so once again, well done, Charles, and I'm just looking forward to seeing your work in German!\n\n"

      "content": "Christopher  \nThank you for a thorough and just critique.  \nMy overstatement of the separation of German and Latin typographic practice derives from my own discovery that I had presumed that German typographic practice was dependant on English practice. I remain very much struck by the assignment of particular forms–roman, fraktur, schwabacher–to particular roles in German book publishing, as well as by the lack of cross-mixture of roman and italic in German books of the era. The only occurrence of the oblique version of Futura in any of Renner's books on typography occurs in the setting of his name on the title page of _Die Kunst der Typographie._ The most stunning example is the difference in appearance between _Typografie als Kunst_ and _Mechanisierte Grafik_. I am working on a revision that does a better job of demonstrating how Renner's selection of Unger fraktur as the font for the 1922 book provides an insight on Renner's perception that Unger's integration of German form and French neo-classic style provided an example for the emergence of a new kind of script for German book publishing, one that was just over 100 years old at the time of _Typografie als Kunst._  \nI used the word \"bruchschrift\" on the advice of a German epigraphic scholar, but thank you for suggesting more contemporary alternatives.  \nThe reference to the \"post WW II silence\" was made in terms of Renner's isolation from the history of design as written and taught in England and the United States after world War II.  \nThe point about Renner's appearance was more to explain why he had less trouble than he did after his contretemps with the Nazis in 1933. That comment was all that was left after an edit that removed accompanying information about his Northern-German protestant background, but I certainly apologize for any offence.  \nAgain, thank you for the feedback and I will certainly recheck the German spellings.\n\n"

This is why Hitler's decisions to militarize Rhine Area again, to reintegrate Austria, to stop the payments of the Versaille's contract got an acclamation of the german population. Germany did not want to be integrated wherever. All european nations were stand-alone national thinking ones. Germany wanted to take its place in Europe and the world of the \"big nations\".

What the purist modernists, as Tschichold was prior to 1933- 36, called for was neutrality of voice, transparency of identity, sublimation of individual aspiration to the continuity of the community. It is very helpful to remember that Jan Tschichold was not really very supportive of Futura before the NSDAP electoral victory in 1933. In other words, he didn't like Futura very much before the excesses of absolutist dictates became apparent. I suspect that he didn't like Futura in 1932 because it called too much attention to its style when what he wanted then were visually neutral typefaces, and in 1948 because it was to dismissive of historical features that he had subsequently come to appreciate.

      "content": "_What was new seing it from 1925?_\n\nPaul Renner was an artist, book designer, and educator who also wrote, spoke, and organized/agitated.\n\nLike many people everywhere at the time, including the same-age Erbar and the much younger Tschichold, he started out an historicist and got modernism in the mid 1920s. (Historicism had been the progressive graphic movement since the turn of the century, with the influence of Morris and the private press movement.) But he wasn't the only 1920s designer to have a go at designing a sans; Goudy even preceded him. Renner described Futura as a \"typeface of our time\", not \"of our country\" or \"of our world\"; being up to date was important to him:\n\n_\"For the Modern is an idea, an unending task, never to be entirely resolved. We seek it on a narrow ridge, which drops away on one side into thoughtlessly adopted convention and on the other side into the modish, which is mostly a somewhat foppish exaggeration of the Modern at any one time. This ridge is no comfortable middle way._   \n--1947, quoted from Christopher Burke's _Paul Renner_\n\nHistoricism was the modern thing to do in the first two decades of the 20th century, and the Arts and Crafts movement, which Renner participated in professionally as a book designer, did provide some of the formal and theoretical underpinnings of Modernism.\n\nSo there is nothing particularly Germanic about Renner's modernist \"renewal\" (as Burke calls it), except that Weimar was a hotbed of turmoil and polarization, with artists from many countries converging on the scene there, so it did provide a cauldron of creativity that produced extreme results, and Modernism was nothing if not extreme. So when he decided to construct a modern, geometric, reductive typeface, Renner took it all the way, and rationalized its appropriateness for the German language, arguing that the Carolignian script, basis of the humanist alphabet, was in fact Germanic, because Charlemagne was Karl the Great, and fraktur was a later French bastardization of the script.\n\nSo the geometric minimalism of Futura, in comparison to other sans faces of the era, was due to:\n\n- The culture of extremism in Weimar. The geographical location of Weimar, between Constructivism in the Soviet Union, and De Stijl in the Netherlands, provided an apt center for the development of modernist graphic design, with Gropius' post-1923 concept of the Bauhaus providing a symbolic and social focus. However, in the same German environment, the Erbar sans and Kabel were not solely dependent for their modernity on looking as machine-made and simple as possible, but addressed and defined other qualities.\n\n- Renner's background as an artist and intellectual, and being a member of that social set, provided an awareness of reductive modernism in art and theories such as Purism, and a sympathy for it.\n\n- Renner's considerable professional status: in his late 40s when he designed Futura, he was a man with a solid track record in graphic design and education, and no doubt significant _gravitas_ in person--these qualities meant that the folk at Bauer took his weird geometric experiment seriously, and were prepared to spend many years working on it, and with him, to make it commercially viable. In comparison, neither Bayer's universal alphabet, nor Tschichold's unicase made it into type. Gill Sans benefited from a similar provenance and sponsorship. Kabel too, must have been a no-brainer for Klingspor, given that it was the \"skeletal\" derivative of the already successful Koch Antiqua.\n\nUltimately, all type faces are type styles, and what comes first is something purely visual and crafted, rationalized _post fact_, not before. Really, in terms of genesis, the \"modernistic\" Benton and Hess face Broadway is not that much different from Futura: proceeding from reductive majuscule signage lettering, a matching lowercase adheres to the same strict formality.\n\nOf course, historical contingency does play a part in shaping types, because every designer lives somewhere, sometime. But it is not a direct influence in a way that gives type forms inherent moral or political qualities--which is the association that people often look for, especially with Nazi-era DIN and Futura. The letters are just shapes, after all. Contingency means how a designer carves out a living, with the successful work being economically practical, and commensurate with the physicality of how he draws and designs for media.\n\nFor some reason, Renner was able to excise the trace of the hand from Futura in a way that other 1920s sans serif type designers were not, or didn't want to. At the time, his cultural environment fostered that--but it was the same German environment that nourished the more mannered though no less modern sans serifs of Jakob Erbar and Rudolf Koch.\n\nThe modernity of 20th century sans serif faces is not quite so epochal as the modernity of contemporary art. The sans serif had been invented 100 years earlier, and in continuous usage. It was standard practice for successful type designers to work in many genres, including sans. For this reason, one should be wary of borrowing historical contingencies from other fields of art and design and applying them to type. Should not Morris Benton, the author of News Gothic in 1908, inventor of the sans/serif megafamily Clearface, the ultralight Lightline Gothic, the geometric Bank Gothic, the reductive Broadway, the socially-committed Century Schoolbook, &c., &c., be considered a modernist?\n\n_My contention is that the two are basically cut from the same cloth—Arts & Crafts lettering._\n\nI don't think so. The idealized geometric shapes of Futura are a completley new and opposite concept to the hand-made quality of Arts & Crafts and Gill Sans. In type, such plain geometry demonstrated the smooth machine finish, becoming at that time symbolic of functionalism. This was the change that Gropius instituted at the Bauhaus in 1923, and what distinguishes the bent steel tube chairs of Breuer from the bent wood chairs of Thonet.\n\n_...he opted for the more stringent standard, not for aesthetic effect but because of a drive to be theoretically consistent._\n\nDesign isn't either/or, it's both/and. The goal is to make something work well and look good, which involves resolving conflicting criteria. It's hard to marry theory and style, to satisfy both masters, to walk the narrow ridge, but Renner and Bauer pulled it off with Futura, creating a design that fused and transcended style and theory.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick thank you for your thorough critique. It is very helpful.  \n_The idealized geometric shapes of Futura are a completely new and opposite concept to the hand-made quality of Arts & Crafts and Gill Sans._  \nI think that Renner was less a modernist than someone who came up in the arts and crafts movement and was trying to reconcile his life experience and book designing expertise with modernism as it was consolidated from all the other \"isms\" of the early Weimar republic. He held this view into the thirties. In 1931 he wrote: \"It [the book trade] owes its recovery much more to the revival of the old craft than to constructivists and Dadists.\"\n\nThere are two aspects to Futura's geometry. The first is embodied in the form and the second is a result of its visual austerity.\n\nAs to the first, Renner wrote in 1922 that 'the inscriptional Roman capital which stands at the head of European scripts is composed of triangle, circle and square.'\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125013521im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quote1_4575.jpg)\n\nHe uses this quote from _Typografie als Kunst_ twice for proofs of Futura. The first instance is in the sample he prepared for Ehmcke's 1925 book on new German type\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125013521im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quote2_4263.jpg)\n\nand the second is from December 1927, after the initial release of the face.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125013521im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quote3_3768.jpg)\n\nRenner didn't set out to rationalize the upper and lower case alphabets by drawing them geometrically. The geometry was already there in the system of proportions based on the relationship between the circle and the square. This point was also made by Edward Johnston, Rudolph Koch, and Rudolph von Larisch. Before World War I, Renner derived his instructional method for lettering from contact with Johnston's student Anna Simons. His brief description of starting Futura includes mention that he started out, 'just as he has his students do.'\n\nWhat he did do, with the assistance of his former student and Bauer employee, Heinrich Jost was strip away any artifacts of the hand.\n\nHis view that \"[Variation in stroke thickness], which script took from the wide-cut nib, are, like all other handwritten elements, not necessary components of these language marks,\" was modified by the work of Heinrich Jost. Jost apparently convinced him that a tapering reduction in stroke weight where bowls join stems wasn't an effect of the pen, but a necessary optical correction. While Jost was a student in the school Renner directed before World War I, Renner had employed Hans Cornelius to teach his students about the physiology of sight. The untapered perpendicular joins of the bottom of the b and d to their respective stems is sometimes cited as an example of the calligraphic, non-geometric quality of Gill Sans.\n\nThe key to this insistence on austerity and removing traces of the hand doesn't lie in attitudes about constructivism and the modern. It is revealed in Renner's discussion of Edgar Dacqué's primalist theories. Here's an example. \"… fraktur is not actually of German origin. It is the last ornate offshoot of Gothic scripts…\". The key words are \"last ornate offshoot.\" Dacqué held that all creatures that had ever evolved had within them a primal human _germ_ that acted as a generative force. In different eras different species developed. These species failed to achieve ideal form because they were conditioned and limited by the environment in which they emerged. Because of these limits these branchings were ultimately dead-ends that could never achieve the ideal form \"sought\" by the primal force. Renner applied Dacqué's idea to the history of European scripts. So when letters are created in a time of wide-nibs, they fail to achieve their ideal form because of the limitations of the tool that physically define them.\n\nTo be true to his own time and best express the primal letter, he believed that Futura could exhibit no artifacts of other eras.\n\n"

Subsequently, he produced two more types, Ballade, a busy \"broad-nibbed\" gothic (blackletter) style, and the extremely chirographic Renner Antiqua.\n\nSo it seems to me that Dacqué's theory is a rationalization for what Renner wanted to realize in modernist times, and when the bloom was off that rose, he moved on to produce a fully-fledged gothic and an Antiqua.\n\nAs he abandoned Dacqué's theory after his modernist fling, this indicates that his relationship with modernism was the driving force in Futura's monoline simplicity.\n\nHowever, it could be argued that Ballade and Renner Antiqua are attempts to redeem the wide-nibbed letter, firstly by giving a gothic style significant roman letterforms (Ballade), and secondly, vice versa, by \"gothicizing\" his Antiqua, a condensed, squarish, profusely serifed type.\n\nIf he were so dedicated to theory, and the commitment to produce types true to his own time, why would he embrace less ideal type-forms that were notably anachronistic? Perhaps he wearied of fashion, and could no longer deny the feel of the broad-nibbed pen in his hand.\n\n"

Worse, appropriation of obvious historical authority obscures the true nature of fonts that, like Futura, have their own clearly discernable historical antecedants but access them in ways not in agreement with the \"official party line.\"</cite>\n\n(Annoyed John Cleese voice:) _Appropriation of historical authority?_\n\nWouldn't it be enough to say that humanist miniscule looked nice, and people were used to it, and it was readable, and so when Nicholas Jenson started from that, but made something more harmonious with the Roman capitals than rotunda, it looked nice, and people liked it - and so, even today, while type designers do try to express their own originality and creativity too, when they're making a design intended for practical use, they make one that's similar to what people already like and are used to.\n\nWith respect to your thesis rather than your posting, although the specifically German influence on Futura does generally go unmentioned in histories of printing types, in histories of typography in general (that is, the use of types as well as their design) the Weimar Republic and Bauhaus and all that figure rather prominently. After all, the other major geometric sans-serif is Kabel.\n\nThus, rather than looking for complicated reasons, I suspect that historians of printing types simply go with Italian: Jenson; French: Garamond; Dutch: Elzevir; English: Caslon... and then, what with Didot being French, and Bodoni being Italian, they just throw up their hands and proclaim that type design became international from then on.\n\nOn the other hand, as I progress further into your thesis, I find it eminently sensible to suspect that Paul Renner's reason for not leaving Germany was because of his age - and that any left-wing politics associated with the Weimar period that may have influenced the design of Futura would have been an embarrassment to be passed over in silence as Futura graced advertising copy in post-war America.\n\nI just wouldn't have felt it necessary to slag Times Roman for paying homage to Caslon. Kowtowing to an authoritarian political model? Given that British history, despite the unpleasantness of the Industrial Revolution, went as well as it did because nonsense like the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon or Mussolini happened over there rather than in Britain, many people in Britain quite legitimately felt there was something to be said for respecting authority.\n\nIn short, I think your problem is that you're the sort of person that prefers other kinds of novels to _The Lord of the Rings_.\n\n"
