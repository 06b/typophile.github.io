  "content": "I'm currently wondering how Google manages to make Roboto look pretty much exactly the same on different browsers. If you're wondering, have a look at it in Firefox, and then a webkit browser like Chrome:\n\n[http://www.google.com/nexus/4/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140528010358/http:/www.google.com/nexus/4/ \"http://www.google.com/nexus/4/\")\n\nNow, here's a comparison to what it looks like on a test page I've set up:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140528010358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/web-font-differences_4183.png)\n\nThe rendering in Safari makes the font unusable. So the question is:\n\n**How does Google do it?** It seems like I'm missing something? At first I thought they might be serving different fonts, but I've checked, and they are identical. I feel like I'm missing something?\n\nAny insights are greatly appreciated!\n\n",

Sorry for breaking the layout with that image, I didn't check and thought it was \\<600px wide.\n\n**Problem solved:** I just realized that a webkit style was disabling subpixel antialiasing, which made the fonts appear much thinner compared to how they were rendered with subpixel antialiasing in non-webkit browser.\n\n"
