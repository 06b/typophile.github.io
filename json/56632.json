Checkout the original one at [www.kibehouse.com.br](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204141351/http:/www.kibehouse.com.br/ \"www.kibehouse.com.br\") I tried keep the most critical element that were in the original design. Maybe cheese, mustard, yellow toungue or, whatever you associate with fastfood.\n\nThanks for your comments.\n\n"

But I still think the tongue needs to be solved first.\n\n"
