I think the small radiused corners are from a bad screenprinting job rather than by design.

I suspect it’s something that someone has mangled and tortured. I was thinking that it might have been originally a condensed black of some font that has been super s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d (hence the weird weight differences). But thanks anyway!\n\n"

Strangely, the ’3’ proportions changed to be more symmetrical at that weight — something I hadn’t noticed before in Avant Garde.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
