An OTF file is not a font family, it's a single font.\n\nThere is a small workaround for 'family-aware' fonts, with the 'size' feature, but that has been poorly constructed and has led to errors in the past. Besides, no application supports it (perhaps InDesign CS4 does). Besides #2, you cannot add it with FontLab, you would need ADFKO for that.\n\n<cite>ps. what unicodes do i use for alternate characters?</cite>\n\nYou may think of anything. A rule of thumb I have seen in Adobe fonts is to let the user choose between selecting an alternate for a character (such as ornaments found under the bullet), and have it as alternate for 'regular' characters (i.e., 'A' is ornament #1, 'B' for ornament #2), but that option seems to be outdated already.\n\nUsing Unicodes in the private area would be okay, I guess.\n\n"

      "content": "_how do you export a font with several families? at the moment i’ve got seperate fontlab files for regular/bold, but how do i combine them into one .otf?_\n\nAs Theunis points out, you can't make a single OTF file with several fonts in it, but, depending on the way you set up the name fields in your fonts, you can create associations between them so they show up in programs as one family. (See [Font Naming](http://web.archive.org/web/20140411212921/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Naming) in the TypoWiki.)\n\n_follow-up question: in file menu, what’s the difference between  \n– generate font  \n– generate all  \n– generate suitcase  \n?_\n\nGenerate Font: Generates a single TTF or OTF font file. (Some other formats, too, but mainly it's used for those.)\n\nGenerate All: Same as Generate Font, except for multiple fonts at one time. Can include all fonts that are open in FontLab or just some of them.\n\nGenerate Suitcase: For making old style Mac PostScript and TrueType fonts. These only work on Macs.\n\n_ps. what unicodes do i use for alternate characters?_\n\nThese should either be left unencoded (no Unicode number) or given Private Use Area (E000-F8FF) codes. There are no standards for this area by definition, so you can use them any way you want. They will be unlikely to match glyphs in other fonts that use the PUA, but that's the nature of PUA. Adobe and other recommend not encoding alternate characters, but there are some reasons for doing so.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>... if it’s un-coded ...</cite>\n\nIn addition to Jens, OpenType features are not Unicode dependent; they work with 'raw glyphs' instead. But assigning Unicodes to the alternates has the advantage they are visible and can be entered into non-OpenType aware applications. Also, you can use Unicode characters in the InDesign Search & Replace fields, but non-encoded glyphs have to be searched and replaced with the Search For Glyphs (CS3+) function (which does that and nothing more).\n\n<cite>Adobe and other recommend not encoding alternate characters, but there are some reasons for doing so.</cite>\n\nFont switching is one, but it's hardly a valid point if you're talking about manually selected alternates. Any more? I remember the original Adobe specification of assigning 'regular' characters to ornaments using aalt (? memory) was removed somewhere in time.\n\n"
