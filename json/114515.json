  "content": "Greetings, all -  \nDoing a redesign of some corporate collateral, and looking for a nice Humanist sans with a full family of weights (especially condensed). In the past, Myriad has been used, but I'd like to find something different. In the design process so far, we're considering Meta Serif as our body text (that too, is open to suggestion), but are not quite sold on pairing that with it's Sans brethren.\n\nYour thoughts most appreciated...\n\n",
