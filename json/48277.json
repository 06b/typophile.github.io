  "content": "I've been working on a script font with tons of contextual code including calt and clig features as well as several SS features. It has CE language support so I finally decided to do the class based kerning for all of that. I had the classes widows only showing kern classes while I was working to make it easier to handle. In order to preview my kerning in the OT preview I selected generate kern feature. When I compiled it said \"fatal error\" and listed the first instance of a OT class. I went back to the classes panel to find out FL had deleted all my OT classes.  \nIs there a way to recover my OT classes? Did this happen from selecting the kern classes at the bottom of the panel (on Mac version) or is this some particular bug in the system?\n\nAny help greatly appreciated.  \nStephen\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks Nick,  \nI've added so many glyphs its probably just as well to redo the classes. I went through the feature code and made a list of my OT classes by name. Since I didn't have fractions and such, I only needed 6 OT classes, so I think if I have a bit of patience I can reconstruct them reasonably quick. I will make note of that bug.\n\n"

I will remember not to mess with that again. In my case it was hitting generate kern feature while only kern was showing that caused the drop of OT features.\n\nLesson learned.\n\n"
