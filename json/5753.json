Tempo is just similar.   \n   \nI doubt if you can match the 57 without a lot of outline manipulation to an existing font. You are better off scanning it.   \n   \nThe script is pretty similar to an old Berthold script called Houston BQ (see below), which I cannot find at Berthold any more, or anywhere else on the web right now. This sample from my Script Font ID Guide was provided for me, by another font collector.   \n ![Houston BQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144116im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41357.gif)\n\n"
