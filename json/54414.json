  "content": "Hey everyone just a quick question here that I'm sure will be easy for all the typophiles...\n\nim currently working on a DVD for a production of Grease (which is set during the late 50s early 60s depending on who you ask) and being the nerd that I am I want to ensure that all the typography is Period sensitive.\n\nI know that Futura was around and Was planning on setting stuff in this but its a bit plain/boring/just plain not wild about the font. I was just curious as to what other fonts were around at the time?\n\nThe current design uses Futura for the chapter text (which is somewhat hard to read at such small sizes) and I was using the Tiki Script font from House Industries (I know its a recent font but it looked \"of the period\").\n\nAny other suggestions for fonts FROM the era (or at least that look of the period).\n\nThanks very much.\n\n",

If this is for things in the video, I suggest that you look at old advertisements and other documents.\n\nWhile you shouldn't use a more recent font, you're quite likely to find older fonts that were frequently used in a certain way in the 50s and 60s.\n\nI unfortunately don't really know anything about Grease, so I won't give any more specific suggestions.\n\n"

Either way you guys have been a big help.\n\nI wouldn't want to commit the typographic crime of using non-period appropriate fonts.\n\nI'm thinking something along these lines:  \n [http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit/viewfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221091244/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit/viewfonts \"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit/viewfonts\")\n\n"
