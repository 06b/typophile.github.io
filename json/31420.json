  "content": "Hi there :)\n\nI was hoping anyone here could help me identify a font my client wants to use for a horror show. The font looks sort of satanic. The capital letter \"S\" has a devilish tail attached at the bottom, the \"t\" looks like a tall catholic cross, and the \"o\" has a cross inside it. The lower case \"i\" appears in two different hights.\n\nAny help would be tremendously appreciated! Thanks, Tanya\n\nPS If anyone can recommend another satanic/devilish type font, that would be great too!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140513182346im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SatanicFont_4675.jpeg)\n\n",
