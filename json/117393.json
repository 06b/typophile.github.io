The [Berthold version](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143813/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/bodoni-bq) could be the closest. [URW](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725143813/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/urw-bodoni) is close too (and far cheaper ~15$).\n\nEDIT: Bob confirmed Berthold Bodoni Bold. I wish you had US$ 250 (only sold as complete family)...\n\n"
