  "content": "This is my second attempt at typeface-drawing. I have no typographical education, so this is a didactic project rather than a typeface intended for actual use – I'm just trying to learn the basics of type design through self-study and experimentation. That's why I've chosen the renaissance model for the letters, and that's why this is intentionally not a very original design – and probably a very untrendy one.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schola_5204.jpg)\n  \nIt's a very constructed typeface, the proportions of the O and the o are used as a template for almost everything, except for the numerals, which are built from the lower and upper case zeros. (The lining numerals are intentionally upper case in height, I know this is wrong, but I want them to be used exlusively with upper case, not as tabular figures.) \n\nThis typeface is intended for nine or ten points, I will make several versions adjusted for larger sizes (and probably one smaller size) when I'm done with this base design. No small caps yet, and I've just started drawing the italics. That's ... difficult.\n\nI'd be very grateful for any kind of criticism. I really want to learn.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [schola.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/typophile.com/files/schola.pdf) | 177.08 KB |\n| [schola\\_210309\\_mod.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/typophile.com/files/schola_210309_mod.pdf) | 169.49 KB |\n| [text.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/typophile.com/files/text_0.pdf) | 44.87 KB |\n| [schola\\_220309\\_update.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/typophile.com/files/schola_220309_update.pdf) | 177.31 KB |\n| [schola maior.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/typophile.com/files/schola%20maior.pdf) | 184.71 KB |\n\n",

The last y does look better than the one you initially made as a toned down version of the first one.\n\nI also think the serifs might be a bit short? They are sufficiently thick, but they're not really pronounced. It's a question of course whether or not you _want_ them to be pronounced, but it's something to think about.\n\nAnd is this a regular weight? If so, I think it's too heavy.

I'll make a revision as soon as I'm home from work.\n\nThe serifs are intentionally rather short, I think that's appropriate for a typeface in this style. Van den Velde's English No.28, scanned by John Hudson in [this post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/typophile.com/node/8800) was my initial inspiration, but I realise I've made my serifs even shorter. Perhaps they need a few more units, I'll make some tests. Do you think I should make the ascender serifs more uniform, by the way?\n\nAbout the darkness: Yes, this is supposed to be the regular weight, I don't think there will be any other weights. I'm going for Dutch style darkness, like the beautiful but ridiculously expensive [Renard](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/) from Enschedé.

      "content": "I love it. I wouldn't worry too much about the bumpiness of the outlines - in this case, I think they add to the character of the face. Zeno was similar in this way.\n\nSome detailed thoughts, which you can take or leave.\n\nI think the tail of the 'a' comes up too close to the main stem. That tends to look okay up close, but in very small sizes it gets muddy. The 'c' is top-heavy - it's okay for it to lean forward a bit (that's true to the Jenson/Aldus/Garamond model), but I think the tail could come out a little more. I think the center stroke of the 's' could be less vertical (the capital doesn't have this problem). Also take another look at Jenson's original here - he thins it slightly in the center, so it's not a fat blob. The left serif of the 'u' could be heavier (and also, in the traditional model, more horizontal - it doesn't match the 'n'). Your 'z's have inconsistent chirography - in the lowercase, it looks like you've tried to follow the pen, but in the uppercase, the more traditional weight distribution. I would choose one or the other, likely the latter.\n\nI want to see some text settings to see how the short serifs on vwx work out. When paired with rounds (vo etc) they might create too much openness, but perhaps kerning can help with that.\n\nSerifs on 'EF' look heavy to me, and don't really fit with the rest of the font (I see you've done something more delicate with 'Z'). Why the spur on the 'J'? Center point of 'M' seems too far to the right. Bottom of 'U' is too round, I'd have just a little more straight (especially noticeable on the right).\n\n3 leans a bit to the left. I find the open 8 distracting. Ampersand is not quite as delicious as the rest of the font - I don't really like the long straight diagonal. Traditional '@' construction is thin on the right side curve. I'd put a little more weight on the curly brace. Question mark has a nice shape but looks too soft and low-fi - maybe just a bit more stroke contrast.\n\nI'm seeing lots of good attention to detail here - I think it'll be a great font when it's finished.\n\n"

I've also made slanted legs for the M, and tweaked its proportions a bit, as you can see. I've done some minor changes to the question mark, following Raph's advice, but I've retained its \"toothpastey\" quality.\n\nRaph, thanks again for your invaluable assistance, I've followed most of your suggestions, as you can see. I've made a more conventional ampersand, but I've kept the other one as an alternative glyph. I'm not sure I understood what you meant regarding the at sign, but I've fattened up the SW curve. Does it look better to you?\n\nAbout that strange J: I saw that glyph in a dream, and I thought I'd try it. Obviously, the spur is related to that wonderfully weird trademark l in the [Romain du Roi](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841/http:/www.opto.fr/resources/romain-du-roi-epreuve-des-caracteres-de-imprimerie-royale-1760). I'll keep it as an alternative glyph, and make a normal J for use in the waking world.\n\nI think I'll keep that fat lowercase z, it's probably my favourite glyph. For some reason, I like the z to stand out a little in a typeface. I'm not really satisfied with the upper case Z, though.\n\nI've added a pdf showing the altered glyphs to the original post.\n\nI'll upload some text setting examples later today.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schola_210309_mod_6067.png)\n\n"

I'm a great believer in optical scaling, I think it's a shame that so few typefaces featuring this is available, and most of them have only a text and a display version.

There's a huge difference between type intended for eight points and ten points. Also, I think the serif length question you brought up will be solved, they will become more pronounced in the larger optical sizes, as you can see in the 12-point mock-up.\n\n"

Do you think I should make jollier asterisks and daggers?\n\nI really want to keep that question mark, and I belive it's not that out of character, look at Adobe's Jenson or Garamond Premier Pro.\n\nI'm sorry about mixing terms, Eliason, it's kind of difficult keeping track of nomenclature when you think in one language and write in another. What kind of section mark do you think would be right for this face?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417154841im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schola_220309_mod_3536.png)\n\n"

Maybe there's just a little too much modulation of thickness in the strokes. I might just try thickening the thins (particularly the inside stroke where it joins the other at the very top and bottom).\n\nChanges you show just above are all for the better, IMO.\n\n"

I think the contrast of two somewhat opposite qualities should generally be within each glyph rather than between different glyphs. This could mean for example soft counter forms and hard outer forms (or vice versa) throughout the face.\n\nI think it's good that the whole thing is pretty crisp, considering the weight. An oldstyle face with too much softness can end up looking like typical bold cuts or nostalgic ink-spread imitation. The narrow serifs are also good since they bring some delicacy to compete with the robustness.\n\nThe daggers look fine next to the A-Z & a-z. If you want more contrast or tension of different forms, maybe emphasize both the roundness and the sharpness at the same time (like Garamond & Caslon).\n\n"

Lucky accident, really.\n\nThank you for your feedback, Juhani, seems like I misunderstood your advice, though I think my new punctuation is better than the old one. Yes, I like that tension idea you're talking about, and there will be more of it in the larger cuts of this typeface (I'm planning a 10 point, 12 point, 18 point and 72 point version, this is the 8 point cut). I think too much sharpness and tension at eight points is a little wasted. I agree on your view of soft revivals, though they may look nice on the right paper, they all too often turn into their own parodies. I'm sure Baskerville or Bodoni or Fleischmann would have embraced the crispness of modern technology, and designed their faces in accordance.\n\n"

I'm new to this forum, so I have noe idea of your reputation. :-)\n\nYou're right, of course, the making of this typeface has turned into an obsession, now I _really_ have to leave it for a while, to regain some perspective. But I can't. I don't think I'll make other weights, though, at least not for this small size-cut. But I'll make an italic, of course, and small caps. I'm also considering a gothic based on its skeleton, which will have several weights. But that's future stuff. Boy, I wish I could spend all my energy on this instead of working.\n\n"
