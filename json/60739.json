  "content": "Can anybody offer some advice?\n\nI want to buy Elzevir - expensive but so good! I am not sure whether to buy the Book or Regular - can't buy both. The bookis slightly heavier, and apparently more akin to how regular would have looked during the days of foundry type.\n\nThe pdf shows both variants, both look excellent, and I just cannot make up my mind.\n\nmy use for it is for body text, letters, documents etc\n\nAnyone have any thoughts!\n\nJohn\n\n",
