Crewdson created the popular blog [Lines and Splines](http://web.archive.org/web/20120614032512/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lines%20and%20Splines) and later replaced it with [New Series](http://web.archive.org/web/20120614032512/http:/typophile.com/wiki/New%20Series). He has been noticeably absent from typographic discussion and publishing since 2003, a fact bemoaned almost yearly with cries of \"Whatever happened to Andy Crewdson?\" on all the type blogs and forums.\n\n**Discussion**  \n [Typophile Threads](http://web.archive.org/web/20120614032512/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com+crewdson)  \n [Typographica Posts](http://web.archive.org/web/20120614032512/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site:typographica.org+crewdson)\n\n**External Links**  \n [Interview on _The Morning News_](http://web.archive.org/web/20120614032512/http:/www.themorningnews.org/archives/personalities/andy_crewdson_of_lines_splines.php) (2000)  \n [Writing on Typotheque.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120614032512/http:/www.typotheque.com/authors/andy_crewdson/) (2002-03)\n\n",
