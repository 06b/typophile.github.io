[Vitesse](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822050725/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100036) is a retail font distributed by Hoefler & Frere-Jones type foundry. It's not a free font and you have to buy it through their [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822050725/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_styles.php?productLineID=100036). Though, on their website you cannot order just the bold weight, however I believe that they are reasonable people and if you really need the font you could [contact them](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822050725/http:/www.typography.com/ask/faq.php#Ft_11) with your enquires. Good luck!\n\n"
