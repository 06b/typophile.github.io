  "content": "Tangle is a fun font which I drew by hand to have the look of twining vines, reminiscent of a grape arbor in the winter. The inspiration is from my front gate which is twined with an endless tangle of mustang grape vines. It was designed on a whim, but turned out pretty well. It has a full upper and lower case character set, plus numbers and punctuation and special characters. Maybe some clever vintner will notice it and put it to use on a wine label. You can try out the free demo version of Tangle for either [MacOS](http://web.archive.org/web/20130609215835/http:/www.ragnarokpress.com/scriptorium/tangledemo.sit) or [Windows](http://web.archive.org/web/20130609215835/http:/www.ragnarokpress.com/scriptorium/tangledemo.zip). It features just the upper case characters. The full version of Tangle is available on our [Ordering Site](http://web.archive.org/web/20130609215835/http:/www.fontcraft.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=tangle).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130609215835im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tanglemf_4093.jpg)\n\n",
