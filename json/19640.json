      "content": "Well, if no one else is going to come around, I'll bounce some things back to ye. I'll say I like this quite a bunch. It has character, for sure. My humble opinion:  \nMaybe lower A bar  \nMaybe take middle of B higher  \nMaybe extend bar on EF a little  \nBar of G doesn't go  \nJ terminal needs something  \nMaybe take point of M down a bit  \nQ could do with more equilibrium, maybe center that tail under the O form (...I might like it if I could see it next to a U)  \nS too small on top  \nV and W bottom serifs ought to be bracketed  \nY too thin at confluence  \nI could see this, like, engraved onto a wooden sign outside of a quaint family restaurant or motel, or maybe on the cover of a book I'd like to read.... Don't normalize it too much--keep some of the seemingly odd proportions--because that's where the charm comes from.  \nCheers  \nNathanael\n\n"

      "content": "Yea great comments. To add on...from an aestheitc aspect...The C and G is too funky. Doesnt fit in well. The S isnt balanced properly. I would open the top aperture up more and push it to the left. The crossbar on the E anf F can be a little longer. Also the crosspointon the X can be lower (reminds me of Steve Urkel pants). The tail on the Q seems out of place because the design is so classical. And it looks like its barely hanging on. But your consistency is nice. I like where its headed.\n\n"
