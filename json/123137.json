I've also tried searching manually.\n\nThe key factors I was using to try and identify this font are the slight right slant, extended crossing to the lowercase 't', and how the 'n' is written with spaced out \"humps\".\n\nAny help would be greatly appriciated!\n\nThanks,  \n-Will\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073320im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Font3b_4557.JPG)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Font3b.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073320/http:/typophile.com/files/Font3b.JPG) | 10.53 KB |\n\n",
