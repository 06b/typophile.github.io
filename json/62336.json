  "content": "Hey guys\n\nI've been working on my logo for ages now and finally I'm on to the next step of typesetting my collateral and portfolio items.\n\nWhat I have so far is based on a 10 pt grid and am pairing frutiger with baskerville. I'm ok with it for now but I can't help to think that my judegement might be a bit off as I've been working on DHL projects for so long now and what they have is pretty similar. Their set in frutiger and minion.\n\nWas hoping if y'all could help in giving me some constructive criticism on how I can improve it.\n\nI'm looking for a really clean and serious look. I've gone down the fun path in the past but it was hard to get clients to take me seriously.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417055936im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typography_5756.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [typography.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417055936/http:/typophile.com/files/typography.jpg) | 146.79 KB |\n\n",
