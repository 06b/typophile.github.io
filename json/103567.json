This font had its genesis in a logo sketch for the Anaheim Angels baseball team—thus its name.  \nType purists may be appalled by the lack of adherence to traditional forms, but the font should be seen as only “in the spirit of” blackletter, and attempting something that hasn’t been seen or done before—something that feels traditional, yet at the same time fresh and perhaps unexpected.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2-DA_Header_5479.png)\n\nDark Angel can be purchased in its regular solid form, or as Dark Angel Underlight—a handtooled font. If these two fonts are purchased together, the Family package will contain a third font—Dark Angel Highlight. With this font layered over the basic font, you can achieve two–color typesetting when the highlight and the base font are assigned two different colors.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3-DA_3Fonts_5571.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4-DieYoung_3979.png)\n  \nWith Stylistic Alternates you can go either “Plain” or “Fancy”, changing the look of your copy to suit your needs. Compare the two samples below. Some characters have multiple alternates.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/5-Plain_Fancy_5122.png)\n  \nAnd furthermore…  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/6-LCswashes_4997.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/7-Special_3566.png)\n  \nDark Angel has enough language support to make the builders of Babel envious—its 1,163 glyphs can be used to set copy in 59 different languages.
