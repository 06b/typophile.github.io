  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’ve been working on a typeface family inspired by different cuts of Kis types. It’s no revival, but I thought I give credit where credit’s due.  \nRight now I’m doing some research into Kis’ connections with Sweden (I’ve found correspondence that shows he sold type 1686/1687 to Swedish printers).  \nThere are a few articles in Swedish that refers to parts of his autobiography, thus far I’ve found two misspellings (one is repeated in subsequent articles) and no correct version. I did find the book though, and if there is anyone who knows the correct translation of the title it would be very appreciated. It’s not for a paper, I just want all details to be correct.  \nAnd also important, does anyone know of any translations of this book?\n\nThe title is (unless it continues, check the link):\n\n**Maga személyének, életének és különös cselekedeteinek mentsége**\n\nAnd since I can’t seem to insert images I’ll write the links to the pictures:  \ninside  \n [http://www.sk-szeged.hu/kiallitas/totfalusi/apologia.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012144129/http:/www.sk-szeged.hu/kiallitas/totfalusi/apologia.html \"http://www.sk-szeged.hu/kiallitas/totfalusi/apologia.html\")\n\ncover, reprint:  \n [http://www.antikva.hu/borito/1-54786-949.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012144129/http:/www.antikva.hu/borito/1-54786-949.jpg \"http://www.antikva.hu/borito/1-54786-949.jpg\")\n\nKind regards,  \nFredrik\n\n [‹ Is this price real?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012144129/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43998 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [InDesign Style Sheet problems ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012144129/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43798 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
