In the case of 2010 which is longer it might be more problematic to drop the whole thing. But it's very eye catching editorially: it's obviously a year and it makes people want to know what happened in 2010 but I think aesthetically it depends on how condensed the drop cap face is and how wide the column of text is. \n"
