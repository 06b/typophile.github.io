How bizarre. I’m looking for FF Meta, Bauhaus, Cezanne, Bookman, Univers, and Mrs. Eaves. Any leads?

I’m guessing that’s not the kind of example you’re looking for, though. :)\n\nI know I’ve seen Cezanne in an ad recently, but I can’t for the life of me remember what it was. Could have been Savoir Beds, but I’ve only found the ones using Sudestada, Affair and Olicana. Maybe I’m hallucinating.\n\n"

And Meta these days is everywhere, not quite like Arial, but certainly in the mainstream, so I don’t take photographs anymore.\n\nA few car brands use Meta: SEAT in Spain and Infinity in the US. Dodge has very fat Meta headlines in their campaigns in the US. Canon uses it for some products and campaigns, as does Bayer. MetaDesign San Francisco uses it (MetaDesign Berlin now uses FF Fago). The FontBook is set in FF Meta. The German Employment Agency (Arbeitsamt) used to but changed it for Daimler-Benz Corporate S after the last elections. You can still see quite few large letters above their buildings in Meta.\n\nAudi uses Univers, albeit a custom version (by Lucas de Groot at MetaDesign, 1996). So does Messe Frankfurt (by Erik Spiekermann and Erik van Blokland, 2006). Sorry – too late to check urls.\n\n"
