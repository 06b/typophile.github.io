If for some reason those aren’t available to download, alternate typeface suggestions would be appreciated. I’ve been trying to guess as to what to use, but I’d like to see what people say the actual typefaces are. Thanks.\n\n [‹ (x) Classic sans caps as wide as they are high - various {Stephen, Marc O}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306024100/http:/typophile.com/node/42639 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) United Travel serif face w/ triangular serifs - Matrix {Angel} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306024100/http:/typophile.com/node/42636 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "According to the study done a few years ago by Ascender Corp of 100 top US Newspapers, the N. Y. Times uses a custom version of Cheltenham, and the New York Post uses Font Bureau Poynter. You can see the whole study [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080306024100/http:/www.ascendercorp.com/pdf/Ascender_Corp_Fonts_on_the_Front_Page_11_19_2004.pdf).\n\nThese are for the main text, but the Study does list other typefaces used as well.\n\nThe Cheltenham used by the Times was designed by Carter & Cone for the paper, but a commercially available version from Linotype or one of the other foundries would not be very obviously different to most of us.\n\nYou said ’available to download’, and I took that to mean ’purchase online’. If you are looking for free versions, don’t waste your time.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
