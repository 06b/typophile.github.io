It has an ornament cut out of the circular part of the musical note.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/mmm_outside2.gif)\n\n",

Maybe the pattern in the clef could be made more snowflakey?\n\nWhy is the type so many different sizes? Restraint is always tasteful.\n\nWhy is “Joyous” capitalized?\n\nNot so wild about the swashy initial ‘W’. Perhaps it would be best to replace all of the text with a more scriptlike serif face like Brioso or one of the ten gazillion excellent script faces that have come out over the last few years.\n\n"
