  "content": "Hello, my name is Hubert Jocham and I have not been very active in this forum. but here is something I work at the moment. It is a Serif font with some unsual shapes. There is only upper and lower case yet. Reading is quite strange at the beginning, but you never know as a designer if people accept forms like that.   \nAnyway here is the pdf\n\n",

Two things that do stand out as needing change though:   \n- I would splay the legs of the UC \"M\".   \n- Most of all: I would quickly change the \"z\" to have \"conventional\" stroke contrats! It looks really disruptive the way it is. You could do that in the italic though I guess.   \n   \nNice stuff.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The different stresses are only in the italics.   \n   \nHubert\n\n"

I am huge fan of your [FF Zwo](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818164129/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=zwo) and many of your other faces.\n\nI think Talk (is that the name?) has a lot of potential, if for no other reason than modern faces with ultra-distinctive forms are very much in demand. I believe [FF Dax](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818164129/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=FF.10269.3.11&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=look+dad%2C+no+feet&sampleSize=32)'s simplified 'n', 'a', 'b', and 'd' often sell the face by themselves.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n- The crazy 'S' terminals feel a tad too heavy.\n- The serifs may be too large, especially noticeable on the 'm'.\n- Your 'a', 'k', and 'g' are stunning.\n\n"

I really like the rationalized shape changes. I find the \\_g\\_ to bee odd, but it is working in the smaller setting.\n\n"
