      "content": "Agree with the above, even though the angle of the /a/ and /q/ seems to differ from the angle of the /o/ it doesn't bother me really. Overall the wordmark looks balanced and stylish - definitely has a 'brush' feel to it. Have you tried a /P/ with a higher stem as well (higher topleft)? Also, it would be interesting maybe to see it with a brush-stroke below the word - although you'd be at risk crossing the /q/ there.\n\n"
