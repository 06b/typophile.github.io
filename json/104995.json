      "content": "Yes Crayonete, a popular font 120 years ago, cool again in the 1960s & 1970s. A simplified version of Crayon, designed and patented by Herman Ihlenberg in 1886, D16508.  \nI know of two digital Crayonete fonts. One sold by Aridi as Aridi08, Aridi Computer Graphics/Hardcover Communications 2001. The second created by Claude Pelletier as [Crayonnete](http://web.archive.org/web/20150125063624/http:/www.fontspace.com/diogene/crayonnette). Note the double n.  \nDon\n\n"
