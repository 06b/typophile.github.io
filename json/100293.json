Later, I became the chief economic strategist for German Reunification and a counselor to the Holy See. And now, have settled down to establish a new paradigm of global socio-economics.

Make sure your contract has a schedule, shows how many rounds of revisions, and perhaps has a option to kill the deal built into it. It should explicitly state deliverables, which include: Brand standards guide (can be very simple, specifying logo use, colour way, type specification), logo files in all necessary forms (vector, raster, B&W, colour, etc), and anything else you think is needed (ie: it could include a series of icons or illustrations that work together). You are pretty much buying a toolset for communicating with the world, and for persuading people in the world to give you money.\n\nGet references from other businesses in your area.\n\nYou may like to find a designer who knows what flyfishing is (that will speed up the process) and thus won't offer you clip art of a pike eating a treble-hooked thing.  \nBest of luck.\n\nSheesh.

The designer should not only create a logo but design the stationery, website, and related marketing materials.\n\n"

What he said is what any \"local designer\" _wants_, but it doesn't really align with the interests of a vast majority of potential clients. In order to select \"local\" over \"non-local\" there should be a clear benefit to doing that. A benefit that is absolutely bloody obvious to the client. And the way things stand there is no such benefit, especially not for those who look to design a one-off logo.\n\nThe branding is indeed a face of a company, so picking a designer is a substantial commitment and it comes with an inherent risk of making the wrong choice. The way to lessen the risk is to look at designer's portfolio and \"How I work\" section. This is what matters. If the designer happens to be local, it's just an icing on the cake, but it's hardly _the_ selection criteria.\n\nSo the most sensible way to go about picking a designer for a project is to flip through their portfolios. And the simplest way to do that is to skim through sites that serve as portfolio aggregators - Behance, Dribbble and Logopond.\n\n\"Sheesh.\"\n\n"

Maybe it's old fashioned but there is a benefit for a regional client to have a regional designer as they will have a better understanding of the cultural milieu. The OP is distinctly regional; it's not fishing charters in Belize for international clientele.\n\nOf course, there are examples showing the opposite. Such as Old Faithful (which, Apankrat, you probably know of). And the proprietor there, he did just as you said -- skimmed portfolios until he saw what he liked, which happened to be in Austin. The distinction is that this proprietor has a refined sense of what he wants his business to look like.\n\nAnyway, regional vs non-regional/international: this could go on forever and not be entirely fruitful. Over n out.\n\n"

And if the local designer has any skill at all it will show within a short period time, usually through the designer's on the spot thumbnail sketches. And, if the designer is worth their salt the designer should have contracts at the ready. I always ask for a retainer (local or global). It gives me a means to clear the client's quality of intent, and it allows me to purchase typeface/fonts needed.\n\nThe thumbs always settle the matter.\n\nn.\n\n"

Too bad Bruno Munari is gone -- he could have done you a kreel.\n\nPerhaps you saw one person on that list I provided in where you've seen their work. That particular person specializes in identity work, no? Personally when I think of fly fishing incorporated into a logo, I see flourishes of a fishing line. Clearly she has done this over and over and over. If I was randomly choosing well-known people, I wouldn't have provided half of the names above.\n\nMoving on, another solution would be to check Dribbble (large graphic design community) and search those who specialize in identity by location. This way the OP can filter through portfolios.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>In order to select \"local\" over \"non-local\" there  \n\\> should be a clear benefit to doing that.\n\nPicking a local designer can have several advantages. I think you can size up a person better when you meet them in person and look them in the eye, rather than through an email. A local designer may have local references you can check, which may include people or businesses you know personally. A local designer can meet the client and see their business in person, which can help them get a better feel for both. It's much easier for a local designer to design signage (which often requires making mockups and judging in person how they look), and can personally inspect the signage when it's delivered. A local designer can work with a local print shop, meet personally with the printer's rep, and do a press check while the jobs are being printed. A local designer may have a good working relationship with local newspapers and other media outlets where the client may want to advertise.\n\nAnd frankly it's easier to put a little pressure on a designer who's slacking off when you can physically walk into their office.\n\nI'm not saying that working with an out-of-town designer is bad; it's quite common and often works out well. But there are advantages to working with someone local.\n\n"

Some busy clients don't want to hassle with face-to-face meetings, but others really want them.\n\nYears ago I had a client — a very successful, tough executive — who told me she always wanted to meet face to face because she could tell when a designer/vendor was lying by looking into their eyes. And I think she could; you can often tell a lot by a person's body language and so forth.\n\n"
