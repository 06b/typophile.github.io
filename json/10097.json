  "content": "I have written to the site owner to see if they can tell me the name of the font. I think it is a freeware or maybe comic book font. It is a good example of how simple hand-drawn letters can look good with some graphic treatment. Simply by choosing good, bright colors, outlining and adding a drop shadow they have made an attractive set of navigation buttons, using a font that could have been 'home made' for almost no effort or cost.   \n   \nI looked through [Part 6 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054544/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg1.html) and found at least 7 similar styles that could be used in a similar way: Oz Poster (Alphabets \\*Inc), Balder (Linotype), Eborg (ITC), Accent (URW), Fat Tony (Letterhead Fonts), Puff Daddy Bold (Art & Sign), and Shocard Block (Art & Sign) -- sorry I didn't have time to make links for these.   \n   \nI will let you know if I get an answer about the font from the futtes.dk site.\n\n",
