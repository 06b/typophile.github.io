You don’t like Bembo’s long leg of R, so you’re trying an alternate, right?\n\nIt’s hard to tell, since the color of the new R can be slightly different from Bembo. I don’t know if it is a good solution, but why don’t you choose another font? I was thinking in [Poliphilus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012201325/http:/www.fonts.com/ES/detail.htm?pid=4334871&grab_id=0&page_id=4375&query=poliphilus&SCOPE=Fonts) & [Blado](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012201325/http:/www.fonts.com/ES/detail.htm?pid=4334844&grab_id=0&page_id=8826&query=Blado&SCOPE=Fonts). Same source of inspiration, no strange legs. Some other strange letters, though.\n\n"
