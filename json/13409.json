If the ID conflicts with another layout, it'll be automatically assigned a new one at runtime (i.e. I don't think this affects the actual file). Keep in mind, though, that a Unicode keyboard layout won't be available in non-Unicode programs. It may be helpful in certain situations (it depends on what characters you want) to give it an ID for the MacRoman encoding. That way, the layout will be available in any program, but the Unicode characters just may not work. Again, this depends on just how many of the characters are going to require Unicode.\n\n"

My PC is not connected to the internet, so I use the Mac for downloads. Microsoft does not allow you downloading this app unless you are running an authentic windows. I couldn't even download with VPC (not sure if this was due to something wrong on my VPC system). Is there any other way to get this app?\n\nHrant mentions ResEdit in another [post](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202005602/http:/typophile.com/node/351). I thought ResEdit was for Mac OS 9 or older. Is there a PC version?\n\nIs there an app that will convert a Mac .keylayout file, which is an XML file, to a windows keyboard?

      "content": "Hi Si,\n\nDidn't see what I was looking for. However, I've found another apparent oddity. When I set multiple codepoints in MSKLC for a single key, sometimes (in Word 2003) characters with a 'dotbelowcomb' (for innstance U+004C U+0323) will not render properly on screen. The dotbelowcomb appears to the right of the 'L'. What is interesting is that if I follow that particular composite character with another composite (say a U+0070 U+0313) the previous composite character will re-render properly. I get the same behavior in WordPad. When I type the characters in NeoOffice or TextEdit on MacOSX everything works OK. I've rechecked all the OT features and the MSKLC settings and everything looks OK. Other diacriticals, such as a caroncomb or commaabove don't exihibit this problem...just the dotbelowcomb.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n"

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI think I fixed the problems I was having by creating composite characters for the intermediate characters (such as U+004B U+0313) and assigning a Unicode codepoint (1E32). Also, I found that my combination of tools didn't like the Capital W space modifier character (1D42). When I changed the modfier for my uppercase characters to the lowercase w space modifier (02B7) that solved the problems with incorrect word wrap.  \nMy goal is to have a keyboard where users can type Roman characters in the plain and shifted states, and type the specialized language characters in the Caps Lock and Caps Lock shifted states. I'm using MSKLC and was hoping to use the SGCaps feature to accomplish this. However, I've found that I can only enter a single Unicode codepoint in the SGCaps field. In my case, I want to type in the character, diacriticals and space modifiers so that a single keypress will enter all the characters and let OpenType composite them. When I do this in the normal and shifted states it works fine...but I lose the ability to type Roman characters.  \nI sent an message to the MSKLC group listed above...but it appears that responses are only generated periodically.  \nAny ideas on how I can do this in Windows? I've done this same thing with Ukelele on Mac OSX and it works great. Instead of switching keyboards continually the users can just set the Caps Lock key.  \nOn Windows I also tried Keyboard Layout Manager...but it doesn't appear to support mulitple codepoints in any state and relies upon dead keys.  \nThanks for any suggestions...this forum has been great for helping me get started!\n\n"
