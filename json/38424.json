In a hospital you don’t usually have to look at signs from long distances, so I would think that the mood or look you want to create is most important. Therefore, you have a very wide range of fonts that are possible.\n\nFor example, Bliss is a warmer sans than Frutiger, and that might be a nice lift of mood in a Hospital.\n\n"

Facility pointers need to be readable from at least about half that distance. For that project, by the way, Myriad has worked quite well.\n\n"

I want to find a typeface that is clear, readable, legible and solid, that express effectiveness and that the site is «modern» and offer the best medical treatment. At the same time I´m looking for a human, friendly quality in the tyeface, and I want it to have an own «identity» (sorry, my English is not the best, but I want it to stand out a bit from the well known typefaces, Frutiger, etc, but still have that quality that it is effective in a wayshowing-system). Heh,well, I want all! And I want it to have a touch of elegance, that might give the patients and visitors less feeling of beeing in an institution. Ok, these are my thoughts and wishes, if you know a perfect of suitable typeface, please tell.\n\nAnd all you others: thank you for the tips. I´m checking them out now, and I´m excited!\n\n"

Your choice needs to fit in with existing graphics otherwise it may cause confusion and convey a “hodge podge” unprofessional quality. This can trickle down into how people perceive the hospital.\n\nMyriad and Frutiger are tried and true for the purpose, but hardly groundbreaking (I like Myriad better). Maurea is lovely. Scala Sans is excellent for way-finding, but if not used correctly can be industrial and clinical- use warm colors and graphics. Look at Metro.net as an example.\n\nArrival does not have condensed weights yet.  \nChevin may be too trendy if not used correctly for a hospital- it’s nice tho. Clearview is just not attractive and too masculine for my taste- a Meta Highway? However, it does have a complement of extensive weights and styles.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203191420im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/PreviewofUntitled_5703.png)\n\nAnd speaking of Meta- if you combine Meta with Frutiger you get AXIS by Akira Kobayashi... it will cost you a pretty penny though, but its better looking than Clearview or Meta and fresher than Frutiger or Myriad. It is expressly designed for way-finding. I know- its an offbeat choice.  \n [http://www.typeproject.com/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203191420/http:/www.typeproject.com/index.html \"http://www.typeproject.com/index.html\")\n\nOthers to look at are:  \nLocator by Process Type  \nWhitney by Hoefler and Frere Jones  \nAll of Lucas de Groot’s products  \n [www.lucasfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203191420/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/ \"www.lucasfonts.com\")  \nAll of Dalton Maag’s products  \n [www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203191420/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/ \"www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/dama/\")  \nSubtil- probably unreleased, but you could enquire about it  \n [http://www.tdc.org/news/2007Results/Subtil.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203191420/http:/www.tdc.org/news/2007Results/Subtil.html \"http://www.tdc.org/news/2007Results/Subtil.html\")\n\nHope I helped,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"
