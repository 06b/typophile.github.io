  "content": "So, I'm in the process of redesigning the magazine I work on, which used to be two magazines, but is now just one. Both magazines use a combination of sans serif and serif, mostly used to set sidebars and other info from the running text. So far, these are the faces I've looked at because of their huge set of weights.   \n   \nFF Scala & Scala Sans (nice, but...)   \nFF Zine Sans & Serif (a little wonky)   \nFF Page Sans & Serif (very nice, but some weird weight shifting in the design)   \n   \nPreviously, one magazine used FF TheSans & TheSerif while the other used Adobe's Celestia Antiqua & Scala Sans. I find FF Thesis a pain in the butt to work with because of the way the weights are set up, bold jumps to small caps, and the way the fonts show up in menus makes it a pain for the editor to work with the text. My editors do most of the text formatting (and there's a lot of it to be done), so FF Thesis is no longer really an option.   \n   \nI'm looking for suggestions for humanist sans serifs with a matching serif. I need full families with small caps, etc. since I use all that stuff fairly regularly.   \n   \nAny thoughts?\n\n [‹ IVPDA poster show: Typography makes a statement](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704154719/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37888 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Karl-Heinz Lange and the East German typographic scene ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704154719/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37874 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

People have favorites (I know I'm quite fond of using 20th Century from Monotype), but I was hoping (and recieved) for a few new faces to search out and try.   \n   \nSo, after a bit of trial and error, I decided to go with Scala and Scala Sans, using the Shire Types for article titles and folios, and Dispatch and Stainless for subheads. The magazine is split between Lord of the Rings type articles and general news, so I wanted the humanist but slick design of Scala Sans for the general news, but the humanist serif of Scala for the LotR style stuff.   \n   \nBut, this brings up another point, what is your favorite \"strange\" mix of fonts? Mine was using Rotis Semi-Serif and Agency. It worked quite well, I even used Rotis Serif Italic for all the italic (Semi-Serif doesn't have proper italic).\n\n"

However, there are also quite a few where the serif is just the sans with serifs pasted on. Also, if the point of having sans and serif is to provide contrast in a layout, using a mega family that provides both reduces that effect.   \n   \nHaving said that, I once designed a publication using Gill Sans and Gill Serif (aka Perpetua), and it worked out nicely: Perpetua Titling and the condensed Sans were very useful, and the over-the-top Gill Sans Ultra Bold, surrounded by total Gillosity, wasn't too bizarre at all.   \n   \nBTW, who did design Gill Sans Ultra Bold, surely not Eric...?   \n   \n\\>what is your favorite \"strange\" mix of fonts?   \n   \nI used Meta for Heads and sidebars, and Paradigm for main text, when I redesigned Cycle Canada in 1996. It's a motorcycle mag, so to accomodate the vibe of both hyper modern Japanese rocket bikes and retro-styled US hogs, I figured that would be OK.\n\n"

The less said about this unfortunate version the better, but the fact remains that this “adaptation” was made by an apprentice under Gill’s supervision, a practice for all things made in the Gill workshop. (The source for this latter statement is a recent interview with one of Gill’s apprentices.) Gill accepted this commission from the Monotype works under duress. He put off doing anything about it for too long, until repeated demands produced what Gill labeled </cite>Sans-Elefans<cite>, a tongue-in-cheek title for a publicity letter in which Gill had no interest. This crass commercialism on the part of Monotype was no different from that of other type foundries when they “created” from overly popular typefaces, and almost all of those variations were the product of foundry “art departments.” Too, if the criticism of Gill is valid, it must be remembered that Stanley Morison was in charge at Monotype!<br>\n</cite>\n\n"
