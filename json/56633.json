  "content": "I had an idea for promoting my foundry's ( [Greater Albion Typefounders](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015155005/http:/new.myfonts.com/foundry/Greater_Albion_Typefounders/)) latest releases. It goes like this. Three of our larger families on Myfonts.com (Whitehaven, Vertrina and the newly released Bonning) include free faces. The challenge would be to take one or more of these faces and use them to design an advertising poster that respects the spiri of the chosen faces. The best submissions would be published on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015155005/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/) and the winners would receive complimenary copies of font faces as prizes.\n\nNow the questions:\n\nWhat do people think of this idea?\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions of where to publicize it, apart from on here and our own [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015155005/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/)?\n\nCheers,  \nPaul.\n\n",

But it sounds like an interesting \"publicity\" campaign.\n\nYou might check in with Smashing Magazine's blog - they often like to highlight free fonts and other resources and they have a wide, international audience.\n\n"
