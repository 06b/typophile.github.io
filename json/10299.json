      "content": "The main reason to do it is to make the files smaller and thereby make the download (and the upload) go faster. Not absolutely necessary, but a good idea.   \n   \nHowever, with older Mac font formats (i.e., font suitcases) you must do it or you will loose font data. This is because Mac files are in some cases a bit more complex than those on other platforms (UNIX, Windows, etc.).   \n   \nMac files can have two parts, called the data fork and the resource fork. The data fork is just like a plain file on any other platform. The resource fork is unique to the Mac. Some Mac files have only a data fork (usually files created by word processors, drawing programs, etc.), and those can be transfered to other platforms with little trouble. However, system resource files, such as fonts, have most of their data in the resource fork. Unfortunately, if you try to move such a file to another platform, that data is lost because the other platform doesn't have any way to access or use the resource fork part of a Mac file. The result is that it gets stripped out.   \n   \nThe solution is to use StuffIt. When you compress a font file with StuffIt, all the compressed data is stored in the data fork of the StuffIt file, so it can be moved to and from other platforms with no ill effects. When StuffIt expands the file, it restores the data and resource forks to their original state.   \n   \nWith Mac fonts, the files that are affected are font suitcases, which can contain either TrueType fonts or screen fonts (for PostScript Type 1 fonts). OpenType fonts are not affected.\n\n"
