It has 15 very small compartments on each side of a divider across the back. Any ideas?  \nI paid $10 for it, and I’m thinking about going back and getting the remaining three typecases...each has different sorts. (Was this actually a good deal?)\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ UI Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062335/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44188 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Regional music magazine, feedback please ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062335/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44466 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Type cases are not included in the equation, They have their own value. I think you are safe, and $10. is nothing-take the risk.\n\nI was a typefounder.\n\nGiampa\n\n"
