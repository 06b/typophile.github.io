Especially when you consider that the Nazis disowned it! Is it perhaps because it also seems to be OK to hate Germans in general (at least in the US)? It can't be anti-Semitism, since very few people know/believe the (false) story that blackletter was Jewish. Is it because people need something to hate? Is it due to brainwashing? Or what?   \n   \n\\> why did the nazis feel they had to pretend that this wasn't a simple practical measure.   \n   \nMaybe because they could get more milage out of it by pretending it was part of fighting Jews.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

The only way to get rid of something so obviously German as blackletter, was to deny its Germanity.   \n   \nI also think it was a characteristic of Nazism to require an _ideological_ reason for everything, so 'simple practical measures' were unlikely to be acknowledged as such. If it is possible to relate your ideology to absolutely every aspect of life, you can present this as evidence of the universal truth of your ideology.\n\n"

The vast majority of people have no idea about the Bormann memo or the official rejection of blackletter by the Nazi regime. All they know is that in every WWII film they have ever seen blackletter is used for Nazi documents, signage, etc. And when game developers produce the latest version of Castle Wolfenstein or Day of Defeat, what do they use to evoke the WWII period? Blackletter.\n\n"

      "content": "First of all, most of the anti-blackletter sentiment and false association with NS is among modern Germans, not Americans. It stems from the postwar sentiment to reject anything and everything that could even remotely be connected with NS, a great example of the classic leftist bad habit of not bothering to match sentiment with commitment or diligence. In other words, the Rule of Thumb wins out over knowing where to stop.   \n   \nSecond, I wouldn't say that most Americans consider it \"OK to hate Germans in general\" and don't understand where you get this crazy notion. It may have been true after the war, but most Americans today have a rather neutral or favorable opinion of Germany and Germans, notwitstanding the usual bickering over the recent Iraq war. Personally I wouldn't trade my Audi for any American car on the market, and I love traveling in Germany.   \n   \nIf you read the rest of Bain & Shaw's book, you will see that today blackletter is mostly associated with _Heimatkitsch_, goth music, and certain subcultures in Germany. Certain styles (Schaftstiefelgrotesks like Element, Tannenberg and Deutschland) are definitely and perhaps correctly associated with NS. And blackletters of all types are routinely commandeered by lunatic fringe designers.   \n   \nBut the mistake of permitting that fringe to get away with \"making those types their own\" is what grates on me the most. Of course, others make this same argument about the swastika, but I can't go that far. The swastika was relatively obscure before its adoption by NS, whereas blackletter was a centuries-old institution with origins and roots both inside and outside what is now Germany.   \n   \nThe only way to counter this is to start using blackletters again for general purposes--even body text! (Yeah, I know, good luck selling a client on that. :-) So far I only see them in reprints.   \n   \nThere's also the readability issue, which is already discussed in another thread.\n\n"

This was one of the topics discussed at the blackletter panel in Leipzig. One of the interesting aspects of this period is that the Soviet occupiers in East Germany really didn't seem to care one way or the other about blackletter, probably because they lacked any understanding or interest in the blackletter vs. antiqua debate of what was, for them, a foreign script. This is one of the reasons why interest in blackletter persisted in East Germany (e.g. by Albert Kapr in Leipzig) when it was still virtually taboo in the West.\n\n"

How different is this from designers who tried, and are trying to elimiate blackletter from the typographic pallette? There was a time when blackletter was comparatively as ubiquitous as Helvetica is today (esp. in Germany).   \n   \nJust as Tschichold, later in life, looked back at his _New Typography,_ and saw parallels between its polemic and fascism, current \"blacklashing\" against Helvetica by a tiny minority of designers is just as bad.   \n   \nHelvetica became one of the most used computer fonts in the world because it had alrady been used successfully for two and a half decades in metal and film form! It wasn't the Mac (or the PC) that made Helvetica so ubiquitous, it was swiss designers themselves. Already in the 1970s, American designers were writing articles in design journals decrying how Helvetica had taken over the world.   \n   \nAnd lastly, regarding a comment on your site, I find it unlikely that \"Hitler\" would rejoice at the triumph of Helvetica in the world. While Helvetica is a descendent of German sans serif typefaces, these were NOT the sorts typefaces that the NS supported the usage of. They disapproved of modernism in virtually all of its manifestations.   \n   \n\"Hate\" is just too string for anything, especially something like typefaces or type choices (and I'm a TYPE designer!).

      "content": "Chris,   \n   \nblackletter type relates to Bibles in two distinct ways, both of which are often misunderstood. As you alluded, medieval manuscripts were normally written with calligraphic hands that acted as the influence for the the first typefaces.   \n   \nThe \"gothic\" style of lettering (i.e., texturas) probably developed in the Ille de France concurrently with the advent of Gothic Architecture. As French art and culture (including gothic architecture) spread across Europe by storm, these scripts were passed along as well, although every one (country) wrote them a little differently. Interesting to note that neither Gothic architecture nor gothic scripts ever took a firm hold in Italy (where the _italic_ types that we use today were formuated).   \n   \nGutenberg copied the format of the medieval manuscript (very quickly and _very_ well) for his first Bibles. The catholic church in Germany continued to set Latin text in Gutenberg-like texturas for generations (this might be a bit of a generalization).   \n   \nWhat really made _Fraktur_ **the** German typeface was the printing of the complete Luther translation of the Bible in it, during the 1530s. The Lutheran Bible (in German) remained set in the Fraktur variety of blackletter until the 1960s!   \n   \nThe Luther Bible is oftenregarded as the definitive book of the German language. In fact, Luther practically invented _hochdeutsch_ when he wrote it, because he needed to find a langauge that would universally be understood. Even today, German-speaking countries have a range of perlexing dialects. And, it was **the Bible** after all... talk about a good seller.   \n   \nSo, the Luther Bible was the first book printed in the modern German language, and it was printed in Fraktur. This is hard to fight against. It was the standard setter. How could one set German in anything else?   \n   \n**Well** , after the 1800s, a lot of Germans started setting a lot of German books in serif type, because a lot of serif typefaces are easier too read than a lot of Frakturs (I like Hrant's theory that Fraktur Boumas are inherently more legible, but _design_ plays a large role in the translation of this theory... some Frakturs, like some latinate Serif faces, are just **bad** for use in text). Books that were originally written in other languages, and books that were aimed at the scholarly, upper class (think a special edition of Goethe's _Faust,_ for instance) were now being printed in latinate serif type (called _Antiqua_ in German). Books for the masses, and newspapers, remained in Fraktur until the very end... which was Hitler's banning of Fraktur in 1941, and West Germany's quick, unfounded, association of Fraktur type with Nazism immediately after the war's close.   \n   \nSo, Bibles and Blackletters go hand-in-hand, _in more ways than one._\n\n"

In my eyes, Blackletter suffers now because of its past involvement with \"historical situations\" which has politisized Blackletter beyond repair. I think what needs to be done is not use it for something which one could directly relate to Germany, history, or indeed any modern subculture. I think it needs to be used for something totally unexpected if it is ever going to be accepted again as a viable type for every day use. Using it for something such as a history of Yiddish would, I think, only serve to strengthen the box that Blackletter has been placed in.   \n   \nHow about a children's book set in Blackletter? Or a cookery book? And if not, why not? I am not sure what I think of these yet, but I would like to see how others react... :-)   \n   \nBlackletter is so laden with meaning, whatever you believe that meaning to be, that to really bring it back into the realms of an everyday typeface, it needs to become meaningess once more, as it began - as a vernacular, common font of the people. To rid it of its meaning, it needs to be thrust into totally unusual circumstances. Then, I reckon, it's sink or swim. If it works, then we can rejoice! If it doesn't then we will know for certain that Blackletter belongs in the realm of the decorative and unusual. Not that that's a bad thing....   \n   \nBy the way, I am new to all this - both Blackletter and this forum. I am a Graphic Design student with a fascination for Blackletter and am currently writing a dissertation about it. Until now, my knowledge has been very patchy, but it's slowly improving!

I hope to send you some answers to your questionnaire shortly.   \n   \nBut I would like to mention one book I picked up at the recent Prague conference. It's a doctoral dissertation by Silvia Hartmann entitled _Fraktur oder Antiqua: die Schriftstreit von 1881 bis 1941._ Published in 1998, second edition in 1999, by Peter Lang GmbH in Frankfurt.   \n   \nIt exhaustively analyzes minutes and correspondence among the governments, proponents of Antiqua and defenders of Fraktur up until (and slightly past) the Verbot in March 1941. It includes monotone facsimiles of typewritten letters, escalating in desperation and absurdity near the end. Some of the letters are in a Fraktur typewriter font!

I expect it to become more interesting further into the book, especially when the Schaftstiefels start waddling in.   \n   \nIt is important to remember that the German language as we foreigners are taught is a gross oversimplification of what it used to be, which is more than one dialect of arguably more than one language. The greatest solidifying forces of the modern written German language are Goethe's literature and Luther's Bible translation. In the 1800s, German nationalization--for better or worse--was as much about consolidating a common laguage and identity as anything else. You can't so easily amass power when the people you want working for you can't understand you. I see the assertion of some common \"Germanness\" as a sign of desperation more than anything else. My knowledge of 17th-to-19th-century European history is too spotty to speculate accurately, but I think this desperation may have arose in the wake of what other adjacent empires were doing or had recently finished doing on Prussian and Saxon soil. There were regional differences within Germany just as in any other nation that had to be overcome. More complex than the puerile extrapolation of cultural meaning from the purely mathematical classification of \"red states\" and \"blue states.\"   \n   \nAs an aside, I was born into a military family that moved around a lot, but by age seven we settled into a relatively isolated part of the United States (the rural South) and I spent the rest of my childhood there surrounded by strange dialect, strange customs and patently offensive ideas about \"race\" and \"revival\" and a few other chestnuts. Our schools were effectively segregated ad hoc. I was lucky to have parents who knew what to look out for and keep me from falling in with friends who susbscribed to these things (the military culture had long since developed a very simple and effective means of dealing with ignorance) and I never quite assimilated. I had escape fantasies from the beginning, in fact. But what I observed coming back after a few years in college is that the Southern accent has completely left younger children. Their televisions teach them how to talk, think and feel. They all still know rednecks, they make fun of them now, and being one is now more a sign of rebellion and is often as artificial as being, say, a \"goth.\" (Heh.) Mullets are even cultivated out of conscious irony rather than plain ignorance. But I don't know if this is any sign of advancement. From where I look, they're merely exchanging one mass culture for another one.   \n   \nTo be sure, I don't feel any sense of elitism for observing this. On the contrary, I think it happens everywhere, and there is an impulse in many (most?) people to see the others surrounding them as not clued in on what they know. In my own more discouraged moments, I see my fascination with Blackletter and automated fine typography as my own not being clued in on what everyone else already knows. But I say fück it, it gives me great pleasure, so why not plow ahead. (Thanks to the typophile censor engine for necessitating the umlaut.) I'll let others experience and preserve the fascination of professional football, prime-time home renovation documentaries, and Univers on a damn Swiss Grid.   \n   \nThere has been a lot written about Blackletter for German, cos that's where it last had massive use, especially in text sizes. What I would like to see is an analysis of what happened to Blackletter outside of Germany, and I suspect that you will find that it wasn't discarded for its own faults, but because Antiqua designs of particularly high quality appeared here or there at this or that time, became quickly fashionable and successful enough as to set a standard. And I think this happened long before there was anything close to an actual \"Germany.\" Before there were nation-states at all as we know them. We should probably turn this around and ask not why Fraktur failed, but why Antiqua succeeded. And I suspect it has less to do with how the letters looked and more to do with the parts you can't see, for example what mechanical innovations and economic demand coincided with Antiqua types' introduction... did printers simply happen to be able to print more as a result of faster presses, more paper, growing literacy--did the letter shapes themselves ever play much of a part in their own success?   \n   \nThe main problem I have about the Fraktur v Antiqua argument is the \"versus.\" The idea that you must discard the other when choosing the one makes no sense to me. And if people find it hard to read, well boo farking hoo. Oh no, we wouldn't want to learn something new, now would we?!   \n   \n[panting exhaustedly]   \n   \nWelcome to the show!\n\n"

It occurred to me when Josh Griffing mistook the cathegory name/subgenre (Fraktur) with the whole category (Blackletter).   \n   \nMy idea to help discussions (in general as well) would be this: considered we are each one from a different country it's great we can use English, but wouldn't it be useful to see which terms are used in our own languages?   \nI think it would be enormously helpful to see the whole picture in a clearer light.   \n   \nI start with my beloved Italian. We do not have more technical terms like \"Blackletter\" or \"Gebrockene Schriften\". We call it \"Gotico\", which, in all senses and with all that the word can evoke is \"Gothic\".   \n   \nBut here, the way people superficially use it, is very precise in its loose definition. And as you use it, they tell you it's \"something Nazi\" (the Fraktur) or something generically \"old-style\".   \nWhile many people (even the most ignorant) are responsive when you talk them of \"Lineare\" or \"Senza Grazie\" (Sans-Serif) or \"Graziato\" (Serif), or \"Calligrafico\" (Script) they are often very quick to refuse your \"Gotico\", since it's \"outdated\" and \"evokes Nazism\".   \n   \nPicking up once again Hrant's interest (which is mine as well) we may consider Italian culture \"needed\" to keep its distance from Nazism for decades after WW2, since we'd been allies with it. How do you think is \"Blackletter\" perceived in Japan, for example, considered they were Germany's allies as well?   \n   \nYou should see how the political debate here in Italy still spins around this issue, in an era where it does not make actual sense to still speak of \"Fascism\" or \"Communism\" except as referring to History. Politics seems such a farce today I can't really see why people keep clung to the use of these \"labels\".   \n   \nI find difficult to grasp any actual connection between our post-structural politic parties and their previous historically-soaked counterparts. We live in a sort of \"non-historical\" time, where History's faults has become good mostly used as a childish offense. Ignorance (in any field) seems inevitably interlocked with Pride, and they both prosper.   \nOr is this vision biased by the fact I, myself I'm ignorant about what actually \"Politics\" should be, and that I was born in 1969, already so distant from the War?   \nIs this too off-topic?\n\n"

But I have a theory that there is a lot more to this interest.   \n   \nPartly it has a lot to do with the recycling of symbols; in the sense that Blackletter has become associated in a contemporary sense with alternative, and even pop culture in the West thanks to its use in the identities of contemporary Rock and R&B acts, and has therefore once again become familiar to our eyes from the point of readability. Blackletter now stands for an acceptable form of rebellion, and has become less associated with Nazi Germany particularly with the younger generations. This association with rebellion has been passed down to us from the 60's and the use of what we would call Second World War memorabilia by American motorcycle gangs as 'cheap riding gear'( Check out page 38,'Hell's Angel, the Life and Times of Sonny Barger and The Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club' published by Fourth Estate). This side of the theory relies on what Claudio called a \"non historical time\", in that a symbols association can alter with the passage of time.   \n   \nThe other part to my theory relates to what is going on throughout Europe at different levels, but particularly on a subcultural basis, and with relevance to countries with a Celtic and Germanic heritage of which the UK is part.   \n   \nThere is a growing interest in our individual cultural heritage in relation to a growing belief that globalization is leading to the Americanisation of European identities. Sub culturally this can be seen in the Black Metal scene in Norway (read 'Lords of Chaos' by Michael Moynihan and Didrick Soderlind) where this belief has played a part in the development of a scene that is now international. The same mass interest has been seen in the rise of popularity in History and and European Mythology (see 'Lord of the Rings', the forthcoming 'Beowulf' film, and the forthcoming Ridley Scott film about the Crusades).   \n   \nFrom the English point of view I think we look at the languages and culture of Europe and see a sense of identity we crave when we consider that our cultural invaders from America use the same language as ourselves, and with the dominance of American media over here, it seems that there is very little we can do to stop our assimilation.   \nFor this reason we look for our identity in our nearest cultural neighbors which I believe are those in Northern Europe, and the Celtic countries Scotland, Ireland and Wales; and in this sense I believe that the use of Blackletter as well as Uncials, Semi-Uncials and other decorative Medieval lettering is being used to give a sense of identity that is not Americanised.   \n   \nI know many of these issues are not strictly type related, but they are to do with culture of which language is a part.   \n   \nBy the way I do have good friends who are American, no offence intended.\n\n"

Blackletter is used as a signifier of Western exoticism, Victorian-era fetishization of childhood (cf. ref. Japanese \"elegant lolita\" culture), and spoOoOoky Gothicness. There was a good article about the Gothic Lolita scene, which has been a dominant trend in Tokyo's Harajuku fashion district for a good five years now, in the [New York Times](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317223058/http:/www.nytimes.com/2005/03/13/fashion/13GOTH.html?pagewanted=all&position=&pagewanted=all) (unfortunately, it's disappeared into the archives). Anyone with access to a good Japanese bookstore is encouraged to pick up a copy of Gothic & Lolita Bible to see how this works out in practice.   \n   \nWhat interests me about this phenomenon is how closely it mirrors the American goth / industrial subculture's fascination with incorporating Japanese language text into their own designs. The Japanese have created this weird steampunk vision of morbid Victoriana, where Japanese evokes postapocalyptic futurism to the goths. I guess we all yearn for the exotic.   \n   \nHrant, Japanese is reasonably plastic, but when you're dealing with ideograms composed of graphemes or radicals, you have to be careful about how you distort the strokes if you want the result to be readable. You have to be pretty sensitive to how Japanese is read before you can start making alterations to forms for aesthetic purposes. I think you're right that outsiders can have more fun with this than native readers and writers, but they still have to be pretty conversant with the language first.   \n   \nIt would be interesting to see what people could do with the archaeographic forms or Japanese / Chinese calligraphy, which use forms that are considerably freer in their rendering.   \n   \nRe: black metal, tastes vary. Some of my favorite music is black metal, although John is right in saying that black metal reflects deep-seated unease to the point of atavism in its outlook. The original black metal scene was full of neo-Nazis, xenophobes, homophobes, and pretty much every other form of violent European white male thuggery. It's somewhat hypocritical to admire the music and deplore the ideology, but hey, people still go see Wagner's operas all the time. And yes, black metal bands love not only blackletter but the extreme plasticity of letterform that blackletter reflects: just look at a few black metal band logos, and you'll see what I mean. It's strange to me that blackletter doesn't get used more than it does. Typically it's used by the bands that are trying to sound more medieval and primitive and less extreme or thrashy, much like you'd expect.\n\n"
