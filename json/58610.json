The design is a contemporary handwriting style adapted from  \nexamples in lettering exercise books. It has been redrawn and expanded into  \nsix styles. The four weights were created by drawing the style using  \ndifferent mediums: Cappuccino in pen, Pastry in felt-tip, Lemonade in brush  \nand Tobacco, the original, in pencil. Poster and Poster Inline are well  \nsuited for display purposes and round out the family. This font family is  \nperfect for bistro menus or other European-flavored poster & print design.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/caffe.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619225910/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/caffe.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/caffe.html\")\n\nIntroductory offer through June 30th\n\n",
