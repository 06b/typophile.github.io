Introduced by Filmotype in the late 1950s, it perfectly captures the mid-century playfulness of hand lettering while providing comfortable readability.\n\nYou can look for Alice’s cousin Brooklyn to be released in the coming months. Brooklyn was a derivative weight of the Alice face that is slightly bolder and wider than the original.\n\nStrikingly poised and almost as exotic as it sounds, Filmotype Zanzibar is among Filmotype’s most amazing and beautiful formal scripts released. This hidden gem from the early 1950s has been meticulously redrawn from the original font filmstrips and has been expanded to include a full international character compliment, automatic fractionals, ordinals, and a host of alternate characters in dynamic OpenType format.\n\nWe’re pleased to share the re-release of these amazing original designs from the 1950s and hope you’ll find them to be a perfect compliment to your design toolbox.\n\nYou can purchase, preview and discover more about these faces online exclusivly at Font Bros!\n\nSee ’em here: [http://www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20080318120624/http:/www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php \"http://www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php\")\n\nWarmly,  \nStuart\n\n",
