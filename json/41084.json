I appreciate what you’re saying Haley. We’re all individuals, and I thrive on some of the things you prefer Flickr to. Travel magazines bore me. Boosk on art and science fascinate me. That kind of material fires my imagination and I draw creative inspiration from it. Looking at tons of images clogs up my mind.\n\nI don’t have much use for Flickr, and there isn’t room or time in my life for it. With so much media making up our lives, mine is already full to capacity. Social appointments to keep, friends to visit and entertain—-most people have them, and for me they come first. The internet comes last.\n\nFlickr’s function as a social resource is fine—-except it has much more relevance for people dwelling on the North American continent than for an Australian. We have no Typecon down here. It seems most major players in the type industry are located in North America or Europe. I could use Flickr to stay in touch with people working in those places. Except I can’t pull airline tickets out of my rear end. The upshot isn’t practical for me.\n\nAs a way of staying in touch with people Flickr is all very well. I already do that by email tho, and it’s much more intimate that way. I crave intimacy whenever I can get it. The open air exposed public nature of the internet puts me off.\n\nFlickr is wonderful and I don’t have a problem with it. Flickr duplicates aspects of living already covered by other resources and institutions which already serve me.\n\nBoring.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
