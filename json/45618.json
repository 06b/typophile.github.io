I would make the “v” slightly bigger. Maybe instead of green, I would use magenta. “target your social calendar” I would start it aligning with the vertical of the “n” and bigger, cause if you reduce this to a certain size, the line of text will be too small. Yep.\n\nCheers\n\nAndré\n\n"

First off, go back to designing in black and white, color is one of the last things you deal with in a logo.\n\nFirst off, you might want to consider picking a different font, especially if you’re “geared towards women”. Second, the weight change for “ress” isn’t necessary and adds little to the meaning, same with the illustrator brush stroke ’v’.\n\nThe tagline also needs reworked, it’s much too small, and looks smashed up under the end of the logo like a wad of clay.\n\nThe icon, I assume is a calendar, doesn’t look like a calendar. Pull it out and rework it to resemble a calendar more. This could become the logomark and work side by side with your logotype.\n\nBack to the sketch pad with this one.\n\n"
