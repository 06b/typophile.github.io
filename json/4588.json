Specifically, whether it is worth changing the whole (advertising) company from [Quark 4](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907073835/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Quark%252B4) to InDesign as opposed to upgrading Quark (the more expensive option).\n\nAlthough I am a bit wary about changing over, I’ll be going along with a (relatively) open mind. But I would like to know what thoughts do you people have about the differences between [Quark](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907073835/http:/typophile.com/wiki/QuarkXpress) and InDesign? Things to look out for? Basic boxes or tricky typographic twiddling? From an overall design perspective to a more particular typographic viewpoint - which is best?\n\nApologies if this has been covered before, but it would be really useful to have a few opinions and perhaps things to look out for from people who know their stuff.\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Building an OpenType font, where to start?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907073835/http:/typophile.com/node/4765 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A substitute for FF Kievit? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907073835/http:/typophile.com/node/4624 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If you are already using Illustrator and Photoshop, InDesign makes an excellent fit.   \n   \nThere are some interface inconsistencies with Illustrator and Photoshop, and that can bug you, but in all they are very nice together.   \n   \nI have purchased Creative Suite Premium for my own use (on Macintosh) and the integration is better through-out though there is still more to be done. It is pretty well wholesome and delicious from my POV.   \n   \nThomas:   \nI can't speak to crossing the Quark with Adobe apps. I have only ever used Adobe apps. I even liked Pagemaker and thanks for bringing back the Control Panel in CS.   \n   \nIt looks like Macromedia Studio MX is in my very near future because of my various capacities at work, so I may be able to comment on this soon.   \n   \nNick:   \nWhat I don't understand is why you feel embarrased that your students haven't learned Quark. InD is clearly gaining traction and improving steadily, and seems the way of the future. Your students are well prepared. I don't understand why employers and potential employees both worry so much about whether you have one or the other. Can't the other be learned and conceptually we're talking about the same stuff right (text and pictures combined on a page), so you sit down, RTFM, screw around, commit to using the new one for a critical project and then you've got a pretty good idea of what goes on. I know this sounds like I'm an arrogant prick (I can be) but what I'm getting at is: are these programs that conceptually different? From what I have seen in the screenshots and movies and stuff it looks a lot the same.\\*   \n   \nIn general:   \nI have never had the opportunity to use Quark. I'm sure it can be learned. I'm sure it's a very capable program or the large number of companies that do use it would no longer be invested in it.   \n   \nAs a potential customer (and up until my recent CS purchase I was one), nothing that Quark did or said could convince me that their world was better. Truthfully I must say that their insistence on not bringing their stuff to OS X drove me mad and predjudiced me against them forever.   \n   \nJon   \n   \n\\*I remember now: their Flash movie seems to not work when you get to the Landmarks section. I'm downloading a demo of Quark right now just to prove to myself what a reasonable guy I am...\n\n"

I only say InDesign is pioneering, because it's the only mainstream app that can use OT fonts at the moment.   \n   \n**Nick,** there are color swatches in InD. They just happen to be in the color palette. (Imagine that.) Rather than in an obscure dialogue box. I agree with Jon, that is one aspect of the Adobe suite that's really nice - the apps all play nicely together. For the most part all the key commands are the same.   \n   \n**Thomas,** of course Quark is the underdog. They're not Microsoft or Adobe. =) It was easy to predict the day Adobe announced InDesign (1998?). I knew then PageMaker and Quark were doomed if Adobe got InD right. (Frankly I was kind of puzzled to see PageMaker continue on for so long after InD came out.)   \n   \nFurthermore, you're right about the Photoshop example. I've been impressed that Adobe has continued to innovate with Photoshop. (Afterall, they still want people to have a good reason to upgrade every year or two, right? No different from any other software maker.)   \n   \n**Rob Walker,** one final point. Don't expect to install InDesign and \"get it\" immediately. If you know Illustrator, sitting in the InD saddle will feel very familiar. But when you switch, give yourself some adequate time to try stuff, read the manual, etc. For me it took half a day to get over the awkwardness of a new app and about a full week before I felt like I really understood the more complex stuff: how to use masks, masterpages, style sheets, etc.   \n   \nI guess the bottom line is, I don't believe in hanging on to old tech for nostalgia's sake. For utility's sake, yes. Just don't expect to see me with a Newton. =)\n\n"

Although I'm far from expert, I have to say that is one really major reason I'm trying to work with only InDesign and not going back to Quark. The fact that everything seems to be one application. The ability to go back and forth without having to mentally switch different quick keys. The downside for me is speed. I'm using Panther and Indy CS (all CS now actually). But Quark is still faster, and not just marginally, I would call indy slug-like even. But, I use Indy because the patience pays off in the end. --- BTW Indy \\> GoLive \\< Illustrator is pretty cool too.   \n   \nNick said: _EMBARRASSMENT that my students (I teach part time) will graduate proficient in InD, but with no Quark skills (the faculty chose Adobe), when that's a requirement of most entry-level jobs_   \n   \nThis is a reality. I can relate to this. It seems most entry level jobs want friggin' ambidextrous multi-lingual multi-platform multi-media geniuses ... an unfair amount of pressure is put upon the teachers whose hands are tied.   \n   \nI can also say that I have put zillions of hours into Quark and can only say that I'm happy that Adobe allows the quick-keys (and other such) to be the same app to app. I can even set my palettes up almost identically from app to app. Lurvely!   \n   \nUp until recently I've managed to leave Quark alone. I do have a two clients now, one a publisher the other in the training field, who both use Quark 4.11 -- so I happily can help them. Otherwise I might not have been able to accept the work. I consider Quark a tool that I can use when I need to, but only often enough that it doesn't get dusty. However, if more clients need me to use Quark I won't turn my nose up at them. Quark isn't a way of life, it is only a tool to me.\n\n"

This bug was fixed with 2.1.   \n   \nGrant: re \"OT botched\" in InD, there are several problems. To begin with, the OT commands are buried on a 2nd-level submenu. It would be nice to have an interface which showed the user at a glance what features were available for a particular font -- Basic, Faux, or OT -- and allowed one to select a piece of text and just click on buttons to see the effect, rather than \"click-drag-drag-release\" every time. Secondly, the major issue of \"is it or isn't it\" faux small caps is not resolved. Ultimately, OT features should not be in an add-on menu, but integrated. It's unfortunate that they were not a more integral part of the InDesign coding from its inception, because the timing was concurrent.   \n   \nThe OT palette is a work in progress, and is more progressed in Illustrator CS than in InDesign CS.

I rarely mix the two suites, however. I still have a soft spot in my heart for Deneba Canvas (bet you never heard of it). It's a do-everything graphics app that my Dad bought me when I was a kid (mostly because it was so cheap). I acutally used it my first year of design school, because it's all I could afford. Now it's marketed to engineers.   \n   \nAs for competition for Photoshop: how do we know how good photoshop would be if it had some serious competition? Maybe it would be faster, or have new features we haven't thought of; maybe it wouldn't cost so much. I love Photoshop, but I wish it had some friendly competition.   \n   \nAs for botched OpenType support: I've talked about this before, but why should supported features be defined by the application? Why shouldn't they be defined by the type designer? For example, why can't I add four different ligature sets to a font. Why do I have to put them in the \"titling alternates\" feature, just so I can access them?

But from what I've seen (previously and in this thread), it looks like it improves the _overall_ spacing of _most_ fonts.
