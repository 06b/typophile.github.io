  "content": "This is an addition to Coruña that was a bit tricky and so I'm hoping someone might have some suggestions.\n\nI've added the Tifinagh alphabet to Coruña. It's shapes are deceptively simple, and being an unicase alphabet, making it match the color of the rest of Coruña wasn't easy. This is a quick draft, I don't like the terminals at all, but just the same I'm not sure what will work.\n\nSince it's often seen in mixed script cases due to the commonness of Arabic and French in Morocco, I want to make sure it looks good on its on and mixed with Latin (I've only just begun Arabic so nothing to show yet).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [corunna\\_tamazight.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417114126/http:/typophile.com/files/corunna_tamazight.pdf) | 112.54 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "It's really interesting. It doesn't at first seem to harmonize with Coruña, but since I'm totally unfamiliar with Tifinagh script I have no idea what the rules are regarding its design. That could just be from having to look at them separately, though. If you could set some lines in both scripts together, as one might see in Morocco as you describe, that might make it easier to comment on.\n\n"
