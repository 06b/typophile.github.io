Calcite Pro & Chicago are 2 I like best. What do you think? OR ... do you have a better suggestion?\n\n",

So categorize the typefaces you have accordingly, and you will come up with a hardcore, authentic choice.   \n   \nYou can find out the dates of the typefaces at the Adobe.com/type website.\n\n"

I like your idea of checking out the dates of the typefaces at the Adobe.com site. I am heading there to do just that now! Thanks also Thomas and John for your imput.\n\n"
