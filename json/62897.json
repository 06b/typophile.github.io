Im creating an essay for my final year project and im after a font for the main body of the essay which isnt the standard \"arial\" or \"calibri\" fonts, but I still want it to be easy to read.\n\nCan anyone point me in the direction of a font which might be suitable, I dont mind paying for the font.\n\nRegards,\n\nJames\n\n",
