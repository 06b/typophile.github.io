  "content": "Hello there, almost two years ago I entered typography field, and a still consider new in this.\n\nI'm working on a typeface looking for a Avenir or Neutraface serif with transitional roman features. This exploration started when I'm trying to find a serif equivalent of Futura or Avenir without any success. When I started to design I altered the course of the original idea making half-rounded endings, and in each new re-design and corrections this typeface was getting more ornamented. I think to make it a text typography.\n\nI included a PDF with a sample text. Although I worked with some uppercase letters, this typeface's version doesn't include any one, I'll work on it after I make corrections on lowercase letters.\n\nThanks in advance for your comments.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [aureal\\_0.21.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416115242/http:/typophile.com/files/aureal_0.21.pdf) | 36.6 KB |\n\n",
