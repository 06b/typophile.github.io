You might want to use a size larger than that formula provides, since a billboard needs to be read from a moving vehicle, which is considerably more difficult than reading while standing still.\n\nJason C\n\n"

With that in mind, you should keep it simple and readable.

      "content": "I just did 11 billboards for a campaign in New Jersey. 15 words. They range from 14' x 36' (signage companies always do the dimensions backwards - at least for me) to 16' x 60'.\n\nI would estimate that the main letters (a band name in Franklin Gothic Condensed or Extra Condensed) are 8' to 14' tall (depending on the board size).\n\nThe other words are probably around 2' to 5' tall.\n\nThey are done to scale in Illustrator (1/48 to 1/12 scale depending on the vendor) so you can get there with point size. I have done them full size and then you have to set the type and scale it - 1200 points - I believe that's the limit in our software - is not large enough.\n\npbc\n\n"
