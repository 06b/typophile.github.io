      "content": "Seriously, the alphabet we use currently has evolved over time in a completely willy nilly fashion with a great many redundancies that don't really enrich language at all. As designers, we all know this, yet we it meekly accept it as a fact of life. But does it need to be like that? NO. It doesn't. We're designers, after all. I think that now would be as good a time as any for some rationalization and culling of unnecessary and wasteful letters, in much the same way that the dozens of different and idiocentric weights and measures systems used in France were culled and replaced by the infinitely more rational metric system at the end of the 18th century.\n\nWe could probably whittle the number of letters in the standard alphabet down by 25% to 30%.\n\nTaking the letter \"J\" as an example: In many languages it is pronounced as a \"Y\" sound or even an \"h\". In French, it is pronounced \"zh\", so the assertion that these languages can't get by without a \"j\" is simply not true. The name, James is really Iago. Jack is really John which is really Ivan, and so on. Jorge is really George, and is pronound Horhay anyhow! If a \"J\" sound is really ever actually required, \"ge\" or \"zh\" work just fine.\n\n@ jazzhustler: My Norwegian Grandmother, didn't like any music that didn't have a polka beat, or sound like it was made up by Vikings in quiet moments between pillagings. Any other form of music, she would denounce fiercely with: \"Dat's yoost yass!\" You see. There's my point; no need for \"j\", \"th\" \"u\" or even \"z\". You'll always have yass. (or iass, since the \"y\" is really just a redundancy of the letter \"i\") Cutting the alphabet down by 30% is actually quite conservative, when you think about it.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
