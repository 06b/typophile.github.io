I hope you enjoy the font.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232129im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hachura-tp_3700.gif)\n\n**[Hachura](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232129/http:/www.outrasfontes.com/hachura.htm)** is an impressionist typeface designed by **[Ricardo Esteves Gomes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232129/http:/www.outrasfontes.com/about.htm)**. Its general proportions are based on the garalde models, with traditional roman serifs. It was initially made by hand using a drawing technique to create a font that simulates the unfinished aspect of a work in constant progress. This textured face is useful for display sizes, making a very visible presence. Because of its basic dimensions and careful distribution of black and white, it still also very readable in text sizes like 10 or 8 points.\n\n**[Hachura](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232129/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/hachura/)** is available to purchase and download at **[Myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014232129/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/hachura/)**.\n\n",
