  "content": "I'm reading an autobiography set in this face, and I find it really distracting -- not nearly as invisible as a book face should be -- because in my eyes the lc _d_ and _p_ are well below the x-height. It isn't that noticeable in this scan (possibly because it's bigger on screen).\n\nAnyway, I'd like to know what it is.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013174124im_/http:/typophile.com/files/uncle-tungsten-serif.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [uncle-tungsten-serif.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013174124/http:/typophile.com/files/uncle-tungsten-serif.jpg) | 15.11 KB |\n\n",
