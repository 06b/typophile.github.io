      "content": "Hi Sam,\n\nwelcome to Typophile!  \nPlease note that you get faster feedback when you post such ID requests on the [Type ID Board](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016052616/http:/typophile.com/typeid).\n\nPostmarks use custom letters, i.e. there is probably no digital font that perfectly matches your sample.\n\nFor an approximation of the date (digits): this might be a case for [Linotype DIN Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016052616/http:/www.linotype.com/en/5798/dinnext.html). It has the ‘9’ with the rounded bottom, as an alternative glyph. Neither DIN Engschrift, FF DIN nor PF DIN seem to have this form.  \nDIN Next has a Condensed, and a Rounded. Alas, no Condensed Rounded.\n\nAlternatively, there’s [Gravur Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016052616/http:/www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Gravur+Condensed/).\n\nCheers,  \nF\n\n"
