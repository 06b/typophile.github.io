  "content": "Hi,\n\nAre you a pro with sketches/doodles lying around you wouldn't mind sharing/selling? A budding type designer with a promising font, but not wanting to take the time to digitize it and take it to market?\n\nI'm getting started in digitizing files for DIY type patterns/projects/scrapbooking etc to be sold online. Files do NOT have to be rendered as vector or be an actual working font.\n\nI cannot pay much as I'm just getting started, but would love to get a conversation going with interested artists. Please include samples of your work and what you're expecting in terms of payment and licensing allowances.\n\nLove to hear from you!\n\nYou can email me at [chgotom23@aol.com](mailto:chgotom23@aol.com).\n\n`Tommaso\n\n",
