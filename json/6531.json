When Roger Black redesigned [my local paper](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311072621/http:/straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/) (the printed version, of course) in 98/99 he used Interstate as the primary sans and paired it with Garamond. They have used Plantin and Century Schoolbook on some previous incarnations of the paper.   \n   \nThe way they used it, Interstate is rarely used for more than three lines of text, in headlines or the stand-first. But sometimes they do go berserk and use it in a whole sidebar.   \n   \nRecently, they have started using the whole gamut of widths and weight. Very distracting, IMO. They should just stick to what I think is the _original_ Interstate, the [Regular Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311072621/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/regularcondensed/). Funny, when I first noticed Interstate, I don't remember it having so many weights and widths. Were those added later?\n\n"
