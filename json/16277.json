So I am looking for a font with the following attributes:\n\n1) Well readable at 9pts  \ni.e. comfortable for long-distance reading\n\n2) Condensed\n\n3) Typographic workhorse  \nthe whole nine yards: medieval, tabular, smallcaps, ligatures, weights, etc.)\n\n4) Serif\n\nI know this asks much, but the project is like that. I'd be very grateful for your suggestions.\n\n",

One should reach for the stars, shouldn't one? :-)\n\nCollis is very elegant and very expensive. I have Minion Pro, which I will probably use, but still find a bit 'common'.\n\n@nick: The project is non-commercial. It is part of a assignment for typography class at the art academy. So there is practically no budget at all.\n\n"

If you can get it in OpenType, you'll basically have a font that will last for years. I know that Type 1 fonts, for example, have been in general use since what, the early '80s? And they'll still be useful for a few more years.\n\n"
