  "content": "From the 1st of July till 21 September the latest edition (3.7) of **DTL OTMaster** will be offered with a 50% discount on the standard licensing price of €255.\n\nVersion 3.7 contains a lot of new functionality. From the import/export of _Ideographic Variation Sequences_ (IVS) to the editing of _feature parameters_, and from an _autohinter_ for edited or newly added glyphs to support for COLR+CPAL tables. One can read about all details in Karsten Lücke’s wonderful [manual](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040250/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/pdf/OTM_manual.zip).\n\nSome use OTM for font-spelunking, other use it for Open(Type)-heart surgery. Some use it for compiling OpenType Layout features (directly in the font, or exported for proprietary workﬂows) by applying the elegant automatic subsetting, while others use it for instance for mark (to mark) positioning. OTM is the ultimate Swiss (or actually German/Dutch) knife for CFF- and TTF-based OpenType, TrueType, and TTC (TrueType Collection) fonts.\n\nA complete listing of the functionality in OTM 3.7 can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040250/http:/www.fonttools.org/downloads/OTMA/RM/Read_Me_lb.txt). DTL OTMaster can be ordered directly with forenamed discount at [DTL’s FontTools shop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040250/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/Shops/FM_Shop/index1.html) or at FontLab Ltd.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040250im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OTM_promo_3596.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I’m very pleased to inform you that the OTM summer promo is a huge success. Obviously 50% discount makes a major difference for all of those doubters. ;-)\n\nOn Google’s font list currently there is a lively discussion on the development of Devanagari fonts and I was surprised to ﬁnd out that it was unknown to many that OTM generates a nice log ﬁle when compiling OT Layout features. This way errors and mistakes in the features can easily be traced. This is a excerpt from the discussion with an example that I generated with OTM 3.7:\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n_Just had a short look at the features. The lookup 'PreBaseSubstitutionslookup2' contains duplicate substitutions:_\n\nsub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva\\_viramadeva by \\isign\\_ra\\_virama.tha;  \n sub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva\\_viramadeva by \\isign\\_ra\\_virama.ja;\n\nsub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva\\_viramadeva \\anusvaradeva by \\isign\\_ra\\_virama\\_anusvara.tha;  \n sub \\isigndeva.tha \\radeva\\_viramadeva \\anusvaradeva by \\isign\\_ra\\_virama\\_anusvara.ja;\n\n_If one of each is removed then there seem to be some more errors:_\n\nHOT [ERROR] MarkToBase or MarkToMark error: A previous statment has already assigned the current mark class to another anchor point on the same glyph 'rvocalicdeva'. Skipping rule. [/Users/blokland/Desktop/Devnagari/Lohit.fea 814]  \nHOT [ERROR] MarkToBase or MarkToMark error: A previous statment has already assigned the current mark class to another anchor point on the same glyph 'kadeva'.

Also this can be exported in OTM and the text ﬁle can subsequently be easily edited (in batch, if applicable) and imported.\n\n"

      "content": "I suppose this is a crude question to ask but what is DTL OTMaster useful for? I read that it's basically post-production software for fonts, but the descriptions remain very vague. What's the biggest upside of DTL OTMaster, and is it essential to be able to guarantee the quality of OT fonts?\n\n"
