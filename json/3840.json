      "content": "I can't believe it! I haven't read all the posts... but it's just too much! I feel sorry for Vince. Although I'm not a fan of Comic Sans I must say, he had a reason to design Comic Sans and that was his job! Stop getting the designer involved in this... he isn't Comic Sans! It wasn't his fault! I'd like to also add that I went to the same grad school (University of Reading, UK) as Vince to do typeface design, so I do have some respect for his work (I don't know him personally though).   \n   \nI think there's much to be said about informal fonts. People just love Comic Sans. Most of my non-designer friends love it and use it for their PowerPoint presentations and emails. I don't blame them. They need typefaces that they think are useful for expressing themselves and that are freely available to them. With the popularization of computers (or maybe even the typewriter), all the friendliness and warmth associated with handwriting are gone. We began to have to 'typeset' personal letters and other informal things with official, cold looking typefaces. Do you expect them to use Times New Roman or other 'proper typefaces' for everything? I don't think they should somehow. They are not as educated in type as us graphic designers, and they simply choose what appeals to them. The criteria that they use when they choose typefaces are different... they tend to choose non-typographic and 'handwritten' type. There's nothing wrong with it, I think. But the popularity of Comic Sans just show how big an effect a software monopoly can have on the visual landscape. I think we urgently need a good workhorse informal font that is free for everyone to use. I'm quite happy to take that on myself.   \n   \nI don't agree with deleting Comic Sans on art schools' computers.... that's censorship! People, even designers, have to right to know what's available and to make decisions for themselves. Instructors who are fed up with seeing Comic Sans in their students' work should blame it on themselves, not the fact that the font is available on the computers. Education is key. I agree with Vince that Comic Sans could look really good if it is used well. I'm proud to say that I've used Sand in an email I sent on Halloween day! It worked! :-) I must say I'd rather see Comic Sans than Sand for running text. And trust me, I've seen Sand being used for running text!   \n   \nK.\n\n"

I woke up one morning and had some sort of typographic epiphany. I confess! I used it once, long ago, to rough out some scripts. When I came across them the other day, it was like looking in the mirror and suddenly remembering what exactly you did the drunken night before, running into a one night stand or realizing that you're living on skid row, prostituting yourself for crack. I thought I was being cute. Now I want to cleanse myself of that dark period and lose the shame. Either forgiveness or flagellation is welcome. I do confess a deep and abiding love for Helvetica... hope that's ok...I've come here to learn.\n\n"

It would then join the ranks of dearly-beloved typefaces like Times, Helvetica, Avant Garde, Zaph Chancery and Comic Sans.   \n   \nWould you still like your favorite font the one-thousanth time you saw it on a lost-dog flyer? How many times would you like to see it used as a newsletter text face in artificial bold with too-tight leading? How often would you like to see it on a laser-printed price list with lots of sizes and underlines and outlines and drop shadows? How often would it take for you to see your favorite display face used for e-mail text or body copy (in all caps, of course)? How often would you enjoy seeing it artificially bolded or slanted? How often would you need to see it used for a 3-D spinning logo?   \n   \nWould you even want to touch it for serious projects any more?   \n   \nThe people who wold commit these attrocities simply would never buy your favorite typeface, except by sheer accident, and they would never, ever buy fonts with expert sets.   \n   \nMy greatest, secret fear is that a blackletter typeface will someday become standard - you know everyone would be using it in all caps whenever they wanted to be sophisticated or elegant.
