I got in touch with different students from WT via email and they told me it wasn’t worth visiting the open day. I was adviced to take a separate appointement.  \nI’ve also had trouble getting in touch with WT although I haven’t tried to phone them yet (I’ve been told that the staff is only in one day a week, I don’t know which day though). I asked a series of questions via email to a couple of students and they have answered most of my queries.  \nI guess this doesn’t help you much, good luck anyway!\n\n"
