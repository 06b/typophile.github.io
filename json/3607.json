I dug up my old Bitstream Type Shop Pro CD-ROM which has a bunch of GX fonts to see how well they worked and whether you can access the extra glyphs in Illustrator CS. You can, but only through the Glyph Palette, and some of glyphs are a bit garbled. TextEdit and other Cocoa applications support them completely, though.   \n   \nAnyway, I don't think the font in question is Chianti, but, you're right, it's very close.\n\n"
