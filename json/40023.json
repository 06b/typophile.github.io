  "content": "Hello everybody. It's been a while since I've written something in here, but I need some help, and where else coud I get it?  \nI have the déjà vu sensation of the face, but I don´t know how to identify it. Tried Identiyfont, underware, ourtype, dtl. I just know it has a dutch genesis.  \nCan anyone help?  \nThanx ;)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025051im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dutch_type_4234.gif)\n\nIt reminds me of \"vista\", and the \"g\" looks like a Gerard Unger's one.  \nIt's a beautifull face, but I'd like to know who drew it.\n\n",
