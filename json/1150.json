I tend not to drink coffee while I'm actually working: if I need to stay up all night to meet a deadline, I find chocolate covered espresso beans to be more effective.

Scotch rocks is the perennial favorite. Arbeg, Laphroaig, or Lagavulin (in order of preference) are the favorites. Usually it ends up being something like Dewar's or Ballantine's however.
