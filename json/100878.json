I haven't been able to track down the original designer/foundry, and it seems as though this particular typeface is no longer available.

On top of all that, Chester Jenkins, who used to run Thirstype after Rick, apparently _co-founded_ Village, but the only Thirstype fonts still available on Village are his, now published by the foundry [Constellation](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015031816/http:/www.vllg.com/foundries/Constellation#panel=news-gallery-about).

In many cases, just go to the vendor and download it again. Or you created a brand identity or logo and the original designer is unavailable or refuses to help. You look for the font, and it's nowhere to be found.\n\nWhat if the font company goes out of business with no one picking up the assets? What if the font is abandonware? If I needed a font to _recreate_ something already extant, as opposed to just _wanting_ a particular font, there's no telling what I would do.\n\nIt's easy to to be an absolutist, pontificate, and say \"the worst thing is to help him download from illegal resources, as Renaissance Man did.\" I understand that people die, companies go bankrupt, foundries are taken over, and shit happens. In those cases, the legitimacy, morality, or legality of recreating a font (\"outline theft\") or downloading from \"illegal resources\" is less clear cut. If you want absolutes (and absolution) join the Republican party or the RC church.\n\nI would NOT recommend a questionable source if there was a legitimate alternative.\n\nThis is NOT about \"illegal resources,\" but what to do when all legitimate sources have dried up.\n\n"

In other instances, I've always attempted to contact the original foundry and/or designer, and failing that, looked for another cut of the typeface. (An example: OPTI Majer Irregular is no longer available, and is of questionable origin to start with, but was a legacy font picked by a client before I started working with them. We were able to replace that typeface with Filmotype Major across all uses.)\n\nIt is a bit ludicrous in the age of the Internet that legitimate (and paying) users of typefaces can't always find a straightforward way to compensate the owners of the intellectual property. But not doing so is still theft. That being said, a designer who allows their font to go \"out of print\" (as opposed to pulling the font because of some defect) is basically throwing money away—while I believe many end users want to do the right thing, most will only do so if it's made painfully easy for them.\n\nAnd RM, I just saw your reply, and it is a difficult but relevant gray area—what do you do when there are no legitimate options/resources left? Thankfully in this case, it didn't come to that. And that discussion is probably best left to its own thread.\n\n"

However, not one of them has an email address or a contact form, although Barry did post a link to \"the West-Egg biscuits and gravy plate\" on his website. The Linkedin info essentially duplicates his website info, I'm not going to agree to Linkedin's TOS just to \"access Barry Deck’s full profile,\" in case it may have contact info, and I don't tweet. Would that Barry followed the motto on his website: \"Simplify. Scale. Sustain.\" He doesn't make it simple to contact him, and he did not sustain his own fonts.\n\nThat this had a happy ending for David is no reason to be smug and say I told you so.

Unless you think people are lying (and why would they?) about being able to contact the relevant parties and finding a proper resolution, once somebody says they found a legitimate means why not give that the benefit of the doubt and remove the illegitimate link?

Given his good relationship and history with my client, and the scope of this project (being a single reprint of a long in-print book), he granted me a gratis license for use on this project only. The font is still not commercially available; if I wanted to purchase a new license for a new project, I would have to continue my quest, or find a new typeface. Had I been unsuccessful with the foundry, I would have tried to contact the designer directly. Had all avenues failed, I would have needed to confer with my client on how they wanted to proceed and/or worked directly with the printer to update the files (at a significant expense).\n\n"
