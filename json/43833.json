      "content": "\"What makes you think so?\"\n\nI think they wouldn't do that. Why get rid of good letterpress machines. I don't know how letterpress is used over there, but there are still semi retired individuals still printing business hand set cards, or invites. I worked in a little letterpress shop over there for about a year or so, and I interviewed with local printers and actually was given to see the presses, and I visited a lot of them. Anyway, if you want to print letterpress, just tell the printer you want it that way. I guess you will find letterpress (tipografia) printing if you ask for.\n\nGeorg gave you good info about Bauer in Barcelona. Actually they still have for sale some lead type with antique finished wood boxes.  \n-\n\n\"AGL, thing is... almost every place has a letterpress machine, but they only use them for engravings or for numerations, they don’t actually have metal nor wood types nor ornaments :\\\"\n\nAnyway, if you want to print letterpress, just tell the printer you want it that way. I guess you will find letterpress (tipografia) printing if you ask for. Just tell the printer, I want it 'tipográfico', you give them some negatives, they make the plates (which these days are fotopolymer).  \nI actually i don't know for sure if there is actually lots of letterpress shops over there, but you can just walk and find a printshop, go in and ask. Most printers like the refer others and guide you on finding one.  \nHope this help. Thanks.\n\n"
