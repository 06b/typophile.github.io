They can then copy and paste as needed.\n\nBy Unicode convention, a combining diacritic should come immediately after the letter it modifies. If you follow that convention, and you happen to be using a font with proper support for combining diacritics, the diacritic will properly position itself--no kerning required.\n\nThe Unicode standard includes a number of [pre-composed glyphs with dots beneath](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131051934/http:/www.ling.upenn.edu/unicode/?search=dot+below). I don't know if any of these are glyphs you need, or if they're included in the font you're using, but it may be worth checking.\n\n"
