  "content": "Ok, so the logo I designed was for a company that deals with government clients, so they needed a logo that was contemporary, classical and very corporate to represent the type of clients they will have to deal with. So, I need adivce from you experienced designers on where to place the ’Consulting’ part and which font you think I should use. I just can’t seem to get it looking right. Any ideas??
