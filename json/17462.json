  "content": "hi all. attached a logo for a club called \"cubes\". the 3 smaller cubes on the top \"represent\" the  \n3 rooms/areas of the club. the color is just a working color. looking for critique right now :)  \nthe club is going to play something like electronic music, dance and stuff for people between  \n25 and 40 or so. thanks: lars\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cubes.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416005631/http:/typophile.com/files/cubes.gif) | 6.14 KB |\n\n",

Like the green, not keen on the shadow - seems a bit unnecessary from a purist point-of-view.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416005631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cubes.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "hi nick, i had some other version as well, but i skipped those because nearly all of them looked to \"technically\" (what the client dont wants).  \nyou're right on the \"shadow\", but i kept it because it gives a little more \"contrast\".\n\n"
