I use them regularly for all kinds of work. They are a broker, rather than a printer themselves, but that’s worked to my benefit. They also have a very environmentally friendly bent, but will not force it on you at all.\n\nIf you call them, ask for Mike DiBugnara and tell him I sent you.\n\n"

They can handle as Jackie says two color printing and short runs with outstanding quality and consistancy. Foil stamping, embossing, die cutting...etc. I have HIGH end FUSSY clients and these guys know what it takes to make them happy.\n\nThey also do outstanding 4 color and large runs.  \nYou can always get the owner on the phone to help you plan the job and stay within your clients budgets.\n\nI have just recieved an email stating the launch of their website by the end of April patanepress.com but for now I still contact them below.\n\nPatane Press  \n228 E 125th St  \nNew York, NY 10035-1738  \nPhone: (212) 289-1440\n\nHope this was usefull :)  \n-Michelle\n\n"
