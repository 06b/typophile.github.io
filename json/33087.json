      "content": "The keyboard driver is usually unrelated to activating features and does not need to know anything about OT language tags. All it does is pass codepoints in to the OS. The OS or application needs to tag the text with the appopriate language. The OS or app could derive the language from the keyboard selection, but what then about cases where a single keyboard can be used for multiple languages? Or text is imported or copied and pasted from some other source?\n\nSome applications may try to derive the script and/or language from the particular codepoints being used. This is obviously prone to error, particularly if it's language rather than script that is driving the processing.\n\nSo the most reliable method is to have the end user needs specify the language. InDesign CS3 relies on this; when the end user specifies the language for spelling and hyphenation purposes, that also serves to tell InDesign what language tag applies.\n\nThe downside of InDesign CS3's approach is that currently users can't specify a language they don't have a dictionary for. I hope to see this limitation removed in a future version of InDesign. But for now I'm pretty glad to have language-specific OT feature processing.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"
