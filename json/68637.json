I did a bit of pondering on the topic in relation to the series of [glyph t-shirts](http://web.archive.org/web/20100326143350/http:/blog.myfonts.com/83) I designed for MyFonts a while ago.\n\nI rather doubt that many type producers would complain if the MoMA were to highlight their typeface with full credits, but I'm curious about what people think of the comparison between typefaces and other more traditional materials, like oil paint or charcoal.\n\n"

But you know they're going to pick totally uninspired set of fonts to reflect the mundane and utilitarian nature of the mark. If they don't pick Helvetica and Lucida Grande I'll be shocked.\n\n"
