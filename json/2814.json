  "content": "Hi All,   \n   \nThis is my first post. I am writing my Mathematics Ph.D. thesis. I am planning to use Classical Garamond to typeset the thesis. Usually people use Computer Modern (that comes with LaTeX typesetting program) or Times New Roman. Garamond is artistic and that is my choice as I want a relaxed look for my thesis. Also, I own it so would not have to spend extra money. If it is the right choice, what font you would choose for headers, a sans serif font or bold weight of Garamond? Thank you very much in advance for your time and help.   \n   \nRahul.\n\n",

However, I have more experience with Adobe Garamond than Classical.   \n   \nTiffany, since I don't know, do you think that Classical Garamond and Adobe Garamond SC can mesh?   \n   \nRahul, I applaud your desire to seek out something better. Back in college I used to use Centaur with non-default margins and line-spacing because TNR in Word settings was so painful. Professors would ask me how I made my papers so nice to read. The typography was sketchy, but even those adjustments made a big difference.   \n   \nMy experience with Garamond is that it can get tricky at smaller sizes because of its proportions and relatively fragile forms (as compared to TNR, which was designed to take abuse). This may not matter for what you're using it for, but be conscious of that, particularly if you're outputting on an inkjet or lower-res printer (which I was often forced to do).   \n   \nBecause I'm not a mathematician or a LaTeX user, I'd like to know what you're using for setting the equations. Are you going with Garamond, or a more specialized mathematics face?\n\n"

Garamond (which cut?) will work well as long as your point size isn't too small (unless you're using the obese ITC Garamond, in which case I can't help you :-). As for the headers, I'd recommend smallcaps too (you need a separate font though, don't use any automatic smallcaps method - they create discord) - not a bold weight of Garamond - those tend to look caricaturish. If you go for a sans, I've had good results pairing Garamond with Bank Gothic (a pretty ubiquitous font too), which might be especially good in your case since it's math stuff.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I would recommend looking at Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style, the section \"Choose a comfortable measure\" and the accompanying table (in my edition, p. 26-7, 29). After reading Bringhurst, I found in experimenting that the measure is indeed very important to comfort level in reading continuous text. If you are close in width to a 66 character line (Bringhurst explains how to measure this using his table), it really is a big benefit.   \n   \nOn A4 paper, a usual full width line is way too wide for comfort. With the narrower measure, you can use the margins for titles and notes, if your type setting software permits.   \n   \nThe other thing that is critical is the leading. Adjust it till you find it comfortable to the eye. Because Adobe Garamond has a relatively small x height, you will need less leading.   \n   \nIf you get the measure and leading right, it will right away look way better, and the rest you can do is gravy.   \n   \nHandling equations is a whole different can of worms, but I assume you have some materials on this.   \n   \nGood luck!\n\n"

Bringhurst has a whole chapter on all the mathematical ratios that have been historically tried for page and text blocks, and their positioning on the page. Not rules, but fascinating, especially for a mathematian, I would think. For example, he shows you how to put a golden rectangle text block on an A4 page, with a lot of white space around it, which will work great for you.   \n   \nYour running head with the rule defines the text block as wider. The outside margin is naked without something in it.   \n   \nYou can put something in it or make the rule shorter, and reposition the whole thing. I don't know the current size of your type, but you can certainly make it bigger (not much bigger though) if you like, as you will use the space better.   \n   \nBringhurst's book is an example of how to use margins. His way is traditional. It has been revived in many computer instruction books, which have wide pages with stuff in the wide margins. Basically you want an additional column outside the text block, with enough space between it and the text block to distinguish it, but not so much that it's not related. Then do the numbers or notes right aligned on the left page and left aligned on the right page, if you have a wide outside margin. You can just align the numbers with the head, sub head or first line of the equation.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm also writing a mathematical PhD thesis so this is a very interesting topic for me, although I'm in my first year now so I'm not actually writing up yet! Apart from the thorny issue of mathematical typesetting, one has to contend with restrictive and largely arbitrary layout regulations.   \n   \nFor example, my university mandates 12 pt text, with \"double or 1.5 spacing\" (which I suppoose means 12/18 at least). It must be printed recto only on A4 paper with all margins at least 15mm, and the left-hand (binding) margin 40mm or more.   \n   \nFor my [master's thesis](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825061327/http:/www.ma.man.ac.uk/~rhouston/msc.pdf), I used 12 pt Charter and Euler with a measure of 29 picas (to make a \"double square\" text block, as Bringhurst would have it). I'm sure there must be a better solution than this. I've been planning to try and put something together using one of the Adobe OpenType fonts, which have most of the glyphs you need for equations (e.g. swash caps and Greek letters). The only missing glyphs (apart from \"blackboard bold\" and blackletter) are the geometric symbols representing mathematical operators, which can easily be taken (perhaps slightly modified) from elsewhere, since they need only match the base font in weight and size. (The proportions and style are pretty fixed!) Adam Lindsay has done [some work](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825061327/http:/homepage.mac.com/atl/tex/OpenType.pdf) in this direction.   \n   \nFor blackboard bold, one could just eviscerate the ordinary bold uppercase.

The only two things that bother me are that Charter (a superb choice) doesn't seem to jive with the Palatino headings; and your footnotes are very cramped - the fact that you're needing a rule is telling - I think you can make the point size slightly smaller, but do track it looser as well, and if there's a semi weight use that.   \n   \n\\* I'd make the left bigger than the right though.   \n   \nBTW, that OpenType doc looks interesting.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It is too close to the page shape, which makes it dull. I think your old version, putting the heading numbers in the margins would look better, or following Bringhurst's design for a golden rectangle on A4 paper (which is the ratio 1 to sq. root 2).   \n   \nThe formula is this: the top and spine margin is 1/9th of the width of the page, and the bottom and outside margins are twice this. This will give you a golden rectangle in the text block, nicely positioned on the page. You can then adjust the size of your text to make this work.   \n   \nIn general, Bringhurst's principle is \"Shape the textblock so that it balances and contrasts with the overall shape of the page\". Usually, as with the above formula, the inner and top margins are less than what you have in relation to the bottom and outside margins. This assymetry 'locks' together the facing, bound pages.   \n   \nSome other comments: I think your rule at the top of the page is too thick. And your title page is too shy compared to your chapter titles. The classic thing would be to use letter spaced caps or caps & small caps, but that is only one idea.   \n   \nOverall, Bringhurst will give you guidance on many, many issues.\n\n"

      "content": "Having been through the PhD process myself, permit me to state the obvious: the design doesn't matter that much to you, because you are going to get your PhD based on content judged by people who are very knowledgable about that content. The visual 'sell' isn't that important to you. It is a good way to learn about typography, but not that important to this particular product.   \n   \nI don't think the current version works well. You have a number of elements that by themselves could work, but don't work together to make a coherent, balanced set of pages. The running head with the rule frames the page as having equal margins left and right. Then you have the text with outside margins over twice the inside margins, and with little use of them. The effect is unbalanced.   \n   \nIt might work with somewhat less of an outside margin and more of an inside margin, and the running head the same width as the text. But you have to try to see.   \n   \nIf you are going to put the numbers of the headings in the margins (as I had recommended as an option), I think will look better if they are right aligned on the left page and left aligned on the right page. Also I would try puting the equation numbers in the margins as well, if you are going to go that route.   \n   \nThe large bold numbers in the margins are distracting. They need to me more discrete (non bold or smaller size or both), or don't hang them in the margins. They need to be clearly subordinate if they are in the margins. Also I would check whether in labelling the heads lining (full height) numbers are better, especially if they hang in the margin.   \n   \nThe titles don't need to be both bold and big. The current large size and the way they are vertically spaced breaks the rhythm of the grid. Bringhurst recommends keeping everything in multiples of unit lines. That way lines on opposite pages line up with each other. Felici says you can also add half line gaps between paragraphs, and that way after two such they come back to the grid.   \n   \nYou have the luxury of so much space that I would stick to the grid. You can put heads in bold caps and sub heads lc bold in your normal size. Or, more classically, you can avoid bold altogether and use caps, small caps and italic as your options.   \n   \nHave fun playing with this, and don't worry about it!\n\n"
