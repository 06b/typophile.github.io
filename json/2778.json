  "content": "I'm sure this has been discussed, but my searches have turned up empty.   \n   \nIs there a way to change the properties of a font in Mac OS X? The reason I ask is that I've just purchased a font that came with several different weight variations. When the font is opened in FontBook, though, each variation is displayed as it's own unique font family.   \n   \nIs there a way for me to change this?   \n   \nThanks in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "You can use FontLab to change the info in the font header - Family name, Style name, etc. In lieu of that, I believe you can open the AFM file in a text editor and change the info there.   \n   \nI'm assuming that the Family name is something like 'Fontname-Regular'. If you want them to not be their own unique entries, then the Family name should be just 'Fontname' for each font, the Style name should be 'Regular', & the Font name should be 'Fontname Regular'. Same for the other members of the family (e.g., italic, bold, bold italic).   \n   \nIf you want a huge family (i.e., more than 4 members) to be contained in one family, you'll need to add OpenType names in FontLab. The family name for every font will be the same, and the Style names will all be different.   \n   \nMaybe this makes sense? I don't think I'm at my most lucid today ;-)\n\n"

For instance, Paralucent-Bold belongs to the family Paralucent-Bold. My goal is that it would belong to Paralucent.   \n   \nIs there another utility that can do this? Perhaps something without the $549 price tag? ;)\n\n"

You'll see something like this at the top:\n\n> StartFontMetrics 2.0   \n> FontName Paralucent-Italic   \n> FullName Paralucent Italic   \n> FamilyName Paralucent-Italic   \n> Weight Regular\n\nChange that info to this:\n\n> StartFontMetrics 2.0   \n> FontName Paralucent-Italic   \n> FullName Paralucent Italic   \n> FamilyName Paralucent   \n> Weight Regular\n\nNotice the change in FamilyName. Maybe that'll sort you out.   \n   \nBe sure you're not violating your EULA by modifying the information though.\n\n"

I'm pretty much Gumping my way through the learning process and have managed to create new fonts. However, they're all always titled \"UNTITLED\".\n\nI'd already gone in and edited the .AFM and .ini files, just like what's been mentioned above, however the .fog file that Fontographer uses to edit my fonts, doesn't seem to be communicating with the .AFM and .ini files. Essentially, when I attempt to Generate my font files, I've never given the option to actually \\_name\\_ my font or even create a new font family (goal #2).\n\nI realise i'm probably in the minority here with working on a pc and all, and i further realise there are newer versions of the software out there, but any pointing in the right direction would be most helpful.\n\nthanks muchly  \n/aae\n\n"
