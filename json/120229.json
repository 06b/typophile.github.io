That uppercase “J” breaking below the baseline got me in the right ballpark, but I suspect I'm just missing the obvious. Thanks in advance for any direction / help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/JMBH_C_Blk_5846.jpg)\n\nMatt D\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Lucida Sans Bold (manually slanted) \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114642/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks fvilanakis. I reviewed Lucida Sans Bold as well, and noticed the same inconsistencies. Stroke weights are off for the lowercase v (right side is thinner than specimen), but that might be one cut vs. another. I suspect (and as you mentioned re the manually slanting) that the letterforms have been altered.\n\nThanks for the assistance.\n\n"
