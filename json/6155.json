I would ask your friend it net was as important as stylus. My guess is it isn't. Take net out of the box make it smaller and maybe even tuck it under the us. Just some thoughts\n\n"

Stretched type-never a good idea.This could be a logo for anything- old ladies pantyhose, broadband service provider, and anything in between.   \nThe idea that the U and N align is the only thing   \nclever it has going for it. Start from scratch. Browse design annuals for concepts, check out logolounge for inspiration, etc....Remember, you should come up with something you can trademark, so be original.   \nGood luck, post again when you work this out.\n\n"

They dont really have any idea what they want..so its up to me.   \nThis new direction is basically trying to make a logo out of the letters SN, I think the idea is starting to work but would like your thoughts. I dont have any strong feelings about the colours (those were the first that looked ok) nor the font underneath.   \nThe rotation of the logo is what I really interested to hear about from you, should I keep it head on or try to force a little perspective from it.   \nIs it clear enough that its an S and and n?   \n   \nAnyway, I'll let you be the judge.   \nThanks a lot everyone!   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111302im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47521.gif)\n\n"

Go to this link and see how 2advanced used the same letterform for the icon: [http://2advanced.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019111302/http:/2advanced.com/) . Honestly the icon you have now seems unoriginal. If you were to keep the icon, the font underneath needs to be more blocky (like eurostyle, bank gothic, itc blair etc.)\n\n"
