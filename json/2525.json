  "content": "A bit of a posting spree here...   \n   \nAnother MT font, similar in style to Dorothy. Like the majority of my fonts, I designed it with decorative useage in mind. However, I find that it doesn't look that bad set as a text font. Sort of a stylized Sans or something.   \n   \nThe numbers need a bit of work, I think, but on the whole, I enjoy the balance of this character set. Perhaps the lc x and uc x and y betray the rounded style of the other characters?   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414183048im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22974.gif)\n\n",
