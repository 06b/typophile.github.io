I already visited all the links.\n\nThanks Stephen for your welcome and the suggestion (funny one).  \nActually I’m looking for stop-motion examples, but based mostly on animated letters than in words... I want to prepare an assignment for my students, and this is why I’m collecting some examples.\n\nLook at this site:  \n [http://nejib.uing.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924093444/http:/nejib.uing.net/ \"http://nejib.uing.net\")\n\nInspired on Norman MacLaren movies, which I like a lot!\n\nlaura\n\n"
