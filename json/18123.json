The theme for this year's club is Paws, Claws, Scales, and Tails.\n\nThis is all play right now, so no flyer or tickets yet.\n\nI guess I want to know first if you can read it easily.  \nIt's display size only, and won't be used as a logo.\n\nAre the primary colors distracting? First character too angled?\n\nYour feedback is appreciated.\n\nAndrew\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Regal.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106092957/http:/typophile.com/files/Regal.pdf) | 182.42 KB |\n\n",

I agree with Tiffany about the spots. It might not be neccessary. Since everything is abstract, I don't think it would be a bad idea to just make the \"d\" look like a \"d\" and add characteristics of a giraffe but putting the tail at the tail of the letter. Also, lower the stem of the \"a\".\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106092957im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Regal6.gif)\n\n"

Right now it looks a bit noncommittal. It looks like it's meant to be verticle and is slightly at an angle on accident.\n\nGreat job!\n\n"
