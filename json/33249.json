A search doesn’t turn up much of interest, but it appears in a lot of German pages with the spelling “Cäcelia” so I guess it would be like “zezelia” or something.\n\nNote: At some point German started using “ä” for the digraph “ae” (when it represents a single sound), so Latin words and names, like Caecelia, that were borrowed before that time also sometimes ended up with “ä” (though many names didn’t change).\n\n"
