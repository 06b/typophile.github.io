  "content": "William Berkson is a philosopher and author of Fields of Force, Learning from Error, and the forthcoming Avot: Ancient Wisdom for Modern Life. He caught the type virus as a teenager from his Uncle J. Ben Lieberman, founder of the American Printing Historical Society, and author of Types of Typefaces. The slow acting virus became virulent when he turned 60, and he became a real “man of letters,” by drawing Williams Caslon for Font Bureau. He lives on Lake Anne in Reston, Virginia, where he sits at his computer and produces letters and words.\n\n",
