I found these looking in the Sign Lettering section of the Script Font ID Guide:\n\n[Geis](http://web.archive.org/web/20061111004730/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/geis/) from Galapagos, by George Ryan\n\n[Cyrano Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20061111004730/http:/www.unifonts.com/c_texhtm/cyranomodernregtex.htm) by Victor De Castro, Unifonts.\n\n[Arjorie](http://web.archive.org/web/20061111004730/http:/www.unifonts.com/a_pages/arjoriemedium.htm), also by Victor De Castro, Unifonts.\n\nIn my opinion both these guys are artists, who put a lot of personality into their fonts.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
