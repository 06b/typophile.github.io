I later realized there are absolutely no benefits included, and I'm paid on an hourly wage rather than a 40 hr work week because we are not needed to work everyday. There is a slew of other freelance designers that come every few days. One designer with nearly a decade of experience was being paid $25/hr while another with only a couple years more experience than me is being paid $30/hr. After realizing my position is financially no different than those of the freelance designers I requested being changed to a freelance position. However they agreed and want to continue paying me $15/hr for the work.\n\nEditorial design understandably does pay less than that of ad agencies. However, I think $15/hr even for a start out designer is ridiculously low in this market, especially in NYC. Any advice?\n\n"

There are too many design schools graduating too many students and too many of them have wealthy parents who can support them after college. And too many of those design students graduate without the high-tech skills they need to get a job because they spent their time in school focusing on conceptual fundamentals instead of keeping up-to-date with web trends. So some entry-level design jobs here can pay under $30,000 with _no_ benefits. And low-end freelance work sometimes goes for $15/hour or less if the client is a small publisher or fashion house with its own budget problems.\n\n"
