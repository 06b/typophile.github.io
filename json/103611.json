  "content": "Helloooo!\n\nI really love the look of these letters, identifont suggested Schneidler EF (1936) as the closest match although it is not exact. I mean that S is pretty loopy.\n\nAs this is architecture from 1916, I am now having doubts... Is this even a font? (Alternatively, has someone made it into one?)\n\nThank you so much for your time!\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MIT\\_Building\\_10.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014094723/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MIT_Building_10.jpg \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MIT\\_Building\\_10.jpg\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MITbuilding10.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014094723/http:/typophile.com/files/MITbuilding10.jpg) | 100.29 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "This was the era where major architects developed their own lettering styles. The architect of the new MIT campus, William W. Bosworth, modelled this building after the Pantheon in Rome. I suspect that the inscription is his idea of an improved version of the Trajan column lettering, designed to be effective as a monumental incised design. Note that C and G have almost horizontal strokes on the right hand side. If I recall correctly this was not found in American typefaces of the day. But perhaps I missed something?  \nDon\n\n"
