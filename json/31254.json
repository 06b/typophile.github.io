Don't know what is the hen or the egg. See for example [this discussion](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022094616/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=43341) at WTF.\n\nEDIT: As I see now, there ARE differences between Liana and Mr. Lackboughs. Sorry for that.  \nEDIT2: Ah, Mike Y has also [valuable background information](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022094616/http:/typophile.com/node/9942) on this font. So roostertypes has it as [Lady Dawn](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022094616/http:/www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=19848&issingle=yes).\n\n"
