Help!\n\nSample A:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015011608im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample3_6094.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015011608im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample2_6244.jpg)\n\nMy first thought was Trajan Pro or LaGioconda, but neither of those fit. Trajan Pro is very close, but the lower right serif on the capital A does not extend at all to the right in the sample. The font in the sample also appears to be squarer in its proportions.\n\nSample B:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015011608im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample1_4412.jpg)\n\nI hope I'm not missing something obvious on this one. I thought maybe in the Garamond family, but nope.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
