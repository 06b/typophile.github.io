It is essentially a responce to the Lars Muller Hommage to Helvetica book with the aim of giving Univers its due as a true type great.\n\nI am making good progress but am sure that i am still only scratching the surface, if anyone has any good examples of its use (pictures or details) I would love to be made aware of them.\n\nWil\n\n",

Or so he says :)\n\nThe fact that Helvetica was the cheaper typeface to license for the Linotype machine in America made the decision that effects us all today. Had Univers been cheaper, Parker would have decided to go with it because of its then obvious advantages of the number of styles. Helvetica at that point was only a few cuts compared to the family of 21 of Univers.\n\n"
