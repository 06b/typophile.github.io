  "content": "Hi,  \nI am new to this forum and would like to ask your opinion/critiques on my new logo for a small design agency. The older one was created some time ago and now I'm not fully satisfied with it. It doesn't work very well on small sizes and looks a little bit old-fashioned to me. I've created several new versions with a modern look but can't decide which will work better.\n\nTo keep continuity with the old logo I used same red and gray. The font is also the same.\n\nWhat logo do you think suits best for a small design studio? Do you have any negative associations with any of these logos? Any thoughts and opinions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo-0-old_4548.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo-1_6547.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo-2_4884.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo-3_5135.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi and thanks a lot for the feedback! You guys are really very helpful!\n\nIt's good to know that somebody likes the old logo :-). What if to make slight modifications of it and remove letters in order to solve problem with small sizes and add a star to the red square for the sake of a visual accent. I see star as a symbol of an achievement reachable through hard work, dedication and talent (hope it's not much trite and commonplace). And then it is probably better to move a red square to the right to the end of the usual direction of eye movement.\n\nWhat do you think of this? Is this version any better? Does the old logo looks old-fashioned to you? I feel the need for a more modern look buy maybe I'm plain wrong.\n\nI also made a version of the old logo without media at the bottom as JamesM suggested.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo-rev_4842.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Personally, I still prefer the version with letters (the star _is_ overused and in this instance gives me a Texas/military vibe). However, the letters look misaligned.  \nFor the text part, I think you should try to move “media” under “YULA”.\n\n"

      "content": "I'd keep the letters too. I've seen plenty of logo concepts aren't legible in a small size, but I don't think yours is that much of a problem. Does the overall width (symbol + name) create a problem in narrow layouts? Maybe you could make an alternate version with the name stacked below the symbol.\n\nAgree with Riccardo that the letters look misaligned. And I like it without \"media\" below it.\n\n"
