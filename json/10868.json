This sign derives from the Roman judicial shorthand system developed by Marcus Tullius Tiro, Cicero's scribe and namesake of a certain type foundry. The top of the Tironian ampersand is aligned to the x-height. Sometimes it descends below the baseline, looking like -- sometimes too much like -- an oldstyle number seven; in other examples it stops at the baseline. All Gaelic fonts should contain this characters. Note that it has its own Unicode codepoint, U+204A, to distinguish it from the usual ampersand, because it is sometimes found in texts used alongside the modern form.\n\n"

This site is a school project of a christian monk monastery.   \n   \nThe letters and ligatures derived from historical hand written sources and help to read and decode the old latin scripts from the library.   \n   \nThe project was inspired by same samples from a book restorage. In the upcoming time of letter print, most of the original scripts used or cuted to repair the \"new\" and \"better\" printed books. Nowadays some of such historical samples will be found in such early printed books if they will be restored again.   \n   \nLike yesterday or so, some new unknown samples of the \"hildebrands lied\" are found in an Austrian monastery.   \n   \nSo, these samples are for historical research only and not samples for new fonts designs. :-)   \n   \nBack to the topic - It`s interesting to see such historical forms.\n\n"
