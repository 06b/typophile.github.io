Engineer friend had no idea what movie we were seeing until we told her, on the steps of IFC, that we were seeing a movie about Helvetica. A long silence. A blank look. And then finally a glare. To make things worse, we arrived late and couldn’t sit together.\n\nShe didn’t NOT enjoy herself, though..but she has made it clear several times over that she would have liked to see a “real” movie. Heh.\n\n"
