  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been asked to vector a logo for a company, I was sent this image and was asked how much I would charge to vector it ( in GBP £). I think the font might be frutiger but I'm not 100% sure. I also don't have the license to frutiger and I'm not sure they do either.\n\nHow much money do you think I should be charging to vector a logo like that and what do you think I should do about the font license? Could I get away with just pen tooling it? If I vector this image for them, who is liable for the font? Could I get in trouble?  \nIf someone else designed the font for them, am I allowed to effectively copy their work?\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [electrovapours\\_logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019014421/http:/typophile.com/files/electrovapours_logo.png) | 164.73 KB |\n\n",

Purchase a license; if you don’t need anything else from the family just the single weight. The job will be done so much faster and accurately. We have a saying here in Belgium that roughly translates as: “Avarice betrays wisdom.” (It rhymes in Dutch). :)\n\n"
