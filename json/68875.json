Any and all, really.\n\nThings I'm mostly pondering right now and could use a little ideas on: stylistic diversity is a bit messy; stylistic \"oddities\" are lacking a bit too much perhaps; italic is on the drawing board, but still rather formative — know of things that make sense here? Thanks!\n\n(The name is a working title. I prefer having utterly irrelevant working titles, for some reason.)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Sample 2010-03-27](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202951/http:/typophile.com/files/Sample_2010-03-27_0.pdf) | 21.12 KB |\n| [Sample\\_2010-05-19.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202951/http:/typophile.com/files/Sample_2010-05-19.pdf) | 73.01 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "A very good overall design, but I don't like the combination between some very traditional, rounded terminals (/a/f/r/s/) with the unusual, contemporary cut of other elements (for example, upper right serif of /k/v/w/x/y). As you used a sharp cut in other parts (/b/d/u/) and uneven serifs (/m/n/) it may be more harmonic to use not-so-rounded terminals.\n\nDiacritics (acute/grave/circumflex) are misplaced. You can take a look on Slimbach's serif fonts to verify an optimal placement of these diacritics. Observe that this taller style of acute/grave will demand a different shape in uppercases.\n\nI like your /k/p/m/n/h/K/R, but /g/ seems distorted and /e/ is falling to the right.\n\nComma seems identical to Greta's.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, guys.\n\n@riccard0: Working on them. Seems right on all points.  \n@Freiberger: I understand why the terminals could bother you. I'm going for a transition-kind of letter, a seventies' Baskerville perhaps, which suits itself to rounded terminals. In the /C/G/S/ I do use different terminals. Maybe that's a starting point. Not sure about the diacritics yet (angle especially), but willing to see specific examples if you can find them. /g/ has been under constant revision ever since the start, which might be a sign. /e/ gets two counts here, which says a lot. Thanks.\n\nRe: Greta: hadn't seen that at all. That might very well be the only thing it has in common then. Thanks again. Keep 'em coming. I know I will.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm myself developing a serif family and /g/ is by far the most difficult character to me. It took me dozens of revisions until I got a decent design.\n\nThe comma got my attention because I like very much the shape you used.\n\nAbout diacritics, the main problem is not with angle but with position. Acute and grave are not centered or aligned to character limits. They must be slight dislocated from the center to te direction the accent points to. You can use a rule like this: acute have one third of its length to the left of middle and two thirds to the right. The opposite with grave.\n\nOf course this is a very general rule. You can adopt different positions and, except for extremes, it would not be incorrect. But some positions works better than others. Take Minion, Times and Meta Serif: each one has a different criteria, but I think Minion works much better (as I'm a native Portuguese speaking, I use acute, grave, tilde, circumflex, cedilla and dieresis regularly).\n\nYou may also consider acute and grave to be shorter if you plan an extensive language support. Letters with two diacritics above will need very much room over uppercase limit.\n\n"

      "content": "Ah, yes. Yes, positions are terrible. You're right. They're not high-priority at the moment as I'm mainly trying to get the shapes and metrics right. Thanks for the pointers.\n\nRe: language support. That's the part that's vexing me. I want to use this face for my own print things (10pt text and the works), but supporting many different languages is more than logical as a selling point. I don't know where I got the idea for the highly slanted acute (well, it's in my handwriting), but I was happy to discover it in Trinité and Lexicon. Dutch typefaces. Go figure.\n\nHere are some updates. A pointy, pointed-pen-inspired terminal that has some of the sharpness other shapes have as well (/&/g/k/) and some more.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202951im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen_2010-03-28_5426.gif)\n\n"

Maybe that is due to the fact that the typeface hasn't been kerned? The single words doens't look \"isolated\" enough in the line of text. I guess you should work on that issue - the relationship of space between glyphs pairs and between words. Besides that, it looks like a nice typeface.\n\n"
