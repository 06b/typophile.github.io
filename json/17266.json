I was fooled at first, which I hope says more about my knowledge of fashion designers than my knowledge of type. I suspect Jean-François is still laughing at me. He sent me a sample and asked me what I thought of this Chalet guy’s work. Well, what I thought was that he had ripped off Helvetica for his entire 1960 line.\n\n"

I didn’t think to check the name, and while the history of art was a part of my curriculum at school, fashion designers didn’t figure in much. Oh I confess I’m so gullible.
