With FF Speak, Maack wanted to capture the tone of voice of youthful conversation. He created smooth but lively [letterform](http://web.archive.org/web/20140410091404/http:/typophile.com/wiki/letterform)s that would evoke different intonations depending on the weights and ligatures used. FF Speak features light, regular, bold, and heavy weights with companion italics.\n\n",
