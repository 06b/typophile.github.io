I'm not sure I like this type.\n\nDesigner: Oh? (sigh) What don't you like about it?\n\nBoss: You designers are always using this kind of type with the pokey parts on them...\n\nDesigner: Um, you mean serifs?\n\nBoss: Yeah, whatever. I don't like type with those things on them. Can't you use something more funky or splashy?\n\nDesigner: Well...\n\nBoss: I don't want to see type with those things on them anymore. Show me something else before you leave.

I am the only person in the shop who takes work home, and often I do so more than 3 nights a week.\n\nUntil I started there, they were still using Quark 6.5, and CS for retouching and layout. Additionally, they were shooting images (for hi-res) in jpg. I have done my best to bring them up to date, and go on press with every print job I run. Even still, mistakes happen. I have yet to figure out how to prepare for the owner randomly realizing that the 300+ pg book he is supposed to run the next day is too large to fit economically on the paper he bought; subsequently giving me 2 hours to shrink the whole thing by .25 on one side. This is of course not to mention the times he gets angry at himself (the source of most of the dysfunction), and throws the laser printer or the postal scale.\n\nI will continue to work hard, and push myself, because that's what I do. The part that stung me this afternoon was that after all i am expected to do (retouching, concept, layout, illustration, copy writing, etc), my retarded boss gets indignant about a \"pokey thing\". As if to say the sum total of my knowledge doesn't prepare me to be a designer simply because i chose a serif. Not that he can even _say_ serif.\n\nI know that all of this will make me better, I just don't want to be colored by the mistakes i try so hard to prevent.

If it's your own business that fine to strive to do the best and stop when you are happy with the work.\n\nI've had clients and bosses stand over me as I've worked and nearly direct me with every node placement, only for them to say they love the crap they directed me in doing.  \nIn times like this I couldn't approach it from a French Chef's point of view and take the work to heart and start jumping up and down that the work should be better. I just had to let go and keep the client and boss happy.\n\nAll Designers need to learn to let go of their preciousness at times, and pick when to stand and fight for good design.\n\nI've always found that if explain the problems early or the ugliness of certain decisions you can talk some bosses or clients around. That comes with experience.\n\nOne thing you will never get around, are blind clients and bosses who want to see the mistake or bad decision before you make it. Some people have no vision or imagination and don't trust yours.  \nNumerous times I've told a client or boss that a certain look or graphic decision, or even production decision, won't work, only to have to show them on screen or through proofs. Now that's a waste of time.\n\nBut you can always be smart, and direct or coerce a client or boss without them even knowing it!! Set that as your plan early, do error free work, tell them things they want to hear, explain your designs and decisions...and you've got them by the nether regions!!  \nAnd that's where your true power lies.\n\nGood Luck going forward  \n_tearsforsappho_\n\n"
