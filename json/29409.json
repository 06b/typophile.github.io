I’d love to find the font used on the Sokol Blosser winery’s Evolution No. 9.\n\nHere’s a link to a pic:\n\n[http://sokolblosser.com/images/image\\_library/Evolution-bottle\\_349.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071226184646/http:/sokolblosser.com/images/image_library/Evolution-bottle_349.jpg \"http://sokolblosser.com/images/image\\_library/Evolution-bottle\\_349.jpg\")\n\nI’d apparently make a reasonably lousy private (or public, for that matter) detective as repeated attempts at locating this rogue typeface have turned up snake eyes. Welcome any guidance any of you may have. Thanks!\n\n [‹ whose eyes!!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20071226184646/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29408 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [greek old style !! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071226184646/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19895 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I thought it might be from [Solotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20071226184646/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/solotype/), but didn’t find a match.
