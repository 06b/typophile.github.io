  "content": "Hi you all,\n\nI'm trying to get an OT-TTF embedded in Microsoft Office. Is there a way to get it done?  \nAs far as I get it embeds in PowerPoint (Office 2003 and 2007) but no way to get it embedded in Word (2003 nor 2007).  \nFontValidator doesn't report any critical error.  \nI could follow a topic in this forum about this issue but there wasn't any final solution-conclusion.\n\nAnybody had these problems and have any light for the path to solve them?  \nMany thanks for your help,\n\nJoancarles, BaseLab\n\n",
