Would be nice to hook up for some drinks with the local Typophiles, too.\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Video game posters at USC's GamePipe](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013021/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33711 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [cover letters? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013021/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33654 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m afraid the other things I did were the more traditional touristy things — but if you’re interested in those kinds of things, the [Taronga Zoo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709013021/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taronga_Zoo) was incredible. I’ve never seen such amazing animals in my life, but if you’re going to be with nature for two weeks, you may want a bit more of human culture in Sydney.\n\n"
