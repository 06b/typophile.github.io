  "content": "Hi everyone - I’ve designed some logos for a US company, and they’re getting them made into vinyl stickers (like the Oakley stickers people have in their car windows for example). Anyway, the company that does the stickers uses Corel 8, and a program I’ve never heard of before - Omega. Now, I’m sending them eps file & pdf files, both of which they say they can’t open in Corel, and if it won’t open in Corel they say they can’t use the file...  \nSo here are my two questions;\n\nfirst off, what version of Illustrator eps (version 7, 8, 9?) do I need to save my logos as in order that Corel can accept them?\n\nSecondly, does anyone know of this Omega program? If I can find info out about it, then maybe the company can skip the Corel side of the process and take the file straight into Omega.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nJH\n\n [‹ Ligatures show up on screen, but...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705163528/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44414 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [100 years of... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705163528/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44375 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m guessing he has a really old version of Gerber Omega otherwise he would (surely) bypass Corel and just drop the eps files right in there - unless there’s a stage I’m not aware of that need Corel.\n\nThanks again!\n\nJH\n\n"

I’ve used an older version of a program by Gerber called Composer for vinyl cutting and it rarely opened, or imported, .AI files, regardless of the version. Illustrator 3 EPS files seemed to do the trick, I’m hoping that’s been worked out in some of the newer software but who knows.\n\n"
