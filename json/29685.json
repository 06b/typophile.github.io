  "content": "Hi  \nSorry to bother you with yet another InDesign problem.\n\nWhen I put a decimal tab in a line, the line breaks too early. Problem is, when i move the dec.tab rightwards, the line breaks long (that means 3-4 millimeters before the '0' meets the text box \"wall\". take a look at the picture below.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019124905im_/http:/typophile.com/files/post-18-98187-dectab_6325.jpg)\n\nall margins and paddings etc are set to zero.\n\nDoes anyon know how to solve this without changing the width of the text box, and preferrably without using tables?\n\nbest,\n\nalex\n\n",
