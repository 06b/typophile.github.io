It appears on the metal plaques used for street names etc, I cant find anything exactly like it anywhere, it looks very similar to some of the DIN typefaces, but has several subtle differences.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Unknown-TypeFace.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20101215175835/http:/typophile.com/files/Unknown-TypeFace.gif) | 87.97 KB |\n\n",
