If you do illustration and graphic design, simply send the appropriate variation to the potential employer. Would king of make me go ‘duh!’\n\nIf you got rid of ‘graphic design resume’ I would try bringing your address line to a subhead level in some way.\n\nMaybe an ‘objective’ heading before ‘work experience’\n\nAnd actually, the whole thing feels very left-heavy. Maybe reduce the width of your column and center? Keep it flush left,more than a few lines feel like they want to fall off.\n\nI wonder, if you just chuck the ’ gdr ‘part and move the contact info up. It’s actually a double whammy, because who ever is looking at it will be like, yes, you are OBVIOUSLY applying for a gd position, and yes, i AM looking at a Resumé. So, chuck it.\n\nAnd I think where it says the part about online samples should go to, that’s something that should be worked into the cover letter and removed from resume, which should always go out with a res.\n\nmy thoughts.\n\np.s.- where on spruce do you live? I used to live there when I went to school for a while? Landmark?\n\n"

      "content": "I’m with Eric concerning the left-heavy-ness (not only is the main text-block way too far left, but the caption under your name-plate is also contributing to the pull leftward).\n\nAlso, the whole thing feels a bit loose. There’s a lot of breeze flowing between your headings & subheads, and between the subs and sub-subs, which is actually making the information clusters _less_ easy to distinguish.\n\nHopefully this won’t sound too harsh, but I suppose I’m wondering: if you’re a graphic designer, where’s the evidence in the design of the resumé? I’m not saying you should turn the thing into a full-colour, full-bleed poster, but while you’ve used a few distinctive fonts, the layout looks a bit like, well, an MSWord template, and the typography is riddled with bugs.\n\nFor example: your work descriptions are sentences and sentences require periods. And, you’ve got small caps in your parenthetical dates, but not in the Awards listing (and track the small caps out a bit). And get rid of the italic on the parentheses, or at least kern in the right-parens. And change those hyphens in the dates to en-dashes. (To mention a few…)\n\nAlso, I’d definitely get your contact info up top.\n\n"

      "content": "Without discussing content, I think you should re-think how the resume looks. It is typically the first piece an employer sees of your work. It’s purpose is to interest the employer into wanting to see your portfolio (electronic or printed). To that end, this is your first chance to showcase your design skills. It should be as “design-y” as your website or your business card.\n\nRemember, any employer you send this resume to already has an active interest in graphic design and/or typography.\n\n"

Before my type design life I was a publications design director in charge of too many magazines. Here are my thoughts…\n\nDrop the art work at the top. Its not very good lettering, and why start off with a less than fabulous impression. (I always threw away resumes that looked too designed).\n\nFlesh out your descriptions of your previous work experience. If you had a career spanning a few decades, it might make sense to sum it up briefly, but I would think the opposite is necessary in your case.\n\nInstead of the lettering, concentrate on the typographic details. Show in a subtle way that you have command of typographic organization and hierarchy. In CV 3 the heads are too large against the body type.\n\nGood luck,\n\nJames\n\n"

What was good in the latest version will stick in your mind, and you may come up with solutions that are invisible while staring at the current attempt.\n\nAnd no input on the next (new) version. At the moment much of the work in the lastest version is not your own (it was suggested/directed). Scrap it and do it solo from scratch, so that when you hand it to a potential employer, you’ll know and feel good that what you’re handing them is yours.\n\n"

Elaborate more on your previous job duties. This is good practice at your advertising skills. Use fancy adjectives to make your jobs sound more glamorous.\n\nAlso, your business card needs work.

It gives a bad first impression (ex: “indpndent” under Thayer Academy unless that’s a funky title?) - plus if you do any production work, style of writing is as important as the typography. As a rule of thumb, when writing lists use the same tense, i.e. change “funding, faculty advisor, obtaining software, mission of class, curriculum” to something like “procuring funds, obtaining software, developing curriculum…”. I now work as in design and production and my most successful interviews were gleaned from targeted resumes. If I was targeting a corporation, I went more clean in my layout. If it was an interactive firm, I kept it brief on written and sent links to my url. Be sure to show your strengths - and you’ll get the call.\n\n"

Don’t get me wrong, I agree with Datura, in that the thing that others haven’t thought of is simply doing the job well, but the drive to be different is too often viewed as the goal in itself. The phrase I use in class is “effective yet understated,” and I have to say it often because understatement seems to be a bad word.\n\n"
