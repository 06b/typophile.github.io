      "content": "I don't think this was based on a pre-existing font. The p's are just inverted d's. The line weight and end strokes are inconsistent. The G is just horribly outlined, and really bumpy. I think the l was flipped for some reason. The stroke on the o is as thick as the G.\n\nIf it was based on a font, it was then horribly mangled into what we see today.\n\nI would believe that it was hand done and then scanned digitally.\n\nFor something similar, you might want to check : [http://www.sudtipos.com/home](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113044353/http:/www.sudtipos.com/home \"http://www.sudtipos.com/home\")\n\n"
