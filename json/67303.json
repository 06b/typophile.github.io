  "content": "Hi\n\nA customer is trying to embed a set of eight TT fonts all of which have installable embedding set. All the fonts have the same glyph set and index order, the default glyphs are all correct and MS FontValidator does not return any errors, yet from within MS Publisher four show as 'will embed' and four show as 'may not embed'. The customer has been reporting inconsistent results across different machines when trying to embed.\n\nDoes anyone know what might be upsetting Publisher?\n\ntia  \nM\n\n",

The client preferred to have TTF OpenType fonts which ment that the Platform 3 FullName should have been without the hyphen.\n\nMy way of working is always to work with the OpenType names records directly.\n\nI think that MSPublisher is the only application that baulks at this but I may be wrong.\n\nM\n\n"

      "content": "No Adam, I'm not saying that MSPublisher has a problem \"seeing\" them.\n\nMSPublisher seems to have a problem recognising TTF fonts as embedable when they carry a hyphen in the Windows Full Name (4.3.1.1033), even when the correct embedding bits have been set. The \"embedability\" of fonts is displayed in the 'Tools\\>Commercial Printing Tools\\>Fonts' dialog of MSPublisher.\n\nI have not been able to do extensive research into this problem suffice to say that changing the 4.3.1.1033 field in these TTF's by changing the hyphen to a space caused the 'Tools\\>Commercial Printing Tools\\>Fonts' dialog to show them as 'embedable' where before they were shown as 'may not embed'.\n\nM\n\n"
