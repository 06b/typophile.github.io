This applies to both which toolbars are on, and what's on the toolbars.   \n   \nIt would be nice if it saved the UI state when you exit the UI customization.   \n   \nT\n\n"

(besides the toolbars shifting around on me all the time) i found it again though, i think there's a button on the bottom left hand side i had to click to get that magnifying glass back. i couldn't find it in the drop down menus anywhere...\n\n"
