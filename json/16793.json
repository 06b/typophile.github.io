I thought it was “Georgia” but I can’t quite match up the new text with the old.  \n Let me just say that I’m a photoshop novice so you know my skill level. I’ve tried changing the “vertical and horizontal” scales but the “Georgia” still seems to be different. (more narrow).  \n Any help on the “Golf Guide” font would be appreciate.  \nThanks,  \nTom\n\n"
