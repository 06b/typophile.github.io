  "content": "After TpG's event in Buenos Aires a few guys from here began to think that a foundry project is possible. So, we started a collective foundry. We called it Sudtipos ( [http://www.sudtipos.com.ar](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020145748/http:/www.sudtipos.com.ar/)). We hope you like it. The catalogue includes a beautiful treasure from Mr. Koziupa, a 63-year-old lettering guy that never made a digital font before.\n\n",
