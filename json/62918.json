No one had come up with [Goudy Mediaeval](http://web.archive.org/web/20100924174825/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/richard_beatty/goudy_mediaeval/), in one of its lesser revivals, as a better match than “Magic Cards” for the title font. Even though, ostensibly, that is what the card designers used here. But, of course, you wanted a match for the numerals, so I didn’t chime in before you wisely tracked that one down.\n\nRest assured – I finally found those for you.\n\nBefore I get to that, though, I want to offer that the distinctive numerals in the set we had to work with are the _0_ and the _3_. All the others – including the _5_, albeit in condensed form and with a downward-pointing lower terminal – to a great degree emulate the structure of any [Old English](http://web.archive.org/web/20100924174825/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/old-english/) font and its dozens of freely available knockoffs and derivatives who’s creators had no qualms about ripping off numerals. Just sayin’.\n\nWithout further ado: You’ll be hard pressed to find a more exact match than [Boere Tudor](http://web.archive.org/web/20100924174825/http:/www.sulucas.net/fonts.htm). Unless, of course, you can track down the designer of “the first Afrikaans family magazine, _Die Brandwag_” that inspired Su Lucas to create it!\n\n_~ William Leverette_\n\n"
