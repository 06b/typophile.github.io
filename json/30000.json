And if so, what about position of the shapes, colour, size? Is there anything I could improve?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [square.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416030506/http:/typophile.com/files/square.jpg) | 95.43 KB |\n| [square.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416030506/http:/typophile.com/files/square.pdf) | 198.24 KB |\n\n",

The same goes for the space above the red text.  \nAlso, you might want to move the \"cut\" a bit up/down for the first/last line so the \"e\" gets cut over right under/over the horizontal line.  \nOtherwise I think it looks good!\n\n"
