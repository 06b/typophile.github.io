  "content": "Hi There,  \nThis is my first post here so pardon me if I've missed any etiquette.  \nI have a logo mark which is in development which must be a 3 spoke design representing the 'Y' character. Each spoke is equal length and angle and I'm having difficulty matching it to a font and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720183008im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202013-04-11%20at%2013_5835.03.28.png)\n\nI'm really looking for a font where this shape will fit in nicely as the 'Y'. If needs be I'll design a font around it but I was really hoping there was something out there which would fit it.\n\nThanks very much for any suggestions.\n\nA\n\n",
