  "content": "Does anyone know of and recommend any schools with typography programs in Texas?\n\nI live in Austin, TX and my addiction to type design grows stronger every day. Problem is, I have no formal education on the subject. Books have been a lot of help, but I would really like to take some classes or in some way learn from someone more learned than I.\n\nAlso, are there any Texas based type foundries or studios that perhaps I could look into?\n\nThanks for any information you can provide,\n\nDuncan\n\n",

I attend Northwestern State University of Louisiana, and can't _not_ recommend it enough. Not that the professors are bad, but the rest of the faculty is simply out-and-out useless if you ever have a problem that it is their job to solve (which you will, because they are completely inept.)\n\n"

If you ask me, a lot of their work can be very expected and redundant, but the type is usually handled very well. It's in Denton, a small town near Dallas, which has a very strong design community. Not too terribly far from Austin. Good luck!\n\n"
