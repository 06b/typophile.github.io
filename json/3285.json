  "content": "I think it's custom, but I think it might be easy to make if these are all the letters you need. The 'a' looks like a reversed G. The M looks like it could have been made by inverting the 'u' and extending the strokes, then overlaying it with the same new character. A flattened version of [TC Europa](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142737/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205099) could be a starting point to create this. Other squared fonts might work even better.   \n   \nIf you don't see any other letters, then I think this is a custom job for sure.\n\n",

You can see my skill with outline manipulation in Illustrator is not very polished, but this only took about 15 minutes.   \n ![Mau Europa Simulation](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142737im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27204.gif)\n\n"
