It's fine for most things, because most of the applications I use have scaleable menus, etc. The palettes in InDesign are a bit tiny because they don't scale, but it does mean that my actual work space is nice and big. Windows itself lets me set global preferences for icon and UI font sizes, and most apps use these.   \n   \nThe only thing that really bugs me are website designers who specify type in fixed pixel sizes: a failure to understand the nature of the medium for which one is designing.
