  "content": "So, after spending almost my entire evening, figuring out what was wrong with uploading my .pdf file on Typophile I finally decided to make a screen capture (i can’t believe how slow I can be sometimes…lol) so this is only 2 slighly different versions of the new design of my business cards…\n\nAnd here is my first post :  \n“Guys, you made my day (refering to the Kursivschrift discussion in the tatoo icon topic [http://typophile.com/node/27828](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829144131/http:/typophile.com/node/27828 \"http://typophile.com/node/27828\"))!  \nI finally decided to purchase Kursivschrift from Linotype and I am very (very) happy about it.  \nNow, may I ask for your comments about this new business card of mine, I’m still hesitating between the different “versions”. It is going to be offset printed on transparent Cromatico™ paper.  \nThanks in advance.  \n(I was also thinking to use Digital Kauno’s “@”)”\n\nPS : The other versions I wanted to show you at the begining were not very different from these 2, only “DESIGN CARE” and my eMail address were either white on one or 50% yellow on the other. Well, anyway, let me know what you think… Thanxxx\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [capturebcards.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829144131/http:/typophile.com/files/capturebcards.jpg) | 936.93 KB |\n\n [‹ constructive criticism wanted for trajan book title](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829144131/http:/typophile.com/node/28079 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [bCards Hall of Fame ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829144131/http:/typophile.com/node/27867 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Te ornament is too clip art, is it adobe wood type? there’s a cafe here in oslo, right around the corner that has exactly the same ornament. I think the photograph, the “me”/”my website” and the ornament are competing, not complementing each other. kill some darlings, and reenliven them for a project where they are useful.\n\ngood luck!:)\n\nalex\n\n"

I was wondering more about the layout of the bCard rather than the logotype itself. I am going to post the other color versions in an hour or so. I like better the first version too and I’m just wondering about the arobase...  \nAnyway, other critics are welcome.\n\nPS : At the begining Dr Duckling was the name of a (successful) graphic project that I did (print, web, tees) about taking CARE of the environment (nature heath care...) and I just kept it when I started my freelance activity as it felt right to...\n\n"

      "content": "This may be because we haven’t seen the comps in colour, but to my mind the design feels messy: the out-of-focus-and-cropped image, the quirky font used for the logotype and address, the skewed and jumbled glyphs, the scribbled notes, the arrangement and proximity/distance of the text elements. You might be shooting for quirky, but really it just seems messy to me. The thing with self-promo projects is that like attracts like, so a messy design will likely attract clients who are also messy, and those kinds of clients are nothing but headache (and usually cheap as well).\n\n"

Even when David Carson was at his RayGun peek, there always seemed to be some sort of underlying structure. Business card design is a sticky-wicket. Very little space and if you choose to be assymetrical or random the lack of balance is exaggerated.\n\n"

And I was pretty happy with what came out of my research... Opposed to my usual alignment obsession which always kinda lead me to some sort of frustration. I just wanted to play with space and typefaces and basically with the whole thing... and had fun with this job. Although, you haven’t seen the final touches...  \nBut please show me what you think is a “structured” business card (opposed to my supposely unstructured/unbalanced one...)! I would really appreciate that...  \nAnd sorry, for my english, I hope I make myself understood.\n\n"

I posted another thread the other day, proposing that everyone post his own business card, to have a little gallery of how graphic designers / typographes, etc introduce themselves nowadays...
