  "content": "I'm working on a book and I'd really like to use a face similar to the one show in the image. I'm fairly certain the on there is Travis, but my company doesn't own Travis and there's really not enough money in the budget on this title for buying it. So my question is, if not Travis, what face is that and short of that do you have any suggestions for something similar?\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103155006/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_101.jpg) | 25.47 KB |\n\n",

I think Andreas' suggestion is a close alternative, if it's not right.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
