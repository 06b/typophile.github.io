Bitstream also has a digital version called [Lucian](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024010450/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lucian/).\n\nBut both digital versions are based on [Lucian Bernhard’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024010450/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/bernhard/lucian/) design.  \nThat would mean Baltimore Type also based their “Graphic Medium” off the metal version of Bernhard’s design.\n\nA note on David Berlow’s Belucian:  \n_In need of a distinctive display style, Smart magazine asked Font Bureau in 1990 to revise the work of Lucian Bernhard from 1925. David Berlow prepared Belucian Demi, now accompanied by Kelly Ehrgott-Milligan’s 1994 Demi Italic, added Book and Book Italic for text, and designed Ultra for dynamic impact in headlines._\n\n"
