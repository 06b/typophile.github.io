My client doesn't want to go to expense of having a customised font created.  \nOptions for sans serif book fonts with an infant 'a' seem rather limited. Futura would be my choice, were it not for the question mark which seems rather jarring... Sassoon Primary looks a bit too young for our purposes... Super Grotesk is a possibility...\n\n"

      "content": "You’re welcome.  \nWhen compiling this list, I didn’t pay regard to your original request, sorry. That is, I won’t recommend most of those typefaces for setting a children’s book (including URW Grotesk, for the reason Jens mentioned).  \nIn my opinion, the significance of a single-storey ‘a’ for children is, at least, debatable. Such a typeface might come in handy for teachers, when it is both used for reading and (as a model for) writing. Apart from that, the benefit of avoiding confusion of ‘_a_’ and ‘a’ is soon outweighed by the potential –&nbsp;and likely – confusion of ‘_a_’ and ‘_o_’.\n\nChildren are not stupid, they can handle more than one representational form per character. Their world doesn’t end at the edges of their primer. They do spot and effortlessly read a lot of different ‘a’ glyphs every day: caps, italics, serifs, sans-serifs, scripts, fat letters, condensed letters, single-storey and double-storey …\n\n<cite>Sassoon Primary looks a bit too young for our purposes</cite>\n\nNote that the [Sassoon family](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013554/http:/www.clubtype.co.uk/fonts/sas/sasslist_com.html) is an elaborate system that consists of a number of members, each designed for a special purpose.  \n [Club Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013554/http:/www.clubtype.co.uk/fonts/sas/s110sample.html) about [Sassoon Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013554/http:/www.clubtype.co.uk/fonts/sas/s110sample.html): “A more mature font … Ideal for older pupils, perhaps at Seconday school, or adults, who no longer require ‘exit strokes’ to clump the letters together.”\n\nF\n\n"
