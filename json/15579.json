My mother was really into the holiday and we would go to great measures to make a spooky fun place for the kids and the adults. One thing we would do is put fish nets hanging from the ceiling of the dinning room and put streamers draped through the holes. This gave the room the look of a magical forest. We also always had hot chocolate and apple cider for the adults who were almost always outside and never invited into a house. Not at my mothers place, the parents were incouraged to come in and enjoy the event. We would get hundreds of visitors when some neighbors would only get a few. A fun time.\n\n [‹ typographia omniglotta - test forum post](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200804/http:/typophile.com/node/15624 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Pilcrow and paragraph signaling ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112200804/http:/typophile.com/node/15702 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

My mom isn’t much of a party planner, and the same goes for me. But recently, I’ve begun to feel excited again about putting on a costume. If people are planning to dress up, I want to know what everyone’s costumes are!\n\n"

She was about 16. I looked at her and said ’you’re a day early’. She said ’it’s my religion.’ and then I said ’go back to school, it’s tomorrow’ and shut the door. Other years if you were home and didn’t answer the door you will get you door egged!!!! And It is very hard to get dry egg off a wood door...I now hate this commercial American crap holiday.

I got everything ready for kids to come to the door, and when the bell rang with the first trick-or-treater, I opened the door eagerly.  \n“Trick or treat...” the four year old said, with trepidation.  \n“What’s your trick?” I asked, expectantly.  \n“Huh?” he replied.  \n“Do you have a joke or something?” I encouraged.  \n“No...”  \n“Well, you have to tell me a joke or it’s just begging,”\n\nThe kid started to cry.\n\nNo other kids had jokes that night, either.\n\nIt wasn’t until the next day that I related the story to friends and was informed that the St. Louis tradition of telling jokes or doing tricks wasn’t practiced in Kansas.
