  "content": "I'm working on emulating a Weingart type specimen for a typography class. One of the layouts appears to require type that is justified only up to a tab stop, not to the end of the line. I'm stumped. Besides trying to do this with a text wrap box (the easy way out of course!), I can't think of how to do this. I have attached a PDF outlining what this looks like. (The magenta line is the desired outer boundary of the justification for those three lines).\n\nIs this technically possible to do? I realize I could just manually track out those lines but where's the fun in that?\n\nEnrico\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017134727/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_8.pdf) | 235.56 KB |\n\n",
