  "content": "Hello all.\n\nI’m currently working on an identity for an annual gala, for a sports organization that will be held in (southern) Sweden. The brief was to develop a typographical solution only (no symbols) and it had to be bold. I was also required to use the green that you see in the attachment (not really accurate when ’saved for web’. It will be more vibrant. Also, the mark would have to suitable for broadcasting on TV.\n\nJust to break it down, ’Malmö’ is a city in southern Sweden, and ’Galan’ is - you guessed it! - swedish for gala. In english ’The Malmo Gala’. Not very original maybe, but I think it gets the message accross. Besides, I don’t have any say in the actual wording.\n\nOut of the four, which works best? Most of the type is custom, apart from Harlow and certain elements of Bauhaus 93. Personally I feel that the bottom alternative has most character and would be most suitable.\n\nGreatful for any response.\n\nS.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000337im_/http:/typophile.com/files/concepts.gif)\n\n [‹ Logo for Authenticore](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000337/http:/typophile.com/node/18997 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hong Kong Design Institute ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000337/http:/typophile.com/node/18681 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m afraid you need to look further at the kerning, if you take MO as a base then MA, AL and AN need more space. You could put in some work on the bar of the G and the LM and LA could do with a bit more separation to distinguish it from IM, IA. As a thought you could look at making MALMÖ in to a triline, which might give it a running track feel and will lighten the grey, which is still dominating GALAN.  \nTim\n\n"
