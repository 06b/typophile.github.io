( [http://alphabet.tmema.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030339/http:/alphabet.tmema.org/ \"http://alphabet.tmema.org\"))\n\nMy FontLab class has an exercise that is centered around that, so now I am looking for a replacement. What other font creating machines are there online? I've been searching and haven't found anything.\n\nAll suggestions appreciated!\n\nThanks.\n\n",
