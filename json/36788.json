Games are all dimensional... and it comes in all shapes and sizes. Colors are ok. maybe try tertiary colors instead of primary or mustard, lilac or olive combo.. layout is clean. How about embossing.../or a cut out?  \nMaybe have the type in the middle and have the shapes over the information like a juggler? as another alternative?\n\nAD-Shamiko\n\n"

I don’t like the blurred drop shadow but it makes me think light shadows for the balls would be cool. Love the “press play” under the name. I don’t think the T F E and WWW in pink is needed.\n\n"
