Found 2 similars [Atrament](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714213246/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/atrament) and [Malleable Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714213246/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pagan-sharp/malleable-grotesque). Gave up twice. Finally, found [Aveny](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714213246/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.playtype.com/index.php%3Fq%3Dnode/331) and looks quite matching everything (part of /G).\n\n"
