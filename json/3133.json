      "content": "If you only need to transfer the outlines, generate a PC Type 1 font from Fontographer (make sure to enable AFM and INF file generation), and open the resulting PFB file in FontLab.   \nIf you need to transfer outlines and bitmaps created in Fontographer, you need FontLab and BitFonter. Generate a Macintosh Type 1 suitcase from Fontographer, open the suitcase/.bmap file (not the printer file) in FontLab to import outlines, and open the same suitcase in BitFonter to import the bitmaps.   \nAfter you have finished editing your font in FontLab, you can output it as Macintosh Type 1 suitcase, or Windows TrueType (these are the two font formats that support embedded bitmaps, although not in MacOS X), and then add the bitmaps to these results using BitFonter.   \nAdam Twardoch, FontLab Support\n\n"
