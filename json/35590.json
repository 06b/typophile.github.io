  "content": "Urbana wants to be a contemporary sans-serif typeface inspired in the traditional lettering seen in one of the most popular, massive transportation mediums available in Bogotá (Colombia): \"busetas\" (small city buses). A mixture of influences reminiscent of modernism, hand lettering, cluttered spaces and improvisation are the source of its characteristic forms. Urbana wants to save space and catch the reader's attention at the same time. All of your comments are very welcome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415100301im_/http:/typophile.com/files/muestra%20urbana%204_4484.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "César, te debo unos comentarios más detallados, pero puedo decir: es una tipografía preciosa, solo noto (en un relevamiento veloz) dos cuestiones referentes a la contraforma:\n\n1. en la palabra \"ahorro\" creo que el espaciado entre las dos \"r\" debería de ser un poquitín mayor... si comparo el espacio \"rr\" con el espacio \"ro\" me da como que faltara un poco de blanco en el primero.\n\n2. algo similar me ocurre con las palabras \"transmilenio\" y \"TRANSMILENIO\" referido a las \"s\" y \"S\" en ambas me da la sensación de una separación apenitas mayor de la necesaria, como que las veo un poco separadas de la palabra.\n\nY 3. que lo veo ahora hay algo de eso en la palabra \"caos\" como que me queda la \"ca\" por un lado y el \"os\" por el otro, es apenas también.\n\nLa seguimos por aquí o por allá! abrazo!\n\n"

Your lower case is stronger & more compelling than the Upper Case. I think you have a good strong piece of work here. I suggest that you keep working on it for a bit longer & then start submitting it to foundries. It's really good looking.\n\n"

But not all second language English speakers are as strong in their English as others. If a thread is mostly in Spanish, German, or Dutch (etc.), I think that is just fine. Typophile is for everyone. As you can see, some users are posting in English here, too. If two Spanish speakers can communication better here in Spanish, that is OK. No oone should feel left out and not post because of their English abilitiues.\n\n"

A Spanish thread will propably mostly attract spanish speaking people. Where an English thread can reach a very large group of people, giving more input and getting out more result.\n\nI think it'd be just 'open minded' to include everyone here on Typophile. My english is also far from perfect, but you can understand me. ;-)  \nIf I see a foreign thread that I can't read, I will not involve myself. That would just be a pitty.

      "content": "Me gusta esto mucho! Okeydokey...the MNVW letters seem too flat/wide in the joins. In the diagonal letters it is always a balance between making the joints too wide, or making the joints too dark. Wide joins can be part of the style, but here you have a mixed style. The A join is so wide that is has a very big \"trap\" at the apex. The MNVW, are just wide. Consider adding this trap to the MNVW too, or solving it by making the joins narrower.\n\nAlso, the diagonal of the N is too thin to me. Consider making the diagonal thicker, and if needed, the verticals a little thinner.\n\nSorry, no tengo palabras de tipographia en espanol.\n\nAhora, tiempo por mimis...  \nzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\n\n"

      "content": "Very nice typeface! Is it up for sale?\n\nI have to say about English vs other languages: English was the original language here at typophile and all posts should be kept in English. If there is interest for a Spanish Typophile that should be on a different url (www.typophile.(something)). Considering the people that only speak Spanish are not going be able to take part in any English threads and vice versa there will only be a divide. I myself am Norwegian and English is definetly not my first language. I have many gramatical mistakes in my posts but that doesn't stop me. There is not one person in here that's gonna judge you for trying to write in english. People are just happy to have a mix of people in here with different backgrounds. That's what makes Typophile great. Having said that; there are a lot of people in this world who only speak spanish and it would be an idea to make a Spanish site for them (sooner or later it will definetly have to be a Chinese site as well). The Spanish speaking Typophiliacs can then decide whether to post at the english site or the spanish site depending on the relevance of the topic for the different groups. The community would not separate but just be more organized. Posters that speak both fluent Spanish and English would still post and translate anything of importance on both sites.  \nMaybe I should start up a Norwegian/Scandinavian Typophile division...? Nahhh We are only about 20 million people up North (Danes Swedes, Norwegians and the few Finnish that still speak Swedish). I'll stick to the .com site;-)\n\n"
