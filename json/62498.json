The closest thing we have found to what we want is Mark Simonson's [Mostra](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015063615/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/) and [Mostra Nuova](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015063615/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra-nuova/).\n\nThese may be sufficient for what we need, but I'm interested in seeing alternatives. I'm particularly after sans serif faces that make a somewhat less overt allusion to this style, without imitating it quite as literally (Neutraface came to mind because of the low x-height). Does anyone have any suggestions for either literal 30's Art Deco Poster Style OR something that might imply such a style a bit more subtly? Thanks in advance.\n\n",
