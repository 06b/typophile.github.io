There's next to no budget which i think many can identify with, and it well end up being used on business cards, Letterheads etc. Basically i'm after your critique   \n ![Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023022458im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41354.jpg)\n\n",

The leaf concept i like it a lot but i always value more a simplification of it. try working on a simpler version.   \n   \nDrip Irrigation SYSTEM works for me, try puting the green of SYSTEM a little bit darker.   \n   \ngood luck   \n   \nCG\n\n"
