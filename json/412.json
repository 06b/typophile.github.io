  "content": "Hi.   \n   \nI see that many nice fonts appearing on this forum and I wanted to post one of my own to see your reaction.   \nIt's not meant to be readible at small sizes. I dare people to use it big. Best used for posters, flyers, etc.   \n   \nI tried to keep the width of the letters the same. The numerals are wider and a little heavier. Therefore they stick out a little bit more. I tried to break the vertical character of the letters a bit by creating some 'thick' areas (a, e). This gives the font also a little rhythem. Otherwise it would be too rigid, not?   \n   \n ![Nantua](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020194950im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12031.jpg)   \n   \nI'm finalizing the font but have my problems with the lowercast P and the R. The difference is too small. Perhaps I should cut of the upper right point of the P to make it more round. Then it also sticks out more from the R. Or perhaps the stem of the P should sink under the X-height.   \n   \nAny more suggestions?   \n   \nRen\n\n",

      "content": "Hi phillip,   \n   \nthanx for your tip. The upper version looks nice. Only thing is that I want to keep the vertical openings equally big. That keeps it consistent in style.   \nYou're right that the 'p' and 'r' looked to much the same. I will try it and see if it still fits in the global idea of the font. I need to see it in a textblock.   \n   \nI sold it by the way to Union Fonts. Very soon it will be available online for sale.   \n   \nHow are you doing with your fonts. I saw a lot of them in this forum and I really like them. If you ask me, I think you have a good eye for it. Keep it up.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRen\n\n"

The little sharp diagonal edge made me a little 'nervous'. In this way you keep the openness of the font without breaking the overall look-and-feel.   \n   \n   \nWhat do you think?   \n   \nRen\n\n"
