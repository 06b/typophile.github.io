In the OpenType Features preview pane in FL 4.6 I can see the script armn and the language HY, and the features work. But when I export the font and try it in InDesign, the features are not available.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n",

Unfortunately, there are currently no shipping applications that support this feature of OpenType Layout, although I have seen demonstrations of functionality in Microsoft software. To get your Armenian lookups to work within InDesign, you may need to associate the lookups with the Latin script and dflt language tags.\n\n"
