  "content": "Hello everybody\n\nI am new to this forum and need some help with one of my clients who would like to me to design a book and some art prints for him.\n\nThe brief is to find: \"one of those classic 1930's Dutch sans serif faces that can be related to Piet Zwart's work.  \nIt does not need to be Dutch — but should convey a sober, direct quality with the friendly but mildly Calvinist overtones of Dutch modernism.\"\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on that??\n\nSo far I presented him DTL Nobel, Akzidenz Grotesk, Gill Sans, Grotesk MT. I am aware that they don't 100 % match the brief, but couldn't really find anything closer...\n\nI'd be very grateful for some further suggestions!\n\nThanks heaps!\n\n",
