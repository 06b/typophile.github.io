The only words set in it were \"FINE GOLD WATCHES,\" the resolution is poor, and the original was a newsprint -- so this font is at best an interpretation. Any thoughts?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FINEGOLD2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123211100/http:/typophile.com/files/FINEGOLD2.pdf) | 102.24 KB |\n\n",
