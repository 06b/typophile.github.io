I have never worked with companys this size - that put out annual reports and that kind of large publications, so I dont know if the baskerville will work in all the necessary form - tables, very small compact pargaphs etc. If you have any experience on baskerville in these contexts, please give me some advice.\n\n",

      "content": "Nice little family. Should make a great annual report, etc., - Baskerville makes a very readable book font and this also has elegant display options. I would suggest that you specify a companion font for the occasions (such as tables and diagrams etc.) that probably won’t really suit it. Probably a useful condensed sans, but keeping the options quite limited, as with this Baskerville family.\n\n"
