I would like it to be quite contemporary or a “modern classic”, maybe with some special distinctions- but still the most important thing is that it’s easy to read in a small size and that it will look good in text column (not too loose, not too thin or too black). I’d like a font that’s is also not too round if you understand what I mean.\n\nI hope that some of you might give me some suggestions on fonts that would work well in my magazine, I would be really grateful for some help\n\nMany thanks\n\n [‹ Typography for the older folks](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907013700/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44904 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Table of Contents middots ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907013700/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45046 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
