For that, I simply copied a codepage from codpages folder of FontLab and changed its name and changed the codes to those I wanted to put together... it takes time!  \nNote that this was never intended to affect the font encoding process.\n\n"

You can also use a spreadsheet like Excel where you can put lists next to eachother as columns and drag and drop things around. Be sure to rename your file afterwards.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
