  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI donated an experimental display typeface to my favorite web-radio-station [dublab](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203024115/http:/www.dublab.com/protondrive/).\n\nBut I'm not really helping them with their fund-racer without putting some music loving type-designers on this subject. So I should do some rude self-promotion: By donating an amount over 50$ you will get a price-package in retune which as well contains an exclusive mix-cd by dublab-dj [Jimmy Tamborello](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203024115/http:/www.jimmytamborello.com/) (a.k.a. Dntel, The Postal Service, James Figurine).\n\nI originally designed this font for the audio-visual exhibition [Into Infinity](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203024115/http:/www.intoinfinity.org/). My contribution is also posted on my [frontpage](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203024115/http:/www.ewalthert.com/).\n\nMy sounding Typeface:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203024115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SonicWaves_abc400_5967.jpg)\n\nAnd the funny thing, it will come with a folder of sound-files:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203024115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SoundEditor_3894.png)\n\n",
