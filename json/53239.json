Wherever this may be — I am considering relocating. I previously focused quite heavily on brand development, corporate design and typography. Hmm, what else. I've been working in design for 10 years now, in Europe _(Austria, the UK, Italy)_. My past work has been featured in various design related publications. _(And — You may have seen [my 'Typophile T'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416035719/http:/for.ma/blog/?p=292) up there. ;)_\n\nIf you have any questions concerning me or my past and future work, let me know — _mail(at)davidhubner.com_.
