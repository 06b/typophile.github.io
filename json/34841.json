  "content": "This is a logo which I am currently developing, for small “boutique” graphic design studio. It is intended to be very regular (common) looking - at first glance, which with careful observation will reveal it’s complexity and beauty. It must look really “tricky” (if I may express myself that way:), because the people working there are professionals, hidden behind a firm name, generally meaning – unprofessional (something like anti-hero design agency).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020081120im_/http:/typophile.com/files/diletant_prev_5476.jpg)\n\nI’m posting it for critique and suggestions, which may add little perfection – it must look really twisted, tricky and in the same time amazing.\n\nI’am currently having a very hard time constructing the latin version… so any comments and suggestions….\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020081120im_/http:/typophile.com/files/diletant_prev2_4434.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [diletant\\_prev.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020081120/http:/typophile.com/files/diletant_prev.jpg) | 33.85 KB |\n| [diletant\\_prev2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020081120/http:/typophile.com/files/diletant_prev2.jpg) | 34.66 KB |\n\n",

I'd try adjusting those things and even pushing the secondary line farther to the right, don't have it cling to the same guide as the main line.\n\n"
