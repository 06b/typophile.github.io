The book \\*The Elements of Typographic Style\\* by Robert Bringhurst is a great book that has a chapter on choosing and combining type.\n\nA few good serif and sanserif combination's are; Haas Claredon and Helvetica, Memphis and Futura, Berthold Bodoni and Futura, Meridien and Frutiger, as well as Syntax and Minion, .\n\n"

Bring on the naivety!\n\nThanks again.\n\n----------  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Graphic Design Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20130816160340/http:/www.solid-creative.com/)\n\n"
