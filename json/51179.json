  "content": "I exported my typeface in FontLab in roman and oblique. It worked fine for a while when I used it in Illustrator, previewing in the drop-down character menu in both regular and oblique. Once I tried selecting the typeface in Photoshop, the roman wouldn't work, just the oblique, and when I went back into Illustrator, it did the same. I don't know what to do, I think this is a mastering issue. Could someone please help? Thanks.\n\n",
