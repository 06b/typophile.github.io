At first I thought it was Machine, but that's got no serifs and is even more basic. \"What the font\" on myfonts.com can't come up with a match either. Anyone have any ideas?   \n   \n ![Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524130921im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69362.jpg)\n\n",
