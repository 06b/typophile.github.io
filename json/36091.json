Particularly students, or those interested in information design, and environmental graphics/typography.\n\nJames Montalbano, a Typophile frequenter is featured in this article. A great article! On a somewhat personal note, James and Don are to a large degree partially responsible for my interest in typography and information design. Congrats guys! I wish you continued success!\n\n",
