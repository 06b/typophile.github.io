  "content": "Ok so I’ve been considering getting an established logo going but there are so many good choices out there. I’ve narrowed it down to 4 different ones that I like.\n\nI’m a freelance web designer but the site is basically non-important drivel and banter ... so take that into account when considering which choice. It needs to be professional enough to look like I didn’t slap Arial on there, but cute / playful enough to fit the style of my site. Check out [the site](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152435/http:/tinycrumb.com/home) for a better idea of the style I’m going for.\n\nAlso, along with which choice, I’d appreciate any critique on them individually, e.g., if Kerning is off on one particular one, if one choice is just really bad type-wise, etc...\n\nI am a noob though so please be nice :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Choices](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152435/http:/typophile.com/files/choices.png) | 15.28 KB |\n\n [‹ \\*\\*\\*PLEASE COMMENT ON MY TYPE\\*\\*\\*\\*](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152435/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41246 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Critique for new Web Design agency portfolio/website ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152435/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41202 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
