There’s an essay about it out there somewhere, Stewf might have a link, it’s also in _Made With FontFont_. Neville Brody did some great stuff designing type with strips of tape, that’s in _Made With FontFont_ as well. And of course, there’s [The Proteus Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100019), you should totally interview the big guys about that one.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for including me in your research and for all the images/links! Here's some others that I've run across (thanks to Lindsay Ballant for some new ones) for your use:\n\nLetterror is sort of the granddaddy of programmatic type (though I'm sure someone's going to object to that). Specifically, [Beowolf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.letterror.com/foundry/beowolf/index.html) has randomized rough edges.  \nAnd the letterforms for ['Twin'](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.letterror.com/portfolio/twin/index.html) are affected by the weather in the Twin Cities.\n\nAnother older fella ;) is [Peter Cho](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.pcho.net/), with [Typo Topo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.typotopo.com/)\n\nYou should definitely check out [Scriptographer's Gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.scriptographer.com/Gallery/), featuring the work of [Jonathan Puckey](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.jonathanpuckey.com/) & [Jürg Lehni](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.scratchdisk.com/). Eye magazine did a feature about it a while back.\n\nDavid Reinfurt created an interesting feature for the design of Yale's architectural 'zine. He asked various designers to take a customized version of Hevetica Neue and make a new typeface from it using some form of alteration. Two examples of computational results were created by [Project Projects](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.projectprojects.com/#H_HELV_NEUE) & [Apirat Infahsaeng](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.syntheticautomatic.com/activity.html#helvetica).\n\nFormer classmate Joshua Walton's [Babel type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/babel.conflux.org/) generator. [Example 1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/joshua.conflux.org/portfolio/workImages/babel2.jpg) [Example 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/joshua.conflux.org/portfolio/workImages/babel3.jpg)\n\n[3d type created in Processing](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.ortho-type.it/).\n\nMore processing by [Ricard Marxer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.caligraft.com/).\n\nStill not so sure about Hudson-Powell's [Responsive Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.responsivetype.com/).\n\nRobotic type in Nikita Pashenkov's [Alphabot](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/acg.media.mit.edu/people/nik/projects_n.cgi?alphabot&screenshots)\n\nagency:collective's [Container Steganography](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.agencycollective.com/projects.php?view=type&id=container).\n\nWhile not typeface work, these German Students have using [scripting in InDesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001345/http:/www.looksgood.de/log/2007/07/27/diploma-posters-indesign-scripting/) to do some new methods of layout.\n\nThat's what I've got at my fingertips, hope it helps!  \n-- JK\n\n"
