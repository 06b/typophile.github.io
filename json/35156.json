  "content": "Hey, I’m new to this place. I posted about some new Chops on my blog, but do people generally post there and here? Seems the forum is the place to really post your diggs.\n\nI also can’t seem to get the images to run in-line with the post. How does one do that? Is it simply a size requirement? It always just attaches as a link instead of a visual.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [onesheet\\_gwmf\\_sml.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012195910/http:/typophile.com/files/onesheet_gwmf_sml.jpg) | 137.11 KB |\n\n",
