New application versions are not an issue to PSD or AI files, but INDD documents are not readable by older versions –and a similar issue arrives regarding plugins. Imagine a workflow broken or a production error because you used InDesign CC from September 9th while the printer was using the August 28th version. And then Adobe releases an update in September 17th changing the tool introduced in July 3rd but disabled due to an error in August 11th version, which are not compatible with plugin Xthing 9.9 so you downgrade to Xthing 9.4 and... Well, computers are here to make life easier.\n\nThis may seem a bit dramatic, but Muse is experiencing such a quick versioning.\n\nBesides the marketing empty words, InDesign CC will offer no relevant addition except native 64-bit structure. Adobe really needs subscription revenues when their upgrades offer “modern black UI” as a great improvement. Better long document management? Maybe in InDesign CC7, or CS13, aka version 16.\n\n"

Problem is, for simultaneous print/epub work, it is currently also almost necessary.\n\nI'm with the guy who said \"NOOOOO.\" Well, like PageMaker and Quark, InDesign will eventually be replaced. Soon, I hope, and by someone who views typesetting software as a tool, one to be used by skilled craftsman, not a coffee grinder for text so you can have kewl graphics. XeTeX looks more & more attractive.\n\nOne thing that would help InDesign would be if there could be a plug in so the H&J routines used the normal TeX routines instead of any of the \"Adobe paragraph composers.\" I get so tired of InDesign not breaking the exact same text the same way in different proof stages. We have to run pdf-to-pdf comparisons at every proof stage, just to catch unwanted text reflow, which occurs with paragraphs that had no alterations. Publishers just don't put up with that kind of change in the text, so we have to catch it. So far, we've only had to pay for the reprinting of one book, but the time spent checking is not insignificant...\n\nI'm sure they will promise better bug fixing in the cloud versions, pardon my skepticism.

You learn to look at potential trouble spots -- across page boundaries (text frames), wraparounds, etc., but it can occur anywhere, anytime.\n\nI had one recently, about a 5-line paragraph, middle of the page, where an editor changed (say) the words \\*if only\\* to \\*only if\\*. This in the middle of a line, in the middle of the paragraph. InDesign recomposed the paragraph, making different hyphenation decisions. But at least it happened in a paragraph being worked on.\n\nMy guess is what will increase with upgrades is \"features,\" not bug fixes. The thing about \"features\" is one group -- say book compositors -- doesn't give a hoot (not my chosen word), but the complexity of the program grows, and at some point, the program stops working correctly. Here's another one from CS6: After you use \"fit frame to content\" a number of times in a document, it stops working. Rebooting doesn't help, it's just a gone feature in that document from then on.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nAs to the cloud-based system, perhaps some of our concerns are not relevant.

You still have to update, which now includes feature upgrades as well (I expect, kind of like Gmail, when things would change from time to time).\n\nSo, Adobe gets rid of any shipping costs, and regularizes their revenue stream. A real bummer for someone who just spent $700 buying a new copy, though. And for those of us who like to pay once, with a check...\n\n"

This isn’t cloud software at all but rather simply a subscription model, which is a bit of a relief. The Adobe CEO clarifies a bit:\n\n[http://mashable.com/2013/05/06/adobe-ceo-interview-creative-cloud/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150325150127/http:/mashable.com/2013/05/06/adobe-ceo-interview-creative-cloud)\n\n“[The Adobe CEO] insists that the cost for Adobe CC is now lower for ‘any customer.’ Those costs are now more predictable, he added.”\n\nThat’s simply not true. I, along with most designers I know, only upgrade when necessary. I skipped CS4 and CS5 before moving to CS6, and even that upgrade was more of a convenience than a necessity. While he says it’s not, this move by Adobe is all about the money and will ultimately cost me a lot more. I do see a silver lining with that though; it will cull the hobbyists from the market.\n\n_\\>What features need to be added to Quark Xpress 9 or Microsoft Publisher 2013 before they could become alternatives?_\n\nThat’s a very steep hill to climb. Adobe has done a masterful job of creating brilliant software products while at the same time eliminating competition. The purchase of Macromedia to kill Freehand and the creation of InDesign to kill Quark were major coups. What stands out more than anything is the integration of product features. Quark and/or Publisher would need to integrate with fully featured vector and raster editors such as Photoshop and Illustrator. They would need a ubiquitous file format for export like Adobe’s PDF. There’s also the learning curve. I’ve learned and forgotten multiple versions of PageMaker, Quark, Freehand, etc. The switch to new software is a serious drain on my increasingly limited cognitive resources.\n\nThat’s the rub. Adobe wouldn’t dare do this move to the subscription model if there was a valid competing software product. They are being a bully because they know there’s no one to lose marketshare to.\n\n"

But for folks who only updated occasionally in the past, this new system may be more expensive.\n\nMaybe for those who were licensing every version of the Master Collection. But I suspect most CS users are using a subset suite. As a Design Standard user, the subscription model would roughly triple my costs over upgrading the suite every 18-24 months. I can't see much point in coughing up the extra money; it's not like they've been improving the software much in recent years.\n\n"

So they may have behaved... injudiciously... which need not necessarily be of benefit to shareholders.\n\nThus, rather than advocating the overthrow of the capitalist system, I think it will be sufficient for consumers to aggressively explore alternatives to their products. If this leads to Adobe requiring the use of Chapter 11 soon, this will encourage Microsoft not to abandon Microsoft Office in favor of Office 365.\n\n@marcox:  \nMy mistake, I wasn't aware of the details of their means of implementing SaaS.\n\n@charles ellertson:  \nYes, it doesn't stop existing cheapskates, but it prevents new ones from starting.\n\n"

Most mutual fund managers interest is short term. They are in business to get management fees, and they get those by appearing to do better than indexed funds. So, their interests are short term, they are continually buying and selling companies stock, passing the well-hidden costs on to <cite>their</cite> consumers. Just like advertising.\n\nUsually, the company's job is to remain profitable over the long haul. What becomes interesting -- theoretically -- is when institutional investors own more than 50% of the stock. Is the 6-month profitability then a larger responsibility than the survival of the company?\n\nAnd do you really care about the answer? If not, stop using such nonsense sayings.\n\n"
