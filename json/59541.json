  "content": "Hey team. I’m 4th year at a Design School in New Zealand, doing my final major project this year - the prep was first semester (Feb to June) and now the execution is coming up (July to November).\n\nSo a few years ago I found out that I had some Gypsy ancestry and I thought it might be interesting to base my major research topic on the Gypsy (now known as ‘Roma’) culture as an excuse to learn more about the people and discover some of my own cultural heritage.\n\nI felt that not only did it offer a unique starting point to my project; it also made it more of a personal statement. Research in my first semester led me in very interesting directions – areas I didn’t really think of exploring and wot-not. From this little acorn of an idea I now have this idea of ‘cultural representation through typeface design’ to run with.\n\nSo where I’m at now is I’m currently checking out some good examples where typeface has reflected the culture (Fraktur - Nazi Germany // Gill Sans - Early 20th Century England) and seeing how it works, what was the background etc and try and pull out some good parallels that run between them all that I can use to influence my proposed typeface.\n\nSo can anyone think of some other good examples? - Maybe more contemporary? I thought Gotham by Hoefler & Frere-Jones could be a good example of this kind of contemporary American zeitgeist we are in now-days, but dunno - just rambling here.\n\nPlease be kind, I’m just a youngin’\n\n",

I don’t know if there’s a connection there for you but I highly recommend checking out some Roma music. The music of the downtrodden is almost always the best.\n\npbc\n\n"

      "content": "Touché with the Saab call Nick. I like your three ideas - especially the one suited to the language, that could prove to be an interesting approach. Thing is - this is just half of my final project; the other half is part of the International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD) brief which set up parameters that I felt could help me present the Roma in an authentic // balanced // interesting way. ISTD brief is to publish under the title ’10 things you should know about...’ using one of the following 10 categories:\n\nScience // Sport // Hobbies/Crafts // Gardening // Famous battles // Games // Travel // Plays // Artists // Authors.\n\nI’m choosing Travel. My tutors said it’s a pretty broad requirement and i can basically twist it to 10 things you should know about Ethnic Minorities, or Ethnic Groups of Europe or something along those lines.  \nThe main aim for this book (aside from the 10 things) is to show the way typography can be used to create an interesting visual publication.\n\nSo one part type design that is to be used in this second part - the book I’m going to design too. At this stage I imagine it’s going to be a standard alphabet but adding characters that are key to Romani language could be an interesting twist, enough to start on at least. I’ve been checking out the music aspect as much as you can from a tiny island in the south pacific. All very inspiring comments so far by the way. Thanks so much for helping me narrow the field down.\n\nOh and I’m not fully certain Paul - but I believe my Grandmother said Hungarian Roma? Im about 90% sure.\n\n"

They honor the tradition well. They also have a cimbalon player, which is an amazingly beautiful instrument.\n\nThere’s a video documentary called “Gypsy Caravan: when the Road Bends”. It is really great and a good introduction to Roma music. No Hungarian musicians if I remember correctly but some great music and a look at how some Romanian Roma live.\n\nThere’s another one called “Latcho Drom” that is also fantastic. I believe that has some Hungarian musicians although I can’t quite remember.\n\nCheers\n\n"

Maybe you could investigate the cloth signpainters’ sample books that traveling signpainters would carry to show customers when they arrived in “your town”. I think this was a common custom in the 19th century in France, maybe it was more widespread and if so, there might be some Romany signpainters out there. The lettering styles are very decorative and seem also to fit into the visual culture of the circus. More nomadic connections there.\n\n"

Where the Road Bends is fabuous - I have it on Tivo at home and watch it every once in a while. Latcho Drom is the story of the Roma told completely in music - starting in India and continuing on through the hot jazz clubs etc. It is a beautiful movie but I have never seen it on DVD, just video.\n\nDrom means road I believe, something the Roma know well.\n\nThere’s also a Spanish movie called Vengo which is set in the south of Spain amongst Roma flamenco musicians. It’s fictional but there is some great music in it.\n\nCheers to the Romani!\n\npbc\n\n"
