  "content": "I found this in a book called \"Early Advertising Art\" by Dover, I was thinking of digitizing it for more practice making fonts. But curious on any history of it? Has it been already digitized? (didn't see anything close on whatthefont.com). If it did make it into a font, i'd most likely give it away.\n\nthanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [favorit\\_scan.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703152757/http:/typophile.com/files/favorit_scan.jpg) | 155.71 KB |\n\n",

The Solotype Catalog calls this Music Hall Text and [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703152757/http:/moorstation.org/fontennium/blackheav/fsheav1.htm) you'll find one digital version as Music Hall.\n\nThe font is copyrighted by WSI - one of those companies that produced almost solely clones of existing fonts, renamed. However, if you look at [this list of WSI font descriptions](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703152757/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/WSI-FontList.txt) by Robert Long of WSI (1997), you'll find that almost all of the fonts state that they are \"similar in appearance to ...\". Music Hall, however, states that, \"WSI is the first commercial collection to produce and offer such a clean digitization ...\". So, just maybe this was a rare legitimate WSI digitization.\n\nThe other digitization I'm aware of is Scriptorium's [Rheingold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703152757/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=rheingold).\n\n"
