  "content": "Inspired by neutral slab serifs with an added twist, Slab Happy is a typographic system consisting of eight layerable fonts with infinite combinations. Slab Happy looks best when set in display sizes, but functions just as well at smaller point sizes.\n\nThe complete Slab Happy family consists of: Regular, Bold, Outline, 3D, Stitches, Fill, Shadow, and Crosshatch.\n\n[Slab Happy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/will-ryan/slab-happy/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-worry_b_5642.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-mambo_b_6504.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-eyechart_b_5857.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-spec_b_3544.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-eyechartDetail_b_6101.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-specDetail_b_5271.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-worryDetail_b_3759.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120658im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabhappy-worryDetail2_b_6640.jpg)\n\n",
