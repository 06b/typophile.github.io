Part of my explanation seems to have disappeared.\n\nThis is a custom typeface designed by R&D&Co for the Old Vic. I just found out that the east London consultancy [closed shop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019044414/http:/www.mad.co.uk/BreakingNews/BreakingNews/Articles/80a87b78cd32452ea54106d8b5a8f85f/RDCo-ceases-trading.html) a little over two months ago.\n\n"

The font comes in widths instead of weights (2 Weights). The font was designed by Rob Andrews of R&D&Co (which has since ceased trading).\n\n"
