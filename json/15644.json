      "content": "I would rather classify that as a Textura/Gothic, not a Fraktur (quadratic ’serifs’, form of sc ’o’, ’ö’, ’r’). I think I have seen this logo in an ad in a telephone book of Vienna 1924, so it is probably hard to find their ’font’ (if it is not custom, which I could imagine, sure based on letterforms). Their [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20071122220600/http:/www.boesendorfer.com/) does not give any hints on the logo or since when it is in use. Perhaps they can help you if you ask politely?\n\n"
