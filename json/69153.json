Usually we like to invite young illustrators, photographers, typographers to collaborate on some material to preview the new designs. (e.g. [Business Penmanship PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014143536/http:/www.veer.com/download/pdf/businesspenmanship_specimen.pdf))\n\nThe Brownstone Sans is a very special specimen for us because it was written and photographed by Jon Parker, a good and personal friend who actually lives on Brooklyn.\n\n**[Visit Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014143536/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)**.\n\n",
