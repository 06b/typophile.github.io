Why isn't it?   \n   \nThis isn't really my field, so I could be talking nonsense, but the thing that springs to mind is that you are probably doing much more with InD, than you did with Quark - even if you don't realise it.   \nFor example, if your Quark experience is pre-version 6, then you were working without multiple undo. Think of all the available options that make you want to use InD, rather than Quark. Now, even if you're not using them, you might be, so InD has to check to see if you are, and it has to leave the door open in case you want to in the future, and then it has to leave a route back to anywhere in your session, incase you want to undo your way all the way back to lunchtime.   \nThis is why we all have to keep buying new hardware - because the software does so many new things (which we all take for granted after about 15 seconds).\n\n"

      "content": "Myself, I have found InD CS slightly faster than 2.0, although it is still slower than QuarkXPress. OTOH, QXP 6 is considerably slower than previous versions of QXP....   \n   \nSteve's right that many of the standard features of InDesign will slow it down. For example:   \n- hi-res graphics previews   \n- paragraph composer   \n- unlimited undo   \n   \nIf performance is an issue, one can adjust some of these (and other options) to improve performance, at a cost of features. I believe there is a standard tech note on improving InD performance on the Adobe Web site.   \n   \n(BTW, no clue on the grey box in Illustrator. Sorry.)   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

I think the real reason is that inefficient code is good for this perception-driven economy (as long as all the big players are about equally inefficient). Fontographer 3.1 does most of what 4 does, and it's magnitudes leaner and faster - I used to run it in 512 RAM with one floppy drive... under Mac emulation!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
