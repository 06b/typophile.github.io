I'm not afraid.\n\nThis is a personal logo design, it is my initials which are c j d. i prefer the lower case.

While it's not such a bad idea - as a design exercise - my thoughts are you'll communicate more clearly...with letters as they are, and more memorably...with something unique.\n\n"

So i default to a symbol that I made out of my initials.\n\nDo you have a recommendation by what you mean by letters as they are? Do you mean something simpler, maybe more typographic?\n\n"

Yours is a nice geometrical approach to combining 3 letters, but that is all there is to it.\n\nHave a look, for example, to [Ty Wilkins](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012190049/http:/typophile.com/files/pictures/picture-2664.jpg) logo. Or better yet, skim through [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012190049/http:/www.helveticbrands.ch/blog/100_Brands_of_Interest), [this](http://web.archive.org/) and [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012190049/http:/www.helveticbrands.ch/blog/100brands3). There is plenty of letters only logos on these lists.\n\n"
