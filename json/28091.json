  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm designing some packaging for a product that is to be sold in China (specifically Shanghai) and the US. All the text is in English (mostly using ChaletComprime), except for one panel, which needs to be in Chinese.\n\nI need a Chinese font that reads well at a small size. I am using Illustrator CS and am in OS 10.4.7. Does any one have any suggestions for fonts (whether system installed or for sale)? Also any recommendations/guidelines about setting text in Chinese?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
