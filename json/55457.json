I would imagine the flush right/ragged left came about with the invention of movable type. Lines set with movable type on a press bed can easily (relatively) be moved from left to right justification whereas a calligrapher would have had a difficult time knowing where to begin the lines of handwriting in order to end them at the same point.\n\n"
