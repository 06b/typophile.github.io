I didn’t know if there were preferred applications or widgets out there, or something secretly built into Tiger similar to what Leopard has with Quick Look.\n\nBlah. I probably should have phrased that less <cite>how?</cite> and more <cite>what’s the best way?</cite>\n\n"

Panther on the other hand, unless there’s a piece of 3rd party software out there, I don’t know of any other way that to click on the file to preview it prior to installing via Fontbook. Actually does Panther come with Fontbook? I only ever used Panther briefly before I upgraded to Tiger. Sorry I can’t be of more help.\n\n"

The fonts viewed in Suitcase, FontAgent Pro, or FontExplorer X are not installed in the system. They are simply in a database accessible to the manager.\n\n"
