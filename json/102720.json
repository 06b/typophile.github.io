  "content": "This is my first every post on Typophile! I've been building a typeface in fontforge and I've hit a problem that will most likely sound stupid to all of the experts out there, but here goes.\n\nSo I generated by font and gave it a test run. It all seems fine apart from the quotation marks (QM). How do I command them as a set? As it is, the QM on left of a word will be the default font (like Helvetica) but the right will be my typeface. I've looked it up online but I really can't get my head around it. I gather that there is some command in the Lookups section that will allow the QM to appear correct, but how do I do that? I'm so confused! I can't get my head around how one key on the keyboard can generate two different graphemes. I always just thought of them as being the same.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated! Cheers guys and gals.\n\n",
