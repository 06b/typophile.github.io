  "content": "Hello all,\n\nWhile reading a book I realised that the font is really nice. After investigating a little bit I found that the font is “Ehrhardt Volume Expert”. I went to several internet search machines but this typeset is commercial and, therefore, you have to pay for it.\n\nDo you know any way to get this typeset for free?\n\nolea\n\n [‹ Will you ever go online](http://web.archive.org/web/20080519014715/http:/typophile.com/node/19443 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [sans serif complement to Chaparral? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080519014715/http:/typophile.com/node/19326 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Say, for use on Win or OSX you choose the TTF version — only about Euro 50 total. I bet you will write more reports in future, and have some written correspondence too.
