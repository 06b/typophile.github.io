Originally intended for art, design and architecture books, Edita can graciously work alongside photographs and images alike, producing an amazing synergy. Furthermore, Edita is a legibility workhorse, whether it is used in a few paragraphs or in a 600-page novel.\n\nAvailable exclusively at our online store.
