Often greeting card (and gift wrap) companies have their own fonts, and that would be my guess about this one — a custom in-house font design.\n\nThe most similar script I was able to find was [Memoir](http://web.archive.org/web/20080609231656/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000329#specimen) by Stephen Rapp. It has many OT alternates, but no exact matches for letters like the swashy h and y of this sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
