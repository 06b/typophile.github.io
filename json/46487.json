  "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\nI'm working on a personal logo for a friend. He's a part-time photography and needs a logo/identity for a gallery he will be selling some photos in. I'm not working with any real concept because I want to shy away from using a camera symbol, etc... I'm just having fun with his initials—\"M\" & \"W\"—and going for some sort of monogram. This is one of the concepts I've been playing with, just something fun (I thought it was pretty trippy/interesting). Anyway, I would love to get some feedback on it.\n\nThanks,  \nMike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140128090524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mw3_6241.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140128090524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mw1_5612.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140128090524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mw2_5141.jpg)\n\n",
