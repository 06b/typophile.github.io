  "content": "This is how it works:\n\n- A portion of a glyph is published in the Type ID Pop Quiz.\n- Try to identify the glyph and the typeface. To win, you need to name at least:\n  1. typeface\n  2. weight\n  3. character/glyph\n- Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.\n- The winner produces a new challenge -- a portion of a glyph, black on white background, presented in a 288 x 288 pixel square, including a R204G000B00 1 pixel border.\n- The person who posts a challenge can't win the next game.\n\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\n\nIf you think this is a little too difficult, maybe try the [Entry Level Type ID Pop Quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035037/http:/typophile.com/node/31362) or [Intermediary Level Type ID Pop Quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035037/http:/typophile.com/node/31363) first.\n\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\n\n_With respectful thanks to the originator of this utterly useless but highly entertaining waste of time, the often imitated but never duplicated Cheshire Dave._\n\n",

Mainly a self-taught artist, in 1905 Bernhard won a competition sponsored for the Berlin Chamber of Commerce. He began producing posters and quickly established himself as one of the most important people working in this field in Germany.<br>\nBernhard was employed by the German government during the First World War to produce propaganda posters. After the war he became Professor of Poster Design at the Berlin Royal Academy.<br>\nIn 1923 Bernhard moved to the United States where he joined with Rockwell Kent to establish the New York design company, Contempora. Over the next few years he was involved in several projects including the design of 36 different typefaces. Lucian Bernhard died in 1972.</cite>\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035037im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ARTbernhard_6234.jpg)\n\n"

There were a number of contemporaries of LB who all worked in a similar graphic style; Julius Gipkens, Louis Oppenheim, and Julius Klinger, but Bernhard stood out for me.\n\nThere was some fantastic stuff there.
