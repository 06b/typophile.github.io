  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm looking for a quick critique on the logo attached if anyone fancies leaving a comment or two, that would be great. Its a logo for a University post grad society. The colours were set in the brief and can't be changed as they have to correlate with the main University logo. The letter shapes are intended to resemble ladder shapes, based on the idea of 'climbing the ladder of higher education', or something to that effect!\n\nAny comments, criticisms or suggestions would be greatly received.\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [UHPS logo's2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191036/http:/typophile.com/files/UHPS%20logo's2.jpg) | 676.69 KB |\n| [UHPS logo's2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191036/http:/typophile.com/files/UHPS%20logo's2_0.jpg) | 653.16 KB |\n| [UHPS logo's2blue.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191036/http:/typophile.com/files/UHPS%20logo's2blue.jpg) | 648.65 KB |\n\n",

I suspect this is not the response you're going for ... man, the font just could NOT be worse. Choose something that is the **most opposite that font.**\n\nA quick google search shows the [university colors](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191036/http:/www2.hud.ac.uk/news/index.php) are a much darker navy blue and burnt orange. Why not use those actual color values rather than these neon versions?\n\nThe ladder metaphor is cliche, but in this example it's too fragile to even execute the metaphor properly.\n\nBottom line? I don't think you need a logo mark -- I'd just focus on a logotype alone. It's a lot of words; and with the right type treatment, it can be more than enough by itself.\n\nAK\n\n"

Letter forms to me are more architechtural than sculptural (depending on the typeface I suppose). Anyway, the Huddersfield University logo itself is based on a building, so it would be a good place to start.\n\nMy thoughts on the logo as it stands 1) lose the box/stroke around the graphic and tie the required colors into the illustration 2) As stated above, you need a different typeface preferably the standard for Huddersfield or a clean sans 3) Use the light blue/orange as accent colors and the darker blue for the type and better part of the image. Orange is my favorite color, but don't kill it.\n\n"

I know the original flopped but i've posted a couple of other versions (held under the original post just to be difficult!) of the original based on the responses so would be great to see what you think now.. Do you think the fragmented ladder idea still sucks? Do I go back to the drawing board altogether? I think I may know the answer to that one but let me know if its looking better than it was!\n\nCheers\n\n"
