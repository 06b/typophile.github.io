Hence all of the common logo id requests. ;)   \n   \nI've actually generated quite a few so far -- though I still need to purchase Introspect for the Albertsons font since it's not in my archives. For 7-11 I settled on a Futura Condensed UltraBlack with some editing to weigh the characters on the left side a bit.\n\n"
