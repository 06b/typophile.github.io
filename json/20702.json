It looks 19th century to me, but Solotype Catalog & Art Nouveau books haven’t helped yet.\n\nAny ideas?

Lyons collection of antique types).\n\nMike, since the lettering comes from a set of city development plans, isn’t it likely that an old Varigraph or [LeRoy Mechanical Lettering](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810001155/http:/www.tpub.com/engbas/3-35.htm) system was used by engineers?

      "content": "I never used the LeRoy system, but I did use a Varigraph and another mechanical pantograph system whose name I can’t recall.\n\nThe Varigraph had several sets of templates with several lettering styles. I can remember using Stymie Bold and Franklin Gothic(ish) styles. You traced using a stylus in the template (metal), the pen nibs were connected to the other end of a pantograph arm. You could size and slant of desired lettering by adjusting dials near fulcrum of arm.\n\nAfter outlining in ink, I had to fill in the characters by hand with India ink. These kind of lettering devices were very common with architects and engineers.\n\nAs for the Post Old Style, on closer look the “A” is somewhat similar.  \n(Sorry about poor repro... quick snapshot. I could scan tomorrow if you’d like.)  \nObviously my sample is the bold weight (Post Old Style Roman No. 2), but notice the difference in the cap S treatment between 10 pt. (slightly slanted) and the 24 pt. (upright). Also note the 24 pt. lowercase “y”... I love this old stuff!!!\n\n(edit-a-bit): There are 2 cap “S” in the 10 pt. sample. One is roman (POST) and one is italic??? (STYLE)!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810001155im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Post-oldstyle-1_3880.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, Norbert, I have also been looking for samples of other template lettering, but only found Old English. I agree that using manual lettering tools would make sense, since it lets anyone make professional-looking letterforms on any size drawing. However, when Trina said that she thought these were current drawings, it raises the possibility of using a plotter-printer with computer fonts.\n\nStill, it surprises me that they would use such an archaic-looking style on modern documents.The only digital versions I can think of right away of typefaces that I think have a similar antique feel are [Windsor](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810001155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/windsor-sb/) and [Musketeer](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810001155/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/musketeer/). I think Stephen’s suggestion is a bit too formal looking.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

We do get in a lot of plans from various firms still using old fashioned/outdated lettering systems, believe it or not! So I am attaching a larger sample and am waiting to receive the book that contained the full plan where I can get a better scan. I eventually want to mimic this lettering for an upcoming project. Thanks again for all your knowledge; it has been interesting reading.\n\nTrina\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070810001155im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stcharles_4569.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Seeing more of the lettering makes it look like this might have been hand lettered, although I realize that the details of different type sizes would often vary within a typeface. In this sample, notice how the smaller E’s are not the same as the large one in ’CHARLES’. It’s not even clear that the identical letters in the same size are actually identical.\n\nTwo questions Trina:\n\n1) Can you see variation in the identical letters in the original, or is that just the scan? (To me, the S’s for example, do not look _identical_, even though the shapes are about the same.)\n\n2) What is the actual date of the document? (This could help rule out certain styles, although if you just want to look like this it may not matter.)\n\nA problem may be finding digital types that will be close enough for your purposes, but making any font into an outline is the easy part.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
