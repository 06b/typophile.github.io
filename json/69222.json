  "content": "I've made a couple of quick videos to show the difference in editing between Fontographer and FontLab. FontLab has so much more power than Fontographer, so I'm not complaining overall. But I AM frustrated by some of the actual drawing/editing behaviors.\n\n[In this first video](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020161157/http:/www.typesetit.com/video/fog-demo.mov), I show how I use Fontographer to connect two letters to make a ligature. In this case, I used the \"r\" to the letter \"k.\"\n\nI began by removing the overlap of two paths, then using the merge tool to get rid of unwanted nodes. With Fontographer, the interpretation of that merge is so much more intuitive with regard to what I want it to do. The amount of editing is limited.\n\n[In this second video,](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020161157/http:/www.typesetit.com/video/fl-demo.mov), I perform the identical task of making the same ligature. But what happens in FontLab with regard to the merge (in FontLab, the delete button does the same task as Merge in Fontographer) is a bit frustrating. Its interpretation of what I want it to do is different and requires more editing on my part.\n\nWith this simple task demonstrated in the two videos, I'm able to perform more than three times faster in Fontographer than in FontLab.\n\nQUESTION: Is it that I am just very accustomed to how Fontographer works, or is there something I could do differently in FONTLAB that would make this process easier (and, more like how Fontographer performs)?\n\nOr is my interpretation that Fontographer is more intuitive a correct one?\n\nP.S. I hope the videos explain what I mean... I didn't want to have to try explaining by typing all of the steps out. :)\n\n",

Since I haven't used Corel Draw, I don't know the distinctions, but I do prefer how Illustrator works better with regard to those two features.\n\nYes, there is a lot to be said for familiarity. You're right about the rotation and scaling in Fontographer (FOG). However, I find that the way Fontographer works with Bezier paths and nodes is IMHO superior to Ilustrator (and FontLab) and worth the trade off.\n\nThere are features in both FOG and FL that I really like. I would love to be able to combine features I like about FontLab with features I don't in Fontographer (or vise versa).\n\n"

My apologies.\n\nBELOW is the original POST of this thread:\n\nAdam Twardock mentioned in another thread:\n\n_I've checked and Fontographer 5.0 (soon to be released) behaves the same way as the Type 1 spec and the same way as FontLab Studio._\n\nCool. I know and understand that FontLab is far more popular and powerful a tool than Fontographer, but I'm looking forward to the release and intend to get it.\n\nI've been using FontLab exclusively since I got it about 7 weeks ago. And while I've learned a great deal, and recognize the overall superiority, there are things about how FontLab functions that simply put, are inferior to Fontographer from my point of view. It's probably more a matter of my being used to Fontographer, as I have used it since 1988.\n\nIn fact, over the years I often found myself using Fontographer to do work that most people would do in Adobe Illustrator. I simply liked Fontographer's drawing methods better than Illustrator. It seems to be so much more intuitive.\n\nThere are definitely things I like about FontLab over Fontographer, but my hope is that Fontographer's upgrade will incorporate some of those features FontLab has with the already good features of Fontographer.\n\n"
