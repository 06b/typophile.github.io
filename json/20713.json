  "content": "I have always struggled with the names of specific fonts and type designers, as I am sure many others have. Doing a search here, I came up with a few threads that were of good reference, but none that were specifically attributed to this subject alone. So, here, we can clarify once and for all those cumbersome pronunciations so that I for one won't ever say Benguiat incorrectly ever again.\n\nSome of the below I am including for the greater good, and some I am including because I am honestly unclear on the correct way to say the name. Hopefully, everyone else will contribute their own key's to the difficult pronunciations as well. I think that the best way to do this would be to play the phonics game, spell out the sounds? Right? if not, someone else can make that decision.\n\nAdditionally, I was thinking that this could be included into the Typowiki somehow. Obviously it would be best to have the information included under the specific articles for the designers, but, maybe there should also be a commonly mispronounced typeface/designer article as well?\n\nTypefaces:\n\nBelwe  \nBenguiat  \nCaecillia  \nCheltenham  \nCochin  \nDidot  \nHiroshige  \nHoefler\n\nType Designers:\n\nEdward Beguiat  \nCharles Nicholas Cochin  \nFirmin Didot  \nTobias Frere-Jones  \nJonathan Hoefler  \nAldus Manutius\n\n",

The thing is, even when you listen carefully at International conferences, pronunciations vary slightly.\n\nI'm surprised you didn't have \"Lubalin\" in the topic thread list.\n\n"
