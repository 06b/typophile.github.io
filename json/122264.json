That is not to say that such a typeface was not made.  \nBTW the British Library announced in 2010 that this newspaper, and many others, will be available in digital form for online reading. Press release: [http://blogit.realwire.com/british-library-and-brightsolid-partnership-t](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215061009/http:/blogit.realwire.com/british-library-and-brightsolid-partnership-t \"http://blogit.realwire.com/british-library-and-brightsolid-partnership-t\")... and [http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/w/276.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215061009/http:/chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/w/276.html \"http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/w/276.html\")  \nEdited:  \nAdditional Information.  \nUnfortunately the links do not actually lead to the digitized newspapers.  \nBy 1884 the idea of a concave lettering was made into a font by Marder, Luse & Co, which they called Concave. A version of concave was digitized as Show [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juan-jose-lopez/show/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215061009/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/juan-jose-lopez/show/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/juan-jose-lopez/show/\") But there are considerable differences between Show and the nameplate lettering \\_ILLUSTRATED PAPER\\_.  \nDon\n\n"
