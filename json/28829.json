  "content": "Dear fellow Typophiles,\n\nI am currently looking for samples of 'famous' [handwriting](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022064409/http:/typophile.com/wiki/handwriting) scripts. I am especially interested in samples of Blaise Pascal's handwriting. Anyone of you ever 'searched' for / noticed / found such samples, sources and lettering excerpts? _(Please note, I am not necessarily looking for actual typefaces, based on famous handwriting. But I am of course open and thankful for any suggestions and hints.)_\n\nThank you.\n\nDav\n\n",
