  "content": "Recently, I was asked to design a book (mostly poetry) to be printed at an as-of-yet unspecified production place in Israel, and was wondering if anyone knows the popular book/trim sizes over there.\n\nIt'll be written in Russian, drizzled with additional bits in polish, and old English, so a fairly versatile face is called for. Much of the subject matter concerns classical, and Renaissance work, with a plethora of illustrations by old Italian masters, so I think a light Venetian influence on layout and typography would not be misplaced. Can you recommend a good family, aside from the obvious: Jenson, Arno, Palatino, Garamond?\n\nAlso, if anyone can point me to any particularly well designed books that combines pictures, prose and poetry (or just feature the latter)I'd be more then grateful.\n\n",
