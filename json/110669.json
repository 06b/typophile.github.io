      "content": "Probably lettering in a popular style of the early 20th century, rather than a specific font. Note the tilde shape for the center stroke on E. Here is a somewhat similar digital font called Jonquin  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/jonquin/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/jonquin/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/jonquin/\")  \nby a British foundry, Greater Albion Typefounders, which is \"inspired by some hand lettering seen on a World -War One recruiting poster.\"  \nMove the tilde stroke to mid level and do some other relatively minor tinkering and you are in the ballpark for your lettering.  \nOther digital fonts with the E tilde include Tenebra by František Štorm  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/tenebra/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/tenebra/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/tenebra/\")  \nThe E tilde is in the lowercase.  \nFor more information on fonts with the tilde see:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/103815](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/typophile.com/node/103815 \"http://typophile.com/node/103815\")  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Can't name this one and doubting actually it could have been a font, more probably a sign painting or a custom lettering for Gieve(s) (which could make sense when talking about tailors to the King...).  \nI'm wondering also if the /E median crossbar is [flame-shaped](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/typophile.com/node/103815). Anyway, some clients for customization: [Bolyar](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/bolyar) (removing some spurs), [Trieste](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/trieste), Aviano [Flare](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-flare) and [Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-serif), LHF **[Cameo](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/cameo.php)** (my vote), [Boston Truckstyle](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/bostontruckstyle.php) (interesting but enough elegant even reworked I guess), [Esoteric 3](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802204320/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/esoteric3.php)\n\n"
