Something with a circle inside the capital \"P\"...the lowercase \"e\"might have been rotated. The original logo was designed in 1989 if that helps.\n\nThanks!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Modified- Avant Garde Gothic Bold \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [oldnick](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415064159/http:/typophile.com/user/6470 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
