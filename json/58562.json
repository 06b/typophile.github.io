There are always things that can be made typographically better.\n\nAnd while not typography per se, you can spend an inordinate amount of time preparing halftones. It is rare today to find a book without a fair number of images.\n\nTo do an acceptable job usually takes 20 minutes with Photoshop, and that's assuming your monitor is calibrated, you've profiled your \"proofing\" printer, and you have accurate TVI data for all 256 levels of gray from the eventual printer, on the sheet that will be used for printing. To get the most out of an image, or to prepare an \"art\" image, takes far longer. But no one's willing to pay for that kind of work.\n\nMore often than not, you also start with a supplied image rather than being able to make a scan from an original, and that supplied image will be 8-bit, with an untagged color space, & somebody will already have (poorly) done some manipulation.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWhen I read something I'm interested in -- the best test -- I find that I can ignore a lot of poor typography, design, etc. It is sort of surprising to me, but I seem to reject buying a book, or quit reading one, more because of bad printing than any other single manufacturing issue.\n\n"

From what I see all but the top institutions struggle with these simple standards. Graphic design programs at universities and museums are often behind the curve or simply not up to the standards that other countries set. When a museum or educational program teaching graphic design does not demand the best design and typography where do we look for standards?\n\nAlso, I see a general trend toward disrespect and non-recognition of expertise. The culture seems to have fallen prey to the idea that anyone can do any job, and that if I do not understand the particulars of what differentiates a good job from a poor job no one else does either.\n\nMuch of this has to do with ethical standards associated with business, and business culture inevitably encroaching on standards within institutions. Corporations know that by eliminating skilled positions and filling them with underqualified people within ranks or outside the organization money can be saved.\n\n"

      "content": "@CameronWilliams: <cite>\"where does it all end?\"</cite>\n\nI think it ends with the continued cultivation of a strong, unified professional design community that can work together to maintain the standards of the trade. In my experience, there is a lack of emphasis put on the importance of typography within the greater design community. This needs to be changed starting at the educational level. I have always found that outstanding typography can salvage lack-luster imagery, but no amount of breathtaking imagery can make up for poor use of typography. In the end, if the **words** look unprofessional, the **whole piece** looks unprofessional.\n\nI think that more and more designers come out of school (especially the technical schools) underestimating the importance of typography, and consequently end up treating it as a supplement to the design, rather than as a crucial element of the design – an art form in itself. In advertising especially, some designers completely miss the boat on how important it is for a brand to have a consistent voice – an implied character whose use of language (tone, formality, etc.) reflects the values of the brand and it's target audience. This is a key part of the puzzle in creating a successful brand culture, and has only, in my opinion, been successfully accomplished by a handful of brands. These brands also just happen to be the ones that stick around for the long haul.\n\nSince language and all of its denotations/connotations are at the heart of building a successful brand culture, we as designers need to respect the impact our treatment of typography has on the delivery of our language, and ultimately our brand's personality and values. In short, the language needs to set the stage for the imagery, not the other way around. I could go more in-depth about why writers are underpaid, but I digress.\n\nSo, coming full circle, it seems to me that education in design needs to hold itself to higher standards. I see too many technical schools with lousy design programs selling to-good-to-be-true degrees to students who are looking for an alternative to fixing air conditioners (no offense to air conditioner repairmen – I just think that people should strive to do things they are passionate about, whether they are fixing things, designing things, or crunching numbers). These programs are not exactly attracting those who are passionate about art and aesthetics, but those who see design as better than their other options.\n\n[Edit]  \nBy the way, my biggest pet peeve at the moment is when people don't hang their quotation marks for a pull quote.\n\n"

When I attended school (not that long ago even!), the design school I went to was focused primarily on motion graphics and flash development with branding as a close third and communication design & print & typography being left to short and ultimately inadequate amounts of time. I understand that the digital age is one about the dynamic — websites, flash, video etc. That's what attracts \"normal\" people nowadays and gets them excited. Even I am rather impressed by a well designed and executed piece. But the problem is that the split between print design and web design that occurred when the web came to be is starting to resolve itself and the two streams of thought are starting to remerge. Of course, not everything from print will carry over, but important aspects like grids, typography and visual presentation will. We're just at the growing pains stage right now.\n\nUltimately, the problem is that people don't have or are unwilling to spend the time to make good typography. I have been guilty of that myself in an attempt to build a webpage as fast as possible, but I'm making an effort now to make sure everything is done as good as possible (I'm even fixing our copywriter's double space after sentences —&nbsp;I need to talk to him about that). Anyone I work with I will essentially force to do the same until they do it and they'll teach the next person and so forth (my evil plot). Truly, the best thing we can do right now is to show that there are people that care about good layout and typography and make it important. The more effort put into it, the more schools are willing to listen and realize that it is actually something of important. Maybe then, they'll start to change their ways.\n\n"

That seems hard to do in a world where vinyl signs in artificially condensed Arial abound on the fronts of stores selling albums by guys who can’t finish a record without autotuning every second of the vocals, but it isn’t impossible.\n\nI think that to tip the scales in favor of beautiful typography we must ally ourselves with other proponents of beauty and effort and expertise. There’s no shortage of such people in the world. Marian Bantjes seems to have inspired many graphic designers to care about work that’s done slowly, intelligently, and with great care. Karim Raschid is doing something similar in the world of industrial design, notably with his adorable little dustbuster. Alice Waters is pushing chefs (and people who cook at home) to take it slow and use the best ingredients. Alejandro Paul zips from convention to convention spreading a love for carefully crafted fonts and lettering. Jeff Koonz keeps pushing pop art to even more wonderful places than Oldenburg and Van Bruggen did. Sade still takes the time to slowly tease out a perfect album every decade.\n\nWhat we need to do better is evangelize in favor of those who do it well. There are plenty of wonderful William Morrises out there who work with masters of their crafts, with with slow, artful dedication, and they need to be held up as examples of people doing it right.\n\n"

This extends beyond graphic design and typography to all aspects of life. It is truly sad to see the arts so undervalued in the American public school systems.

I saw the flipped apostrophe/date problem two weeks ago in _The New York Times_, a paper that once hired Ed Benguiat to design its masthead; the same paper that employed Roger Black as designer of _The New York Times Magazine_, the paper that publishes Williams Safire’s often witty and always informative _On Language_ column; it’s only a slight exaggeration (if at all) to refer to the paper as “the pinnacle of newspaper publishing”. And they would not print a retraction.\n\nAnd in the recent past, I’ve tried to fix these and other typographic mistakes in printed pieces for national advertisers and even for renowned publishing houses and ivy-league universities; only to be told: “stet”; “we cannot afford to risk offending the client”.\n\nAs for the hardware solution, _I_ like it, but how do we convince anyone to use it? These characters are already accessible via combination keystrokes, yet the publishers of Mavis Beacon haven’t incorporated typography into _Typing Tutor_, nor can I foresee their doing so; their widely-praised method still advocates double-spacing after punctuation, and double returns at paragraph ends. How do we change the perception that typographic first principles are mere “niceties”, rather than necessities? Because if we can’t change that quickly-growing perception, your improved keyboard will never be manufactured; and awareness of mankind’s typographic heritage, a heritage inextricably linked to the rise of literacy (and its concomitant, self-determination) will surely fall by the wayside; that’s why I thought it no exaggeration to state that we may be entering a new dark age.\n\nCan we mount a major museum exhibition, and will that have any effect? We could try a legislative approach; try to convince our local governments to issue fines for misspelled signs, and further fines for not correcting the errors, but I have little hope for that method. Should we take guerrilla action (I liked the Chevwrong advertisement posted elsewhere on this site, but that was politically rather than typographically motivated)? How can we convince educators that this is a matter of importance? Drastic steps, rather than incremental improvements, would seem to be appropriate at this point. Am I wrong?

The original Qwerty keyboard arrangement was originally designed to slow down typists on early mechanical typewriters. 100+ years later we still use a device that slows us down, and you expect everyone to change to a new version just to placate the 1% of the population who are typographically aware.\n\nGood intentions do not always lead to actions.
