And the Mardersteig exhibition is really very impressive. If you have the opportunity, I strongly advise you to go there.\n\nAlas, the photos hardly convey the ambiance that emanates from the numerous exhibits. As I couldn’t really capture the books’ formidable spirit, I just picked a couple of interesting details.\n\nBy the way: the [accompanying catalogue](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905131032/http:/hsl.chalco.net/erez4/fsi4/fsi.swf?pages_server=http://hsl.chalco.net/erez4&pages_dir=FSI%5FPages/hyphen/Demo/grafiche%20SIZ/LIPSIA/&cfg=pages_presets/catalog.fsi&Skin=plain&pages_pagecolor=000000&pages_slider=0&pages_index=1&MouseModes_Mode2=0&pages_skin=plain&pages_pagebordercolor=999999&pages_menu=1&pages_BendEffect=none) is online at the [Stamperia Valdonega website](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905131032/http:/www.stamperiavaldonega.it/), as a Flash file that can be searched, browsed and zoomed.\n\n"
