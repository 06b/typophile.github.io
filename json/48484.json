  "content": "Hi\n\nI have to write up my doctoral thesis eventually (when I run out of reasons to procrastinate) and it should look nice (never mind the content...).\n\nSo I was having a look around and at the moment I have decided on Neutra Text Light for titling and headings and Jenson for the copy.\n\nMy aim to use fonts that work well together, and ideally anyone who is reading the thesis (and is not a typophile) won't even notice my clever selection of font, only subconsciously acknowledging the easy legibility and harmony (and flow) of the text and headings. The headings should not overpower the following text.\n\nThe copy will be in 12px with line spacing 1.25 to 1.75, headings around 30px, 21px, and 15px. There are no guidelines on what fonts to use.\n\nDo these fonts work well in these sizes on long documents in academic (management studies) context, based on your experience/ deep knowledge? Any suggestions for alternatives? Or should I stick with Arial and Times New Roman and get my hat?\n\nThanks for your answers!\n\nMike\n\n",

I probably mixed the units up and it should be pt instead of px?\n\nI am still deciding which editor to use for the final document (300+ pages A4, with lots of references, some illustrations and tables etc.). At the moment I'm using MS Word. LaTeX, OpenOffice Writer, or even HTML/CSS are some alternatives I'm thinking about.\n\nI hate MS Word (a pain with long documents), OpenOffice Writer isn't much better, and I don't really want to learn LaTeX. I know a LOT of CSS.\n\nWhen I publish it (if ever) online, then I'd set the units in em's (and use boring web fonts until @font-face is widely implemented).\n\nMike\n\n"

His types, based on the upright calligraphic styles of the time, are regarded as among the very best of the Renaissance, indeed of all time.</cite>\n\nPretty good summation. While Adobe Jenson has perhaps been regularized, it still calls to mind the Italian Renaissance, an unusual allusion for \\*management theory.\\* Minion is an obvious choice for text; if you want to be different, I'd look at Cycles (text) and Arepo (display) from the Stone Type foundry, or something in the same vein from any of the other designers.\n\n"
