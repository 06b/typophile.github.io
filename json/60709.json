The angles and character widths are all over the place and the tracking – spacing between words is scary bad.\n\n"

With a detail view of one of the letters pulled from the PDF (I’d us the R) explain to them after extensive research their logotype appears to be handdrawn, thus making it impossible to create variations for their additional companies.\n\nIn addition, I’d put their current logo on a sheet and recreate it with ’Futura Bold Oblique’. Obviously, you’d fix the tracking and spacing issues and present the two side by side. Explain the benefits of using a professional designed typeface and the benefits of having it available for corporate branding and the other company logos.\n\nAs a polite gesture tell them you’d be happy to use their current typeface if they can provide the name. ;)\n\nHere’s a closeup of how bad the “R” really is.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814172507im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Central_Glass_R_5203.png)\n\n"
