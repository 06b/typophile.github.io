  "content": "Hi all. This will be my first post on Typophile. I am very much interested in learning more about type design and it is my ultimate goal to design a few of my own. I already have some ideas floating around my sketchbook. Can anybody offer me some advice on how/where to begin. Also, what are some good resources (books, websites, etc.)? I am studying GD in school at the moment but none of my professors have ever designed their own typeface. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Matthew and welcome to Typophile. Don't be surprised, most of the brilliant design educators who had the greatest impact on me were not the greatest designers as I imagined them to be.\n\nRegarding online resources; [I Love Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/ilovetypography.com/) is a great starting point. Few other websites which I have in my mind at the moment are: [typefoundry.blogspot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typefoundry.blogspot.com/), [briem.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/66.147.242.192/~operinan/index.html), [100types.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.100types.com/), [kupferschrift.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/kupferschrift.de/cms/), [paulshawletterdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.paulshawletterdesign.com/), [Microsoft.com/typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/default.mspx), [typotheque.com/articles](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.typotheque.com/articles), [fontfeed.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/fontfeed.com/), [typedia.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typedia.com/) and [typographica.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typographica.org/).\n\n[The Elements of Typographic Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typographica.org/typography-books/the-elements-of-typographic-style-4th-edition/) by Robert Bringhurst appears to be a popular read amongst designers and typographers, some other books which I enjoyed reading were: [Counterpunch: Making Type in the 16th Century, Designing Typefaces Now](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.goodreads.com/book/show/463387.Counterpunch) by Fred Smeijers, [Anatomy of a Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Typeface-Alexander-S-Lawson/dp/0879233338/ref=pd_sim_b_1) by Alexander S. Lawson, [Alphabet: “The History, Evolution, and Design of the Letters We Use Today”](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.amazon.com/Alphabet-History-Evolution-Design-Letters/dp/0823001709/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1366871880&sr=1-4&keywords=allan+haley) by Allan Haley. All of the books by [Doyald Young](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.doyaldyoung.com/) are a must in my opinion, if you can afford them.\n\nAdditionally, see also journals and magazines like: [Codex,](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/codexmag.com/) [Eye](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.eyemagazine.com/), [Baseline](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/www.baselinemagazine.com/) and [Creative Review](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typophile.com/wiki/www.creativereview.co.uk).\n\n"

Not all cases lead to fruitful feedback, but sometimes one's cup runneth over!  \n [http://typophile.com/node/83333](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165650/http:/typophile.com/node/83333 \"http://typophile.com/node/83333\")\n\nGreat compilation, Sevag! I would add these three books: \"Letters of Credit\" by Tracy, \"Designing Type\" by Cheng, and \"Letter Fountain\" by Pohlen.\n\n> most of the brilliant design educators who had the greatest impact on me were not the greatest designers\n\nIndeed. Because actually designing things versus being able to communicate about designing things are two different talents/skills. Sort of like chefs versus food critics. The important thing is for each side to appreciate the indispensability of the other.\n\nhhp\n\n"
