It is always nice to have a really nice \"look and fell\" handwritten font. Not an easy task.\n\nNella Sue is nice but it would be great if could be a little bit more bold for contrast, don't you think?  \n [http://www.dafont.com/nella-sue.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418173946/http:/www.dafont.com/nella-sue.font \"http://www.dafont.com/nella-sue.font\")\n\nSuomi Hand Script  \n [https://www.fontshop.com/families/suomi-hand-script/buy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418173946/https:/www.fontshop.com/families/suomi-hand-script/buy \"https://www.fontshop.com/families/suomi-hand-script/buy\")\n\nlooks really nice and has some extra \"personality\" added too.\n\nCheers,\n\n"
