I can’t seem to find any known typeface that goes with any medicine on the market right now. I was really wanting to do Nexium. Does anyone know if this drug was custom designed or if it has a common typeface that can be downloaded, or bought? I’m new in the type world, so go easy on me.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023163141im_/http:/typophile.com/files/footer_nexium_pill_5004.gif)\n\n [‹ Granite in Web Layout Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023163141/http:/typophile.com/node/50787 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [I'm looking for a Serif font with big, strong, prominent punctuation ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023163141/http:/typophile.com/node/50752 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
