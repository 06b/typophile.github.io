The type size? The way I would emphasise certain type for i.e headings etc. How else can I make it typographically interesting? Do you think using type to make up images would be exciting? What other ways could I do it? Thanks.\n\n",

Like if you were applying for a position in a graphic design department in a large non-graphic company, the person judging your resume would not be graphically aware.\n\nAnyway, in this case I think you have a little bit of room for impressing, but not much, and you have to tread pretty carefully: too little is better than too much (assuming you have a good chance at getting the job based solely on the content of the resume). In terms of the font, I would choose something very under-used but understated and highly readable. Not Times, but not Mrs Eaves either.\n\nhhp\n\n"

My work experience lasted about 7 years and was the job from heaven. And why did they look at my CV? because it was two things: different and relevant. It's a comment I hear over and over from Creative Directors I chat to that they are looking for an indication that someone has a passion for what they do. Their time is limited so at least give them a reason to look at what you send!\n\n"

The resume is a practical piece of design. It has a specific function. Good design has to be applicable design.\n\nNow, a truly different CV (like f&c mentions) CAN work wonders. The catch is that you REALLY have to pull it off well. And that's hard. There's a spectrum:\n\nA-----------------------------------------------------Z\n\nA = practical, well layed out, one page, type-only resume.\n\nZ = some crazy intelligent avante garde interactive CV.\n\nA & Z are both great. Anything in between, though, can fail miserably. ;o)\n\n"

Good employers will spot good candidates and will be bombarded with these things in the next few weeks/months and will look for any reason to cut the pile down to size. In the end it's what you say that's important, not how you say it.\n\nIf nothing else, put it up for crit on this site – it's a rewarding experience :os\n\n"
