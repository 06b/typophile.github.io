Like its sibling [Metroscript](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819002618/http:/www.michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/metroscript.html), Deliscript has many features that expand its usability such as the the variable length tails which can be accessed in 6 different styles, and the unique crossbars which can be extended outward in either direction from the \"t\" character. Throw in the special \"WordLogos\", tons of ligatures and foreign accented characters, and you have a recipe for typesetting that approaches the look of hand-lettering. This was only achieved with the very savvy technical assistance of Patrick Griffin of [Canada Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819002618/http:/www.canadatype.com/) who did all the OpenType encoding.\n\nDeliscript has just been released at [FontBros](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819002618/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=ALSO-DESC). The 6 Page (1.7 MB) [Deliscript User Manual](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819002618/http:/www.michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/Deli_OT_Manual.pdf) may also be downloaded.\n\n",
