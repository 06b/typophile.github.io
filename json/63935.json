      "content": "Interesting. It feels rather fresh and definitely not \"dusty\", which religious groups don't often manage to do (to my perception at least).  \nThat said, it also feels surprisingly cold, techy and corporate (and a bit Web 2.0), mostly because of the type (and type color). \"Thrive\" is a great name – hmm, it would seem to warrant a little more movement, a little more liveliness – the premise of [inner] growth, a bit of sparkle\\* and joy and life, no? At the moment it seems a bit… dead. The absence of the tittle doesn't help.  \n(\\* You do have a bit of that in the leaf/cross mark, which I think is quite nice.)\n\nIt would be cool to learn a little more about this group. Is it a \"real-life\" community? Or an online thing? What are common activities, goals? Do you feel the \"tone\" of the logo matches what they do, how they work?\n\n"

      "content": "I think the typeface is quite attractive, and the i doesn't need a tittle in my opinion, as it would ruin the pure look of it a bit (however, it would make it more dynamic, which is desired). I think the symbol is wonderful, but very cold indeed. I would probably use that symbol but add some sparkles around it in a dynamic composition (but don't make a sparkle-cloud), and change the color from emerald to orange/yellow, and position the symbol centered above the text.\n\n"
