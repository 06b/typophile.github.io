  "content": "Can someone help me out?  \nWhats the difference between these two types of kerning?\n\nI know that metrics are instructions built into a face that gives software programs instructions about how much space to put between different combinations of glyphs. Arent these 'metrics' set-up so that faces have correct optical spacing depending on the shape of each glyph? If so, the what is 'optical' kerning.\n\nSpecifically, i'm talking about type controls in Adobe CS programs.\n\nThanks - JonnySchneider\n\n",

While optical kerning may perhaps be a handy tool for large bodies of text, for display type (and wherever possible) one should always manually kern.  \nI guess metric kerning would be based on the kerning info from the font file, where as optical is an approximation/adjustment based on the visual character. Still never going to be as good as adjusting by eye.\n\n----------  \n**Paul Ducco**  \nSolid Creative  \n [Communication Design, Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106213657/http:/www.solid-creative.com/)\n\n"

      "content": "Paul, you got that right.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't use optical kerning for anything other than display sizes (usally do it by eye anywway). An exception would be made with badly spaced fonts which can look better in text settings with the Adobe's optical kerning.\n\nAlso may be of interest;  \n [Opinions on Optical Kerning](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106213657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20455)  \n [IKern vs Adobe InDesign's optical kerning](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106213657/http:/typophile.com/node/10317)\n\n"

There's my answers)</cite>\n\nThanks guys, but i dont think anyones actually answered the question...\n\nI know there is no substitute for kerning by eye.  \nMetric kerning uses the kerning info stored in the font file, but what info does the 'optical' setting in Adobe kerning use to make its adjustments.\n\nI guess i should RTFM...\n\nok, i did.\n\n'optical' kerning in CS is used To automatically adjust the spacing between selected characters based on their shapes.\n\nHm, see, isn't that what typographer's do when they write metrics for their typefaces?\n\nSounds like 'optical' kerning is an approximation for faces with crappy kerning info.\n\n"
