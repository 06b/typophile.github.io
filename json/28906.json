      "content": "hey thanks a lot for getting back to me,  \nOk, well the audience is 20 — 60 year olds.  \n(wide audience, yes, but let me explain.)\n\nIt is an exhibition catalogue of 64 pages with vibrant colour images.  \nCheck out the website: www. paintingsbelowzero.com\n\nThe artist used cutting edge refrigeration technology to install paintings into a 400 year old church as part of a fortress in the mountains of Northern Italy.\n\nI would like to achieve a face to represent the history of the project as well as one to symbolize new technology.\n\nWe are producing this catalogue to sell at two installations the artist will do January 2007. The purpose of this catalogue is also to send out to galleries and institutions in hopes that they will comission the artist to install his works in their space.\n\nOk,  \nthere you go, what is your response,  \nand thanks,\n\nJ P H\n\n"
