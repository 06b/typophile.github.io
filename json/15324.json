I found Babbage on Veer but I'm worried how well it would work as body copy at 8pt. I definitely don't want to be using Times or something along those 'traditional serif' lines but I need this font to fit into a fairly tight space as far as magazine page sizes are concerned.\n\nAny help would be appreciated!\n\n",
