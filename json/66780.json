  "content": "The deadline for Font Aid IV submissions will be Friday, January 29th at Midnight Eastern Standard Time (New York).\n\nWe currently have over 250 participants and I expect we will exceed 300, breaking all previous Font Aid records.\n\nWe’re excited to move to the next phase in the project. Chank Diesel has been working hard behind the scenes to create the font. It will be sold through multiple font distributors.\n\nWe’ll announce a release date as soon as we have one. We hope to move quickly so we can start raising funds for Haiti.\n\nThanks so much for your support!!\n\nMichelle & the SoTA board\n\n",
