If you ever get hold of old sign painting books you'll find alphabets like this usually called \"Casual\" or sometimes \"Utility\". Red Rooster's [Portobello](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043628/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/portobello-rr/) is another close-ish one, especially the demi, bold & extra bold weights.\n\nI've just noticed Bello & Portobello. I presume there is a connection but what is the source?\n\n"
