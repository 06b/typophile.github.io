  "content": "Hi all, i am doing a dvd cover called The Mistress starting Julianne Moore. I have used an image that is rather feminine yet empowered along with 30's feel, i would like to have suggestions on appropriate fonts for the movie title. Thus far, i've tried paring Futura Medium w/ 1)Galliard, 2)Castellar MT, 3)Bellevue. I am trying to capture the feeling of feminity and power.   \nSuggestions and comments please. Thanks a bunch! =)\n\n",

Maybe someone else has it?   \n   \nVaughn Oliver used it quite a bit when he was designing for [4AD](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023020211/http:/4ad.com/). In my humble opinion, some of the best design for the music industry has occurred at 4AD.   \n   \nAnd while you are there check out the photogallery. One of the happiest accidental photobook purchases I have ever made was of Tom Baril's work, published by 4AD. Haunting.\n\n"
