I’m not decided on the Latin type yet. I may design something myself. However, it will be similar to the Plato I have used here.\n\nWhat do you think of pairing it with Avant Garde?

I realize the actual company name will make a difference on that. But overall, what do you think?\n\nAnd lastly, the business currently uses Avant Garde in its logo, with no other type. That’s why I continued using it. Does it work? If not, do you have suggestions?\n\nOr, do you have another Latin type suggestion?\n\n"

If there’s a “U” in there you might even show it as a “V”. :-) The subtext could be lc (maybe all-lc) but with a nicely contrasting font it doesn’t have to be. In any case I’d avoid Avant Garde. It smells moldy. You don’t want moldy furniture.\n\nAlso, the weathered idea make me uneasy. But it depends on what kind of customers the client wants. And that central question should guide the choice of an Avant Garde replacement.\n\nNick, that’s more Greek than Latin.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, my point is that there are two ways to approach Latin-ness.  \nEither through authenticity (Trajan) or through popular (mis)perception (Caesar’s Palace).\n\nIMO, some of the Shaw/Boge types would be good for “Latin”, e.g. Donatello, Ghiberti, Beata.  \nBased on Italian Renaissance inscriptions, they combine the authentic classic proportions of Latin antiquity with a slightly hewn effect, to satisfy the popular conception of something a bit rustic. A clean sans to complement such faces could be Futura, with its Classically proportioned capitals.\n\n"
