  "content": "Hi everybody, For the Python chapter in my upcoming book, Learn FontLab Fast (to be released in July at TypeCon--Read about it at [http://www.logofontandlettering.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110411065105/http:/www.logofontandlettering.com/)) I'm asking for some typical Python scripts that I can use in the book.   \n   \nI won't go into explaining Python programming (those of you who know me know that it would probably kill me to get into that), I just want to present helpul, ready-made Python scripts designed to solve common problems so other FontLab users can plug them in.   \n   \nPlease explain what the script does, then provide either a screenshot of the programming window with the script entered, or just paste the script into an email to me at [lescab@flashfonts.com](mailto:lescab@flashfonts.com).   \n   \nI'll credit everybody who submits a script I use.   \nThanks,   \nLeslie\n\n",
