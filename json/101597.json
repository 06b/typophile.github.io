It's apparently been bundled with other products such as ClarisWorks and (as such fonts often do) has made its way into the archives of some mass font repositories. I don't know of any legitimate source to download it, but it _is_ part of the School Font Collection CD ( [PDF link](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619235615/http:/www.halfhollowhills.k12.ny.us/uploaded/PDFs/Technology/sf.pdf)) which is available from several online vendors.
