I presume he means in a list if things should appear like:\n\n`I. ____\nII.___\nIII.__\nIIII._\nV. ____\nXVIII.\n   e`  \nor  \n` ____ I.\n___II.\n__III.\n_IIII.\n____ V.\nXVIII.`  \nor  \n` __I.__\n_II.__\n_III._\n_IIII.\n__V.__\nXVIII.`\n\n(okay it's hard to center 2-3 characters in monowidth). Also, off topic, is it possible to show whitespace on «code» because, well, it's kind of important for codes.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».
