  "content": "espn always has nice fonts. this font looks somewhat familiar but the chopped tops of the S’s and G’s as well as the slanted bar in the H make it distinguished. The “R” is also slanted some. i’m interested in seeing if there are varying weights to this font.\n\nthis is from the previous issue which was about college basketball. i tried getting a link to the digital version but its been updated to the most recent.\n\nany help much appreciated! i tried providing as much information as possible. thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091201221924im_/http:/typophile.com/files/espnBballFont_4676.gif)\n\n",
