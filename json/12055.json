Also, two or more characters that are combined into one [glyph](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101326/http:/typophile.com/wiki/glyph), generally comprising such characters as **ﬁ** , **ﬂ** , **ﬀ** , **ﬃ** , **ﬄ** etc.\n\nWhen type was made of metal, ligatures were a physical necessity to stop one piece of metal clashing with another: it was physically impossible for strokes to overlap. Not so with digital strokes: so nowadays, ligatures have primarily aesthetic benefits. Some ligatures, such as the common **ﬁ** may merely prevent the collision of two glyphs, but others such as the OO ligature provide a decorative, ornamental quality.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [qu ligature, tell me why not?](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101326/http:/typophile.com/node/19376) descends into a discussion of what comprises a ligature exactly.  \n [Non-Latin Ligatures](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101326/http:/typophile.com/node/31432)  \n [Bring out Your Ligatures](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101326/http:/typophile.com/node/43879)\n\n**Technical Discussion:**  \n [Unicode Ligatures](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101326/http:/typophile.com/node/33330)\n\n**Additional Articles:**  \n [Wikipedia \\> Ligatures](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031101326/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(typography))\n\n",
