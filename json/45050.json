  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have been developing a squarish sans intended for text (e.g. in brochure), for now there is only regular weight, others are still under development. I would like to hear your opinions on this before I move on.  \nDo you think this font can differentiate itself from other square sans? What do you like or not like about the letters?  \nComments and criticism are most welcome. Thank you for taking a look at this.\n\nMarica\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820030912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/melor-regular-m_5083.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [melor-regular-mp.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820030912/http:/typophile.com/files/melor-regular-mp.pdf) | 32.48 KB |\n\n",

Maybe I would come up with a new one.\n\n@clauses  \nDanish style? That's interesting. Thanks for pointing that out, I will correct it.\n\n"

This type of squarish sans seems to be the new \"Meta-syndrome\". A couple of years ago everybody was doing their interpretations of Meta. Today we see a lot of squarish sans.  \nBut, hey – that shouldnt stop you, should it? :)\n\n"
