  "content": "Hi, typophiles-  \nI’m working on a website for a lawyer friend, and had paired Trade Gothic (Bold Condensed No.20, a personal favorite) with Bulmer Italic to try to balance the forcefulness of the Trade Gothic. I am fond of the pairing, but my client doesn’t like the Bulmer- she wants something less “cursive-y.” I tried some serif small cap typefaces to look more legal-esque, but they look too pretentious to me. I want to keep the approachable feeling I think I had going with my original pairing. Any suggestions?  \nMany thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907051106im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/lawyer_5811.png)\n\n [‹ Symmetric Typography: Letterheads](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907051106/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43865 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Daimler logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907051106/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43593 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
