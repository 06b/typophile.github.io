If all goes well, broach the subject of work experience or ask if there is anything you could do to improve your portfolio, or any other design companies nearby that might be able to help. Design Week, Creative Review or the Guardian on Mondays are the best places to look for vacancies but there will be precious few for new graduates.  \nGood Luck  \nTim\n\n"
