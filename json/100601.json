  "content": "I recently came across a book, c. 1990, typeset in A. Frutiger's Iridium (Linotronic 500), and realized what a beautiful typeface Iridium is. Like a happier Walbaum, a more humane Bodoni, a better-crafted New Caledonia...\n\nAs the Linotype specimen sheet, as always, isn't too helpful -- has anyone has ever used the digital version, or seen a book typeset in it?\n\nthanks in advance!\n\n",

I'll be able to get it via interlibrary loan, but I'll appreciate more thoughts on Iridium nevertheless.  \n [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521088893&...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415095930/http:/www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521088893&ss=exc \"http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521088893&ss=exc\")\n\n"

No effort was made to adjust or manually kern the text... just a straight comparison.\n\n[http://ge.tt/7VAbQiY/v/0?c](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415095930/http:/ge.tt/7VAbQiY/v/0?c \"http://ge.tt/7VAbQiY/v/0?c\")\n\n"

Looking at the comparison, I'm getting an idea of what a great font this could be if the spacing were corrected -- and if it came with the small caps and text figures that the original had. Even the »Pro« (!) version comes without them :(\n\n"

But everybody involved would need to own a license to all the fonts in the mix.
