      "content": "One little thing here: FogLamp will round off the off-grid points just the same as generating a font file (ttf or ps). The simple fact is FontLab does not support off-grid points (neither do ttf or ps). However, FogLamp does give you the option of increasing the number of units per em in the resulting vfb, so the rounding can be lessened.\n\n"
