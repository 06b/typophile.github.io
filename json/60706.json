Are you populating the description and/or license fields in your OpenType fonts?\n\nWe're investigating a new bug that limits these fields to 5,000 characters (edit: regardless of encoding). Need to determine if this limit is unrealistic.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n",

It seems to me that having the complete 'rules of use' (EULA) in the font itself would increase the chances that users actually follow them. And that would be a good thing, right?\n\nThere is already a license URL field that gives a link to an external EULA, so the main license field seems like it should be used for that purpose - to show the complete license. Although it does not affect OFL-licensed fonts, you probably need to fix the bug, or potentially face a vendor who wants to have their full EULA in the font (which should be their right) and can't, and accusing MS of not giving them the right to properly communicate their EULA. :-)\n\nVictor\n\n"
