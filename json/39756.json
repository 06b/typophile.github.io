The kern feature for the GFSOlga font says “Latin”. The kern feature for our version has no language tag at all — the kern values are just entered. But with our version, the kerning values in the features do in fact appear in the little CS3 test document.\n\nThen I checked the foundry GFS font (with the “Latin” tag). It too worked. Now this is just a new document without any paragraph or characters styles, is that the issue (We’re still using CS2 in production).\n\nWhy can’t I get the problem mentioned in the earlier thread?\n\n [‹ Is Leopard OS good to go now?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119050626/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39789 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Semi-standards ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119050626/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39669 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But Chris is right, the problem manifests itself when you assign a certain language for a certain text — for example, if you mark some font set in Cyrillic as “Russian”, it will then use the OpenType features registered under the “cyrl” tag.\n\nA.\n\n"
