Basically that is why the menu and that title has a lower font-size. Anyway, I bumped it up 1 pixel and I think it works better with the menu already, what do you think?\n\nI also changed the date to Benton Modern RE, thoughts on that as well?\n\n"

For some reason it looks wide to me.  \nAlso for your to-do list: making it work on mobiles:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417083951im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_5364.PNG)\n\n"

The only dislike I have for Benton Modern RE on the dates is that the weight contrast between it and Old standard in the titles are too significant.\n\n"
