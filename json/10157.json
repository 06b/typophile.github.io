But then it occurred to me that OpenType's table structure and capacity to handle new, arbitrary tables in the future without harming existing functionality means that we could do this in OpenType 2.0.   \n   \nWe just have to figure out how to put physical instantiation into a table. Also, the cost of arbitrary fabrication systems capable of building physical objects based on computer-based instructions needs to come down. But they only cost $20K today (according to a recent piece in The Economist), so if we apply price reduction at rates equivalent to Moore's Law (improbable, but just for fun)... mmm, in about 13.5 years arbitrary fabs will cost about $40 so every computer will have one. Then you could just have a new OpenType table that contains instructions for building stuff, and have it build the thing that goes and gets your drink from the fridge.   \n   \nSo, if you're willing to wait until late 2018, no problemo!   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

Consider the simple word 'jumps' at 12 points. This word sets perfectly and doesn't require any kerning. It has been carefully optimized by Adobe's designer Robert Slimbach to have absolutely perfect spacing at this point size.   \n   \nNow let's specify Adobe's 'optical' kerning. InDesign subtracts 23 units of space between j and u, adds 14 units between u and m, subtracts 16 units between m and p, and -1 units between p and s. The result is atrocious. The u is now too close to j, and there is a noticeable river of space between u and m. A well-made font has been rendered useless.   \n   \nIt's the same story no matter what font or setting you choose. Adobe's 'optical kerning' isn't a feature -- it's a liability. Worse still, it's featured in Illustrator and Photoshop.   \n   \nAdobe has gambled that its target customers will not be able to tell the difference between a professional font rigorously spaced by its original designer, and a complete mess-up spaced by its guesstimator. I don't agree. My faith in designers is greater than that.\"\n\n"

InDesign's optical spacing wasn't meant to be used only with Adobe's fonts, or Carter's fonts, it was meant to be _useful_ to a lot of people, and most fonts most people use have imperfect spacing. Take Mrs Eaves for example, a font that many people love, to the point that they ignore the font's horrid spacing: InDesign renders Mrs Eaves actually usable.   \n   \nAnybody free of a visceral, burning desire to strike down Adobe at every turn in the berserker rage of a jilted lover (think Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction) can see that InDesign's optical spacing is just another tool, that can be used or misused. It is better than not having it, and that's more than can be said of many things, certainly most fonts!   \n   \n\\> My faith in designers is greater than that.   \n   \nFaith, shmaith. Most fonts are spaced badly (you of all people should realize and admit this), and InDesign's optical spacing makes them less bad, that's all. A good typographer simply knows when to use it and when not to. Think of it as anti-lock braking on a car: there are more people who need to avoid rear-ending the car in front of them than there are people who need to perform a controlled slide.   \n   \nCrocodile faith.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "\\>I generally work with a font's built in kerning and then flip on the Optical Spacing for display work and fine tune from there. Often saves a lot of hassle.   \n   \nWell, Stephen, I suspect the reason you see a slight visual improvement is that the predominant action 'optical kerning' takes is tightening.   \n   \nMay I suggest that you simply track negatively instead?   \n   \nThe problem with 'optical kerning' is that it tightens disproportionately and incorrectly - and when it thinks it has to add space, the results are usually disastrous.   \n   \nThe advantage of using simple negative tracking is that you preserve the correct spatial relationships of the font. (Unless it is just a shareware cockup - in which case, what are you doing using it to start with?)   \n   \nThe profound disadvantage of 'optical kerning' is that it distorts the original spatial relationships of the font in an irrational and unpredictable manner.   \n   \nIt requires only the simplest analysis of any of its suggestions to see where it almost invariably goes wrong.   \n   \nWhat is really great about the feature, though, is that it makes it so easy to determine exactly where and how it has gone wrong.   \n   \nMy position is that it is simply indisputable that the traditional technique for dealing with display sizes - used since phototype - is the best: negative tracking. 'Optical kerning' is a gimmick gone wrong.   \n   \nI know that deeply respected font folk from URW have worked on this intensively, but I believe their work has been in vain, primarily because the program still does not look at actual stems. Analyzing white space has been tried by a hundred programs a hundred times, and just doesn't work. Never has, never will. EvB and JvR tried doing this in a much more sophisticated manner, and ultimately conceded failure. The only thing that is surprising here is the number of worthies that were taken in on this latest occasion.   \n   \nThere remains the suspicion that 'optical kerning', though of dubious merit for professional fonts, can be of value for badly spaced shareware fonts. I can't agree. If the program cannot understand a well-spaced font, it cannot understand a badly-spaced font. It seems clear that whatever slight benefit might exist is just due to generalized tightening that could be achieved better with simple tracking.   \n   \nI have yet to see a single documented test which establishes that 'optical kerning' actually understands what it is doing.   \n   \nBut this isn't an issue which needs to be argued theoretically. Arguments for either side can easily be demonstrated by simply mentioning the settings.   \n   \nI have shown that 'optical kerning' will hopelessly mangle the spacing of the word 'jumps' in Adobe Garamond Pro. Can you provide us with some examples in which you can consistently show that 'optical kerning' actually performs well? (Especially when tested against simple negative tracking?) My suspicion is that in at least 95% of cases, 'optical kerning' will make visibly deleterious decisions. And my position is that no program can even begin to know how to space or kern until it is aware of actual stem positions. This, clearly, Kernus/URW/optical kerning cannot accomplish and indeed it is too much to expect, in a WYSYWIG context.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> the predominant action 'optical kerning' takes is tightening.   \n   \nIncorrect. The spacing is depending on point size, with smaller sizes generally getting _loosened_, which is of course what's required. I've actually graphed the algorithm's behavior, and it's \"bilinear\": a straight line between 4 and 12 point, another (shallower) straight line between 12 and 72, and no [further] change below 4 and above 72.   \n   \nThat said, it's probable that _overall_ InDesign's algorigthm tightens more than loosens, but I would think that's due to most fonts being spaced too loosely (it's easier that way, after all).   \n   \n\\> May I suggest that you simply track negatively instead?   \n   \nNo, because that ignores \"boundary conditions\", like the right side of the \"r\". Fooling with the tracking is a brute-force approach that's generally much worse than what InDesign would do.   \n   \nOne problem with InDesign's algorithm though: if you apply tracking to text that has optical spacing enabled, the tracking is still applied \"blindly\", leading to the boundary issues above; I think it would have been much better to take the opportunity to apply the tracking adjustment as a \"recommendation\" to the optical algorithm to change its parameters. But maybe there are performance issues (which is why I think the alogirthm is bilinear and not outright smooth).   \n   \n\\> Unless it is just a shareware cockup   \n   \nThere's a difference between a font with good forms but lousy spacing, and a font that's good in both. There are very many fonts in the former category (probably because most people in type design are aesthetically competent but analytically lacking) and these are the ones that benefit most from InDesign.   \n   \n\\> Analyzing white space has been tried by a   \n\\> hundred programs a hundred times, and just   \n\\> doesn't work   \n   \nIt hasn't been done to the point of matching a good human spacer, I agree, but it's really the only way you _could_ get close to it! Balancing the white space, after all, is the whole point of this; stems are circumstancial, a shadow of the true solution.   \n   \nThe reason it hasn't been done yet isn't that it's not possible, it's that there's not enough money in the field to finance a serious effort to completion. Many people who have given up wouldn't have if we paid them enough. But then we have people like Raph, so all is not lost.   \n   \n\\> Can you provide us with some examples in which   \n\\> you can consistently show that 'optical kerning'   \n\\> actually performs well?   \n   \nYou can easily do it yourself, like with Mrs Eaves (which is no shareware font).

Some things (like the extremely important \"the\") are much improved, but some places the decisions are suspect\\*.

Somebody with a 2400dpi printer might want to try it out and chime in...   \n   \n--   \n   \nOne thing that hasn't been mentioned yet: from what I understand (I think John pointed this out once), the Optical algorithm's decisions depend on the existing spacing; they don't completely over-ride it. I'm not sure if that's true, or why it's true, or how it might work, but it's possible that if a font's existing spacing is _really_ whacked the algorithm doesn't perform as well? Or maybe if a font's spacing is unusually loose (like in Mrs Eaves) the algorithm gets confused? Dunno.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
