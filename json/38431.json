If the bottom of the italic title for the 3 piece is lined up with the third line, why not the first two. I don't understand the significance of putting the titles one line below the numbers.  \n3. Depends on what sort of paper size you're printing on, the point size could be a bit smaller.\n\nI like the color and the font itself.\n\n"
