You can occasionally use different fonts, but make sure to limit yourself to 2-3 fonts for like 90% of your text.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Some may have a more serious type style, some more whimsical, etc so depending on the recipe we want to post we'll use a typestyle that matches well with the flavor of the dish or juice recipe. Our logotype and copy however are always the same fonts :)\n\nThanks much,\n\nChris\n\n"
