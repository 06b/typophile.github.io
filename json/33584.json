Anyway it would be nice to have an app that could take whole folders of fonts and display them, that could XFontInfo not do. I don’t want to install Linotype’s Fontexplorer as it gets in my way with its caching and auto-this and auto-that. Mac OS X’s fontbook preview window is way to small to be usable.\n\nThere is a host of font viewers on versiontracker, but I have yet to find one that simply works. Are there any applications that you have tried and can recommend?\n\n [‹ Style-Linking Question from a Newbie](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704150731/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33757 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [help on tables ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704150731/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33823 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "This is an interesting idea. Most font management/preview tools use ATS for font previews. To preview uninstalled fonts, the application developer would need to have libraries that could handle the rasterization. One option would be to use FreeType, although I don’t know if it works with traditional Mac suitcases. The downside is that the compatibility of the preview engine would not be exactly the same as the OS. It might offer some advantages in terms of generating specimens though.\n\n"

The fact that no-one has done something like MacFont [http://www.geocities.com/mixage/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704150731/http:/www.geocities.com/mixage/ \"http://www.geocities.com/mixage/\") for OS X yet is puzzling. XFontInfo only went halfway, but shows that it is possible. I am mega puzzled. I miss MacFont.\n\n"
