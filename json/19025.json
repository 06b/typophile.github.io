  "content": "Some time ago I bought a very old document from the 1920's on a second hand fair. I instantly fell in love with the used typeface and descided to scan it and make a font out of it. Intentionally I just wanted to use it as an excercise for future fonts, but meanwhile I've really put my teath in it.\n\nIn the attached PDF you'll find the original text from the document. This contains words with the 'normal' s and the old German ' [long s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018104354/http:/typophile.com/wiki/long%20s)'. My German is quite good, but I my backwords compatibility goes only back to 1995. So I don't know how the long s is originally used in German text. I couldn't find any structural grammar-rules in the text, because both s-forms are used in the same word. Sometimes only the normal s is used and not the long s.\n\nI want to make an OpenType Pro font that takes care of the historical grammar-issues when you activate the feature. Besides that it will be packed with cool ligatures that I'm going to make next.\n\nDoes anyone have reference material, or can give me an insight in the 'long s'-fenomenia?\n\n[RV©Deutsch\\_Reich.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018104354/http:/www.characters.nl/downloads/RV%C2%A9Deutsch_Reich.pdf)\n\nThanx,  \n®ené\n\nPS: The name is just a working title, so if anyone has a cool name for it... please feel free to suggest it here.\n\n",

      "content": "The distinction between ſ and s in German is really a spelling problem, and as such there won't be an automatic solution unless you plan to include a sizeable dictionary in your implementation...\n\nHowever, it's really only crucial for Blackletter. When using Antiqua for printing German, the short s has always been acceptable.\n\nSince you may still be interested, I'll try to explain the rules as far as I remember them.\n\nAs pointed out before, the basic idea is that ſ comes at the start of a syllable, but s is written at the end. (The ſ in ſp and ſt is always counted as part of the following syllable, unless etymology indicates something else.) The problems are that sometimes ſ can also come at the end of a syllable:\n\nIf the end of the syllable coincides with the end of a word, the end of a prefix, or the end of a constituent of a compound word, s must be used; these rules are applied to words of foreign origin, too! If a silent vowel has been elided (e. g., ich wechſle, unſre) ſ must be used. Before a suffix starting with a vowel, it's ſ. If the suffix starts with a consonant, use s. Before d, k, m, n, w (in native German words, there are few such combinations not covered by earlier rules) s is used. In all other cases ſ is used as the default.\n\nDoesn't seem to complicated, but in practice the issue can be quite subtle, for example transportieren (trans-portieren) vs. tranſkribieren (tran-ſkribieren), or Wachſtube vs. Wachstube (slightly far fetched, but there are a few examples where the form of the s changes the meaning completely.)\n\nAbbreviation and hyphenation do not affect the choice of s. You have to base the orthography on that of the complete word.\n\n"

Not ever instance of \"fl\" is replaced by a ligature in German. \"Auflegen\", for instance. \"Auf\" is a prefix. Prefixes and root words are not connected by ligatures.

      "content": "So in German text, you only substitute fi an no other ligature? This doesn't satisfy me. Same for Adobe's solution which requires that you activate dlig (discretionary ligatures) to get f-ligatures in German text ... [Side note: These language-dependent definitions would require that layout engines respect language tags which, to my knowledge, most of them don't do at the moment.]\n\nI am unhappy that no application yet supports proper substitution of f-ligatures and maybe long-s for German. Obviously this is the price of internationalization. And I am one of them who made a fuss about the earlier method of substituting f-ligatures everywhere, with typographically incorrect results at many places in a German text.\n\nBut: Taking f-ligature substitution (almost) completely out of liga is just the other extreme!\n\nA very simple solution for German typographers is:  \nliga \\*should\\* substitute f-ligatures wherever they appear -- so, no additional lookups for German! If a typographer really cares, he can go through the text manually, place the cursor between two letter that shall \\*not\\* be ligated, and switch off the liga feature. Character styles may help.  \nThe amount of work this requires is about the same as with Andreas Seidel's or Adobe's liga-implementation for German. Only difference is, corrections work the other way round ...\n\nIn German typesetting it is not nice, but does not harm either if f-ligatures are used at places where they are typographically \"wrong\". This is what has become common anyway -- because the software does the job. If we are honest, there are maybe a hand-full of German typographers who really care if an f-ligature is in place or not. My impression is that this hand-full of typographers are responsible for the just-as-unsatisfying solutions described at the beginning. I worry for this, because the \"solutions\" are even worse than the original problem which is something one can live with! And definitely is not to be addressed on font level.\n\n**To non-German-speaking type designers: Just do it as you always did. Forget the talk about exceptions from German side. Dealing with these exceptions correctly is not to be solved on typeface but on application level (dictionary).**\n\nKarsten\n\n"

The German language has a lot of f-ligatures (ff, ffi, ffl, ffj, fft, etc.) that have been forgotten in fonts for a long time. You had to buy an expert font an work through your whole text to replace these ligatures. My god!...\n\nI'm also a person to correct my text by hand, as long as we're not talking about a 200 pages thick book. ;-) IMHO I think every typographer and/or typedesigner should apply 'the correct typographic rules' set an example for people. If they don't, who will!  \nMost people nowadays rely too much on their software to do it right. Mostly this is not the case. Therefor I want to implement as much into my font as possible, so the machine does it right.\n\nIf you make a font for a specific language, the etymological- and grammatical issues should be respected and applied correctly. You can't just producte the rights glyphs and put them into the designated box.\n\n®\n\n[www.characters.nl](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018104354/http:/www.characters.nl/ \"www.characters.nl\") { Dutch typography to express yourself }\n\n"
