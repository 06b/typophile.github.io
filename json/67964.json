A custom font for Lloyd's of London.\n\n[Brand Guidelines for the Coorporation of Lloyd's  \n](http://web.archive.org/web/20150228184639/http:/www.lloyds.com/NR/rdonlyres/72DEA2D9-4EDC-4D8B-9946-85201D7937A5/0/Lloyds_Corporation_brand_guidelines06.pdf)\n\nI can not find this font commercially (or otherwise) available.
