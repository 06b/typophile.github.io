A Designer of what?  \n**Me:** Well, what you see around you, posters billboards, books, signage, packages..websites (on rare occasions)  \n**Them:** Ah ! So you are a webdesigner!  \n**Me:** Well not so much, I dabble on occasion but..  \n**Them:** Hey, you know what, my daughter needs a logo for her band, I still have a few minutes before I have to head back, can you make one for her before I leave?  \n**Me:** Well, see now, designing a logo takes a lot of effort, and it’s not just a mark, what we do is create identity systems..  \n**Them:** Don’t be ridiculous, I see logos every day, they are tiny things, you can make a dozen in five minutes. I’d do it myself, but I can’t draw, tell you what, just draw me a picture and I’ll put in the text and everything, My cousin showed me how to do shadows and other cool things in Photoshop!  \n**Me:** Identity design is probably the most difficult discipline within the field of graphic design, it requires one to sift through countless concepts to arrive at a finished, concise form that embodies a whole score of ideas, is unique, and pleasing to the eye. You have to appeal to the target, and after all, a logo is just a tip of the iceberg. A logo by itself is just a mark, what makes it magic, is an expansive and detailed identity system, that establishes a particular style to all areas of visual communication, from architecture to the color of your toilet paper.  \n**Them:** Well, thats just a load of corporate nonsense isn’t it? It’s just a way for you guys to raise your price. All I need is a simple little logo. I don’t even mind if it only has two colors, and I can add the shadow myself. I was going to order it from one of those online logo places, but they are charging $50! Isn’t that ridiculous? 50 bucks for a tiny picture. Who’d ever pay that? If you want payment, I can give you this gift certificate for $35 at Quick-E-Mart. How about that?\n\n**And then you accept their commission, because they are distant friends of your relatives and you can’t say no, or for that matter, ask for a fair price:**\n\n**Me:** Here are three directions that we can take to develop your identity.  \n**Them:** Oou! It looks pretty good, but I don’t like the green.  \n**Me:** The green is there to blah-blah-blah... but it doesn’t matter. What we have to decide, is which of the three do we pick and work on further.  \n**Them:** Oh, I think the left one is the best of the bunch, but I thought about it some more this past week, and I think we should have strawberries. I’ve asked my friends and my partner, they all agree, that strawberries are a good positive image.  \n**Me:** Eh?  \n**Them:** And here is a font that I fond on the web, it’s modern and forward-looking.  \n**Me:** But..  \n**Them:** So, if you could just take that design on the left, put a strawberry on top, and write the text in ZZ\\_Type\\_Kool, we’ll be golden.  \n**Me:** Hang on a minute... /Writes up a 2-page essay explaining the value of quality design, the difference between kitsch and avantgard, the meaning of professionalism and the role of a designer as conceptual communicator./  \n**Them:** /After skipping through to the least sentence in the essay/ Stop being difficult! I am paying you money, and should be entitled to get what I ask. I even found you the font (ZZ\\_Type\\_Kool) so you don’t even have to search for one. My insurance company needs a pink strawberry on top of a shining golden spear, and I expect to get it. If $100 I paid is not enough, I can add 20 more for your troubles.  \n**Me:** So why do you even need a designer?  \n**Them:** I can’t draw strawberries. Look, I’ve worked with other designers before, and it was always very easy, I tell them what I want, they do it and get paid. See what they did for me? /shows a juggernaut of piss and glitter/  \n**Me:** But that’s horrible!  \n**Them:** All designers say that about the work of all other designers! And it only cost me $50.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nPersonal Art and Design Portal of Ivan Gulkov  \n [www.ivangdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706172636/http:/www.ivangdesign.com/ \"www.ivangdesign.com\")\n\n"
