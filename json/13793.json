      "content": "like the face. though dan is right about the y. and perhaps it doesn’t need to be a stencil?\n\nI think #6 is working best for me. though I am not sure about the two I’s. Perhaps just one and make it a logotype only, no mark?\n\nmarks are hard for IT companies. They’ve been played out. I think perhaps just a logotype with some kind of stylized dash between the sys and the IT would look quite nice.  \nperhaps the dash in some way hints at order from chaos…\n\n"
