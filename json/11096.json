  "content": "I am a third year Graphic Design student at The Arts Institute at Bournemouth and am looking for some help with regards to my final major project. The brief for this project is as follows:   \n   \n'Examine through broadcast media the changing role of written language   \nwithin the expanding digital world highlighting its inaccuracies and deviations from the communicative accuracy of the spoken language.'   \n   \nAlthough heavily emphasised towards language development another major   \naspect is to highlight the development of the written word into more screen based solutions, in effect type for the screen.   \n   \nAny ideas, contacts or places to reasearch would be gratefully accepted.\n\n",
