I have tons of fonts and wanted some suggestions on how others tend to search through their libraries to choose fonts. The best thing i can think of is to manually go through each font and tag meta data for searching. but that would take forever. why aren't tags built into fonts to make it easier?\n\n",

      "content": "Indeed... i find myself going to MyFonts more often than ever just to do a quick search for something like \"chalkboard\" -- when the results come up, I can almost immediately recognize some font(s) I have, then go into Font Agent and activate it/them.\n\nAt present, I've got my library organized mostly by foundry... Adobe in one set, Bitstream another, etc, etc. Of course, I had to break my \"Web\" fonts into multiple sets, and they're still too huge. And I find myself creating job-specific font sets more often than I used to, and keeping them longer -- I keep re-using the \"pirate\" set I built two years ago.\n\nOrganizing by style is one of my laundry-list things-to-do, but I fear I'll never get around to it; my biggest complaint/problem is that you can't permanently (or semi-permanently) tag fonts by style - sets you create in FontAgent/Suitcase/FontExplorer/etc are only good until you trash your system or upgrade... then you've gotta start all over again. The only way I can see to keep style sets organized thru catastrophes is to organize them in the Finder (by folder) in my master sets, but then I lose my foundry organization. And with 10,000+ fonts, I'm loathe to have multiple \"master\" sets (no pun intended).\n\n"

      "content": "You CAN save your Font Explorer sets - go to Configure -\\> Load and save the file on a backup hard drive. Then when you upgrade or crash you can import it. Could have saved myself a ton of work recently had I known that.\n\nOrganizing by foundry generally is less useful for me, as that is rarely my jumping off point when I'm choosing a font for a job. I don't say to myself \"I think I'll use something from Emigre\" it's more like \"what's a good sans I haven't used recently?\" or \"what's an elegant serif that has an expert set\". If I already know which font I want I just type to it. And I don't need job-specific sets anymore with self-activation (altho that isn't working for me in Quark right now). I also tend to leave fonts for current jobs open for the duration of the job.\n\n"

Unfortunately, foundries are not consistent in setting that PANOSE parameter.\n\n"
