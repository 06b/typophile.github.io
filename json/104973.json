  "content": "This is the first time I have attempted to draw letters on my own (only the devnagari ones) and am looking for feedback. Chhayachitra is a Hindi word meaning photograph. It is a combination of two words chhaya+chitra (shadow+picture). The logo is for a photographer based in India whose work mostly consists of wedding photography. He needed the name clearly readable in Hindi for Hindi speaking clients and in English for registration purpose. I suggested the use of Hindi letters as a visual element that could be used indipendently and yet carried the name of his firm. The version with Latin characters is simply for legal purposes. Any comment or critique is welcome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417163732im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chhayachitra_logo_6029.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [chhayachitra\\_logo\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417163732/http:/typophile.com/files/chhayachitra_logo_01.jpg) | 108.09 KB |\n| [chhayachitra\\_logo\\_02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417163732/http:/typophile.com/files/chhayachitra_logo_02.jpg) | 130 KB |\n| [chhayachitra\\_logo\\_03.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417163732/http:/typophile.com/files/chhayachitra_logo_03.jpg) | 151.3 KB |\n\n",
