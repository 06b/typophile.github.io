  "content": "Hello!\n\nB&P Typefoundry is proud to present and distribute Romain BP by Ian Party.\n\nBased on the Commission Jeaugeon’s models and on Philippe Grandjean’s classic character, the Romain BP celebrates the marriage of geometric rationality and elegance, of science and craftsmanship.\n\nThe Romain BP Text is actually closer to the Commission’s model than Grandjean’s Romain du Roi. It is more synthetic in its structure, more radical, and thus, more modern. It is a contemporary text typeface based on a structure that was created in 1690, not a revival mimicking Greandjean’s shapes. It is an attempt to imagine the aesthetic choices we should be making in the modern day, based on the universal theoretical model.\n\nThe Romain BP Headline is a complementary font, which, free of text constraints, fully exploits the amazing graphic potential of the original model.\n\nmore informations on our website\n\nYou can download our free trial version to test the font on your own computer.\n\n[www.bpfoundry.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414235931/http:/www.bpfoundry.com/ \"www.bpfoundry.com\")\n\n",

      "content": "if you look to the old model you can see that there is no real slanted roman. the choice was difficult and this one is a pure design choice who (i think) fit better with the \"roman construction\", if you go on BP website you can read more about some of my choices. In a few month i will release two other typefaces around Romain du Roi, one based on Nicolas Jarry calligraphy, and one based on the type in church book of early begging of the 17 century, and then a book about the 17 century french typefaces \"the origin of the circle shape\". this book will finish my work around the Romain du Roi construction. in between BP will release other typefaces based on old french model\n\nian\n\n"

      "content": "From what I remember there were _three_ distinct italics, although the \"official\" and/or \"production\" status of each is still open to discussion; and one of them was in fact a slanted Roman (even though it seems to have never been cut).\n\n\\> BP will release other typefaces based on old french model\n\nBTW, are you familiar with the late-19th-century work of the Deberny foundry? I'm actually working (although at a snail's pace) on a revival from that period.\n\nhhp\n\n"
