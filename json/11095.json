  "content": "I am quickly becoming a fan of the expanded character sets of OpenType fonts, esp. the built-in support in most for oldstyle numerals.   \n   \nI'm doing up print collateral (with mailing addresses, of course) using oldstyle numerals. Zip+4 codes look great with them; however, because a Street Address line usually starts with numbers, having the line start with characters (34) that hang below the baseline looks uneven.   \n   \nIs it acceptable to mix the two styles within a text block. I'd love to be able to use lining numerals in the Street Address line and oldstyle characters in the City-State-Zip line, but I want to make sure I'm not committing a typographic faux pas.   \n   \nAlso, any great style guide books out there there that discuss typographic minutiae such as the above?\n\n",
