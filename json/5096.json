It's not a debilitating problem (not yet anyway); I first noticed it when I created a TrueType file that included a codepoint not found in the standard Latin codepage. I selected the font in Word and it gave me no error message; I then selected the file in WordPerfect and it could not open it, saying \"Error--Cannot use GDI object. The most probable reason is insufficient memory.\"   \n   \nAnd like I said, now it's moved on to other functions (but it's okay again once I reboot the computer). Anyway, I'll try the suggestions. Thanks guys.\n\n"

      "content": "Windows ME.   \n   \nI should add that, in addition to the GDI.EXE error, I frequently get other errors: DIBENG.DLL, USER.EXE, TypeTool2.EXE, etc.   \n   \nI only noticed the problems once I started performing heavy vectorization functions, and not just in FontLab programs--CorelDraw8, CorelPhotopaint8, AI10. Again, any heavy graphics applications.   \n   \nTo tell you the truth, I think my system might be a tad too weak for the operations I'm performing. I'll open three or four of the programs I listed above, copy and paste between all of them, minimize, save, cut (not to mention 7 or 8 ellipse-contours in FontLab all at once trying to become an \"s\").   \n   \nMaybe I'm trying to do too much, too fast--that's when the problems occur.\n\n"

I look forward to hearing more on the subject.\n\n"
