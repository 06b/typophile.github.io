Lately I’ve become very interested in the work of John Langdon & I’ve been trying to make an ambigram myself to add to my portfolio as well. With little succes so far, so if anyone can give links, advice, tips,... on how to get started it would be much appreciated. Just for the record, I do know the easiest way to get started is to study other ambigrams & start off your own by writing a copy of your desired word flipped 180° to see what forms you’d be working with. But there are more ambigrams than just the single 180° words. Any usefull information or nice links are welcome.\n\n [‹ rosewood: what font to pair it with?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011157/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34057 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [greek ductus ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011157/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33869 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Another point is that it sometimes works against the final product if you try to make one letter directly into its opposite, in other words, parts of one character can be used to form parts of the rotated, neighbouring characters.  \nPost a sketch maybe somebody will have an idea/advice.\n\nTim\n\n"
