      "content": "There are three major font management programs for OS X: Suitcase Fusion, FontExplorer X Pro, and FontAgent Pro. They are all serious and capable applications.\n\nYou don't say anything about what kind of work you do, what applications you use, or indeed anything else that would give us any clues that might suggest what features would matter to you. People have opinions in plenty, but it's hard to give meaningful advice in a vacuum.\n\nOf course, I'd be happy to see you give Suitcase Fusion 2 a try, as I'm the product manager for Extensis' font management applications. What's the last version of Suitcase you used?\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
