I'm not saying that [a survey of Latin grammar](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821054848/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_grammatica) is more or less significant than the Christian bible, mind you, but the journalist seems to have done her research. :-)\n\nIf someone were to ask me which of these two books has had more influence in Western history, I would have to say it was the Christian bible. Not to mention the fact that thanks to Gutenberg it could be mechanically reproduced. That changed things, too.\n\n"
