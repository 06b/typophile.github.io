Could someone clarify why this is? I'm thinking it's something that obly applies to fonts with quite wide letterforms.   \n   \nthanks!\n\n",

As a result, books use fonts with generous extenders to promote boumas (word shapes\\*, the core of immersive reading) while newspapers use fonts with generous x-heights to promote legibility (through plain old visibility) in adverse conditions (like a bumpy, dark train).   \n   \n\\* Or more accurately letter-cluster shapes.   \n   \nThe optimal vertical proportions of a font depend on its intended balance between readability and legibility - as well as the particular language's usage of the Cartesian space.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
