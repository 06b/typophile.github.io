  "content": "People of Fontos,   \nCan anyone recommend a good utility/ fine bit of software for extensive kerning. Currently I'm using notepad! I'm working on a font that has waaaaaaaay to many kerning pairs and I want to largely reduce that number.   \nFontlab is good for this. However I still want absolute control over which pairs stay and which go. - Some how it chooses an internal list and ditches most of the a-z pairs and keeps the brackets and hyphens. Not what I need. ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013030724im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \nSo far, the best thing I've found is to edit the metrics by hand in notepad. But there has gotta be something easier/better than this. Or   \nis there?   \n   \nIncidentally If anyone can point out any kerning lists, either with words - like gym, wyvern - things like that, or kerning pairs - like [http://typophile.com/downloads/kerning\\_pairs\\_1.0.txt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013030724/http:/typophile.com/downloads/kerning_pairs_1.0.txt) then I will be very grateful. Thank you.\n\n",
