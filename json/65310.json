  "content": "How can I restore all the kerning in a font. It’s probably obvious for someone here, but I can’t figure out to do it. I read in the FL manual that I have to press on the (icon) button and select the Reset Kerning command in the pop up menu. I see that icon in the toolbar but that button is in gray, so I can’t press on. Your help will be appreciate. Is there an other way to restore all the kerning in a font?\n\nThanks\n\nAndré\n\n",
