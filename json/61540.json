  "content": "This is a card design in progress for a photographer friend of mine, he's a wedding photographer with a bit of an edge whose style is a rather outside the traditional wedding box.\n\nWe decided to use his somewhat offbeat personality to really brand him as part of his business, the mark was developed a while back and we printed a simple two-sided card. He's now moving into a higher end market segment and wants to do a richer looking letterpress card along with some other collateral.\n\nThis is my first shot at the business card, the typeface in the mark and for his name is Gotham, the info is set in Eplica. I'm thinking we'd print this with a silver metallic and a gold on dark gray stock. I like the way the mark and his name feel but I think they could be set a bit higher, I don't know if I like how the contact info falls at this point.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420023324im_/http:/typophile.com/files/clint_lpcard01_5769.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "i like it! love the logo part...i might like to see the rectangle/frame/focus point thing in a thinner line and a teeny bit further from the letters just to see what it looks like, but i think this is great.\n\nif this were mine (which it is not), i might also play more with the typography of the info below. to me, it seems a little out-of-place. maybe a more modern sans serif or serif in all caps or all lower caps. (i know you are probably trying to avoid that b/c his URL is clinttakesphotos.) perhaps you can differentiate between those words by reviving the yellow and making 'clint' and 'photos' yellow, but 'takes' in white.\n\n"

I'm kind of hanging onto the serif as I like the way \"photgrapher\" plays off the solidness of the name, and I think it worked well on the original card which actually did use small caps for the info (below). Some good ideas on how to break that up though, let me do some more playing with it. Appreciate the input.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420023324im_/http:/typophile.com/files/clint_card_3958.jpg)\n\n"

I think I'm going to lose the frame idea for the letterpress card (though I do like the idea) as we're going to a one-sided format and I'm not sure there's really enough room for it. I wouldn't be opposed to integrating into the one-sided version if I can figure out a solution, however.\n\nOne other person has mentioned the National Geographic thing :) I'm not too worried about it as it's more a loose association than anything else, he's also been using the yellow as a brand color for a while now so it's a bit late to change it.\n\n"

Most wedding photographers actually have terrible identities as I've learned, and they seem to like scripty type :)\n\nevanbrog, good ideas, thanks. we had actually talked about doing a square card with the mark at one point so I do like the idea of creating that visual square there.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm assuming the card is standard size 12P x 21P. I suggest moving all the text up 20pt then. This is approximately the average between the distance from the left edge of the card to the yellow box/distance from the left edge to \"C\" in Clint. Hard to measure it accurately on a jpg, but that should be close. The visual focus stays on the mark and pulls all the text into a single unified form. This puts it below the vertical center, but the smaller space at the bottom works with the lighter type and brings your eye back to the mark. I think centering it vertically would give you an odd looking space at the top and it won't relate as well to the side spaces.\n\nIf you want a two-sided card I suggest just putting the mark alone, same placement as the reverse and switch the color scheme like you did in the second example: Yellow background, box in white, Clint in grey.\n\nI wouldn't do anything else. You could work with the line spacing between the type blocks, but it will work fine without having to do that and I think that length of time vs. diminishing returns makes it kind of nitpicky.\n\nIn my opinion.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"

As I said, I wouldn't change anything beyond placement. The card works well, and no it doesn't look like the \"c-word,\" The spaces within the mark are pretty consistent so there's no confusion.\n\nYou could fiddle with different faces for the text, but the way it is now there is a four step hierarchy and that's not going to get a lot better with different typefaces. Of course it's hard to tell from the jpg.\n\nAnd if you're going letterpress, price out a blind emboss for the mark which would make it even more striking. Just a thought.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"
