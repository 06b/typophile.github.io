Only got a graphic of it so have attached it.\n\nI have been trying to identify it with no luck but hopefully some of you might recognise it. If not then maybe you have suggestions as to a font that is similar / close to it?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nDN\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000417/http:/typophile.com/files/font_37.jpg) | 3.79 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Pitchfork 10th Anniversary New Year's Bash poster - Futura (customised) {Lex}](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000417/http:/typophile.com/node/19605 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) flourished script used in Martha's new mag Blueprint\\* - Fling {Patricia} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809000417/http:/typophile.com/node/19600 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Because they are so easy and cheap to produce there are literally thousands of them floating around on the web.\n\nHave you ever seen this script in another context, with different characters, especially repeating ones? It could even be a custom lettered logo for all we know, and only these 6 characters exist.\n\n"
