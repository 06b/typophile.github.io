Available through 31 May 2008.\n\nIn our age, since the arrival of microcomputing, the majority of professional letters have been composed in quality typefaces. Typewriters & the typestyles they used have become antiques. A letter composed in Times or Helvetica & printed with a laser printer at 300 or 600 dpi are of such quality that one can no longer distinguish it with a document produced by offset printing. But letters composed in this way appear overly institutional. Le Monde Courrier PTF, designed by Jean François Porchez, attempts to re-establish a style halfway between writing and printing. It returns the informal character of 'typewritten' fonts to letters and suit well all bad conditions printings, such faxes and low printer resolutions. Even though it connotes this aspect of communication, it does not have any less of a typographic character, integrating itself with the rest of the family with effective contrast. Le Monde Courrier PTF is available in three weights, each in roman, italic.\n\nPresented to the public in 1997, [the 2008 version](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211225815/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrierPTF) is the next step in the history of the [Le Monde Courrier](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211225815/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrier). The glyph set has surpassed the usual 250 to a size of more than 700, which allows for the composition of numerous Latin-script European languages. Along with small caps available in the three weights, 4 sets of figures are provided (lining and oldstyle) in tabular and proportional widths, depending on the version. Minuscule lowercase, figures for automated fractions, are also included, and in addition a set of dingbats for everyday use in newspaper and magazine layout. The full family is composed of more than 4600 glyphs and feature around 300 000 pairs.\n\n**[Le Monde Courrier PTF extended pdf specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211225815/http:/www.typofonderie.com/icono/alphabets/pdf/LeMondeCourrierPTF_pdf.pdf)**\n\n**Separate packs**\n\n[Le Monde Courrier PTF](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211225815/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrierPTF) 3 fonts: Regular, Italic, Bold, from €210 for a licence covering 8 workstations.  \n [Le Monde Courrier PTF b](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211225815/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrierPTFb) 3 fonts: Demi, Demi Italic, Bold Italic, from €210 for a license covering 8 workstations.\n\n**Full family to save 25%**\n\n[Le Monde Courrier PTF x2](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211225815/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrierPTFx2) 6 fonts: Regular, Italic, Demi, Demi Italic, Bold, Bold Italic, from €315 for a licence covering 8 worstations.
