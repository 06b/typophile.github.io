[Serifa](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044147/http:/www.linotype.com/1463/serifa-family.html) is kind of nice, but I think those three work best when setting all caps. Not to mention the fact that they lack cursive italics. Anyway, I for one love [Caecilia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044147/http:/www.linotype.com/1313/pmncaecilia-family.html). And what about [TheSerif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044147/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/lucasfonts/theserif_classic/)? And [Officina Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044147/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/itc_officina_serif/)?  \nI didn't know some of these you all mentioned, but none of them really won me over… Vista was almost begging to become a slab, that's a great one (I love Vista, so I love [Vista Slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044147/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=vista+slab&x=0&y=0)), and [Black Sabbath](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044147/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=t0133) is great in that quirky glitchy way.

For a more modern feel I quite like Enclave.\n\nDon't have it but as I saw it just recently am currently in lust with Archer.\n\nSince it was mentioned: Guardian Egyptian I've been seeing a lot of lately (partner’s newspaper) and I don’t like the light, but the italics I loathe.
