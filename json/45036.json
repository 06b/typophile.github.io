I’m on the lookout for a fresh, exciting sans sherif with a lot of character. I will be used both in the logotype and troughout the rest of the identity.\n\nDoes anyones of you type-specialists have an suggestion? :)\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Font that is similar to Seravek](http://web.archive.org/web/20080925081021/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45033 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Pictogram for Gratis ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080925081021/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43578 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Better get contrast with a differentiable typeface, or alter your chosen typeface for the same reason.\n\nPS  \nYou made a wonderful misspelling, thanks – “Sans Sherif”. It’s memorized, “The Sans Sherif(f)”\n\n"
