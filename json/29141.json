  "content": "I recently got a program called ObjectDock for my PC, which is basically a port of the icon dock on the Mac, that can magnify your icons when you move over them and all that. But the Fontlab icon on PC is only 48 by 48 pixels or something like that, so it looks horrible when you move over it and it's magnified.. I've searched every resource I know of for a high quality version of it without any luck. Does anyone with Fontlab 5 on a Mac feel like helping out (if it's not too hard to do)? I'm looking for the icon in 128 by 128 pixel size or larger, in either .ico or transparent .png format.\n\nThank you.\n\n",

Objectdoc icons are fully editable and you can edit one of its existing icons for FontLab.  \nBecause fontLab is not the photoshop, mean its not that widely used software..and thus its very difficult to get a readymade icon for this.\n\n:)\n\n"

I just prefer it that way myself. and I figure it's easier to ask if someone on a Mac can port it over (assuming that the icon for the Mac version is higher quality) instead of me having to redraw the icon in Illustrator or something like that.\n\n"

The FontLab Studio 5 icon only exists in 128x128 but we already have a 1024x1024 icon for the next version of FontLab Studio (not that we're going to release one shortly -- that's still a while ahead).\n\nBest,  \nAdam\n\n"
