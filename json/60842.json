(I have CS3)\n\nthanks!\n\n",

You may have to dodge and burn certain areas. Then convert the image to bitmap mode (Image/Mode/Bitmap). For \"Method\" select \"Halftone Screen\" use a low number for frequency to get large dots, select your angle, and probably round dots (although there are other options). You may have to play around with settings to get the result you're after.\n\nThere is also a Photoshop plug-in from Andromeda Software that does a variety of halftone effects.\n\n"
