  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nthis is my first post! Thank you for creating this forum, I have found a lot of great font inspiration here. Now here is a type id request. It's the \"aNYthing\" logo (New York City based clothing company). A font close to this would also be great, the only one that I have that comes close is Aachen Bold, but it's not really the same.\n\nAlso, the same font is used for the \"ny\" logo of the New York Giants Football Club.\n\nSo if you could help me, I'd be happy. Image attached!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo-blk0.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150228184615/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-blk0.jpg) | 79.34 KB |\n| [NewYorkGiants\\_100.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150228184615/http:/typophile.com/files/NewYorkGiants_100.png) | 1.45 KB |\n\n",

Device's [Quagmire](http://web.archive.org/web/20150228184615/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/quagmire/) is not a slab serif, but it has a similar feel, and the right 'ny'.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
