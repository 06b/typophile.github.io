  "content": "This might seem a rather silly question, but I couldn't find an answer.\n\nWhat is TxN?\n\nFor example, StormType sells Baskerville Ten, Baskerville Ten S.Caps, and TxN, as part of the Baskerville Ten family. At first I thought it was some sort of modified small txt version of the font, but Baskerville Ten is already designed for use at small sizes, so it might be something else.\n\n",

You can't see any difference between the TxN face and the text face in any type software....I suppose you wouldn't notice it until you set numerals. And I don't know of any other foundry that uses the 'TxN' designation...\n\n"
