Actually looking at ITC Avant Garde Gothic Demi Bold at a larger scale I can also see that the \"a\" is different too. The \"i\" looks the same though. How do I reopen this post?\n\n"

I'm with Ben -- this probably started life as Avant Garde and was stretched/manipulated by the designer. Not very well, IMHO: look at how thick the r is compared to the e, for example.\n\nAnyway, if you just need the logo as artwork, go here:\n\n[http://brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query\\_id=899873&page=1&mtype=&brand\\_...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017072320/http:/brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=899873&page=1&mtype=&brand_id=147482 \"http://brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query\\_id=899873&page=1&mtype=&brand\\_id=147482\")\n\n"

Other people will contribute if they feel they can give you a more definitive answer, as Mark has done.\n\nHow about I tell you that the Haier logotype is NotFutura?\n\n"

I reopened it upon Ferdinand's request, even though I'm convinced this is a wild goose chase. There is no font that looks like that.\n\n"
