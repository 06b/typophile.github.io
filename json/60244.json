[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/apolline/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201042849/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/apolline/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typofonderie/apolline/\")\n\nThis book has a lot of elements (a-heads, b-heads, lists, bullets, etc.) that I need a sans for. It's a simple, elegant, clean design. I've been creatively stuck on Gotham and Interstate. Does anyone have an alternative suggestion to get me out of my transportation rut?\n\nThank you in advance-Janet\n\n",
