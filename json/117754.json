The double-story a is a little heavier visually than the rest of the lettering, but only slightly. You asked if it looks small, but I don't see that at all, so I think you're ok there. For what it's worth, the thinner weight of the two looks much better to me, more natural.\n\nFor fun, here's the a both ways:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gtandcanary/morebi-rounded/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419144550/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/gtandcanary/morebi-rounded/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/gtandcanary/morebi-rounded/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/vox/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419144550/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/vox/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/vox/\")\n\n"

I thought it could read as /o/.\n\nAbout the size of double-story /a/, you described the problem better, that's what I'm talking about. Single-story blends much better with the rest of the letters.\n\nThose fonts you linked are great by the way. I'll study them.\n\n"
