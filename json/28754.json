Also an Adobe book, so be aware that there is a definite bias, as is with Stop stealing sheep.\n\nThe Mac is not a typewriter is a classic. Simple, and great for the layperson.\n\nA great specimine book is American metal typefaces of the 20th century.\n\nFontshop makes nice catalogues, and aparently LinoType has one coming out, for something liks $20usd, but from what I know it does not show complete character sets. That makes it more of an ad than a resource.\n\nIf you don't have it, definately get the Bringhurst book, but be sure to get the hard cover. The 2nd edition in perfect bound is a little too thick, though last time I checked only the 1st edition was available in hardcover. It has a nice red ribon for marking your page though. The major difference between 1st and 2nd ed is that in 2nd theres a larger glosary, more specimines, and mebe a small section on something digital. I have 1st in hard, have seen the 2nd, and feel no need to buy it again.\n\nBetter still, I get to go hear Bringhurst speak tonight (at NSCAD University) and if its appropiate, I might be able to get him to sign it for me.\n\n"
