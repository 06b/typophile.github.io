If the sizes are quite different, almost anything reasonable works.\n\nI do think if I were using an OpenSource font like Gentium & wanted a sans, I'd pay close attention to Lato\n\n[http://www.latofonts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416011835/http:/www.latofonts.com/ \"http://www.latofonts.com/\")\n\nWhich in it's own right is an excellent font family. That it's free & open source is just gravy.\n\nBTW, when we've used Gentium, we've found the Book -- available only in basic-- has better weight for text for our uses, which includes both print and the smaller size tablets, such as the Kindle Fire & Android phones.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments!  \nIt is a philosophy book, about 250 pages with much technical stuff like formulas, arguments, blocquotes etc. and many (really: 6!) levels of headings; which is why I need some means to distinguish them without getting too messy and Myriad offers that (and it is not so cold and sterile as most sans-serifs, which is why it seems to me that it might work well with Gentium). No illustrations, just 2 diagrams; intended for philosophy of religion nerds. The choice of Gentium is determined by the house style of the publisher. Yes, I am using the \"Book\" version.\n\n"

If this is academic Anglo-American philosophy, often the authority of a \"sterile\" sans would be more in keeping with the discipline than a humanistic one. Metaphysics has been banished, don't you know (not to mention all that soft, soapy stuff...).\n\nKnowing the subject matter, you might take a look at Thomas Phinney's **Hypatia Sans**. Yes, I know there is a humanistic element in Hypatia, but the geometric element might go well with the topic, and I think will work nicely with Gentium.\n\n[http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416011835/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html \"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/landing/hypatia/hypatia.html\")\n\n<cite>Edit:</cite>\n\nAs I remember, there is no bold for Gentium. Depending, you may feel this lack if there are many formal propositions in the text... Not too many proofs use bold, but occasionally it is needed. If the publisher want's to stick to Open Source, Charis may suit the text better -- though I'm not sure it has all the needed logical/mathematical operators. The publisher needs to either inform you of the requirements of the text, or pay you to go through it & discover them. Good luck with it,\n\n"

But as you mention it: Metaphysics has been banished some 90 years ago, and a lot has happened since then :-) This book in fact places itself in the nowadays already thriving metaphysics-revival strand. If there is a kind of impression I would like to avoid, it is the sterility of Carnapian and Quinean anti-metaphysicalism.\n\n"

Nothing like an old, familiar pair of shoes to make you pull out the wallet & buy the book (to mix a metaphor). If you want to \"challenge\" a reader (an oft-heard remark by people who teach design, but do not hire out), write your own damn book. While the reader (buyer & hopefully enjoyer) is usually the most important member of the audience, if something is written by a famous author, or an author the publisher wants more work from, by all means consider their preferences. Finally, remember the title page is for you (as designer), the author, and esp. the author's mother. Have fun, no one else will comment on it...\n\n"

But yes: there is a metaphysics - and I mean real metaphysics, of the Plato-Aristotle-Aquinas style - revival in philosophy ever stronger since the 60's. But back to typography: I have no ambition to \"challenge\" anyone through type; I just want the typography to be good: as good as possible with my limited means. For my profession (I mean the one I am paid for) too is not typesetting but writing philosophy books :-)\n\nI have settled on keeping the Myriad as my sans-serif font; here is a specimen of the result:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416011835im_/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen_3705.png)\n\nThanks everybody for your feedback!\n\n"
