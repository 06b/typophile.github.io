  "content": "Hi there,\n\nThis is my first font ID request, really hoping some of you out there are able to help.\n\nI've found a classic-looking serif font, on the cover of an issue of GQ magazine. It's characterised by very circular serifs and shapely punctuation.\n\nProfuse apologies to more experienced typophiles, I'm relatively new to describing fonts characteristics.\n\nAny help given will be hugely appreciated. Many thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062925im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-16%20at%2023_3685.17.28.png)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Prumo Text \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Birdseeding](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062925/http:/typophile.com/user/88704 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [article-2708999-201429CA00000578-299\\_634x825.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062925/http:/typophile.com/files/article-2708999-201429CA00000578-299_634x825.jpg) | 127.02 KB |\n\n",
