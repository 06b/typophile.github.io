I guess if I ever made the shirt it would be more of an inside joke, only you're the only one in the loop...\n\nAnd showing it to a few people, I've had people say \"go 2 hew\" and \"no prog\". Everyone is reading it quite different, as expected. It's not that big of a deal if it's a lost cause, but any comments on how to improve the legibility, without recycling the celtic style you see in a lot of ambigrams?\n\nThanks for the input, all.\n\n"
