      "content": "Seth,   \nIt happens when you have syntax error in OTF features. It can be virtually everywhere, so it is difficult to guess where it is exactly. But when you try to compile OTF features first, compiling stops on the first line with error and if you know OTF feature syntax, you will easily find it.   \nIn my case it is typically missing semicolon at the end of line.   \n   \nI bet you have tried to open an Adobe OTF in FL. There is a problem with frac feature because Adobe uses chaining contextual substitution (GSUB Type 6) like this:   \nsub [zero zero.taboldstyle]' [slash fraction]' [zero zero.taboldstyle]' [zero zero.taboldstyle]' by [perthousand perthousand];   \nwhich is (according to my knowledge) wrong (or at least it is not implemented in FL4.6).   \nYou can get the same result using GSUB lookup type 4:   \nsub [zero zero.taboldstyle] [slash fraction] [zero zero.taboldstyle] [zero zero.taboldstyle] by perthousand;   \n   \nHope it helps.   \nRegards,   \nPavel\n\n"
