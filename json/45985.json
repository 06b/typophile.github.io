On FontLab Studio’s first Font Info page, in the Style Name field, only four names are allowed: Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic. Obviously, one of your fonts has “Light” there. That’s wrong. You should put the true typographic style names into the OT Style Name field on the second Font Info page. But I thought I actually wrote this on the FontLab forum.  \nA.\n\n"

Since you get the error message even with the bold weight, you seem to have forgotten to check the Bold checkbox in the bold weight. (Whereas it should be unchecked in light, regular and black weight.)  \nThis however would only be true if you intend to link regular with bold, but treat light and black as separate families on the level of Family Name / Style Name. Given your description, I am not sure if you followed the tips & tricks’ _PostScript Type 1_ or the _OpenType_ section.\n\n"

      "content": "Ramiro,\n\ntypically, you make the typographic “Bold” style act as a style-linked bold for the typographic “Regular”. (The style-linked bold is the font which is chosen when the user clicks on a “B” button in an application, or hits Cmd-B / Ctrl-B).\n\nSo you typically have:  \n`OT Family: XXX, OT Style: Regular,\n  Family: XXX, Style: Regular\n  Font is bold: no\nOT Family: XXX, OT Style: Bold,\n  Family: XXX, Style: Bold,\n  Font is bold: YES`\n\nThen for your typographic “Light” and your typographic “Black”, you really have two choices (I’ve italicized the differences):\n\nSolution 1: The Black font is on its own  \n`OT Family: XXX, OT Style: Light,\n  Family: XXX Light, Style: Regular\n  Font is bold: no\nOT Family: XXX, OT Style: Black,\n  Family: XXX Black, Style: Regular\n  Font is bold: no`\n\nSolution 2: The Black font acts as the style-linked bold for the Light font  \n`OT Family: XXX, OT Style: Light,\n  Family: XXX Light, Style: Regular\n  Font is bold: no\nOT Family: XXX, OT Style: Black,\n  Family: XXX Light, Style: Bold,\n  Font is bold: YES`\n\nIt’s really up to you, but I’d say in this case I’d go with solution 1.\n\nHowever, if your family had the typographic styles Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Black, then you might consider making the Black font act as the style-linked bold of the Medium font, and leave the Light without a style-linked bold, or you could make the Medium act as the style-linked bold of the Light font, and leave the Black on its own, or you could make the Light, Medium and Black three independent fonts without any style linking. It’s a design decision, really.\n\nAdam\n\n"
