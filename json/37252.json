  "content": "This is driving me spare. In Typetool 3, I copy my \"A\" into \"Aacute\", edit the glyph, and then have to type lots of numbers into the Metrics window so that PÁTÁVÁWÁYÁOÁGÁC kerns the same as PATAVAWAYAOAGAC does, and hope I haven't forgotten any pairs. I'm not looking forward to doing this too many more times. Is there a way to copy all the kerning-pair information from a character and put it into another?\n\n",

      "content": "It's my understanding that TypeTool 3 will generate OpenType fonts (TT2 doesn't), so I would assume (perhaps foolishly) that it also supports class-based kerning. If it doesn't, however, you can generate a PS Type 1 font, open the .afm file in a simple text editor, make changes there, then import the new metrics back into your .vfb file. Admittedly, it's a pain, but it may be less painful than coming up with the cash to upgrade to FontLab Studio...\n\n"

I haven't acquired VOLT yet; maybe it does class kerning as well as lookup tables?...\n\n"

Once you determine the first value, you can simply tab over and fill it in the same value for the remaining pairs. Or upgrade to FontLab Studio...\n\n"
