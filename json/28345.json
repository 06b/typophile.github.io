(and I say that not because of [NTLAPD...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023223/http:/www.survivinggrady.com/2006/09/willie-stargell-for-national-talk-like.html))\n\nI am working on a book in InDesign CS (which needs to go to the printer today, natch), and FF Bau regular is acting up.\n\nIt keeps substituting individual characters from the expert set, or from another typeface, willy-nilly.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023223im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bau_3_4783.jpg)\n  \nAs you can see, the last two lines are gibberish. \n\nIf I change typefaces, or even weights of Bau, and then switch back to regular, it fixes itself.  \nUntil the next time I open it, of course, when it reverts to its old messed-up self.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023223im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bau_4_6187.jpg)\n  \nNow for some reason the last two lines are ok, but the date after Derrick's name has gone screwy.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nI've trashed my InD preferences, I've cleaned my font caches, I've installed new versions of Bau direct from FontShop (thanks, Ivan!), but nothing seems to work.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nben\n\n",
