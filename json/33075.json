  "content": "It’s my first post here. So... Hello :)\n\nI wonder if somebody knows some books in which the typography goes crazy.  \nFor example. You have a normal written book an all of sudden the linespacing becomes double, triple or even more. You have just one word in a line or the typesize increases from 12pt to 300pt and so on. And maybe as suddenly as the typographic craziness began it disappears again and the book goes on as if it were a totally normal novel.\n\nAny idea?  \nWould be awesome.\n\nCheers  \nVit\n\n [‹ Jared, anything special about today? like maybe a BIRTHDAY, like?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706084522/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33076 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [\"Our Little Secret\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706084522/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32862 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
