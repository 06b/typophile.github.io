It will take place on May 1 to 4, 2003. See our website for the call for papers and other details.   \n   \nwww.ualberta.ca/comspace/   \n   \nThe conference program will include 20-minute presentations and several working sessions, and will be held in conjuction with \"MOVING THROUGH MEANING\" an exhibition exploring the theme of the conference through the production and analysis of design works from professional practice and education.
