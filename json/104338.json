(Jan Huizinga, In the Shadow of Tomorrow, 1936)?\n\nI realize it's hand-lettered, but anything close as a starting place would be a big help - with some attention to the detail/peculiarities, if possible.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818002629im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Huizinga_6479.jpg)\n\n",
