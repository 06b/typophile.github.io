It's gotta be a font. - the full part of this logo has identical letterforms in other words. e's , s's and a's all the same.   \nit's driving me nuts - that no one knows this one - as I'm to do the french version of the nameplate.   \n   \ntoo many display faces out there you know, you'd need a rather big noggin to know them all - but I'm hopeful that the collective brain called typophile will help. pretty please with a cherry on top.\n\n"
