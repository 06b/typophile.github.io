I’m drawing this without much knowledge of calligraphy. I’m using the 45º degree scratch technique to draw and get the relation of the thin strokes with the strong ones.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [j.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013184013/http:/typophile.com/files/j.jpg) | 98.56 KB |\n\n [‹ Search in your favourite language on any website!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013184013/http:/typophile.com/node/47511 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Making Image Smaller/Resampling in Photoshop ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013184013/http:/typophile.com/node/47439 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I am a fan of enthusiasm and do not condemn you for trying, but I think it is imperative, if you wish for this to look very good, to spend more time gaining more knowledge of calligraphy and working with nibs. Why not? You’re bound to enjoy it, and it is the most fundamental step you could take to gain a better understanding of how to do what you’re trying to do.\n\n"

You must understand what’s happening right in front of you (on paper) _and_ you must understand bezier curves, which takes time, before the two will come together and work for you.  \nOn critiquing: You’ve put up a rough for critique. I suggest you self critique until you feel like you’ve arrived at a finished product, and then turn it in for review. Learning to self critique forces you to be more honest with yourself as a designer. Waiting until you’ve concluded the design before seeking the review of your peers ups the risk of damage to your ego considerably, is more rewarding to us, and ultimately is more rewarding to you.\n\n"

When you start breaking entire stems into swashes, or using different styles of serif in a single word, the piece comes apart.

      "content": "I admire your perseverance and sticking power but on looking at your roughs it appears to me that when you draw or sketch your letters you may not be giving enough attention to the white spaces. I have always believed that when working black on white it is the white background within and outside the letters that we really see not the letters. It is an elusion at its best. Light falls on the sheet but it is the light off the white that reflects to the eye. The black (that is, the letters or type) blocks out the white and they are revealed by the white within and around them. If the white shapes are wrong and miss understood then the shape of the letters and the flourishes will be totally wrong.  \nI appreciate that as a left hander, writing with a nib can be both difficult and frustrating for you, but if you want flow and rhythm and understanding in your italics and flourishes then you have no option but to persevere with it. You don’t have to become an excellent calligrapher, but you must have an understanding of the principles, and appreciate how the thick and thin works, otherwise you will be clutching in the dark an will never really solve the problems by just producing sketch after sketch.  \nI hope the following suggestion will help you to some extent.  \nGet the longest board you can manage to place on your lap and place it against a table (If you have a large drawing board at a steep angle, even better). Attach two 2b pencils together with an elastic band and make sure that the point of the left hand pencil is lower than the right hand one. Then try writing or constructing the letters with paper placed as far to your left as you possibly can.  \nThis will help you to hold the pencils at a steeper angle. I know that you will not see the letters as well as you would like, but the shapes you will produce , depending on your skill and how consistent you maintain the angle, might give you some idea of how the thick and thin works. You can experiment with the angle by adjusting the pencils with the elastic band. See what happens by having the left pencil higher and lower. I think you will have some exciting revelations.\n\nIeuan Rees\n\n"

The excess slack I would be pulled into the loop of the “y” (meaning a bigger loop).\n\nYou have a good balance as a whole, in the placement of the top left and bottom right flourishes. With the main issue, I think, of resolving the attachment of the lower-left flourish to that “c”. If you could, lighten the connection a little more, so the form of the “c” is not at all misconstrued for an “s”. You may also want to try VERY delicately attaching it to the upper terminal of the “c”, and have it branch down and around to create the flourish below (and as it did so, the line would become gradually thicker). This could be tricky. The other option of course is using the lower portion of the “l” stem as the parent to that lower flourish, instead of the “c”.\n\n\\*\n\n"

Sorry about the quality but my scanner, printer and workhorse computer are out of commission for another week.\n\nWhat I have seen from the beginning is a disconnect between the tool and your forms (hence my comment way back in the thread). The entry/exit strokes of the i do not match the flourishes. Same with the exit strokes of the T and the h.

(about the “y”)\n\nI think if you wanted that “y” to be more in line with the rest of the characters, you might consider this:\n\nRotating the main body of the “y” (where the arm and stem converge into the “v”-type shape) clockwise about 35-45 degrees, then adjust the arm according to how it would look best.\n\nEven though all your x-heights of your letters may match, both the stem and arm of the “y” are pointing in the direction opposite of the slant of the other characters (these point left, while the main slant points slightly to the right). So this is probably making it appear to be of a smaller size. Also the upper stem of the “y” arching up exaggerates the illusion of the arm being even shorter than what it really is (don’t change the “y” -to- “T” connection you have established though). I think adjusting this “y” so that its’ stem flows with the slant of the other characters will fix this optical illusion.\n\n\\*\n\nWow, this is looking really great!\n\n"
