Another option is a script like Excalibur [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/excalibur-scf/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417083110/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/excalibur-scf/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/excalibur-scf/\") -- pointy in a casual way.  \nIf you don't mind making letters, you could apply a motif like this [http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-56239237/stock-vector-devil-icon.html?sr...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417083110/http:/www.shutterstock.com/pic-56239237/stock-vector-devil-icon.html?src=vVNCXtoJFAkQruigYqN8Dw-1-9 \"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-56239237/stock-vector-devil-icon.html?src=vVNCXtoJFAkQruigYqN8Dw-1-9\") to the initial letter of your logo from an uncomplicated \"friendly\" font of your choice and leave the rest unchanged.  \nDon\n\n"
