In its heyday, it was the primary tool foundries used to digitize their libraries of metal and photo type. Today, [Dutch Type Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070819/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dutch%20Type%20Library) offers [IkarusMaster](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070819/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/english/IkarusMaster.html) as part of their [FontMaster](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070819/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontMaster) suite of tools.\n\nIkarus had many technical strengths, including [Interpolation](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070819/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Interpolation), very high resolution, and a spline primitive edited using on-curve points, unlike the Beziers popular today, which also depend on off-curve control points.\n\n",
