      "content": "Martin:  \nThanks, I will tell the type designer about it so he can adjust kerning better.\n\nAndreas:  \nYes, I know what you mean. But it's just a marketing strategy, this year we decided to live only from type design, so as a new commercial type foundry we have to adapt to the market and what our target is willing to pay. We all know that prices in type design are dropping, but that does not mean that the type designer is winning less money, I think that's the other way around. Now people from more corners of the world are able to buy fonts, due to the lower prices.\n\nAnyway, I guess that when you have a long and outstanding career in type design and are well established, like: Hoefler & Frere-Jones, Peter Bil'ak, Luc(as) de Groot, etc... you are able to sell your fonts at a higher price and people will buy it happily because they appreciate the difference. But I guess we (Tipotype) are far from it right now. I hope someday we can have the proper economic stability to have the right time to create excellent quality typography.\n\nKind regards from Montevideo, Uruguay.\n\n"

      "content": "Fernando,  \nI see the point, of course. And I honestly wish you success with this typeface and others to come. But the problem with such huge discounts is, you somewhat give an impression that you’re not entirely confident in your product’s value for money. There has been much debate about this trend: 60% off, 80%off, 90% off … and then? Then we have distroyed our market and made type being held for crap.  \nInstead of a panic-discounting you could consider to generally price your packages a bit lower, or to bundle special value packages. Make an introductory discount of 20% or 30% and then keep the normal modest rates, so you will be noted as a serious type supplier – this will help you to establish a fruitful customer relations and generate reasonable revenue over a long time.  \n I use this marketing instrument myself, from time to time. If I recall correctly, I did not go beyond 25% so far. Everything else I would feel just bad about, and it actually won’t raise the sales.\n\nDon’t worry, Rufina is a very handsome typeface, it will find its way and reward you.\n\n– Greetings from Leipzig.\n\n"

That right?\n\n"
