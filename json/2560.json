Adam, I'm still waiting for my composite management script.\n\n"

Not really buggy, but unruly, like Director Lingo (although not as complex). You have to get to know it over time.   \n   \nMiguel, if you're considering taking the plunge, there's really one big question: your level of previous programming experience.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It teaches basic concepts of programming and introduces you to Python at the same time.\n\n"

      "content": "I've started using scripting extensively in FL. It's great. I use it for metrics adjustments, adding anchors, auto-generating multiple fonts from a MM FL doc, and countless other tasks (Ever needed to rename a bunch of glyphs? Try python's regular expression module.)   \n   \nHere is a [free online book](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818173621/http:/www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/), also for beginning programmers, that uses python. It's good, even if you've had some experience. Another great resource is the Python web site. They have some pretty simple [tutorials](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818173621/http:/python.org/doc/2.2.3/) that should get you started in python. For the FontLab interface, the [Unofficial FontLab/Python API Reference](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818173621/http:/dev.fontlab.net/flpydoc/navi/main.html%20) is invaluable. Of course, read the archive of the [FL scripting list](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818173621/http:/mail.letterror.com/mailman/listinfo/fontlab-scripting).   \n   \nAt any rate, if you spend any time at all in FontLab, it is definitely worth your while to learn Python scripting. You will be amazed at how often you write two or three lines of code in the edit macro panel. Your own scripts are much more valuable than anything you might find online, as they will fit perfectly into your workflow. You can save hours this way. (You can also waste countless hours trying to figure things out, when it would have been faster to do it manually, but it's always funner to learn. That's the computer programmers motto, 'power through lazyness'. They'll work all day to avoid 10 minutes of tedious work.)\n\n"
