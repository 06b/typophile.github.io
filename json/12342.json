  "content": "Hi typophilers,\n\nThis is a message for the older typophilers. I haven't been around for a while, but I'm back. And as I'm evolving in my life I felt I needed a new screenname. I'm currently rounding up my own website ( [http://www.characters.nl](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017011636/http:/www.characters.nl/ \"http://www.characters.nl\")) so I've decided to change my name into 'Characters', so that it fits to what I'm about right now.\n\nSo in some time Luciddream will be gone and I will be know as Characters. Just that you know who is talking...\n\n®ené\n\n",
