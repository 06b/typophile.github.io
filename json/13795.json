  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nBlack. Not the weight but the colour.  \nWe (my colleagues and I) were discussing what each one of us used as a CMYK value for when printing a solid panel of black (just the colour, no text). A 100% K black lacks depth without percentages of C, M or Y, and as such we each had differing values for the C, M and Y added. Is there an accepted standard?\n\nWith regards to typography, what would be used as the CMYK value for black, when printing white text on black? If CMY values are added, this could cause a fringing effect if misaligned when printing (yes?), so on smaller point sizes would a standard 100% K be recommeded?\n\nCheers for any thoughts!\n\n",

      "content": "In the print shops I have worked in, we often employ a color called \"Rich Black,\" which is 100%K+40%C. It punches up the black considerably without laying too much ink on the paper.\n\nYou can, of course, add equal amounts of C, M and Y to \"balance\" the spectrum, but in no event should the combine percentages exceed 280% (out of a possible 400%), again because excess ink delays drying time and creates offsetting problems (transfer of ink between printed sheets).\n\nWhen reversing out type--especially smaller point sizes--try to keep the complicating factors to a minimum--that is, use Rich Black or another K+one other color combo, and include some spread in the trap so that hairline registration is not necessary.\n\n"

Aldrich-Ruenzel and John Fennell. New York: Watson-Guptill Publications, 1991\n\nI used their techniques as the guidline for printing type specimen books and posters for Agfa and Compugraphic. We took densitometer readings of the black ink (standard CYMK) only after the presses ran for awhile after makeready, and would not sign off until the readings were consistently between 160 -- 180.\n\nWhen you mean \"black colour\" I assume you are interested in producing a certain richness and depth of \"black.\" That could mean several things in the eye of the beholder.\n\nOccasionally we would hit the black with matte varnish for that \"black hole\" look. Conversely we would hit the black with a gloss varnish for the sleek, shinny look.\n\nBut we would NEVER run another color ink on top of the black type for the very reason you mentioned, registration.\n\n---------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!\n\n"

You're probably getting the results you want from it so let the presses RIP. I would be afraid to put white text or logos on top of that. Any misregistration and you're dead. My baseline mix for backgrounds is 30 20 20 100. For text 0 0 0 100. In Photoshop if you look to the left of K in the CMYK sliders, you can see the undercoating color.\n\npeace\n\n"

That's why I was wondering if there was a standard 'given'.\n\nA recent project invlolved a packaging design where the box was to be black and all text (News Gothic) reversed out, some in lime green. It was to be printed in China at minimal cost, and the first sample box came back with a less than impressive black. Someone suggested adding another ink on top, but I pointed out that the registration could be an issue, and something I had never done when type was involved.\n\n"

I gave up trying to read the lyrics to a favorite CD recently, because the \"designer\" set them in ITC Garamond at 7.5 point in yellow, reversed out of rich black. This is one of the most punishing environments for type, and the face you choose has to be able to stand up to it.\n\n"

With reversed type (if not too small) you can trap with the black solid leaving a dot and a half trap before you use other CMY colors. I prefer just 30% red and 30% blue to bulk up the black. As everyone else says, there are many formulae prefered by different printers. You can also double-hit the black but you still need a trap.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
