  "content": "Hello there. I am on the hunt for an essay that W.A. Dwiggins wrote about the way that commercial artists/graphic designers are treated in American society. I read it years ago, but have completely forgotten the name of the piece. Anyone have any idea what it is or where I could find it?  \nThanks!!\n\n",

      "content": "I believe the piece you are looking for is \"A Technique for Dealing with Artists.\" It's a little bit tongue-in-cheek, in a Jonathan Swift sort of way.\n\nThe original article was published in 1941 by the Press of the Woolly Whale. It's since been republished in a number of places. One is the 1947 Typophile Chapbook XVII -- <cite>MSS. by WAD</cite>.\n\nIt looks like it's also included in the more recent <cite>Looking Closer 3: Classic Writings on Graphic Design,</cite> from Allworth Press.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
