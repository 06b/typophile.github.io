  "content": "I need help..  \nI am aware of how to do optical scaling to make different weights using MM based work-flow. But how to make open-type font that would include different masters for different pt sizes. As I want to refine 4tp, 5pt, 6pt, 7pt, etc. I guess it has to do something with wrapping up multiple fonts and some open-type coding, is it so?\n\nSo, some help on this would be highly appreciated.  \nLinks or key words for searching would do too.\n\n",

If this is true, I don’t think it’s a good idea to put all your optical variants into one single file.\n\nA better approach would be to use different fonts named properly, as [Adobe does](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018073712/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond-premier/).\n\n"
