  "content": "This is a typeface I have been working on for a couple of years, and I have not been able to get to a point where I feel it is finished. I think it is the puncuation and non-letter characters that I do not like. It is mostly a display face but I do envision it being used for small blocks of text. I would appreciate any comments.\n\nI am also looking for any ideas on what to name the typeface.\n\n[http://www.typefetish.com/itw/quirkblklttr.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318000012/http:/www.typefetish.com/itw/quirkblklttr.pdf \"http://www.typefetish.com/itw/quirkblklttr.pdf\")\n\nThanks  \nMichael\n\n",
