And I wouldn’t be surprised if Incas had their own swastika as well... Actually, after quick googling:\n\n<cite>“The origin of the swastika symbol is unknown. For thousands of years, it has been used as a symbol of the revolving sun, fire, infinity, or continuing re-creation, as well as a decorative motif in the Americas, China, Egypt, Greece, and Scandinavia.
