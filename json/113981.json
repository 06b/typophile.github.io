I've taken a picture, and you should be able to see it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140405002715/http:/postimg.org/image/j6fhsh8y7/). Please let me know if that picture doesn't work or if there's any other information I could provide. Many help for any assistance you're able to offer.\n\nThanks,  \nArtie\n\n",
