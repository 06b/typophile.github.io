There’s no one answer I’m looking for, just advice from those more versed than I.\n\nI’m designing a site which will @font-face embed Museo for use as body copy.\n\nThe site is used for display of statistics and information, tastefully laid out on a grid. A few tabular structures. Nothing with long runs of body copy, and Museo performs beautifully at the task.\n\nWhat I am seeking is a reccomendation for a display face to be used sparingly in some prominent locations. Some considerations:\n\n\\* Some of these locations are large and numeric, so pretty numerals are important.  \n\\* Obviously, limited to faces which are either widely-installed (separate faces for Win/Mac ok) or legally @font-faceable.\n\nI’ve been having trouble settling on one. Thus far I’ve liked:\n\n\\* Museo Sans—usually only when set in uppercase  \n\\* Helvetica-alikes.  \n\\* League of Movable Type’s (LMT?) [ChunkFive](http://web.archive.org/web/20090818010019/http:/www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk). I like it more for just the numerals.\n\nAny recommendations? What face would you use to set off Museo nicely?\n\nThanks!\n\nIdan\n\n",
