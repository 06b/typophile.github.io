Then someone had to update the ad without the source file, and they had to set and paste in new listings that were supposed to “look the same” while not having the condensed font and/or being ignorant of the difference. There’s also a good likelihood that it was scaled vertically to fill the space.\n\n"

I don’t get it. There’s a family of Univers, Frugiter, and even Helvetica in various weights and sizes, and yet instead of tracking, they have to distort. I don’t understand it either.\n\n"
