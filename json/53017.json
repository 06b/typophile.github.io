  "content": "What's making me the craziest is the fact that I did this on about a dozen fonts last month, and I can't for the life of me recall how to do it again. I need to convert a series of Type 1 fonts to TTF format for use on a companion PC using FontLab 4.6. I thought there was something in the Tools bar, but can't seem to find the right one. I don't own or have a reason to buy TransType, so anyone with some help would be much appreciated. Thank you!\n\n",
