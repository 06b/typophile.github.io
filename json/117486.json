See the third sample up from the bottom of [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701131717/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg4.html) in my Script Font ID Guide. My notes say it is available from severa free download sites.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It was obviously an amateur effort, in my opinion, because the spacing was terrible. That was the reason I had to adjust the tracking to get my sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Except for the A, the font [Butch HMK](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701131717/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hallmark/butch/reqular/?refby=bowfin), a Hallmark font, looks just like \"Riverside\". Interestingly, the design date is given as 2008, but my page for Riverside was made in 2004. Draw your own conclusions. At least the Hallmark version is spaced better.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
