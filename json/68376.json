The only other approximately similar style was [URW Agenda](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033639/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/agenda/), but the contrast is less and the serifs are still too big. Almost anything else I saw that may have had similar serifs was much more monotone in stroke weight (like [URW Bluejack](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415033639/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bluejack/)).\n\nIf I were trying to reproduce this, I think I would try to customize the heavy weight of Agenda by playing with outlines to change the contrast.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
