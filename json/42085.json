This ’S’ seems familiar, but I have dropped so far behind in the new Script font releases that I can’t recall where I saw it.\n\nHave you seen it used anywhere else?\n\nI hope someone recognizes it, or I stumble across it somewhere. (It wasn’t in the Script Font ID Guide places I would have put it, if I had collected it already.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
