  "content": "Garden Design magazine (US) recently redesigned and makes extensive use of this DIN-like sans. Distinctive characters include the g, the sloped legs of the M, high x-height, and the overall squareness.\n\nEarly hunches that didn’t pan out: Flama (Feliciano), CP Company (Fabrizio Schiavi), Metroflex (Garagefonts). And no, it’s not DIN or Conduit. ;)\n\n(Apologies for the images — I don’t have a scanner handy.)\n\nThanks, and happy hunting!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113144439im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/gdn_dsgn1_5783.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113144439im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/gdn_dsgn2_5138.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113144439im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/gdn_dsgn3_5632.jpg)\n\n [‹ NIKE SB logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113144439/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30563 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Jetlag Travel Guides - Trade Gothic Cond {Mike Y} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113144439/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30600 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
