  "content": "Hi all, I expect find you fine in this new year. This is my first entrance of 2015, now releasing my latest type project CAMINITO, a layered font family inspired in Argentinean art craft «Fileteado Porteño». I started this project 2 years ago, taking inspiration from numerous ads, posters and signs installed along the city of Buenos Aires. Now the font family is available at MyFonts.com\n\nFileteado Porteño is a type of artistic drawing, with stylized lines and flowered, climbing plants, typically used in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is used to adorn all kind of beloved objects: signs, taxis, lorries and even the old colectivos, Buenos Aires’s buses. Filetes (the lines in fileteado style) are usually full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical. They have been part of the culture of the Porteños (inhabitants of Buenos Aires) since the beginnings of the 20th century. One of the most highlighted and recognized artists nowadays is Alfredo Genovese, who does a great job of teaching and claim this art and craft. The name Caminito reminds the emblematic and iconic Buenos Aires neighborhood immortalized by Carlos Gardel in music, in the tango.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/vargusjohn/caminito/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317123332/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/vargusjohn/caminito/)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [poster caminito5.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317123332/http:/typophile.com/files/poster%20caminito5.png) | 927.5 KB |\n| [base behance.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317123332/http:/typophile.com/files/base%20behance.png) | 280.12 KB |\n| [base behance1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317123332/http:/typophile.com/files/base%20behance1.png) | 123.95 KB |\n| [poster caminito1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317123332/http:/typophile.com/files/poster%20caminito1.png) | 285.15 KB |\n\n",
