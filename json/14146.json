  "content": "Just getting started on this one.\n\nHoopFX will make basketball gear for backboards. Can’t really say what that will be, but stuff. They want to attract college basketball fans. And people who play basketball.\n\nI’ve tried a few other directions but I like the type on this best. It takes the form of the backboard and translates it into type. At least that is what I was trying to do. HOOP has gone through a couple drafts.\n\nThe FX mark part I am just getting to. I think I need to try a few different renderings before this starts working. I think the bottom of the mark is the tricky part…that will impact how FX reads.\n\nWould love to hear what you all think.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hoopStudy.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215733/http:/typophile.com/files/hoopStudy.gif) | 16.07 KB |\n| [logotypev2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215733/http:/typophile.com/files/logotypev2.gif) | 11.77 KB |\n| [lockup\\_v1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215733/http:/typophile.com/files/lockup_v1.gif) | 5.93 KB |\n| [lockup\\_1.5.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215733/http:/typophile.com/files/lockup_1.5.gif) | 16.45 KB |\n\n",

Maybe try adjusting the tips of the “H” and “P” to be less angular and more like the “O”s.\n\nAlso, the H and P’s tips might be too high considering there location. I might shave a bit off them too see what it looks like.\n\nHow ‘bout setting “FX” onto basketball’s spherical surface? Perhaps rebounding off the “backboard” of one of the “O”s?\n\nGood start.\n\n"
