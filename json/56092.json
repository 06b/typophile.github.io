  "content": "I would love to find a way to generate diacritic glyphs in Fontlab. The issue is that most of my base glyphs (eg. a, n, r, A, N &t.) are constructed from components, which means Fontlab's 'Generate Glyphs...' does not work. Other people must surely have been in this situation before, and I would imagine that one could script ones way out of this. Now the thing is that I can't write scripts, so does anyone know a workaround that does not involve decomposing the components in all the baseglyphs? Or does anyone have a script, or know of one, that would be available to do this?\n\nThanks,  \nClaus\n\n",

      "content": "\"I really have to keep it that way when I take it to Multiple Master.\"  \nI think, if I understand you, and I've been there having made an entire serif old style font from components, if you want to keep the base glyphs as components so you can get their design correct all the way through to multiple styles in a variation technology (MM in this case), then you really do not need to see accented versions yet. I mean, I've never made changes to the base glyphs based on what I saw in accented characters, it's always the other way around. So, short of some helpful script that decomposes and recomposes, maybe there's no problem? :)\n\nCheers!\n\n"
