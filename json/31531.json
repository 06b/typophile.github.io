A sheriff’s badge that is part of the ad and reads “No Gouging Guarantee” has six points, like the Star of David, Tarsy said. </cite>\n\nAll right, image aside (goodness knows it’s pretty bad, and could have been done much better with a little research.), what about the “WANTED” line resembles Judiac calligraphy? And star shaped badges with five, six, and seven points have been popular police bagdes for centuries.\n\nI mean, I can understand the complaint about the photo, especially in the context of this ad, but the further complaints just make it look like Tarsy is just looking for stuff to complain about.\n\n"
