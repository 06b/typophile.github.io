This means that the designer would have based the design on a font style then called Antique -- which we now call Egyptian. To recreate I could perhaps go with a modified Lino Letter Bold compressed to 80% with an adjustment to make the leg on R more vertical. Hope this is of some help.  \nDon\n\n"
