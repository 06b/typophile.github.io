  "content": "so, i'm writing a short article (1000 word) on typography & architecture to be read by a bunch of building archaeologists.   \n   \nany ideas? or essential reading?   \n   \nstill thinking about it, but it will probably summarise/categorise types of lettering found on buildings (mainly but not exclusively on exterior elevations). some categories that spring to mind are: inscriptions, grafitti, directional signage, advertisements etc. have i left any out?   \n   \nit'll be from an archaeological perspective, so, for example, an inscription could be used to date the building in question, either by content (eg a 'datestone') or even style of the lettering   \n   \nhas this has been done before, in a previous article, or is there any point in doing a little piece along these lines?   \n   \ncheers, geraint\n\n",

      "content": "A lot of the Las Vegas signage has a pretty well documented history via a company called Ad Arts in California as well as the YESCO archives may have some insight to the designers of such signs.   \n   \nThere is a sign graveyard in Las Vegas I went to a few years ago and they are planning on building a complete sign museum to house these restored signs. A few Google searches will find you there . . .   \n   \nBeyond that, almost ALL of the Googie signage designs in LA came from the architectual firm of Armet and Davis. A lot of the sign designs came from the orthographic drawings presented to clients by the firm.   \n   \nBeyond that, check out any books from Alan Hess who is an architectual historian as well as getting in touch with the LA ModCom who focus on architectual preservation for more deep scoop and limitless information.   \n   \nBeyond that, check out the Letterheads, Sign Muesum in Cincinnatti, and old copies of sign magazines on eBay.   \n   \nYou may be surprised to learn how much influence 'pre-fab' plastic injection molded lettering had as materials became cheaper and easier to mass produce and were marketed heavily to the sign making trade.   \n   \nHope this offers some direction . . .   \n   \nBest,   \nStuart :D   \n   \nPS: I just re-read your initial post and would also suggest you take a perspective on how the lettering was integrated into the building vs. just slapped on the front. Armet and Davis used different shaped pylons to compliment the lettering.\n\n"

      "content": "You might consider artefacts left or trapped in a building.   \n   \nBooks, of course. In a kitchen or storehouse, packaging. Many larger buildings had stables, workshops, laundries and bakeries, and kitchens that contained chemicals used for making medicine and cleaning. So look for lettering printed on containers like flour sacks, canisters and bottles. An old wine cellar with a few bottles of 18th century Chateau Rothschild would be a nice find for an archaeologist. I wonder what the label would look like.   \n   \nI have discovered old cardboard boxes (printed) used as insulation.   \n   \nAlso, various artefacts (some left by construction workers) in walls and under floors, such as newspapers, cigarette tins, cans, and bottles. Tins for commercial products (especially tobacco) are often reused for storage of small items in workshops. Usually in the basement/cellar.   \n   \nElectrical, gas, heating, plumbing and sanitary equipment may have the maker's ID on it.\n\n"

It has been broken down, presumably to fit its new location. I don't have a transcription to hand, but the inscription marked the graves of Sacer, a Roman from Gaul, his wife Cassouna and their son Quintus.   \n   \nIt was reused in this C11 building, with an added inscription to Ertig, who donated money for the building of the church. The translation reads 'Eirtig had me built and endowed to the glory of Christ and St Mary'.   \n   \nSignificantly, rather than obliterate the Roman inscription, or use the back of the tombstone, the Anglo-Saxon one has been carved in the apex of the tombstone.   \n   \nmore images can be seen here:   \n [http://rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1cdroms/england/lincoln/churches/s\\_mary\\_le\\_wigford/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825160700/http:/rubens.anu.edu.au/raid1cdroms/england/lincoln/churches/s_mary_le_wigford/)\n\n"
