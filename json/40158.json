If you like san serif I would go for Kris Sowersby’s National [http://www.klim.co.nz/national\\_samples.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008042235/http:/www.klim.co.nz/national_samples.php) . Its very cool and has a lot of character. I chose to use Gotham from Hoefler and Frere-Jones which I like a lot also I believe my main man Sagmeister uses Gotham for his personal site.\n\n"

This is a ”Wow”\n\nBut I am still open to other suggestions. Anybody.\n\n"
