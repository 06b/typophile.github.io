  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nas a type amateur and enthusiast, I've always been very interested in the history of type. Recently, after a lot of browsing on this site, I found numerous references to a certain 'Vox ATypI' classification of typefaces, and that sparked my interest. After a long search on the internet all I could find were pages in French regarding this classification, and my French isn't quite up to par, so I wasn't able to read those pages.\n\nMy question to you is if anyone knows a site in English (or Dutch) that explains the Vox ATypI classification, or can someone maybe post a short summary in English about the classification?\n\nThank you kindly,\n\nWouter Spaak  \nNijmegen, The Netherlands\n\n",

The last time I used an online translater was years ago in the days of Altavista Babelfish, and that was usually rubbish.\n\nThank you Miss Tiffany for the French Wikipedia entry, with a big dictionary and some imagination it proved very useful as well.\n\n"
