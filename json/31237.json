For example will you be using Frutiger for German and Lexicon for English (_vice versa_) or a mix of both fonts for both languages?\n\nI ask because I’m wondering whether you are looking for a gothic _or_ traditional script style Japanese font.\n\n"

The whole thing should have a contemporary feel.\n\n"

      "content": "\"Does anyone have any suggestions which Japanese fonts could go with these two typefaces?\"\n\nIn Japan at least, when the question goes the other way around: \"What Latin face goes best with Ishi Mincho or Shaken Gothic?\", it is usually answered but Frutiger or Univers for their great ability to offer specific weights and widths to appear smoothly alongside the Japanese as that is used at different sizes. That's high end stuff, but the fundamental point is: if you plan on having good looking mixed scripts, choose the Kanji first, and then a Latin with the proper style set to \"match\" at the Kanji's different sizes. These days, with single-mastered Kanji for all sizes, I think that it goes double.\n\n"
