They, [Rodolpho] really care what they put on their website.\n\nI use to believe that if someone is selling a font commercially - then there should be no rip-offs of it. However, learning that some of these fonts were designed in the 1800s or early 1900s - and in some cases the FREE font was the first digitized version out there - then, by all means - it belongs out there for the public to use.\n\nLinotype, Berthold, Alphatype, Mergenthaler, Compugraphic, etc. got enough of our money to keep them in business. The advance of computers for all - did them in. They were so busy selling our customers -- ah, new money - new greed... they forgot about the typesetters that kept them going for 100+ years.\n\nThe example that comes to mind immediately (because it was recently on WTF) is Lainie Day digitized 1993 and was for FREE. Lady Dawn and a Mr. Lackboroughs showed up in 2004 for PROFIT - designed by Charles P. Bluemlein prior to 1943 (Thank you Mike F.). Yes, Soft Horizon was known for cloning... and Sudtipos seems to have digitized most of Bluemlein's fonts -- but this is a case of the chicken or the egg folks.\n\nThere are so many out there - that were designed before copyrights came into effect or family estates demanded rights.\n\nI am sorry dafont no longer has a board to communicate with. The majority of their moderators were extremely knowledgeable -- and most were type designers themselves.\n\nYes, there are a lot of sites out there that are giving blatant not only rip-offs - but original commercial fonts for the taking... You may stand on your Sunday soap box at Hyde Park and complain about them.\n\nBut before you speak up about Dafont -- I suggest you get to know them a bit better.\n\nOh, and mas bien sur -- practice up on your French!\n\nAnd P.S. Before you go on about how great commercial fonts are - stop for a moment. I own most of OPTIFonts fonts - and they are out-and-out LOUSY. All commerical, all paid for. Hey, any of you have the original Adobe library, like I do? I still have the MAC disks - where Adobe sent me their \"REVISIONS\" on a regular basis... shall we go on... and on... and on...\n\nAnd to Russell - many type designers throughout the world have donated to that site. Every designer is listed -- including their website when available. Each font that is submitted is welcomed to be submitted with a \"READ ME\" - not all the fonts there are free - many shareware/charityware even some drinkware...\n\n"

EULA issues are still pretty new, and the courts have yet to do a good job sorting out whether or not a EULA is actually a binding contract, and if so, what sort of penalties one faces for violating the terms. It also doesn't help that a font EULA creates interesting question where precedent is involved, because a font may or may not be considered a program, which could have a big impact on what other cases affect it. Worse still, judges generally don't know or care much about computers, so there's a pretty good chance that nobody would ever get a sane ruling out of a EULA-related case anyway.\n\n"

When fonts were first being digitized for personal computers and Macs -- they came with very lengthy Agreement statements. Bitstream did not allow you to do any manipulation -- just bringing one of their fonts into Illustrator to outline, fatten, bend, etc. was just illegal to do. Adobe on the other hand were encouraging designers to do just that - but they owned Illustrator - made perfect sense. And neither \"foundry\" would allow you to collect your fonts to hand over to a printer to have your job come out looking just like you wanted it.\n\nAs a typographer at that time - I ended up having to purchase many different foundry fonts - just so I could run them on the imagesetter. Bitstream fonts were always wider - and would not allow a substitution of another manufacturer's font. Linographics, Compugraphic (later Agfa-Compugraphic), and the other old typesetters -- all had very similar weights -- and Adobe could be substituted...sometimes.\n\nMeanwhile, I remember when I purchased the URW library. (Talk about much better drawings for fonts, they even tackled some of the old problems from cold type that were found in the ITC font drawings.) URW understood that a designer work should remain in tack. They were the first to allow the designer to include their font to a printer to print the job.\n\nI think I'm rambling on at this point. What I think I'm trying to point out is -- many of the rules were made by the manufacturers. Sure, they have matured, but still - they are not all the same.\n\n"

Fonts were tied to specific brands of equipment. The formats were proprietary and incompatible. The competition back then was between machines, not fonts. Manufacturers copied the most popular fonts from other equipment to focus customers' attention on the features and benefits of their machine. Fonts definitely played a part in the marketing of equipment, but were not usually a deal-breaker as long as comparable fonts were available.\n\nToday, practically speaking, there is only one kind of typesetting machine: a personal computer and an output device. Also, for practical purposes, there is only one kind of font: the kind you can use on personal computers. True, there are different formats (PostScript, TrueType, OpenType), but you can use them all at the same time on the same machine.\n\nClaro did not compete directly with Helvetica in the old days.

      "content": "Hi Mark,\n\nOne thing about Alphatype - I guess you didn't catch it in my other note - when they were bought out by Berthold - and for the last few years of their existence - Alphatype shops had the real, true Helvetica -- and it was beautiful. Claro was our Helvetica up to that point, but the letters never quite fit, no matter how much time and attention we spent on kerning - it was actually a flaw in the drawings of each letter. For an Alphatype shop pre-Berthold -- Claro was Helvetica -- and our customers accepted it as Helvetica, just as they accepted Eurogothic for Eurostile, Musica for Optima... etc., etc., etc. And for every type shop with different manufacturer's equipment -- their versions of these beloved fonts were in direct competition with each other -- how -- because our customers depended on us giving them the \"real\" thing...and yes, our typesetting competitors would try to let all our customers know -- they had the real thing...\n\nI don't know if you realize it, but there are still countries \"setting type\" with our old equipment -- and there is still a fully functional hot metal typesetter in New York. They are still producing and for them it is most affordable (and productive). True, no where the amount of shops that we saw in the '70s and '80s (I understand Boro recently gave up their Alphatype equipment - the last in NY City) but in third world countries and small pockets of poor areas you'll find them...\n\n"

I have typefaces for sale, and have one on dafont as well. And as far as I'm concerned, sitting around and expecting dafont or any other free-fonts site to be the guardians of anyone's intellectual property is akin to feeling like you should be able to have a 24/7 bodyguard for free. Preventing piracy is first and foremost the responsibility of the designer wanting to prevent being pirated. There are some steps that can be taken - for example, learning how to produce attractive pdf specimens that are invulnerable to extraction - but to expect others to be your own personal police force rings of elitism.\n\n"

      "content": "Fascinating. This thread is amazing. I have really enjoyed reading this history.\n\n@Curioustype\n\nI disagree with your choice of the word \"piracy\", since that word has lately been used largely to target personal uses of legally purchased copyright material, but the context implies your primary concern is protecting your work against commercial copyright infringement, which can be more clearly referred to as \"bootlegging.\" That said, I agree that the responsibility lies with the rights holder, rather than with dafont, which serves a valuable service to both designers and the public.\n\nYou should understand that pdfs are not anywhere close to being \"invulnerable to extraction.\" If a bootlegger wants to bootleg it, there is nothing you can do other than go after them once they've bootlegged it. If they want to, they will.\n\n(Adobe pdf software is in fact constantly subject to both spyware and malware attacks, so can actually prove to make your computer insecure.)\n\n"
