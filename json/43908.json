For instance before I couldn’t see “craigslist” and apparently there was another “times” that wasn’t times at all so I deleted it and viola!\n\nI can’t fix this other font however, it just shows a lot of fractions.\n\nCan anyone help me out?

The best way to solve the problem, without having to hunt down the offending font and delete it, is to clean your font caches. Font Finagler will do it 10 times for you before you have to pay for it and FontExplorerX will do it for you completely for free.\n\nAny time you have a weird font problem—when this problem happens usually the text is completely illegible; like opening up a data file in a text editor—the first thing to try is cleaning your caches.\n\n"
