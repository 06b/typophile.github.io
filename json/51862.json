  "content": "Hi\n\nFirst I want to say I rarely post here but I read the forum a lot, It's incredible how helpful you guys are! I have learned a lot about type here, and whenever I have a question I make a search and usually find my answer.\n\nWhen I pair fonts, I usually go with my instincts, and the forum confirmed my method. I followed some advices from here to select fonts to pair with [Amasis](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020200928/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=amasis&x=0&y=0). It's for a data visualisation company. We will be building wireframes and all work documents with those fonts. The sans serif needs to be neutral, have many weights options and be eligible in small size.\n\nThis is what was worth testing so far:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020200928im_/http:/typophile.com/files/testpetit_5823.jpg)\n\nDo you have other fonts to suggest? What do you think of my picks?\n\nThanks a lot\n\n",
