I am working on my very first font (don't really know what I am doing so all the help you can give me would be appreciated). I have included a gif of what I have so far... which is just upper and lower case. This font will be used as a captioning font on a television.. which is very low resolution. Any suggestions would be great. ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414142315im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12829.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Jason,   \nI think the basic shapes you drew are clear & open, which should work well on screen. There are some strange things in the contrast though; The 'I' is thinner than most other uprights for instance. Within letters like 'w' and 'S' some fluctuations in thickness appear. Moreover the horizontals are heavier than the uprights (or is that on purpose?). It is hard to tell from this example how this will work on tv. Try looking at it in white on a moving and colorfull background then see what happens.   \nBest,   \nDiederik\n\n"
