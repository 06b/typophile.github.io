  "content": "Hi folks, new to the forum, but consider myself a neophyte type snob (that is, still a beginner, but I am a type nut nonetheless).  \nI am a student, and purchased the Adobe Font Folio (academic), so I already own such faces as Helvetica, Avenir, Univers, Futura, etc etc,plus the faces that come with OS X and Adobe CS4.\n\nWhat I lack is a really complete slab-serif family of fonts. I am thinking that purchasing a good slab-serif font would be a really useful addition to my library, so I am currently considering Jos’ Museo Slab family or H&FJ’s Archer. I see Archer everywhere, however, and I don’t want to invest in a library that could soon be ubiquitous/overused (if it isn’t already...)\n\nOther faces I’m considering: Gotham, Verlag, some nice brush scripts like Alpine Script... maybe a combination of fonts. However, I can only afford spending up to $300 on fonts. I see the merit in getting one high-quality family (or at least a subset of a family) and learning how to use it really well.\n\nI’d really appreciate your feedback!\n\n",

For a happy sans you can’t do better than Museo, and a friendly one, Archer. [PMN Caecilia](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103033414/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/pmn-caecilia/) is a humanist slab, very nice for some clean looking text. The heavy condensed weights of [Dispatch](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103033414/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Dispatch) look great in headlines, for which they were designed. [Soho](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103033414/http:/www.seblester.co.uk/type_lettering.php?CategoryId=7)’s heavy weights are pretty, and somehow say ’magazine’ more to me.

In terms of pure subjective taste, I prefer slabs that are more geometric, with very little contrast between thick/thin strokes, which Museo and Archer seem to fit quite well. I stumbled across House Industries’ Neutraface Slab last night, and am really considering that or Neutraface No 2.\n\nI like The Serif from LucasFonts, but it feels awfully similar to Chaparral to me, which I own, and I’m looking for building up as much diversity in my font library as possible. On my sticky note of serious considerations, I now have the following: Archer, Museo Slab, Neutraface Slab, Neutraface 2, and Gotham.\n\nI’m delighted to see you frequent these forums, Jos! I feel like I’ve stumbled upon a goldmine of knowledge and expertise. I myself am designing a geometric slab-serif... which may not turn out to be any good, but I am learning a ton in the process.

Because Museo Slab 500 and 500 italic are already free you might want to opt for Archer or something else. That way you have more material to reference to :)\n\n"
