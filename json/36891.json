Still, it may feel a little bit uninspired and clumsy. Alternatives? I like [Excelsior](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170911/http:/www.linotype.com/387/excelsior-family.html) a lot. Quite robust newspaper face, actually. And have a look what [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170911/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/georgia/morelikethis.html) suggests … there are some fresh beauties among them.\n\n"
