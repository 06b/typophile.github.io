      "content": "Miles, you’re right: we would need to consider awards and judges at the beginning. For both of those, it might be best to look outside of Typophile… maybe there could be “sponsors” that could come up with prizes. I don’t think that Typophile has a budget that would allow for it to pay for prizes on its own.\n\nAlso, judging is a big issue in its own right. Judges “make” a competition, don’t they? Either we could try to get “objective” judges from outside of typophile to do the judging (but who?), or we could arrange some sort of voting thing. I don’t like the idea of elevating a few people from within the Typophile community to ’judge’ status. But I also wonder if enough different kinds of people would vote if we had a voting system.\n\n"

      "content": "I think a Typophile type competition is a bad idea.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Typophile is its democatic voice. The most experienced and accomplished and the novice can post alike, and are treated with pretty much the same kindness and cruelty.\n\nThis egalitarean voice has its drawbacks, but pretty much nowhere else is so open and equal. The market place of course is very competitive and always sorting out winners and losers, as well as competitions, so there is plenty of this in the world.\n\nIt is good that Typophile is a place of some respite from this. I don’t have a problem with Typophile being used by another sponsor to get democratic judging, but Typophile as a sponsor for judging critiqued faces it seems to me would put more pressure on those who submit for critiques.\n\n"

Good prizes could from software(adobe, fontlab), a book with the contest´s submissions per year, contracts with big foundries, typophile membership extras, money, etc.\n\n"
