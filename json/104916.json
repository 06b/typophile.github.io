Can people kindly critique the brand mark which will be reproduced foil block on an uncoated stock. In particular I'm having issue with centering the text and the kerning.\n\nThanks  \nDarren\n\n",

I believe that is the standard.\n\n"

A matte foil might help but I'm not sure it'll create the effect you're after.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720014902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/foil2_3660.jpg)\n\nBut even if the contrast is sufficient, I still like the white version better.\n\n"
