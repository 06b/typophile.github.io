Maybe you could use the bold version of Avenier (I think that is the font used for “bee”) or use the same font for both “two” and “bee” and just make the “two” a bold/heavy/black version.\n\nJust my opinion, though, the illustration was very nice.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments. My friend is working on incorporating another bee into the logo. We went with the outline on the “bee” because the plain yellow didn’t show up that well when printed on white media. Can you suggest another way to do the “bee” without the outline so that it will show up?\n\nI really like Avenier. I also like to mix and match fonts some. What would your recommend to go with?\n\nThanks again. Since this is a small side project with a very small budget, all your opinions help so much.\n\n"
