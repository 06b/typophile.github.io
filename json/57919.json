Me and my friend are looking for this font but we don't know what's it called. Could anybody help? There are many similars so it's sort of trapper. It would be great to hear if anyone has the smallest clue. Thanks a lot!\n\nx\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [colorandshape.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110213/http:/typophile.com/files/colorandshape.jpg) | 56.48 KB |\n\n",
