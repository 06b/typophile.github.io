I would like to improve the readablility of the content in the sites my company designs while at the same time keeping the content searchable. I know that Emigre was one of the first foundries to create bitmap fonts for screen use but are there newer designs/foundries that you could reccomend?  \nI like the text font that is used in the Typophile forums.\n\nThank you.\n\n",
