  "content": "I'm currently following an online course, which, as one of the first tenets, has placed exceptional emphasis on tracing/copying various typefaces to learn 'by heart', so that eventually one can transcend the exisitng and then create something original to oneself.  \nThere is little more information.  \nThis is going to take me an age. Am I meant to continue until each character of each typeface is absolutely precise? How many should I learn? Do I do nothing else except this for years? And continue with each new one I want to use?  \nI must admit that I'm not a little disheartened with the approach. Don't get me wrong, I'm a 'precision' freak and really enjoying the process but can't help be aware of the time limitation this is imposing on my actual creativity.  \nPLEASE can someone help with advice before I just give up???\n\n",
