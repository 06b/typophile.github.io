  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm brand new to the forums, please excuse any posting errors until I learn the ropes.\n\nUsing Fontlab Studio 5 in OSX 10.4.11 I have made a OpenType font to be used in phonetic English lessons.  \nThe font I have made has quite a few 'multiple character' glyphs - for example the English word \"ARE\" appears as a single glyph with a carat above the three to signify that it is a single character. The above character is comprised of the three letters \"A R E\".  \nHave I violated some fontmaking law by having three characters grouped like this ?\n\nMy problem is that this \"ARE\" character is being cut off on its right side after printing. Two other 'multiple character\" glyphs of similar width suffer the same effect.  \nI am 'fairly' competent with FontLab Studio, I have manually set the right margin for this glyph so that the width is around 1500.\n\nI cannot find any entry for width in the \"Font Info\" in regard to Open Type fonts.\n\nThe DTP program I am using is PageStream for OSX Beta 18 which seems to be sensitive to Open Type fonts yet it does display and print 60 of the 75 characters I have created in this font.  \nI have about 2,000 lessons I created in OS9 Pagestream to print and am only being held up by this 'cutting off' printing problem\n\nAny advice, suggestions welcome.\n\n",
