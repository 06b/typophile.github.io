  "content": "I'm a student and was wondering about a particular font and whether or not it can be used in a logo design or a poster for a school assignment. Or can this font be used for an actual logo design? I'd just like to know what sort of licensing it has.\n\nThere was a font used for the Venice Biennale 2012 by John Morgan Studio. I've e-mailed directly to his studio about licensing and what not and so far received no response. (Most likely very busy, no time to address a student)\n\nSo I thought I would ask here. This bespoke typeface was created specifically for this event. Some of the characters are available in png image format online. I've tried to find fonts remotely close to this typeface but none compare. I am more than willing to invest in a as good a typeface as the one he created. But of course, without wondering why, it's definitely not sold online.\n\nUltimately I'd like to know, if I redrew 7 letters to use in a poster design or logo design would I be breaking copyright laws?\n\n(Please forgive the fact that I am a neophyte in these matters and have patience explaining! That'd be awesome!)\n\n",

This practice is done by most of today's type designers when designing a font which looks very similar to another.\n\n"
