  "content": "Been seeing this around a lot for the last little bit, and while everyone I talk to recognizes the trend, no one I've spoken to has any idea what to call it, and therefore searching for examples has been difficult. I'm hoping to get some guidance if there is actually a name for it — I'm not looking for snarky barbs in terms of appraisal of this trend.\n\nI've attached some images, but overall I'd describe it as being a design approach with priority on type, characterized by unconventional grids, typically monochromatic or duotoned color selection, minimal use of photos/illustrations, frequent use of minimal geometric graphics, and frequently executed with fonts by The Entente, but also with Futura, Times. Ideologically it seems to be taking a naïve posture — and while there is a superficial lo-fi-ness to it, it's still pretty systematized/polished.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [CAB09.Cover\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/CAB09.Cover_01.jpg) | 239.48 KB |\n| [CAB09.Spread\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/CAB09.Spread_01.jpg) | 233.63 KB |\n| [0064\\_\\_Jai-Tanju-in-Dank-no4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/0064__Jai-Tanju-in-Dank-no4.jpg) | 583.7 KB |\n| [0067\\_\\_Raphael-Zarka-in-Dank-no4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/0067__Raphael-Zarka-in-Dank-no4.jpg) | 606.16 KB |\n| [photo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_1.png) | 1.13 MB |\n| [Screen Shot 2013-03-06 at 12.20.09 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-03-06%20at%2012.20.09%20PM.png) | 106.6 KB |\n| [lottanieminen\\_GD\\_arttu-01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/lottanieminen_GD_arttu-01.jpg) | 176.29 KB |\n| [lottanieminen\\_GD\\_arttu-04.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/lottanieminen_GD_arttu-04.jpg) | 200.52 KB |\n| [lottanieminen\\_GD\\_arttu-05.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/typophile.com/files/lottanieminen_GD_arttu-05.jpg) | 203.62 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "This is my first exposure to this style _per se_. My first reaction is that it embodies many of the principles of Bauhaus/Swiss/modernist design:\n\n\\* Typography as the principal visual element  \n\\* Preference for simple sans-serif types, minimal use of large type sizes, and use of a single font throughout.  \n\\* Grid as the definer of the space.  \n\\* White (or flat color) space as an important compositional element.  \n\\* Avoidance of decorative elements other than simple geometric shapes.  \n\\* Emphasizing the two-dimensionality of the page space.\n\nI see some influence of the backlash against modernism that cropped up in the 1980s (a style I used to call sub-modernism):\n\n\\* Offbeat use of color.  \n\\* Non-traditional use of letterspacing.  \n\\* Intentional violations of the grid.\n\nYour examples are different from mid-20th-Century modernism in that they have more sense of style, and even a hint of playfulness.\n\nThe modernist aesthetic was partly a matter of acknowledging, and even celebrating, the industrial processes that produced office buildings and books. Type on a grid with little color or decoration was optimal for letterpress printing. The examples here are riffing on that look, but they also have some fun with the freedom that digital production gives them to superimpose type on photos, etc.\n\nIf I had to name it, I'd pick something like Digital Modernism. Or maybe I'd refer to the Bauhaus influence, and call it Adobe-haus.\n\n"

Years ago I was in a large print shop when a job came in with type overlaying photos and color blocks in complex ways, and I overheard an employee say \"this job is a stripper's nightmare!\" (\"Stripper\" being the guy who prepared the printing films.)

Competitions like that were a breading ground for graphic layout of quick fun in quick time. And as things evolved a fresh design software graphic signature/style began to emerge ...seen in band fliers and on underground zines etc..\n\nWhat I find refreshing is a Mix Don't Match approach to communicating a visual message, that and the fresh approach dealing with the surface of the page itself. The good stuff has completely shrugged off the shackles of page boarder slavery ... and instead has layouts which deal in visual depth (ranging richness to thinness) without the use of traditional point perspective(s). But unfortunately the bad stuff is seen around more often partly because it is readily understood/copied I guess.\n\nBut the overall rule is the same for all eras of graphic design ... that being one of a hierarchy of visual communication. So in that regard, the song remains the same.\n\nn.\n\n"

But as I mentioned, not knowing what to call something makes it difficult to search for, and also to aggregate examples —&nbsp;so I'm left with what I've happened to bookmark that I recognize as being part of a larger trend.\n\nIf on the other hand, you mean that you are not seeing this trend in the wild, or more broadly, that you are simply not familiar with it, that is less a dismissal of the trend and more a dismissal from a meaningful place in _this_ conversation, where I am explicitly looking for input from people who _are_ familiar with it.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nBack to the conversation at hand — and I'm definitely getting to a \"why bother\" place here, but just in case anyone was _actually_ interested — I finally got my hands on Computer Arts' Typography Collection last night, and they've got some interesting notes on these microtrends in their trend report from FranklinTill. I thought I'd share some excerpts here from their appraisals, here:\n\n**Microtrend: House of Fun**  \n\"Bold statements have been given a witty, light-hearted twist... bad taste is being celebrated by designers who utilise free fonts, clip art and Letraset transfers.\"\n\n\"Design collective Zweizehn's... tongue in cheek approach gently mocks the showy celebrity world, whilst still trying to be a part of it. 'Trashy' renderings and comic typography push the posters in a fun direction so they stand out from more obvious party flyers.\"\n\n**Microtrend: Soft Modernity**  \n\"[Last year] We tracked a theme through many of the design sectors the explored notions of simplicity and clarity. In a bid to stand out amidst the visual noise that surrounds us on a daily basis, an increasingly sober approach is being applied.... We have seen a return to minimalism... utilising unfettered sans-serif fonts and limited colour palettes. Over the last year, this minimalist and monochrome direction has softened to become slightly less sober and more feminine, whilst still retaining a bold and clean aesthetic. Fonts such as Aperçu... have gained much pupularity... Klim Type Foundry's Calibre has also been widely adopted.\"\n\n\"Using sans-serif typefaces in modular graphic grids, together with solid pastel tones create a new form of modernity\"\n\n**Microtrend: Gothic Revival**  \n\"Elsewhere, designers continue to update historical forms to make them feel newer and fresher. Lydian MT, the traditional gothic font designed by Warren Chappell in 1938, is a source of inspriation for many designers.\" Erik Johsson's font based t-shirt for the Violent Elegance series uses lydian bold, framed within a geometric grid.\n\n**Macrotrend: The Real Thing**  \nAfter these reports on these microtrends, they segue into a macrotrend they're calling _The Real Thing_, which they characterize as being defined by: Tradition Revived, The Magic of Making, Linking Past to Present, and Traditions Reborn. Here are some salient points,\n\n\"We have seen not only a return to traditional visual design references, but also the celebration of the craftspeople and producers themselves.\"\n\n\"...We explored how transparency in the production process was being used to communicate to consumers how products are made. The consumer's desire to learn how things are made shows no sign of waning, whilst also being a tool for brands to communicate the rich stories behind their products.\"\n\n\"Preservation of our cultural typographic surroundings is a major factor for those wanting to connect us to our past as well as future, but also to connect a community to its history.\"\n\n\"Traditional typography techniques are seeing a revival. Methods such as letterpressing are being combined with modern aesthetic interpretations. _Das Mainzer Grotesk Experiment_ by design collective Zweizehn celebrated the experimental use of the letterpress rather than simply focusing on its retro charm. Zweizehn created and cast its own letterpress type and invited up-an-coming typographers Marcel Häusler, Alexander Lis, Daniel Weberruß and Malte Weinmann to create posters in response to the question 'More than Retro?'\"\n\nI think it's interesting to frame these layout patterns as a part of this \"Real Thing\" trend, and I definitely think there's a confirmation in what's been previously mentioned in this thread around the ideas of levity, reaction against corporate mass-production and its attendant polished styles, and a pivot on classic design clichés. Here's some more examples from groups that they call out in the collection:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839im_/http:/typophile.com/files/collection1_3559.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839im_/http:/typophile.com/files/collection2_6431.jpg)\n\nSee also:  \n [www.aronfilkey.com](http://web.archive.org/)  \n [www.les-graphiquants.fr](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/www.les-graphiquants.fr/)  \n [blog.zweizehn.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/blog.zweizehn.com/)  \n [Das Mainzer Grotesk Experiment](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/blog.zweizehn.com/post/14818103335/das-mainzer-grotesk-experiment)  \n [Davis Ngarupe](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/www.davisngarupe.com/)  \n [KUNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/k-u-n-g.com/)  \n [YACHT](http://web.archive.org/web/20140721195839/http:/teamyacht.com/)\n\n"

I feel like graphic design as a function in society is becoming more and more recognized (departing the »Oh, thats actually a job?«-sphere). Living and working in Berlin, it's ubiquitous — both this ›anti-design‹ and the awareness. I like the pastiches within pastiches, because I like the inherent post-modern idea to take existing codes and rearranging/intertwining them. It can be very exciting, and there can be great results from people approaching a design with less inhibition concerning rules and proper usage. I kind of see it as graphic designs’ equivalent to Jaimie Warrens’ photography in a way if that makes sense...\n\nAs a job, graphic design is a craft to me. Me and some colleagues refer to this style as ›hortig‹, meaning HORT, a Berlin-based agency that constantly rides the edge of ugliness and genius or just pleasing. And I have done that myself I guess. But this ›anti-design‹ can also be nothing more than just a quick fix. If applied properly though, with context and function or the deliberate disregard for both, I would definitely consider it a style that is itself composed of anachronistic elements. Movement might be a bit much though.\n\nAnyways, my two cents. Exciting.\n\n"

I love a good back and forth in a discussion, and I am thrilled to interact with people who are fundamentally at odds with me in terms of taste, preference, and style. You are absolutely right: these people are often your best teachers.\n\nBut when your first response to a specific question in a forum is \"What's worse acting dumb or being dumb?\" it amounts to little more than interrupting and pulling focus. Where exactly is the conversation supposed to go after that?\n\nSo yes, let's have a discussion about what defines this trend, let's identify what qualities these pieces share, let's talk about what is at the core of the movement (which, hey, maybe \"acting dumb\" _is_ a quality at its core) —&nbsp;but let's not derail things right off the bat with flippant remarks about ebola, whether being intelligent is cool, or what have you.\n\nAm I crazy here?\n\nIf this was a real life discussion, and I'd laid out a bunch of work from various people, and said \"I'm trying to classify these pieces, is there a name out there for this style and I just don't know it? Or is this something new? These are what I could find, but these are some qualities I'm talking about...\" and you strolled over after the discussion had begun with an arch \"What's worse acting dumb or being dumb?\" How exactly do you think that would be received?\n\nIs or is it _not_ a dick move to sit through this conversation of your own free will and then interject \"This is boring! I'm amazed you people actually care about this!\"\n\nIs or is it _not_ a dick move to walk into a room where people are talking about trends and drop an icy \"I think all people who follow trends are abdicating their individual responsibility and refuse to think for themselves\"?\n\nAre these the actions of people trying to have a conversation, or trying to put the brakes on the conversation? Do the rest of us get to just jump back in to what we were talking about, or do we have to actually stop and address and acknowledge what in any other situation would be patently rude behavior?\n\n"

It might be because -unlike you- most people who are fans of this style are not interested in thinking/communicating, but simply doing. Which to me is boring. In fact the _last_ thing I want to do is prevent discussion.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I don't think ›anti-design‹ is necessarily dismissive, just as anti-establishment isn't.\n\nAnd personally I think the application of these styles are poor when implemented without context or cause. It can be quite a quick fix, create a duplex-image and a 4-by-6-grid using Century Gothic with 120%-glyph-height and there you go. If the content of the design on the other hand transcends historical/political/etc classifications, ›anti-design‹ can be a fine choice — but regarding work ethic, I think it has to be a deliberate choice (even when playful – at least in hindsight) or it's just insulting pretty much.\n\n"

One says \"First National Bank\" and is made of steel and marble. The other one is outside a farmhouse and says \"Fresh Eggs\" and is made from a piece of cardboard. It's hard to image 2 signs that are more different, but each is appropriate for its purpose and setting.\n\n\\> What we might call anti-design is mostly just getting  \n\\> attention by subverting the audience's expectations\n\nYes, I think that's a big factor.
