I think I’ll look into Miller or Sabon Next for the main text serif font.\n\nNow I’m persuading them to pick a new sans serif. Must work as a headline, subhead and sidebar text. Large family a plus. Any favorite sans? Any that would work well with Sabon/Miller?\n\nI’m drawn to Stalemate or Tschichold at the moment.\n\n [‹ Typing with accents](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201172546/http:/typophile.com/node/12669 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typeface research.
