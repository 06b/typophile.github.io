  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am new to this forum and to type design in general. Below my first design for which I would like to get your honest critique!\n\nI started the font under construction via pencil / marker sketches of some of the important small faces, following the general guidelines in the book 'Designing Type' (which I think is an absulote must for every beginner).\n\nI want the font to be applicable as a book type with good readability but 'with some tension and movement' here and there. I started with the 'a' and instead of having a rounded hook, I settled for a 'curve under tension' (i.e. a high curvature at the upper right shoulder. This was then used as the underlying theme in other faces as well (very noticeable in the 'e', 'c' etc.\n\nI would appreciate some feedback so that I can roll in some changes during further development.\n\nThanks a lot!,\n\nSebastian\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Tensa.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124153915/http:/typophile.com/files/Tensa.pdf) | 23.45 KB |\n| [Tensa v2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124153915/http:/typophile.com/files/Tensa%20v2.pdf) | 25.88 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "This looks quite readable already in text-sizes, so the overall proportions seem to be right. But actually this can only be assessed if all characters are present, at the moment the more difficult ones are missing yet.\n\na: too narrow in textsetting I think, wonky lower left part, and it falls to the right. I like the upper part, but maybe it's just a bit too much tension.  \nd: the bowl is somewhat \"undefined\" yet. give it more tension (upper right part of the bowl is too near to the stem, lower part of the bowl is malformed)  \nh: is it wider than \"n\"? It appears to me, but I'm not sure.  \nr: the right flag seems to be slightly too thin. Don't make it bigger, just thicker.\n\nPlease take these tips with a grain of salt and please don't rely on them solely, because I am not the Master of Typedesign, but I can only tell what I see, and give some of my experience with my own drafts.\n\nAbout \"Designing Type\": I own the book as well, and after several months in the bookshelf, I have found how it can be used: I draw my characters without the aid of the book, but when revising them I have a look at the book, and often I find the little \"problem\" the character is suffering from.  \nIf I read before drawing, I'm so hooked up in \"rules\", \"proportions\", \"tendencies\" that every creativity is killed...\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Sebastian,\n\nI greatly appeciate you took the time to comment! To learn about font design I went through the string of reviews / posts on your Sofa font (which looks great!).\n\nI spend some time over the weekend and did the remaining lower case letters. During completion of this, I also start making some changes to the original version. I put in a sharp corner instead (as in Bembo) and did the same in the 'q' (not as in Bembo).\n\nOne of the things I wonder about as a beginner, is how rigid one needs to stick to the design language, especially for a text font (which seems to me like the 'high-school' of type)\n\na: I wasn't happy with it also. I put it upright, removed 'tension' and tweaked the bowl.\n\nd: Changed the bowl to be more to the left. The stress is now more to the left. I tried to do that with the b and the q as well.\n\nh: I made it a bit wider than the n. (as outlined in the Desiginging Type book). But I have the feeling that there may be a bit too much white in the counter.\n\nr: Made some changes here to make it thicker. I homed in on the 'swash' a the common theme in this font (a, c, f, j, r and the y).\n\nAlso, I moved away from the spurs in the b and q. They didn't seem to belong in this font. Instead I used sharp corners (as the 'b' in Bembo). One of the things I wonder as a beginner is how strict the use of certain design elements is in a text font (which seems to be the most rigorous branch of the art). For instance, in Bembo the 'b' has a sharp corner, but the q has a spur. Would it be \"ok\" to have a font in which the 'b' and the 'q' are identical in 'design language'?\n\nI use the Designing Type book more or less the same way lately. When I do a group of letters I look up the general 'rules' and then start drawing and wrangling Beziers. Also, I printed a number of samples of fonts I like and look at how diferent elements are used in those fonts.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for your feedback. I hope you can have a quick peek at my updated version.\n\nSebastian\n\n"
