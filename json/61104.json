In the end, they went for a “normal” serif face with fairly solid serifs, but some thick-thin contrast and counters that aren’t totally parallel to the outside shape of the letters. Stronger and thus more useful than Times New Roman while not as constructed as Rockwell. They did, however, like some of their explorations into a “humanist slab” so much, that they asked Sowersby to develop the initial sketches further as a companion for [FF Unit](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_complete_collection_ot/). That, in fact, is [FF Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_meta_ot_collection/)’s more serious sister, and it looked good with heavier serifs.\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FFUnitSlab_Dynasty_500_5614.png)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_slab_ot_collection/)\n\n**The new [FF Unit Slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_slab_ot_collection/)** is a fairly condensed slab which pulls a punch in bold headlines and looks surprisingly good in text with its typewriter-like discipline. Its serifs are decidedly no-nonsense and un-selfconscious. FF Unit Slab can be mixed with FF Unit, of course, but also works as companion to FF Meta. The two families share a common heritage and like to hang out with each other. [FF Unit Slab Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_slab_pro_collection/) adds Central European, Turkish, and Extended Latin character sets.\n\n[FSI FontShop International](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.fontfont.com/) designed a digital specimen which you can enjoy on [Issuu](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/issuu.com/fontfont/docs/ffunitslab) as well as on [Behance](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/www.behance.net/Gallery/FF-Unit-Slab-The-No-Nonsense-Slab-Serif/287356). Typophile moderator Yves Peters wrote a continuative article on ‘ [The Creation of FF Unit Slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103141611/http:/fontfeed.com/archives/ff49-the-creation-of-ff-unit-slab/)’, where you can download the PDF as well.\n\n",
