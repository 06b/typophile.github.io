  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've designed a font in one of my classes at design school, the idea was to have the font feel as if it had been folded out of a sheet. And then I also made tehe font from a sheet, folded it and fotographed it so I had a Clean and a real version.\n\nNow I am working with a fiend to make the letters in 3D and stick it in an Augmented Reality app so that you can see how the font is only realy visible from one perspective.\n\nIt's still work in progress but I was wonderin how you would react, if we could get any tips, maybe where to drop this idea or which type of people might be interested in this so we have an idea wehere to take this project.\n\nThanks!\n\nCoen.\n\nwhat were planning in AR: [http://vimeo.com/99744592](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/vimeo.com/99744592 \"http://vimeo.com/99744592\")\n\nMy project at school: [http://coendekoning.com/folding\\_fraktur.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/coendekoning.com/folding_fraktur.html \"http://coendekoning.com/folding\\_fraktur.html\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Folding Fraktur Light\\_14556905825\\_o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/typophile.com/files/Folding%20Fraktur%20Light_14556905825_o.jpg) | 64.3 KB |\n| [Folding Fraktur\\_14370219920\\_o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/typophile.com/files/Folding%20Fraktur_14370219920_o.jpg) | 143.37 KB |\n| [Fractur A\\_14370298029\\_o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/typophile.com/files/Fractur%20A_14370298029_o.jpg) | 69.57 KB |\n| [A\\_14370462747\\_o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/typophile.com/files/A_14370462747_o.jpg) | 104.26 KB |\n| [Folding Fraktur Character\\_14576965503\\_o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202018/http:/typophile.com/files/Folding%20Fraktur%20Character_14576965503_o.jpg) | 148.41 KB |\n\n",

Blackletters aren't particularly fashionable these days, but I think any designer would appreciate this project. I think it's really more about the play with perspectives which a broken script really lends itself for, than it is about blackletters.\n\n"
