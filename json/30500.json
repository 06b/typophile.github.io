If you know German: There has been a thread going on about the subject in the German [typoforum](http://web.archive.org/web/20071021124605/http:/www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?t=2205&highlight=lexicon).\n\n«DU», or some of the issues anyway, belongs in my opinion to one of the finest magazines ever.\n\n"
