I find it hard to imagine that Myriad could have be created as it is without Frutiger's prior and ground-breaking creation of his self-named typeface. Though Myriad is a significantly different design, I think almost all type designers--probably including Slimbach and Frutiger--would agree that Frutiger's design had a significant influence on Myriad, and not just by reaction.\n\nI don't think that acknowledging such influences takes away anything at all from Slimbach's greatness as a type designer. For me he is one of the handful of greatest at work today.\n\n"

I'm just saying that more of what Robert does (in non-revival faces) is coming from his own head. I don't know that this makes his work less similar to other typefaces, I'm just saying that he tends not to pay much attention to what other designers are currently doing.

Once creative thinkers and workers are beyond their formative stages--in which they are indeed decisively influenced--they often are driven more by their own creative program for themselves, and the needs of the broader culture, rather than their peers. Hence Thomas's observation about Slimbach is plausible to me.\n\nStill, people usually have an awareness of their peers and sometimes a competitiveness, though this varies with the person. And I think it is quite difficult even for a person himself or herself to be fully aware of influences, past or peers. As David noted, such influences may be unconscious, but none the less real.\n\n\\>lowercase italics are so similar to Palatino’s\n\nI don't see it.

Less typographically savvy users were particularly uncertain about how to deal with it.\n\nFor Adobe, it also introduced a legacy issue: what would we do with the existing fonts with the older optical-size naming convention? Either we change their style names - a major break in compatibility - or we live with two different standards.\n\nIn the end, we decided that simply keeping with the existing scheme was the best of the alternatives. For Arno, we minted a new size name of \"small text\" in between \"caption\" and \"regular,\" for the 10 pt optical size. Although we might come up with new names, simply prefixing \"small\" or \"large\" in front of the existing labels would give us enough optical sizes to play with for pretty much any purpose.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

I use TeX and LaTeX for mathematical typesetting, so the digital equivalent of struggling to get the cellophane off the next Beatles LP is a half hour of shell scripting and writing font description files. My conclusion: I need to wait for the remaining light opticals, if they're coming. ArnoPro-Light36pt can't be intended for 11pt body text.\n\nTo my naive eye, light fonts seem to be in identity crisis now. Are they supposed to \"look\" light on the page, or offer a reasonable alternative to regular? One sees good examples of each view. I'm writing a textbook to either be viewed on screen or laser printed. After many experiments I've concluded that most regular fonts are too heavy, reflecting a historical traditon that predates high resolution screens and printing. The only font that I can stay with for more than an hour of writing is Warnock Pro Light.\n\nSo I'm dying of curiousity to see the rest of the ArnoPro light series.
