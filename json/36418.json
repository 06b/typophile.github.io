You might also think about printing on some kind of reflective paper, or maybe even getting a sign shop to help you out with these if you have the budget.\n\n"

The light background of the panel, especially if they are lighter than the wall color, may help readability.\n\nAs to size, I believe ADA guidelines specify 1 inch of cap height for every 50 ft of viewing distance.(I know this is what FHWA has built their spec on). Also remember not to go too bold. A maximum stem weight of 1:5 stroke width to height ratio is the boldest you should go. (also the boldest allowed in the ADA spec)\n\nThat 1 inch cap height spec refers to all caps settings. IF you use mixed case you should go larger.\n\nJames\n\n"

I'm guessing that the signs in question would be supplying information about an exhibit, for instance identifying an artwork's title and artist. In a circumstance like that, the informational sign is not required to adhere to the ADA standard, although the sign identifying the name of the exhibit room (as well as Men's room, etc), would be required to comply.\n\nAs James mentions, even if the law doesn't require these signs to comply, the spec is still a useful guideline for any signs to ensure your signs can be read by a broad section of the population.\n\nJason C\n\n"
