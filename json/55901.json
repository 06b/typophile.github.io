It has a link to another thread, but the link is broken.\n\nI'm sending my cards to the printer's on Tuesday, and I post the photos once I get them. But I also thought it might be worth repeating the 2003 thread.\n\nAnyone's interested ?\n\nI'm sure quite a few of you have cards that are just waiting to be bragged about :)\n\n",
