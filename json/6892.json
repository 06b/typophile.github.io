  "content": "Hi everyone,   \n   \nDoes anyone here recognize this typeface? It was used by a sports team in the late 1890's in England, and I'm trying to find its modern-day equivalent. Take a look at those 'A's and 'S's. Pretty distinctive, don't you think?   \n   \nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated!   \n   \nMany thanks for your time,   \n   \nAndrew   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49960.jpg)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49961.jpg)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49962.jpg)\n\n",

It seems to have been created by/for Disney's Haunted Mansion.   \n   \nand while we're on the subject of links, am I the only one who vastly prefers when they open up in new windows?   \n   \nA note to Type: the links exist (often) if you look for them.
