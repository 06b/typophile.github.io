      "content": "Part of it has been obviously modified (artificially emboldened(?), crossbars pulled downwards, counters reworked), wasn't able to spot a perfect match. I first thought it could have been [Franklin Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/franklin+gothic)/ [News Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/news+gothic)/ [Trade Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/trade+gothic) but digits don't match at all. The closest I've found is [Grotesk URW++](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesk) but I can't positive if they start from it. More in the same vein: [TV Nord EF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/tvnord), [Aaux Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/aaux-next), [Largo URW++](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/largo) (very close too), [Akzidenz-Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/akzidenz-grotesk-std), [Slate MTI](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829171820/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/slate)\n\n"
