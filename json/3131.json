I'm just not sure how \"fat\" the sample that was given to me got. I may need to be looking for a typeface with thicker thins that was based on Century. Maybe? What do you think?   \n   \n ![Century Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052212im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/26528.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "The sample you have on your post #26 looks like ITC Century Bold (possibly a knock-off). Century Schoolbook is a bit thicker in the thins. I also think the title has been condensed somewhat and some of the boldness is simply the result of video distortion (blooming) from being reversed.\n\n"

It has fatter thins and square-ended serifs and is a good match to the logo. Unfortunately it is listed as an Andresen exclusive and the showing is printed in a coarse halftone to deter reproduction.\n\n"
