      "content": "I worked for quite a few years making architectural drawings, so I have additional experience with technical pens beyond the uses we all remember in making mechanicals and such. As the resident pen-fetishist in every architectural office where I worked, I was often consulted about how to get this-or-that 00 or 000 pen working again, even when they were parked in the humidified carousels that Koh-i-Noor sold. Far more often, the draftspeople had left their pens out overnight or over the weekend and they'd seized up solid as a fossil. Pretty hard to get that tiny wire to move freely ever again once that has happened.\n\nWell folks, here's the answer and it is SO simple: at the end of the day -- _every single day without exception_ -- just take the pens apart and dribble the ink back into the bottle from the reservoir. Do a quick but attentive rinse of the moving parts in the pen \"nib,\" dab dry with a tissue, and put the pen back together. This way the pen gets stored dry and you never have to worry: next time you need to make some lines in a hurry, just gas it up and it'll behave like a brand-new pen. Not that important to do with anything fatter than a \"0\" (.35mm) but for the skinnier sizes you will always save time and aggravation by doing this.\n\nRight here in the studio I still have (and occasionally use) sets of these from Koh-i-Noor Rapidograph, Rotring, and Staedtler, in addition to my Brause and H&B dip pens. I gave away my Graphos set to an enthusiastic student many years ago.\n\nI also have kept the Rotring compass and Ulano swivel knife setup that I used to cut all the original letters for a type that Michael Neugebauer designed for a local Salzburg architect back in 1977 (it later became Litera [http://www.linotype.com/89893/litera-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102080612/http:/www.linotype.com/89893/litera-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/89893/litera-family.html\")) but I have never used it since for making letters. As a few other old codgers will remember, it is a very tedious process to cut letters completely by hand on Rubylith!\n\n"
