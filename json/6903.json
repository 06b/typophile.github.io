      "content": "No, i meant ascent & descent. These swash letters (Y & R) are to be used sparingly and the rest of the letters you see in this example are the actual caps. The lowercase is morticed and the descenders and ascenders of the lc don't reach above/below the bounds i've set in the above illustration. Since the Swash caps are meant to be used sparingly (in one line settings), i thought that it would be silly to set the ascent/descent on these letters unless it would cause some cataclysmic problems like chopping off whatever lies above/below the boundaries that i've set in the above example.   \n   \nI guess that should have been the original question: if i set the ascent/descent as shown above will the regions outside this bounding area still print?\n\n"

Since this is a display font, that should be easy to accomplish. Diacritics in text fonts on the capitals are often above type height and they print but more leading is often needed in CE languages where there are lots of diacritics.   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not sure what the red lines are.   \nI can assume they're the \"normal\" baseline and capheight, and I guess you're worried about going too far down/up with the bigger caps. Certainly with the descenders there shouldn't be a problem, and even with the ascenders you should be safe, although once you add the accents on the big caps you'll really be going way up. My guess is that _some_ apps will truncate the tops at some point, but not the ones that really matter.   \n   \nDo some testing.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I should add, I was making a very literal reading of your   \nquestion Paul. If you were to set your ascent/descent as   \nthe lines show, one would then assume the cap height   \nis 1000 with the swash caps shooting over/under?   \nThis would be bad.   \n   \nWhen in doubt, be conservative with this stuff. I like   \nto keep my cap height between 666 and 714. Usually 666   \nbecause it splits evenly and gives a nod to the beast, if   \nyou know what I mean. Then you can set your ascent   \nat something like 750 and the descent at 250. This is   \nof course assuming you have a rather standard design.\n\n"
