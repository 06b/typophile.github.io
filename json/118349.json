  "content": "Lamp Black: The Colour of Soot\n\nLamp Black is made from the soot collected from Jackson Art — a pure carbon. It can also be made from the soot from tar or resin. This soft shade of black often has a brown tint when used alone, while it takes on a blue tint when mixed with white to create grey and is particularly useful for colouring dark skies and seas. This **[Art supplies](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417153133/http:/www.jacksonsart.com/)** colour of black is usually slow to dry and can be mixed with other compounds to speed up the process. It is also very stable colour.\n\n",
