Type used in interesting ways virtually does not exist in Australia. Certainly there is fack all of it in Melbourne and Sydney.\n\nI think it's worth me pointing this out. You could drop a bomb on every major city in Australia, and the damage bill for unique and interesting type treatments would come to $6.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
