  "content": "Hello,\n\nBooks on the subject of corporate identity and its history, as books about the history of type, are plentiful. But I am looking for some suggestions to books on the history of corporate type, and I havent't really found anything yet. But then, perhaps it's not a book I need but a quick dig into the collective knowledge base that is Typophile.\n\nIf, by a corporate typeface, I mean a typeface commissioned, made and used _exclusively_ for a commercial entity or organization, then who made and used the first one? Was it the _Romain du roi_?\n\nWhat are your favorites through history?\n\nYours,\n\nƒ\n\n",
