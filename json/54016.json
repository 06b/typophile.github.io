I haven't been able to find any official documentation from Beaurepaires regarding their new logo either. It's a more geometric, less human version of Helvetica with horizontal and vertical terminals.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nVincent\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020161033im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Beaurepaires_5213.png)\n\n",
