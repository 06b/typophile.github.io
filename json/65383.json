  "content": "Greetings. I am on the hunt for the perfect typeface for LC library call numbers. I want a font which distinguishes very clearly between the most easily-confused characters (zero & O, 5 & S, 1 & I & J); is either a sans-serif or a serif of low stroke contrast; is simple and looks good in Bold; and -- ideally -- has oldstyle figures available. A call number uses only capitals and numerals (e.g. JQ843.I17 S56 2009) which implies lining, but I think oldstyle numerals help to make the letter/number distinction most obvious, especially the O/zero.\n\nRequiring bars on the I, and a sizeable angled tail on the 1, knocks out most sans-serif contenders. Serif oldstyle 1's need a nice tail too (not bars). Starting with basic Windows fonts, the best are Verdana/Tahoma and Bookman Old Style, but they have lining figures. Monospaced fonts offer a barred I, but generally have lining figures. Constantia and Georgia are too high-contrast in boldface for my taste.\n\nMy favorite finds thus far are Quadraat Small Caps (offering uniformly short numerals, which are even better for this purpose than oldstyle), though stroke contrast is a bit high and the J isn't great; Droid Sans Pro (a great sans-serif, designed for legibility on mobile phones); and maybe Cooper, of all things (in Med or Bold), because of its unusual near-oldstyle numerals. Do any fonts combine all the desired features? Numerals like those of Cooper or Quadraat SC might be best. I suppose a zero that's both short and slashed is too much to hope for!\n\n",

      "content": "Nina, Apex's alphabetics kill it for this task. The lc \"el\" in Tisa is too much like a numeral one. Parango has bigger problems... Unit is good - and the zero could be modified. Or you could use the o-slash. :-) Axel looks like a winner as-is.\n\nHere's an idea: programming fonts! They're not the prettiest\\* but their glyphs are always highly differentiated. And there's a very handy one out there: Consolas! If you're on a Mac (or WinXP), Ascender sells it.\n\n\\* And would the fact that they're fixed-width be an issue here?\n\nhhp\n\n"

I didn't actually look at the alphabetics too much – kinda got hooked on the idea of hybrid numerals.\n\nHow about something in the general direction of OCR fonts, BTW? Even less pretty than programming fonts, but the glyphs are certainly just about as differentiated as they can be.\n\n"

Programming fonts have indeed been used by libraries for call number labeling. When I make simple things in Word, however, the Consolas alternate OS figures don't appear in the character map; why is that? Does XP not fully utilize the Vista fonts?\n\nOCR fonts tend to look a little bizarre, and are probably trumped by other options. Lowercase is almost irrelevant to my purpose, so Tisa is still a good choice. Thanks for Axel, which is new to me.\n\n"

You would need a OpenType-savvy program for this. Choosing OS figures is possible in MS Word 2010 Beta (which you can try out free for now), but I don't think older versions of Word include these or many other typographically useful OpenType features.\n\n"
