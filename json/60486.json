  "content": "How do you feel about breaking the baseline grid in a more complex table of contents?\n\nI've come across such a situation and have tried different solutions, yet it always seems to work best when I add some diversity and am in turn forced to break the grid. Since tables of contents often require more detailed control than the main text, I presume it's OK to design them a bit differently while still following the main established design principles.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sampleTOC.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019161047/http:/typophile.com/files/sampleTOC.pdf) | 81.3 KB |\n\n",

It's not 100% proof, with different levels and number of titles, but I'm getting close.\n\nI'll attach a sample. Please note that this is just a working copy so there are still some minor incongruities left.\n\n"

The earlier suggestion about using a grid that is half the line advance of the text is a good place to start.\n\nI'd also suggest that you pull the column of page numbers to the left so there is about 1.5 to 2 ems only from the end of the longest line to the page numbers. That will lessen the overall gap between titles and page numbers (Berry mentions this as not always very good looking; he's right].\n\npowers\n\n"

I design books for a living and have never bothered much with aligning the TOC to the baseline grid. Make sure it's consistent in terms of sink or align the last line to the bottom and you'll be fine.\n\nI don't like that the spacing above the chapter titles is inconsistent.

I've fixed it already.\n\nThank you all for the input!\n\n"
