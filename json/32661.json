  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm currently preparing myself for building my own website (which still might take a while, mind you) & I was thinking about putting useful information on it for graphic designers in general. One thing I wanted to do, is put a RGB/CMYK/Pantone (& possibly RAL) conversion table on it & also a list of fonts which are known under several names. I'm thinking of retro fonts that have now been digitilized (eg. Jackson that is now available from Linotype as Laughin) & also fonts that are cloned and widely spread over the internet. I've often experienced (even at work) that we had font clones without even knowing it (eg. we had Arnold Bocklin, but also Horizon which -some kerning aside maybe- is basically the same). I had a few sites that mentioned font clones in my favourites list, but they no longer exist.  \nSo if anyone knows of any fonts with several names, please let me know, I'll be sure to acknowledge you if I ever manage to get my site online ;-)\n\n",

      "content": "That sounds like a great resource. On the color side, I was just trying to find something like that. When I couldn't find anything exactly like what I was looking for I started kicking around the idea of making a reference document, or website that would have RGB/CMYK/Pantone conversions as well as names that are associated with certain colors. That seems like it could really help with client communication because a designer could both use names the Client is more familiar with and look up color names that a client mentions.\n\nSorry if that's a little off topic,\n\nDuncan\n\n"

I used to have a few of those colour conversion sites amongst my favourites as well, but none of them were complete. And I've also often found myself knowing the name of a \"real\" font, knowing that we hàd it at work, but not being able to find the name under which we had it. I just thought to combine all these things in one user friendly site. The only problem is that the internet is my only source & that I will have to gather all the information myself, so if anyone here has links for fontclones, colour conversions or other ideas, please don't hesitate to post 'em here.\n\n"

      "content": "You need to get your hands on\n\n1. The Bitstream Font Analogue (1992?) – which listed Bitstream fontnames against the respective standard industry names. This info may be on their website, but I've never found it. They tend to rely on the 'family tree' view on myfonts.com to provide names of equivalent faces from other foundries.\n\n2. A Manual of Comparative Typography by Benjamin Bauermeister, 1988, Van Nostrand Reinhold, N.Y. lists many alternative names from other photosetting suppliers for quite a few of the standards.\n\n(Shameless plug!) some of the above information made it into the 'see also' sections of the individual font pages at [my site about the so-called top 100](http://web.archive.org/web/20150407020539/http:/www.100types.com/100types.com.list.html). So for example, if you look for Akzidenz Grotesk there you'll see _'See also;  \nAmsterdam Mercator, Bauer Venus, Stempel Reform Grotesk, Haas Normal Grotesk, Bauer Folio, Linotype Basic Commercial, BT Gothic 725._    \n...and so on. In this particular listing I can say that only the last two are AG under other names from different foundries. Generally, I leave it to the viewer to decide which typefaces are simply close in design and which are rip-off.\n\nI think Daniel Will Harris has something on this at his site too; try starting at [http://www.will-harris.com/esperfonto/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150407020539/http:/www.will-harris.com/esperfonto/ \"http://www.will-harris.com/esperfonto/\")\n\n"
