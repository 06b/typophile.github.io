      "content": "You can do that with Opera too. Any search box from any site can be added to the drop-down search menu. So you only need to enter the name of a font once to search Google, Myfonts, Identifont, Typophile and any others in a row. Just right-click the box you want + \"create new search\" (or something like that, I have it in French).\n\n"
