The flat bottomed 'a' is pretty unusual so I don't think you'll find a match for that. Best to start with something close and modify it. The closest thing I can summon is [Amasis](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023164420/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/amasis_std_bold/?sample_text=Langes&sample_size=96).\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, I knew there was a proper term for the slabs, but it just escaped me. But, yes, brackets are exactly what I'm looking for. Something with a similar feel to the un-bracketed ones, but just a little softer.\n\nAt this stage, I think Boton is still the closest, so I'll give a go at adapting that to fit.\n\nThanks for both of your help.\n\n"
