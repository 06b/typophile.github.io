      "content": "These mechanical displays were made by Conrac in Germany (now it's all digital stuff). This was one of their standard fonts, more or less based on helvetica, but with occasional deviations to accommodate the horizontal split. We occasionally had them make up custom fonts, but this was an expensive and time consuming procedure since the final designs had to work within the limitations of their manufacturing process.\n\n"
