  "content": "A woman who is prohibited from coming within 500 feet and 12pt of Robert Slimbach was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of stalking after police picked her up near the designer's Malibu home, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.&nbsp;  \nSheriff's spokesman Officer Steve Finn said deputies were called to the 14000 block of Malibu Road at about 7 a.m. by a cabbie who said a fare was refusing to pay for her ride into the area. Slimbach himself then flagged the officers down and said he recognized the woman in the taxi as the one whom he accused of showing \"unusual interest\" in his designs.&nbsp;  \nHe said he did not think she had set foot on his type that day.&nbsp;  \nA rep for Slimbach hasn't yet commented on the incident.&nbsp;\n\n",
