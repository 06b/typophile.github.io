Used by both Robert Barker (London, early 1600s) and Wolfgang Hopyl (Paris, early 1500s). Hopyl moved to France to do printing, but also did printing for England. So northwestern Europe is the geographic region where I have found samples of this type. 16th century or so.\n\n**Example 1**  \nIt was common in early printing, but I'm having difficulty finding a modern, digital revival of this beautiful type. Perhaps the best example is of the first printing of the [King James Bible 1611](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022247/http:/digitalcollections.lib.umanitoba.ca/islandora/object/uofm%3A7107/pages?page=9). It was printed in London by Robert Barker, the son of Christopher Barker. The father (Christopher) started printing around 1569, so I'm assuming that the type pieces used were probably mid-1500s era equipment.\n\n**Example 2**  \nThe second example is type from the printer Wolfgang Hopyl. [This example](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820022247/http:/www.kb.nl/bladerboek/hopyl/browse/page_122v.html) is taken from 1500. There is a very common typeface called \"Manuskript Gotisch\" (or \"Manuskript Gothisch\") that was inspired by type used by Hopyl in 1514, but **this type is not Manuskript Gothisch** and have included it in my sample (see attachment) for comparison purposes.\n\n",
