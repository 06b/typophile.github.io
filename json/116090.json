  "content": "Hi everyone  \nHaving used QuarkXPress for years, I'm still struggling when it comes to transfer my working habits into InDesign — you can't specify H&J parameters outside of a Paragraph Style Sheet, the keybord shortcut for \"thin space\" doesn't involve using the space key at all, etc.  \nQuark also used to allow tweaking the kerning pair table for a specific font, a feature which I've always found very handy (to adjust the space before and after the figure 1 in most classic sans serif typefaces like Univers or Akzidenz Grotesk, for instance). Does anybody knwo if InDesign includes a similar feature and, if so, where can it be found ?\n\n",

It's in the flyout menu on the far right of the paragraph/character toolbar at the top of the screen.\n\nYou can also build custom kerning into a paragraph style by using GREP styles. (Yes, it's a little roundabout.) You build a character style with the kerning you want and use GREP to apply this style to a certain character (with or without the provision, only when followed by a certain character).\n\n"

      "content": "> you can't specify H&J parameters outside of a Paragraph Style Sheet\n\nNot _entirely_ true - all paragraph attributes can be applied \"directly\", i.e., as a local override, on any text. Look in the menu of the Paragraph panel. Changing settings through a \"style sheet\" (called \"Paragraph Style\" in ID's native lingo) is useful if you want to have the same settings throughout your document; but occasionally, you might want to override them.\n\n> the keybord shortcut for \"thin space\" doesn't involve using the space key at all\n\nInDesign supports more spaces than there are hot key combo's. If you find you need one sort on a regular base, create a Keyboard Shortcut set of your own and select any combo you find useful.\n\n> etc.\n\nInDesign ≠ Quark XPress. The sooner you let go of the idea that A is DTP software and B is also DTP software, \"therefore\" both options and usage (... and keyboard shortcuts!) should be the same, the better.\n\n> Quark also used to allow tweaking the kerning pair table for a specific font, a feature which I've always found very handy\n\nGranted, this is one thing ID (natively) lacks. Note that Quark _did not allow_ this natively either; it was an external, commercial Quark Xtension.\n\n"
