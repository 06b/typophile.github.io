      "content": "Given that the project in question does not involve font piracy in any form whatever, I find a comment about \"liberating\" people's computers in poor taste.\n\nIntellectual property has value, but it does differ from physical property.\n\nThus, the scene in Atlas Shrugged where an architect whose rights were not respected in the building of housing for the poor takes a bulldozer to the construction... depicts wasteful behavior which makes the world poorer.\n\nThe main reason, though, that the distinction between intellectual property and physical property must be kept in mind is this:\n\nIntellectual property rights exist because they have been granted by the government. They result from a covenant between the people of a country and authors, inventors, artists, and so on, to agree to give them a limited property right in their creations to encourage them to contribute to the benefit of the country and humanity by producing them.\n\nSo the rights given by copyright and patent laws are something society chose to grant, because it saw that it would benefit from the bargain.\n\nRights in physical property, on the other hand, are natural law rights. There is no choice in the matter: a country that lets some people's property be stolen is engaging in a human rights violation.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nBecause when representatives of the film industry or the music industry come forwards to legislators asking for extensions of the copyright law - either extensions in the term of copyright for past works, or laws like the DMCA - the legislators need to clearly understand that they are not under any moral obligation to grant such requests, and instead should only do so if there is a net benefit to society as a whole, not content owners.\n\n"

Not that I remember ever using Clarendon before though. Which, to me personally makes it even less relevant to liberate Clarendon.\n\nIf I can help it I would like to limit the amount of typefaces amateur designers have access to to a minimum. Let them first learn how to use type properly before advancing to other typefaces. I'm aware I'm being callous, egocentric and perhaps a tad narrow-minded, but I simply tire too much from typefaces used incorrectly and becoming stigmatized because people who know nothing about type have opinions based on those incorrect uses. Keep Clarendon reserved for people who understand type. Let the amateurs chew on Helvetica for another 40 years.\n\n"

      "content": "> Please check your facts.  \n> All property rights are created by law. No laws, no property rights.\n\nAh, no. Once you allow separating \"right\" from \"law\" in any context, as is done with basing a society on \"inalienable rights,\" you remove the fact-checking option. There is no one-to-one correlation between \"legal\" and \"true,\" and \"true\" is needed for \"fact,\" minimally as matter of language.\n\nAll religious truths are \"revealed,\" rather than \"discovered\" or \"proven.\" To deny a religious truth simply means that particular truth hasn't been revealed to you. Counterarguments from science, or another religion, count for nothing to the holder of that truth. That's the source for both the strength and weakness of religious truths, and why it can get downright messy, in a law-based society, deciding as a matter of law just what is a religion and what isn't.\n\nAt their core, all satisfactory explanatory systems are based on faith, either you accept the system or not. Mixing explanatory systems midstream is convenient but correctly opens you up to a charge of inconsistency.\n\nNor can you use the tenant of a system to prove it's \"truth.\" Using \"because it works\" can be a reason, practical or otherwise, for someone to adopt an explanatory system, but is not evidence for it, not an argument for or proof of it's truth.\n\nExample: empiricism (encompasses science) is so complete it can explain why someone becomes a mystic. But a system based on mysticism can be just as complete and can explain why someone becomes a scientist (Plato, for one, does).\n\nOnce you allow inalienable rights, you need to decry quadibloc on moral rather than logical grounds. Alternative is to give up on \"inalienable rights.\"\n\n"

No laws, no property rights.</cite>\n\nI have to admit this is more of a matter of opinion than of fact at this time.\n\nHowever, it is a fact that governments do exist, and have existed, other than democratically-elected governments.\n\nThus, some governments have failed to respect basic human rights. They have done things that were cruel and unfair to innocent people. Both the Holocaust and Negro slavery are facts of history.\n\nThus, to make it intelligible that we can criticize governments from a moral point of view, it is necessary to adopt a view such as we see written in the Declaration of Independence: that it is inherently obvious that all human beings are equal in terms of their rights, these rights are not given to them by any government or human authority, but are either a logical consequence of their inherent nature, or, if endowed, are endowed by no less an authority than God Himself, and these rights cannot be bartered or sold, and they include the rights of life (including bodily integrity and security of person), freedom, and the ability to pursue one's goals in one's own way subject to respecting the rights of others (including the right to the property one has legitimately earned, freedom of religion, and so on).\n\nFor it is written, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\".\n\n"
