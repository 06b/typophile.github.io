She dismissed each saying, in effect, that the “K” and the “k” were ugly, pathetic things. And so, dear friends, I turn to you. Help me find this lady the letter of her dreams, an attractive “Kk” in an attractive font.\n\n [‹ Calligraphic work of art on your desktop](http://web.archive.org/web/20080614062159/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14350 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [LiveType Project new name - help! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080614062159/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14326 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
