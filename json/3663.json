Anyone have any advice -- humorous or not -- for me as I make the move from freelance to a full-time position in a small design firm?   \n   \nInteresting employment stories are also welcome. You know, strangest interview, quirky first design job, best or worst boss, unusual office rituals (bagel day and red shirt day are two that come to mind), etc., etc.\n\n",

The two principals never read Print or CA or any other design publication, so had only a vague idea of what current design looked like.   \n   \nI have to disagree with H�ctor. It's true that you set expectations early on, and by doing extra work you're telling them you don't value your free time. But it also shows you're dedicated and hardworking. And also it's professional to get the job done even if it's after closing time or on the weekend.\n\n"

I'm happy to say that in this instance the issue has already been discussed and resolved. :-)   \n   \nJohn, how long did you work at the office you mentioned? Were you able to influence the principals reading habits at all?   \n   \n\"Look, listen, share, ask, contribute,... \" Good advice for any number of arenas. Ditto, sharing food, although I must say it seems to be more of a challenge these days to find something that fits into everyone's diet.   \n   \nThanks.   \n   \nAny other work-related stories you wish to share?\n\n"

I think this is the absolute worst thing you can do. If you don't take pride in the work you do, your not worth much to me.   \n   \nWe work together to get projects done, if your not done at 5:00 and the project is due the next day, you better f\\*cking stay and work, or don't bother showing up the next day.   \n   \n(FYI: I am a principal of a smaller 10 person firm)   \n   \nJesus: Thats an interesting grid in your 'icon', might I ask what it is based on?\n\n"

The funny thing was that they subscribed to both Print and CA, but they did so because that's what design companies do, not because they were interested in reading the magazines. I knew that place was the wrong fit for me, but I stayed a year because I wanted to give them a fair try.   \n   \nAnother suggestion I'd have is to do things to keep design fun, even if the stuff you're working on isn't fun. I'm always bringing in personal projects and ideas from home to show my coworkers.\n\n"
