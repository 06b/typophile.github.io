  "content": "FOR IMEDIATE RELEASE   \n   \nTypeco releases it's second font family - Chunkfeeder.   \n   \nChunkfeeder was inspired by the vernacular forms of lettering created for high speed printing and electronic displays. These letters are seen all around us in such things as postal packing slips, airline tickets and informational video displays. Many of these fonts are designed by engineers and interface designers who presumably do not have a background in letterform design. Consequently these glyphs have many idiosyncrasies.   \n   \nIn keeping with it's mechanical inspiration, Chunkfeeder is monospaced, much like an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) font. Chunkfeeder has a rather ridged modularity but it incorporates some typographic nuance into the letterforms than most other fonts of this style, while exploiting some of the quirky visual artefacts of high speed printing.   \n   \nChunkfeeder is a versatile family of 6 fonts -- 3 weights, each with an accompanying oblique.   \n   \nTypeco is an electronic type foundry for the designs of principal, James Grieshaber, as well as a provider of typographic services and solutions. Services offered by Typeco include font identification, signature fonts, logo fonts and handwriting fonts. Solutions include custom designed typefaces, logos and trademarks, branding and graphic design.   \n   \nJames Grieshaber has been active in the typographic community for several years now.

He has been honored with an award of Excellence in Type Design from Association Typographique International (ATypI) for his Gothic Gothic type design. He has now struck out on his own to offer his services to those in typographic need and showcase his typographic vision.   \n   \nContact info:   \nTypeco   \nPO Box 10661   \nRochester, NY 14610   \nPhone: 585.230.1674   \nEmail: [contact@typeco.com](mailto:contact@typeco.com)   \nWeb: [http://www.typeco.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018033132/http:/www.typeco.com/)\n\n",
