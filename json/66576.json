  "content": "A functioning online community needs a separate place to discuss that community. Specific topic discussions should not be polluted by metadiscussions about how the site works.\n\nTypophile needs to [clone what MetaFilter does](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419063812/http:/metatalk.metafilter.com/ \"MetaTalk\") and start a separate forum called MetaPhile. It is there that site policy and the specifics of individual posts can be discussed. If you have a concern about a post in one of the other forums, start a new post in MetaPhile to talk about it.\n\nIn particular, posts about new site features should not be [buried](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419063812/http:/typophile.com/node/65428 \"Viz Jared Benson’s\") in somebody’s “blog,” a feature this site never needed.\n\nIt goes without saying that all these posts with subject lines beginning “MetaPhile” should be moved there.\n\n",
