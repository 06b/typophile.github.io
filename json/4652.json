But I am wondering if you all think I need to have a period after the A in USA? It looks wonky if I put one there. My other idea was to use circles in place of periods, then I think that makes this less 'agrammatical'   \n   \nthoughts?   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021111113im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35366.gif)\n\n",

In your case of cource you don't need sc, but half space between the letters would do your job and look better (i think).   \n   \nchristos   \n   \np.s. if you are going to use dots it is for sure wrong not to use all of them.   \nIt will be like United States of A.\n\n"
