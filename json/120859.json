  "content": "Hi All,\n\nLike many first-time posters, I'm not entirely new to the site, having lurked in the shadows for a while.\n\nI won't give you a full biography now, but will tell you that I've developed an unhealthy interest in type design since being forced to reinvent myself due to illness. My background is technology sales, not design, so my efforts have tended towards the simple. Which is why I find myself in need of some opinions about my latest font.\n\nLet me try to set the scene.\n\nImagine walking a well-known street. Every so often, you check out an unknown side street , but you don't walk too far down it, because your instincts are to stick with what you are familiar with. However, on one occasion, you find yourself in one of these side streets by accident and walk a bit further down it. You're not comfortable - you keep turning, about to retrace your steps, but an inner voice tells you to keep exploring this strange street.\n\nYou get to a point where you have to make a decision: return or keep going? This is where I am with this design.\n\nI was editing the internal contour of an 'O' in a geometric sans I'd been drawing when I accidentally changed a smooth node to a corner node. There was something about this 'pinched' contour I liked, even though I didn't (and still don't) understand why, and I ended up creating a set of lower case glyphs based on this idea. I've created a TTF file and you can see the output in the linked PDF below.\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404082217/http:/freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf\")\n\nI'm incredibly conflicted about what I have and have held back on designing the upper case glyphs until I can resolve the way I feel about it. Sometimes I look at individual letterforms and hate them; sometimes, I look at the same letterforms and love their quirkiness. The only time I consistently like what I have so far is when I see a segment of body text at around 36pt and it's for this reason I'm asking for the community's view.\n\nDoes this design have promise (and, if so, any thoughts about refining the characters I have) or, should I turn back to my well-known street?\n\nThanks in advance, Steve\n\n",

Looking at the letters in a half-focused way the o's seemed to have a small pinch in the upper left corner of the counter. You can experiment with such a design idea, exaggerate it perhaps make a half or complete cut there, and start the letter as if it were made with a calligraphic rounded brush. Or end the stroke with a little flourish? Whatever you do carry on the new style to the other letters in a uniform way- now the the b for example looks too sedate and incongruent next to the o.\n\n"

So I think the main decision you need to first take is whether to revert to that construction and have a much easier time completing a font that presumably you and certainly many others would find attractive, or to instead try to avoid that reference and make something truly fresh, which however would be a greater challenge.\n\nAs for the caps, that's actually another tricky fork in the road. You can make caps that essentially look like a separate alphabet (the conventional way) or you can try to innovate and make caps that look like they belong with the lowercase (for which you might look to uncial).\n\nhhp\n\n"

Thoughts?\n\nhrant - I will expand upon the broad-nib pen characteristics, but I don't want to lose too much of the ruggedness. I've grown to really enjoy the unpredictable shapes and quirky features, and I don't want to sacrifice them. If that means the font ends up with a bit of an identity crisis, I'll chalk it up to experience and move on.\n\nI think I will attempt the caps.

The very first draft of the font, which preceded the first upload here, had a more conventional round foot, but I didn't like it. I have actually tried a couple more times to introduce it since discussing the font here, but I always end up preferring the straighter style. Do you think this font is desperately crying out for a rounded /t/?\n\nAs for the stroke endings, I've experimented a little here as well. Again, going back to my first 'pre-Typophile' version, the stroke endings you mentioned terminated with a curl, similar to the right sides of the /v/, /w/, /x/ and /y/ found in earlier versions (such as [http://freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404082217/http:/freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/e290ad9e0c.pdf\")).

That doesn't mean to say I opposed to change and I'll certainly experiment with other ideas.\n\n@hrant - you said earlier in this thread that you thought \"_...the main decision [I] need to first take is whether to revert to [a calligraphic] construction..._\".

The change isn't enough to warrant a new link, but I'll update it once I fix some of the other issues.\n\nMeantime, if you (or anyone) see any issue you think I should take a look at, I'd really appreciate your thoughts.\n\n"

I'll also the take a look at the /Y/ - I agree, something is wrong with the balance. I think this is because of the asymmetric stem flare. I'll see if shifting the weight a bit to the left works. I don't really want to remove the flare - that would be anomalous.\n\nBy the way... anyone have any ideas about a name for this font?\n\n"

On review, I think I need the lighten the /g/ just a little bit in the same area.\n\nThe /b/ & /q/ corners were shaved to solve a weight issue I had at that juncture. The curve of the stroke naturally thickens at that point. With the /p/ and /d/, I could get away with thinning the stroke because the descender gave balance, but a thinner stroke on the /b/ looked wrong absent a descender. I also looked at simply flipping the /d/ to create a /b/ but, aside from seeming a lazy solution, it left the pinch points on the opposite side to where they should be. I hope that makes sense, as I don't have time right now to post an image.\n\nAny ideas on an alternative solution?\n\nI'm similarly stumped for a solution to my /Y/ problem. Virtually all stems flare asymmetrically. Single-stemmed glyphs flare to the left at the base; double-stemmed glyphs flare to the left on the left stem and to the right on the right stem. In the case of the /m/ - the only, but logical, exception - the middle stem flares both left and right.\n\nI treated the /Y/ in the same way as, for example, the /f/ - a single flare to the left. But, because the /Y/ stem isn't long enough for the flare to even out, the original version had a horribly unbalanced look, which I tried to address by shifting the arms to the left. If your view is that this remains a problem, the only solution I can think of is to remove the flare altogether, since going the other way and creating a symmetrical flare makes the stem too dark.\n\nDo you think a flare-less /Y/ would be acceptable as an illogical exception? Or, do you have any other ideas I could experiment with?\n\nThanks for the name suggestion. What is your thinking behind that name?\n\n"
