  "content": "So I finally got round to finishing up Numina, formerly known as Catharsis Glamour & Glory... it's out on MyFonts now, with a 25% introductory discount. Get it while it's fresh! :)\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/numina/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025811/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/numina/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/numina/\")\n\nNumina is an elegant, dignified, highly condensed modern display family comprising two complementary faces. Numina Glory capitalizes on the family’s strong, relentless vertical texture, eschewing diagonals in favor of robust pillars, whereas Numina Glamour opts for more traditional letterforms for improved legibility and a classy, airy grace. Both faces are well-suited for headlines, logos, block quotes, and editorial work.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bla_5907.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bli_3980.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414025811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blu_6573.png)\n\nSee the MyFonts page for more posters.\n\n",

Special thanks to Hrant, who did the base spacing on the fonts as well as some touch-ups to the letter shapes, as well as to Rainer, who helped me with technical issues and finishing.\n\n"

      "content": "Very nice.\n\nIt just goes to show that formal invention is quite possible in mature genres, if done with taste and subtlety—one doesn’t have to follow the conventions slavishly.\n\nI like the way these are separate fonts, avoiding the elitism of doing one with the other(s) as a mere set of stylistic alternates.\n\n"
