Anyone an idea?\n\nI don't think it's Helvetica, although that was my first idea.\n\nThere probably has been some manipulation to the text, so an exact match isn't likely.\n\nTIA, Robin\n\n",

It's a Helvetica, the closest I can get to it is with a Helvetica Neue LT Std using the '35 thin'-variant at a 41,64 pt. Then a 164% vertical scale and 135% horizontal scale. Tracking at 20 and small caps. That's what I use instead of the sample and it looks like [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20100916224347/http:/www.chalk-webdesign.nl/headertxt.gif).\n\nRobin\n\n"
