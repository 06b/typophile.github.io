(In other words Kepler (1996), for example, may have been developed later than the logo.)\n\nYour image is way too blurry to make an ID, other than a rough guess. Right now I think this looks closer to [Century Expanded](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018054509/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-expanded/) than Bodoni.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
