They were both from the Cahan & Associates book ‘I Am Almost Always Hungry’.  \nIf anyone can help, much appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [serif\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=serif_1.jpg) | 64.55 KB |\n| [serif\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=serif_2.jpg) | 85.91 KB |\n\n",
