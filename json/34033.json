      "content": "It looks like a well constructed font, based on a well constructed philosophy. Given that his intended audience includes primarily the conceptual artist (from Kai's book), the idealogical underpinnings are sure to appeal. That said, I don't think it really adds anything new to the typographic landscape. Hats off to him though, I'll wager he learned a bundle in the process (ed. I did from reading the book excerpt, thanks for that). Congratulations on it's release. -- R\n\n"
