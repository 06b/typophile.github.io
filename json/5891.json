Used for selling things..   \n   \nThe 'per' design from 14..15th century English legal documents (English Court-Hand) and Latin based and the 'at cost' also loosely seems to have it's origins in Latin truncation. Many other characters derive their origins from Latin truncation, the '#' (pound or hash) , the 'pound sterling' and the 'shilling' are all more modern forms of the Roman Libra as was the Italian Lira. The Roman Libra was a sign of monetary measurement and for weight measurement. Other characters such as the Rx or 'recipe' an R with a slash through it's leg used now almost exclusively in America for 'pharmacy prescriptions' is a Latin form, it is also a truncation from 'response' used with the 'versicle' in Latin liturgical prayer books.   \n   \nThis 'at' or 'at cost' seems to have survived since it found a modern use.   \n   \nThis an old posting I have still on my site of the Monotype Matrix case, one of the earliest and best examples of how it was part of a 'commercial character set'. The book is 1916 and the date in the book as I seem to remember pre-dates Monotype, so it must be wrong.   \n   \n [http://www.connare.com/matrix.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018115058/http:/www.connare.com/matrix.htm)   \n   \nBut the 'Euro'. now that's Modern rubbish... is it the Cento sign? .. or Centi? and has no one ever clamed it to be a modern Latin form? But someone may call it the same at the Libra or Lira or Pound sterling, all being truncated characters.\n\n"
