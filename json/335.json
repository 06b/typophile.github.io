  "content": "The city where I live (Coimbra, Portugal)presented us the new identity and logo last week on a big party with a Michael Nyman show and everything... I intended to present the logo in these phoruns to ask for a typographic expert oppinion (Something on the type is just wrong to me) but now the thing got even more interesting! Someone found a simmilar logo of a company called Quintiles Transnational..   \n   \nThe designer of coimbra's logo says the logo represents a serpent (found on the old coimbra's Blazon). I still don't know why he splitted the Word in to COIM + BRA.   \n   \nThe quintiles logo represents a Q, I guess.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417153143im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11635.gif)   \n   \n1. I still can't decide if this is plain Coincidence or a bloody ripp-off. What do you typophiles think?   \n   \n2. Can you express the feedback on coimbra's logos? Is it balanced? Is the O logo on the COIMBRA word just placed without any care? And what abou the C\n\n",

By the way six   \nmonths ago i designed logos for the municipality   \nand trust me...you don't want to get involved   \nwith those people who take decisions.   \nThey have a charisma to manipulate everything   \nin order to end up terrible.   \n   \nGood day to everybody!\n\n"

Anyway its strange the coencidence betten the two samples that you show (very coencidence) . As Christos said the ligature D is lost in that line (ilegible). The tail of the capital (R) is two must decorative if we compare all the logo. Thank's for this samples and observations.   \n   \nCumprimentos\n\n"

The way this stuff works (one hopes) is that people who already have an association of Coimbra/serpent will quickly notice and appreciate the subtle reference.   \n   \nAnd the thing does have a head!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
