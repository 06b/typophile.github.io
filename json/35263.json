By right, I mean the regular and bold are the proper distance in weight from each other on both platforms, and when printed.\n\nI can solve everything except this one thing: is it possible to use one digital outline for the screen, but when it goes to print (a word document), another font is substituted? This is to get around the problem that I can make a regular and bold that work on the Mac, but regular is then too light for Windows, so it gets hinted to be heavier for windows, no problem. But then the printing of regular is too light if I do it thus so we want a bolder regular to be used only for that purpose...\n\nAny route known for this, or should I start mixing some Cool-Aid, just like the big guys do? ;-)\n\n [‹ Double Mapping Greek Glyphs?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153857/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21292 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fontlab - how do you delete a segment between nodes? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153857/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35280 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You need to make the regular light for Mac’s hint-free screen rendering, but then it is too light for printing.\n\nWhat you are doing on the Windows side, using hints to beef-up the type on-screen, is one approach, but it seems to me that if you are contemplating using different outlines for printing you could also use different outlines to address the Windows screen rendering.\n\nBut it seems to me that the Mac screen rendering is the exceptional environment:\n\nMac screen = needs to be lighter  \nMac print = needs to be heavier  \nWin screen = needs to be heavier  \nWin print = needs to be heavier\n\nSo in theory the most efficient approach would be to make the heavier regular outlines the ’default’ and address the Mac screen with exceptional lighter outlines, rather than making the latter the default and then have to jump through hoops on three fronts in order to support the majority need for heavier outlines.\n\nAs I say, this is in theory. The practical question is whether folk at Apple or Microsoft are more interested in the issue.\n\n"
