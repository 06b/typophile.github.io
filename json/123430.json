      "content": "Not the os-itself, it’s some Apple utilities and apps that ship with the machine and/or OS X. Dictionary is just one giving me grief. Similarly botched are a handful of third-party apps I got from the App Store.\n\nI'm not a programmer, but with some research and the little I do know of web-coding has given me a couple insights into my font problem. Of the apps affected, there are two basic categories: those whose fonts CSS controls, and those whose equivilant technology, css or otherwise remains obfuscated in the compiled code of the app itself.\n\nThere are two workarounds one can achieve with these stylesheets to solve the glitch. The first involves editing css file, swapping garamond.ttc and baskerville.ttc (which is gone as well) for the font of your choosing. Make sure to back-ups both before and after files. Good news: you get to further customise your apps. Bad news: running Software Update (Tiger thru Mavericks) or App Store updates (Yosemite) will overwrite said css file. The other work around is to merely consult the stylesheet, to see what you need to rename your with a stylesheet, to verify the file path to these system font suitcases. These are generic, non-commercial versions of these fonts. Before deleted, it appeared in Font Book as simply “Garamond.” The next step is to obtain another free version of the font from one of the million free font sites out there, open the font file in your favourite editor and change the font name info to “Garamond” like it was. Export as truetype (.ttf). Repeat with the italic, bold, and bold italic versions. Finally, compile these as a truetype font suitcase, add the extension .ttc onto the end of the file name, and move into the directory specified in the CSS file.\n\nI haven’t tested it cause, while a sound theory, it doesn’t solve the core issue, like the majority of apps that don’t have a stylesheet ofr reference. Even if you are like me and own several commercial versions of fonts like Garamond, it won’t substitute Garamond Premier Pro (for example)—or any other—when it is looking for something altogether different: another version in another directory, with another filename and type with metadata that won’t match.\n\nIf I weren’t on dial-up in Vermont I would download the installer from the app store. An installation disk wouldn’t help as I don’t have a drive in my Macbook. So PLEASE somebody, upload the TTC files to dropbox or something!\n\n"
