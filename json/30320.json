If you want an exact copy of it, you'll have to use Illustrator or FontLab to trace it, or create a high-res version in Photoshop. You might be able to find some script fonts that are reminiscent of it, though. Off the top of my head, [Whomp](http://web.archive.org/web/20130415164841/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000173) from Sudtipos has a similar feel, although it's a bit quirkier than your logo.\n\n"
