So I dont really know if it's just something that im enjoying because my head is cluttered or if it actually has any charm to it. Feedback would be awesome! thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Bully (font).jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052120/http:/typophile.com/files/Bully%20(font).jpg) | 191.78 KB |\n\n",

Essentially every charecter has an alternate that fits under the r or t charecter, just those alternates are pretty much the origional letter form shrunk. I do think you're right though that it would bennefit from more. Maybe I should change those up.\n\n"
