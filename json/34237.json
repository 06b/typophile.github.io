  "content": "Hi!!\n\nI'd like to share with you guys the concept of a new font I'm working on... it's the beginning, but it's right now that most of the decisions should be made.\n\nI expect to design a legible headline font, that could be used also on about 12pts in small passages of text.\n\nIt's supposed to have a mechanical, industrial and geometric look...\n\nI specially would like your opinions on two issues:\n\n- the \"a\" design... there are three (the first one seems the best to me).\n\n- Note that b p d q aren't just mirrored images of one and other. I believe I've got it right, based on the clockwise movement when drawing the letter... even this font concept not having anything to do with calligraphic origins, it looks nice (at least to me).\n\nLet me know what you think...\n\nmany regards from sunny Brazil!\n\nFabio\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [IronThree\\_030607.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417084043/http:/typophile.com/files/IronThree_030607.pdf) | 49.07 KB |\n\n",

Given the overall slant of many elements of the face, I wonder if a more Jensonian e with a slant might not look better.\n\nI look forward to seeing more as the face develops.\n\n"

What you did with \"e\" is great.\n\nI like the first \"a\" but the second one looks more part of the font.\n\nThe new \"i\" and \"l\" are great but be careful about kerning. \"in\" combination needs kerning.\n\nI would change letters:\n\n- g - I'd change the descender because it looks distracting to me\n- c - I would close the aperture a bit because it looks wide open\n\nOtherwise. Great font. Looks like some FF font. Very sleek and modern. I can see it used for various different applications. Make shure you make other weights too.\n\n"

      "content": "This has promise. Good luck with it!\n\nOne comment: because of the points on the H, it should come up higher to look even with the O--maybe as high as the O or higher. Test it out and you will see what works best, but I bet it will be different than it would be with a flat H. Similarly try out varying the stem of the n, i etc. compared to the arches, the o, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you both!\n\nHere we go:\n\nLitera,\n\n\\>I like the first “a” but the second one looks more part of the font.  \nYes, but I think that's because it's too similar to forms used in bpdq, and that lowers the legibily of the a as it lowers differentiation.  \nI guess I'll have both designed, and add the second a in the opentype stylist alternate feature.\n\n\\>The new “i” and “l” are great but be careful about kerning.  \nYes, but I'll worry about kerning only in the last stages of development.\n\n\\>Make shure you make other weights too.  \nSure! This is the light weight. I plan to design Light, Regular, Bold and Black, with italic (problably oblique) forms.\n\nWilliam,\n\nVery well noticed. The higher point of the H (with diagonal cut) should equal the overshoot of the O. I've done this on lowercases, but forgot in the uppercase. Thanks for seeing this now and prevent me to design others with wrong proportions.\n\n\\>g - I’d change the descender because it looks distracting to me  \nYes, I'll try a diagonal descender, maybe it suits best.\n\n\\>c - I would close the aperture a bit because it looks wide open  \nI'm sorry but I'll have to disagree on this one. Different from Dax for example, I'd like to make the characters with aprox similar widths. I believe it looks more contemporary (different than classic proportions that has forms like c with almost half of general widths).\n\nAgain, I do appreciate your help.\n\n"

      "content": "Ok. You are right about the \"a\" I started to like it anyway. But to my opinion its eye is leaning a bit left.\n\nAbout the \"c\" letter. I didn't mean to close it to that extent. What distracted me was that its aperture looks wide not even parallel. It looks wide open because the stroke on top has angled ending.\n\nJust my opinion.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Litera,\n\nOkay, I get it now... but still, I believe it's set correctly.  \nThe upper stroke is a little longer to compensate the angle (diagonal), different form the bottom (square). This difference is almost the same as the overshoot between round and square strokes. Here's a close up with guidelines as reference.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417084043im_/http:/typophile.com/files/c_6355.jpg)\n\nthks again ;)\n\n"

      "content": "I think what Litera is talking about is not that the upper stroke is too short (and it may indeed still be a little short visually), but that the arms of the c visually look open beyond the parallel, sort of sprung open. I think that visually to look parallel--and you might want them bent in even more than that--you will have to either bend them in slightly, or flair them slightly, as the flairs on the terminals in Frutiger...\n\n"

And with top arm you should probably bend in only the \"inner line\" of the of it. The one in the aperture.\n\n"
