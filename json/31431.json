While these primarily include typefaces from the Monotype and ITC libraries, a notable addition is a very new Linotype Original: Agilita – a new sans serif family with 32 styles, created by German designer Jürgen Weltin. With over 10,000 fonts now available, Linotype.com has become a larger, more thorough resource. But what if you are looking for just a single face? Fortunately, to coincide with our bigger shop, we’ve also improved the functionality of our search engine considerably. Now finding the right font for your work should be easier than ever before, whether you choose to navigate through all of our new additions or not.\n\n[Read the rest of the Linoletter at Linotype.com!](http://web.archive.org/web/20070223083612/http:/www.linotype.com/38-21412/issue200702.html)\n\nOr, [subscribe to the Linoletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20070223083612/https:/www.linotype.com/newsletter.html), and get the information delivered every month directly to your mailbox.\n\n",
