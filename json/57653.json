Some (all?) of the angled serifs could very well have been done by hand (my apologies if there is a technical terms for such angled serifs).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090507185527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/undra_sample_text_6219.jpg)\n\nTIA\n\n",

In particular the N in your sample has a flat vertex at the basline, not a pointed one.\n\nPenumbra and Columna are flareserif faces, but they also have the pointed N.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

And this is used in the Phil’s Photo book “Homage to the Alphabet” which shows a typeface called Solon Antiqua which happens to have the same A and R, as well as the flat N. This book was published in 1985, and I do not know of a digital version of Solon Antiqua. I think it’s the answer to your font ID.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
