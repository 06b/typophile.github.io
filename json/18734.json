Someone in another thread said it was [Titling Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322030955/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=titling+gothic&image.x=0&image.y=0), which is close, but there are some definite differences, “g” and “Q” being the most obvious. There’s some similarity to Helvetica Neue as well, but it’s not a perfect match either. I’m wondering if they had a custom face done. Thanks for any help.\n\n [‹ (x) Sort of scripty, sort of italic \"Columbia lake\" logo - Book Jacket {Lauri}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322030955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18842 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) God of War - Georgia (customised) {Tom C} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080322030955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18268 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
