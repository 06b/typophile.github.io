I even had a sample page on hand that I could have posted with my question, and I likely spent more time deciding not to post it than I would have spent posting it. In retrospect, I must have reasoned my assumption from the principle: _The object of my immediate concern must necessarily be the center of the universe for everyone_…which is really just too embarrassing to think about.\n\nSheepishly,\n\nTim\n\n"

It looks to me like there is more than one typeface on the title page, and often titling faces are not the same as the text faces used inside the book. Do you have a sample page with text, or were you asking what was on the title page?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
