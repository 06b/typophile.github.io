I'd wondered where he got the Vivian name, since he almost always uses the original name.\n\nPhilippe, from the MyFonts forum, and I are starting to think that Steffmann's fonts are, in fact, mostly made up of preexisting fonts that he made modifications to. By modifications, I mean converting to a Windows format, providing the alternates that were available in the original typeface, or, in many cases, simply filling out the character set. Some appear to be clones of the Solo/Dover fonts. I suspect, but don't know for sure, that some of the blackletter digitizations are from scratch, though.\n\nMost of the originals for fonts he simply modified are no longer around (unless they're in the Opti dungeons of Castcraft). I wouldn't be surprised if his Vivian was released during the time that Fontbank was defunct and its fonts (which aren't entirely original in themselves) were gone from the scene - before Xara claimed to have obtained the rights to market them again.\n\n"
