  "content": "Hi all,\n\nBased on [typecooker dot com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714031226/http:/www.typecooker.com/) method, I am trying to design a font the works with russian according to the following parameters:\n\nwidth: normal  \nweight: black  \nconstruction: roman  \nstroke endings: sans serif  \nascender: much shorter than x-height  \ndescender: much shorter than x-height  \ncontrast type: broad nib  \ncontrast amount: a lot of contrast  \nstems: straight  \nintended application: multi-purpose  \nintended size: use very small\n\nAs I am not a user of the cyrillic alphabet, I would like if anyone who knows it could clarify 2 doubts:\n\n**A)** The word \"Булак\" is clear?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714031226im_/http:/typophile.com/files/komsomol_4169.gif)\n\n**B)** For the entire font to serve its purpose correctly in Russian, do I have to design the 60 glyps that form the Basic Russian alphabet only? Are there any other glyps I will have to design?\n\nAll your news comments and corrections will be very helpful. Thanks for your help!\n\n—  \nCarlos Fabián Camargo G.\n\n",

      "content": "Steve, he must mean that the ascenders _from the x-line to the top_ are much shorter than the x-height.\n\n- In the Б the curvature of the bowl clashes with the bottom of the stem.  \n- For Cyrillic especially, this seems a bit narrow to be \"width: normal\".  \n- Why have a trap in the у but not the к?  \n- The к is out of character. Try curving an arm and/or a leg. Especially since you're dealing with Cyrillic.  \n- You've nicely sketched the inside counters, but the interletter space is just as important.  \n- The inside of the descender of the у is malformed.  \n- \"a lot of contrast\" and \"use very small\" don't mix.  \n- What does \"multi-purpose\" mean?  \n- No spacing requirements?\n\nBTW, in my book that TypeCooker is half-baked.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Carlos,\n\nThe “Б” could be understood in Russian as the “Ñ” using acute instead of tilde in Spanish, but its hook shape is still not working well. Try making the joining of the arm more angled or designing first the “Г”.\n\nRussian alphabet has 33 letters, that’s 66 glyphs (uppercase + lowercase) if you just need to work in Russian. Here you have the Russian alphabet:\n\nА Б В Г Д Е Ё Ж З И Й К Л М Н О П Р С Т У Ф Х Ц Ч Ш Щ Ъ Ы Ь Э Ю Я  \na б в г д е ё ж з и й к л м н о п р с т у ф х ц ч ш щ ъ ы ь э ю я\n\nI also suggest using the tail of “л” in “к” letter.\n\nBTW, for some Cyrillic inspiration visit [Daily Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714031226/http:/www.dailytype.ru/) and browse the archive\n\nKeep it going\n\n"

But what I am trying to design is that the font: in small/big reproduction sizes (headlines, captions and shorts body text) higher performance under adverse printing conditions (fax, fotocopy, etc).\n\nHere’s another exercise **“Булак”(black, bold and regular)**. All your critique will be welcome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714031226im_/http:/typophile.com/files/komsomol_15feb08_6038.gif)\n\n—  \nCarlos Fabián Camargo G.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm liking the new one! The dark weight especially. The lighter weights need to get progressively narrower, and looser spaced. If you want to make all the weights uniwidth\\* you can, but: the lighter weights still need more interletter space; you will find that the character of the font will change due to a large divergence in apparent width (as is happening now) - typically you can only apply uniwidth between two relatively close weights without seriously affecting the character.\n\n\\* Meaning that a given character has the same set width in all the weights (something I've done in Patria's two middle weights). The advantage is that the user can mix up and change his mind about the weights (let's say in which to use for emphasis) without affecting linebreaks etc.\n\nAlso, looking at the dark weight:  \n- I wouldn't taper the bottom of the counter of the \"у\".  \n- Since this is supposed to be usable small, the top of the к needs to be more open; you might have to make the whole thing wider.  \n- Also stemming from the intended small usage: the counter of the \"а\" should be larger; although here it looks like you have room without making the glyph wider.  \n- Try to standardize (maybe into two angles if not one) the shears, here at the tips of \"у\", \"л\" and \"а\"; I like the one in the \"у\".  \n- What bothers me most is the messy conjunction between the counters and bottoms of \"Б\" and \"а\"; what I might try to do is continue the arc from the bottom into the corner of the counter (I'm not sure that's clear).\n\nhhp\n\n"
