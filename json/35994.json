  "content": "I'm going to open a can-o-worms here. I think the letter 'g' is one of the few characters that really stand out in a type face. There are a multitude of ways it can be crafted. With so many fonts out there, I look at a few letters -- the lowercase g in particular.\n\nThis is how I propose the thread will work. I'm not here to militarize things... just some friend standardization.  \n1. Go to a font site (I prefer [http://www.fontshop.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043040/http:/www.fontshop.com/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/\") because you can link to samples)  \n2. Find your font  \n3. Post a link to it (if possible to the sample) along with the font name.\n\nFor example:\n\nNatalie Script OT  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/paratype/natali\\_script\\_ot/?sampl...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043040/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/paratype/natali_script_ot/?sample_text=Gg&sample_size=36 \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/paratype/natali\\_script\\_ot/?sample\\_text=Gg&sample\\_size=36\")\n\nYou can also post an image. Let's see your G-sus.\n\n",

I have a set of Zapfino and keep going through the alternates when typesetting.\n\n@Bald: I agree, the Trebuchet g is quite basic. I think the more a font is used, the more it gets abused. The more it gets abused, the more you want it disposed.
