Unfortunately, despite some early high hopes, it doesn't look like that market is going to amount to a hill of beans.\n\nThe more adventuresome among you may find [Maxim Shemanarev's notes](http://web.archive.org/web/20100521161650/http:/www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/index.html) on font rendering of interest. There are numerous methodological and other problems with his comparisons, but I'm glad that there are people out there who care about getting it right and are paying attention. I'll probably write an extended blog about all this, but am characteristically short on time right now.\n\n"
