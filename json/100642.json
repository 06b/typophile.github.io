  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nToday I finished filling all the glyph slots for the MacOS Roman codepage, I have other glyphs as well for Central European languages, mostly compound ones, but that is irrelevant to the nature of my post.\n\nI'm a little lost of what to do next and I need some advice. I have read somewhere that once you are finished with a basic codepage set of characters in a particular weight you should move to developing another weight (for example black) disregarding kerning at his moment. I have also read that you should begin developing alternate characters like small caps, inferiors, superiors and so on. I have also read you should begin kerning and make the font ready to use asap.\n\nSo, i don't really know what of those three options I should follow. Of course I'd like to kern and make my type usable fast, but if that means that I'm gonna waste time at a later stage, better do something else.\n\nIf you guys don't mind telling, what is the usual developing process you usually follow? A little insight into the design methodologies/stages that other typographers use could help me a lot. A little words explaining why you prefer to kern instead of designing the black version, for example, would be useful too.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "When building a family, I usually prefer to finish (almost) the mother font first, before turning to build the other weights. That includes kerning tables, definitely. If you have to kern V-a T-o and so on in Regular, you’ll have to do it as well most likely in Bold or Light. Of course you may choose to ex-/import kerning tables from one file to another; I prefer to settle this in one file first and then just to change glyphs to create another weight. – This may be a matter of personal preference.  \nBut when completing a mother file this always includes the exact definition of the actual character set. Once this has been worked out, my 1st file serves as a template for all the others to come. If you finalize your encoding at a later stage you ’d have to check several files against each other, this may be laborious and error-prone.\n\n"
