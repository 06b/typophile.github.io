And in this case you’re making a logo - which I assume means that you’ll be converting to curves in an app like illustrator - there should be no issue? However, If you are feeling especially worried you could ask the font vendor to sell you a Type 1 version – I’m sure they’d be happy to take your money.\n\n"
