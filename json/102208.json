  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI feel really stupid asking this but… how do you use tabular figures in InDesign and Illustrator for example. I need to do a few tables and the \"Tabular linings\" options in InDesign and Illustrator does nothing. The numbers still aren't lined up properly. The font I'm using is Gotham (Thin, Book, Medium and Bold). The HF&J site said that those weight supports tabular figures. I've installed the OpenType version.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
