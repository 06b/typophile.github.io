      "content": "Well, one could make an argument about Berthold faces, since they operated out of Berlin for 100 years. But they haven't been in the city for a decade and a half, and times and styles change. Berlin is a different place that it was 70 years ago, 17 years ago, or maybe even 7 years ago…\n\nObviously, the FontFont library comes to mind, as FSI is the largest typefoundry working in Berlin. But in addition to those good selections, there are other Berlin typeface designers and foundries, like primetype ( [http://www.prime-type.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307105302/http:/www.prime-type.com/ \"http://www.prime-type.com\")) or Hannes von Döhren, who is young and has quite a lot to offer ( [http://hvdfonts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307105302/http:/hvdfonts.com/ \"http://hvdfonts.com/\")).\n\nMy favorite Berlin designer is probably Verena Gerlach ( [http://www.fraugerlach.de/index.php?cat=3](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307105302/http:/www.fraugerlach.de/index.php?cat=3 \"http://www.fraugerlach.de/index.php?cat=3\")). Note that she also has typefaces in the FontFont library, as well as at primetype. Moreover, together with primetype's Ole Schäfer, she designed the FF City Street Type family that Stephen mentions above.\n\n"
