I’m by far my own worst customer. I cannot find a font that suits me. Here is what I’d like to convey:\n\n-Sophistication  \n-Yet light-hearted and a bit sweet  \n-Simple\n\nI want to be a textile designer so I was thinking that the font probably needs to contrast with the potentially overwhelming designs. It will probably need to be a little bold and really simple.\n\nOne of the main problems is that my name (Mikelle Williams) has so many of the same letters and the “e”s and the “i”s next to the “l”s look weird. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks a million,\n\nMikelle\n\n",

It rules out neutral fonts (Helvetica, Calibri, Minion, Palatino), all sans (Myriad _et al._) and a good deal of serifs (Times, Jenson, all Garamonds). Why not try a few sturdy, bold script fonts? [Brody](http://web.archive.org/web/20090927124454/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/brody/) came to mind, as it has well-defined, thick curves, nice capital ’M’s and ’W’s, and big loopy ’l’s, which are clearly different from the ’i’. I’m just not wild about its ’s’. Perhaps you could change it to a real one, with a huge end flourish.\n\n"
