  "content": "Hi,\n\nA little question about the exact date of creation of Neue Haas Grotesk/Helvetica:\n\nAlan Marshall and Lewis Blackwell both wrote that Max Miedinger designed Helvetica between 1951 and 1953, but this year is the 50th anniversary of the typeface, and indeed every website I look at indicate that it was designed in 1957.\n\nSo, would anybody have the right answer, and a reliable proof of it?\n\nThanks  \nAlice\n\n [‹ digital printer query](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202181952/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36504 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Blog Directory ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202181952/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36422 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
