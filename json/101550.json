Here a link to the website:  \n [http://www.sideshowsignco.com/pages/gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20150226163722/http:/www.sideshowsignco.com/pages/gallery \"http://www.sideshowsignco.com/pages/gallery\")\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I realize that the chances of identifying a script handwriting font are slim to none as it is probably a custom job, but I have searched for days and can't even find something remotely close to at least try and imitate it.\n\nPlease help!\n\n"
