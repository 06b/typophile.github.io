Unless the point is to: provide an extremely generic serif face (some people value genericity), sort of like Kievit does for sans; or simply provide for practice. That said, I do think there is sometimes value in designing a new font that \"distills\" so to speak the essentials of a few dozen existing faces that sort of define a category. But that's **really** hard to pull off - I'd be afraid to try.\n\nBut I don't want to be too negative. Even if I'm right about the stylistic paucity, at the very least we can have some elaboration on: if this should be given more character; how, and how much; what Glyn feels about doing that. This last bit is of course very important, but fonts are for **other people** , so it's not everything.\n\nLooking at it more closely, I would say that if one wanted to make this design more idiosyncratic, some structural strangenesses here and there would be an easy -if I guess superficial- way. But if my doubts are unfounded, let me know and I'll get into the micro stuff. But one micro thing I can't resist pointing out: the top of the bottom bowl of the \"g\" is a superb -and rare- form.\n\nhhp\n\n"

On the surface, it appears pointless to go over the same ground that has been well covered before. However, I think each designer's interpretation of the traditional forms and decorations tends to be different, as long as the designer is not simply doing a revival of a particular typeface.\n\nMy basic idea with Ledbury is to make something functional: easy to read, and suitable for use in many settings. From several comments above, it appears that the design succeeds in the readability department, and I am obviously pleased about that. Beyond readability, I am aiming for something that looks attractive in blocks of text and headings, without being artsy and cute. This means that I need to be careful about stylistic oddities, like the 'g', and the curvy 'k', 'K', and 'R'. I think, though, that I can do more to give the design character, without detracting from its usefulness.\n\nThanks for all the help and encouragement chaps. I will more than likely post some more stuff soon.\n\n"

      "content": "I have been working through some of the changes suggested above. Most of it I agree with. There are a few places where I think I will keep my present letter forms, as a matter of personal taste.\n\nHrant, why do you think the tail of the 'J' is out of character? I have not put a blob on it, because I did not think either 'J' or 'j' actually need blobs, as the termination is in the form of a thick stroke tapered down, like the bottoms of 'c' and 'e'. This taper also fits in fairly well with the slanted stress, I think.\n\nAs an aside, on the subject of blobs, the typical blob on the 'a' is inconsistent with a slanted stress, unless the top stroke is curved down alot towards the end. A blob termination, and curving the top down, both eat into the small top counter. One of my pet hates is an 'a' where the top counter is almost closed off by the blob. Perhaps I could try leaving the blob off altogether, and go for a taper like the bottom of 'c'. The typeface in one of the books I was reading recently had a blobless 'a', and it did not harm readability at all in my opinion.\n\nMy 'S' and 's' are wider than is typical. I think this results from my disliking typefaces with particularly narrow esses. However I will try narrower forms, and see how they look in my text sample.\n\nOn the subject of the bottom bowl of the 'g', Eduardo, there does seem to be a potential problem with the slant causing it to look like it is falling off. However, I am reluctant to change this letter too much, as everyone else seems to like the somewhat unusual shape. From a function point of view, I was trying to avoid trapping a small white space between the two bowls, which I think can create colour problems. My earlier efforts (not presented on this forum) produced grey smudges in the text, which could have been due to that effect.\n\nOn the subject of the little oddities like the 'g', the curved legs of the 'k' came about from solving a colour problem, where the bottom of the 'k' looked to dark. The shape of the 'k' also helps with letter spacing with rounds on the right, I think. The curved legs on the 'K' and 'R' were to harmonise with the 'k'. As with 'k', I think the curved leg of the 'R' also helps with letter spacing. Contrast the effect with an 'R' that has a swash-like tail (curving the other way), which makes spacing really difficult, due to the need for a large negative right sidebearing, which then causes serif collisions. I do not know if all this makes sense. Comments would be welcome.\n\nHrant, I agree that the ear of the 'g' looks a bit weak. This is another problem I have had with the letter. However, I am not sure I want the ear to overshoot the x height much more than it already does. I prefer a 'g' which keeps things simple along the x height, rather than cluttering the reading line with extra blobs or sticky out bits. I will look into the malformation at the bottom, though. I had quite a few problems getting the contrast right in this area, and it still needs work.\n\nAnyway, I am off down the pub now with pencil and paper, to see what I can do to zing up the style a bit.\n\n"

I am thinking of the unkerned straight-round spacings in the words 'WODEHOUSE' and 'Medium', for example. I generally try to space all capitals a bit wider than the small letters. The fact that the capitals have longer serifs than the small letters also motivates some extra spacing to the main stems. Perhaps I have overdone it.\n\n"

Delightful! Also, Economical!\n\nRe: Kerning: your default spacing (sidebearings) of cap straights and rounds should be such that they do not need kerning. It's oddities and difficult overhangs like L, T, A, Y that need kerns. To space a font well leaves very little need for kerning. Bad spacing needs so much remediation by kerning it's not worth the time. Measure twice, cut once.\n\nFor a book typeface, caps will be used mostly in combination with lowercase, so the lowercase spacing is the most crucial. Adapt the cap spacing to work well with lowercase. This will result in all-cap settings that seem distinctly tighter than the lc, but now with OpenType you could offer a feature to letterspace caps. In the case of Ledbury, there does seem to be a bit too much room between the straight-sided caps and lowercase.\n\nfor your intriguing g, consider redistributing some of the weight around the lower bowl. There's a drooping feel, which could be eliminated without losing the nice open notch between bowls. Experiment with less weight on the left of the bowl and a little more on the outside of the link as it turns right. Nice work!\n\n"

That said, please forgive any dropoffs due to the affluence of incohol.\n\nI can see what you mean about the problems with the undecorated terminations of 'J' and 'j'. A bit of extra divergence of forms is going to add to functionality, which is all to the good, I would say. Reading your previous brief comment, I was a bit puzzled, as I thought that you might have been encouraging a more conventional design, which would certainly have been out of character. I will try blobs on the 'j' and 'J', with stronger curves, but I am a bit concerned about descender collisions with 'gj' and 'QJ'. Not very likely. you might think, but my alphabet investigations show that 'gj' is a common digraph in Albanian (one of your other posts put me onto this), and, with capital combinations, one must assume that anything goes, due to acronyms and such.\n\nWith the bit about the blob on the 'a' being inconsistent with the slanted stress, I am coming round to the idea that type letterforms should not neccessarily be dictated by the forms generated by writing. I must admit that I often work out stroke thickness variations by assuming a notional pen, and use a nib-shaped guage on the background to check things. I have tried to avoid doing this in Ledbury, but the habit remains. By the way, my pencil sketches did not succeed in making a good blobless 'a', so the blob stays for now.\n\nRegarding the generous esses: I must admit I am fond of the fulsome shape, but I agree that this should not come at the expense of readability, especially given my stated aims.\n\nMust go now, my dinner is ready.\n\n"

This is precisely the feel I was going for.\n\nI can see your point about about expecting some tightness in all caps if the cap spacing is determined by working as initials for the lower case. I will tighten up the straight sidebearings, as I had thought I should. Opentype cleverness apart, it would seem to be normal practice for typesetters to loosen all cap spacing anyway, so perhaps overtight all caps are not really a problem.\n\nRegarding the weight distribution in the lower bowl of 'g', the weak bit from my point of view is the bottom left, which does not do justice to the top part. With the top part, I was going for a gradual flare out to the right corner, followed by an s-like reduction to minimum width around the bottom right. After that, I must admit I was unsure what should happen next. As I have said before, I think I need to be really careful about knocking this letter into shape, for fear of subduing its character. Much of the conventional nature of Ledbury has, I think, come about from knocking off the rough edges for the sake of functionality.\n\n"

I think I know why this has happened.\n\nAs a self-teaching aid, I have several other fonts on my system open in Fontforge, while I am working on my own. At the moment, I am looking at New Baskerville, Garamond, Aldine721, (all from a Bitstream collection that came with Wordperfect), and Adobe Minion Pro, that came with Acrobat Reader. I then look at things like proportions, stem widths, and decorations, and decide where I want my design to be placed, e.g. darker than this, but not as dark as that, or slightly bigger x height than most, and so on. I also look at the things in other designs I do not like, and try to 'fix' them, or adopt (but not copy) features from other designs that I like. This no doubt has the effect of making my design a sort of average, where I have not been confident enough in my own judgements.\n\nI am hoping that I will get more confidence as I go along, so I can base new work more on my own efforts, rather than always comparing my designs to others.\n\nAnyway, I am wondering what more experienced, and formally qualified, designers think about the benefits and drawbacks of detailed study and criticism of long-standing designs. My own feelings are that this rather old-fashioned learning process helps build technique and judgement, and that self-expression needs to wait on learning the basics, or it will result in naive and primitive work.\n\n"

I suppose I am being a cynical old engineer: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n\nRegarding the spacing of italics: knowing that the different decorations from the roman would affect this on straights, I started with the assumption that at least the round sidebearings would be the same, and tinkered with the serif length until the straight sidebearings looked right relative to this. Ledbury roman has rather short serifs, and I wanted to preserve that idea in the italic. This worked fine at larger sizes, but a 10 point print just looked far too tight. My point about some other italic fonts being loosely spaced was based on Minion Pro Italic, which appears to be much more loosely spaced than the roman. This is not the case with the Bitstream fonts.\n\nOn the colour thing: I have not lightened the italic by much, the main straight stem width is about 95% of the roman. Same goes for the width: it is only a bit narrower in general. I am trying to avoid a thin spidery look here, while providing the expected style contrast.\n\nI have not posted any samples of the italic, as it really is in a state of flux.

There is only two font units difference, but perhaps this being amplified by rounding effects in rendering. The x height is the same, with the same overshoots.\n\nI recall reading somewhere, almost certainly on Typophile, that an optical correction for apparent height is sometimes applied to italics, but I cannot recall the details.\n\nI will be in a position to do a sample with in line italics shortly, after I have done the leftward offset of the italics. This sample should show if there are any real problems.\n\n"

      "content": "Here is an update, showing italics in line with roman. Regarding the apparent ascender or x height mismatch, I found small error in the ascender serif slope, which might make the ascenders look short. Also, the hinting error I mentioned earlier might possibly have expanded the x height, by affecting the rendering of baseline overshoots in a different way to the roman.\n\nThe italic offset has been set roughly according to the guidelines suggested by Mark Simonson and Thomas Phinney in reply to a question I posted in Build. I have set the alignment point at about 55% of the x height. This was just a convenient number for the purpose of quickly updating all the glyphs and construction guides.\n\n"

      "content": "This is admirably successful: very ugly and very readable.  \nHead and bottom serifs on b,i,u etc in the roman lowercase are too concave. Reducing bracketing on the serifs such that brackets do not reach the ends of the serifs would give the face a touch of severe elegance. Think how x might be improved, for instance.\n\na: consider lowering the upper part of the bowl, at the join especially, such that it is possible to give more definition to the ball-terminal without diminishing the optical size of the aperture.  \ne: reduce counter by thickening at top left.  \nf, t: thicken bars.  \ng: too beautiful for the rest of the face. Or consider altering bdpq to fit g (and also to fit O and Q). That is the route I should prefer.  \no: too light.  \ns: too broad, and the serifs are lifeless.  \ny: Lighten crotch.  \nz: serifs are lifeless.\n\nAll your thins in the Roman caps need thickening, as it is, they cause slight refocussing in reading to accomodate their greater dazzle (with plain letterforms, colour must be very carefully standardised). Lighter brackets would also especially benefit the caps.  \nB: Pull the upper bowl inwards and/or reproportion to reduce the relative size of the upper bowl. Consider shaping the central join by having it curve with the lower bowl.  \nM: drop or otherwise darken the central meeting point.  \nS has the same problems which s does, and consider leaning it rightwards minimally.  \nO and Q: too beautiful for the rest of the face, unless the rest of the face is changed instead.\n\nItalic:  \nb: darken bottom of stem.  \nk, z: thins are too thin.  \np, q: consider regularising the descenders' serifs to horizantals, each a little longer under the bowl.\n\nHope this helps,  \nGeorge\n\n"
