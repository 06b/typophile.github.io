  "content": "I was just wondering if it would be at all possible to get an education in typography, at say Reading, without having a prior background (in my case and undergraduate degree) in graphic design.\n\nThe college I want to go to (N.C. State) has a wonderful Graphic Design program, which includes Typography courses, but I fear that it is too late for me to create a portfolio. So instead, I was planning to major in Communications instead.\n\n",
