  "content": "I'm setting a short story in n!samual (my own nontraditional book face) and part of the story is in the form of emailed correspondence. I don't want to use courier, Helvetica, or Arial. I'm hesitant to use Lucida sans, and American Typewriter is over used. I'm leaning towards either Avenir 35 or 45, but was hoping for alternative suggestions. The reader needs to feel that this is something they could reasonably expect to read on screen, but they'll be reading it in print.
