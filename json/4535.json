Rush job- 9 days. 8 pages. Identity, in-house photography, print collateral, print management. This client rules- paying fair rates, good communication and creative freedom. Wish there had been more time. Things can be less than perfect doing 18-28hr. work sessions, with 2-4 hour naps   \ninbetween. Thank Buddha for espresso.

I do, however, like the overlay to highlight the product in her ear.   \n   \nMaybe do some subdued texturing in a bar behind the \"Tribal Jewelry Catalog...\" tagline to enhance visibility. And perhaps move the navigation on the web interface to the right of the logo to enlarge the active user pane for better usability.   \n   \nOtherwise, everything is great� especially your custom typeface.\n\n"
