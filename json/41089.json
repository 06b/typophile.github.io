Here are examples of the two typefaces:> [http://shurl.org/nutrition-facts-helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111121251/http:/shurl.org/nutrition-facts-helvetica \"http://shurl.org/nutrition-facts-helvetica\")> [http://shurl.org/nutrition-facts-arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111121251/http:/shurl.org/nutrition-facts-arial \"http://shurl.org/nutrition-facts-arial\")> I'm a professional typographer and I'm happy to typeset new example images for your page if you wish.\n"
