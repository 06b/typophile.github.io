  "content": "This is my first post on Typophile, so i’m not sure whether this is best placed as a Forum Topic or Blog for help, but here goes: I have been asked to create a folded leaflet for NHS Employability. It will be a 6 page DL (flat size A4 - folded twice to DL).\n\nI have created 3 colums with 4mm gutters. Type will be Frutiger - 14pt for headings and 11pt for body copy - there is a 2pt leading for the body copy and all text is aligned to the baseline grid.\n\nI was wondering if these measurements would be suitable for a leaflet like this - as it is the first time I have used InDesign and the first time I have created something for print. If anyone could offer any advice with the measurements or suggest alternative fonts to have the best impact in this medium, I would be extremely grateful.\n\n",

At the moment, the only 'visual' I have is two pieces of paper with the text typed and pictures stuck to the paper - supplied by the department requesting the leaflet.\n\nMy job is to create something more professional from this. As I am new to InDesign (i'm a web designer and this is my first print job).\n\nMy apologies for dropping this on people here. I have spent all day reading different ideas of what is the best grids, baseline and leading points for print work of this size. All seem to suggest different, so I guess I will just go with one. There seems to be a lack of decent InDesign tutorials on the internet.\n\n"

      "content": "There are two ways to approach it. If you are just starting out, the look of a virginal empty page could be a little intimidating (heck, it still gives me the shivers) and starting a layout with predetermine grid settings might help you out to overcome that, or it might drive you deeper into a corner and inhibit imagination. Another way, is to sketch the initial layout, get your copy onto the page, then play with it for a little while on a purely aesthetic level, before setting for a particular grid system. Once you get a little more experience, you'll begin relying more on particular combination that you've found to work well, but in order to get there, it might help to start by working \"organically\".\n\nJust my two cents.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nPersonal Art and Design Portal of Ivan Gulkov  \n [www.ivangdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019012808/http:/www.ivangdesign.com/ \"www.ivangdesign.com\")\n\n"

Then I went into pro illustration and visualising, doing design jobs on the side (paste up, anyone remember that?)  \nNext I discovered the Mac (somewhere in the later part of last century), taught myself QuarkXPress. Did Graphic Design. With Quark for 14 years. Switched to InDesign when OS X became ‘it’. Worked with ID for the last 6 or 7 years and now you want me to tell you how to do the MOST SIMPLE JOB THERE IS?\n\nLearn! Experience! Teach yourself! The Internet is there to help you, giving you the opportunity to look at a lot of stuff. And ID has a very good Help-function.\n\n(Sorry if this is rant-ish — young people are so… depending… kind of… What about being self-sufficient?)\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

For me it stems from the anxiety of being new to something rather than being young — There are 14 year old web/interactive designers who would run rings around many of us.\n\nIs that all fair?\n\n@ AS — I'm not sure why pricing was mentioned, I'd never advocate selling yourself short, just know when to be charitable :-)\n\n@ Bert/AS/anybody — I'm not trying to pick a fight!\n\n@ Fredrik — I don't know if you are 'young'. I like the fact you can admit to struggling though.\n\n@ Hanabi — How are you getting on?\n\n"
