  "content": "Hello,\n\nDoes anyone know what I have done wrong when the preview of the font doesnt show up in Word font menues?\n\nThe name is there and everything works fine with the font, but in the font menu the name of the font is written with Arial (or something else).  \nIt is an OpenType PS font that is generated exactly the same as other fonts that Do have previews. The origin has been a Postscript font that I no have convertet into OpenType PS-format.\n\nThanks\n\n/ G\n\n [‹ Editing Glyphs in FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011013321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45914 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Disable PDF Stripping ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011013321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45845 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

To prevent illegible font names for symbol fonts, it uses Arial (or something else) — check “Symbol”, “WingDings” etc., these should display the same.\n\nIf all you did was convert the font, its encoding probably _was_ SymbolEncoding or some custom job. Consult your convert tools to change it.\n\n"
