In this genre I also like to suggest Ole Søndergaard and Morten Rostgaard Olsens nice, simple and quite new font [Palina](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608103004/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontpartners/fp_palina/)...\n\n"

Apparently it is really called [**Outland**](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608103004/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/outland.htm)... or maybe that is just a cheaper version of it... Can’t tell. Pretty similar to the font used for Solaris above.\n\n"
