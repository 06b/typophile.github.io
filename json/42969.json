      "content": "Looks good to me, but can I suggest abandoning the “kerning” idea and just judging letter spacing with the ideal of seeing it as even as possible. To that end you can use the old “Hand Letterer” trick of putting a piece of vellum over the type and penciling in the spaces between the letters. Relative weight can be better judged with a positive image, or so goes the old theory. Letterers did pen and ink headlines before Headliners or such. They worked for Ad Agencies etc. I fear a lot of their knowledge and tricks has been lost.\n\nThe second “s“ in Chess may look like it is wondering off a little.\n\n"
