      "content": "It doesn't sound like you have a lot of time for edits, but here's some comments�since you asked:   \n   \nI don't like the ampersand in 1a and 1b. It's too narrow�to the point where it looks smashed/sandwiched. The 1c ampersand is beginning to work because it looks like a growing vine. That vine concept works well, but the existing ampersand seems a little light, relative to the logotype. Also, 1c has some tension between the ampersand and the house graphic. In this version, you might need to lower the home graphic a bit.   \n   \nYou have a lot to say, so this is a very busy logo. For that reason, I'd lose the sunny \"O\" in EXPO. In addition, the sun appearing below the house defies logic. If it's not required, I'd lose the chisel in the \"X\" also.   \n   \nIf you're interested in my take, read on:   \n   \n1 Add some weight to the ampersand   \n2 Lower the house graphic or nudge it to the right, or both. Whatever makes the space feel right.   \n3 Move EXPO a little to the right (maybe even allowing the bottom point of the house graphic to replace the chisel in the \"X\").   \n4 Reposition \"Northwest Valley Better Living\" as a single line to pull the eye back to the left, so the logo isn't completely going downhill. If the logo is always positioned on the top left of layouts, then the downhill is fine, but if it is bottom right, it leads you right off the page.   \n   \nGood luck with the quick turnaround!   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"
