I have found it very useful over the years.\n\nYou could also try something with a slab serif, like [Geometric Slab 703](http://web.archive.org/web/20090614065601/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-slabserif-703/%E2%80%9D)\n\n[Chalet](http://web.archive.org/web/20090614065601/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/collections/chalet%E2%80%9D) from House Industries has a retro-modern feel to it.\n\n"
