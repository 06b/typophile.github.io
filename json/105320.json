  "content": "Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone has anything to say about the choice of typeface for the street signs in San Luis Obispo, California. I don't get it, I'm trying to find out the reason behind this choice but no luck so far. I would really appreciate if someone could give me information on that. I will be living in this (very beautiful) town for the next 10 months and at some point I would like to be able to sleep in peace. Thank you!\n\n",

      "content": "I lived in SLO when they put up those signs. It was my impression that it was judged a lovely looking typeface (and, I suppose that it is a reasonable display typeface) that evokes the historical significance of Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa. The city apparently didn't put any thought into actual readability concerns (particularly while driving). The end result is... regrettable.\n\n"
