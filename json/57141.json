  "content": "Has anyone else noticed the beautiful blackletter typeface that is used in the New York Times Style Magazine? It is the best blackletter typeface I've come across in a long time but I can't figure out what the name of it is, if its for sale, or if it was created specifically for the magazine. The only things I've uncovered is that the T logo itself was designed by Matthew Carter. I thought that maybe Carter designed the accompanying blackletter typeface as well but I've not been able to track it down. I have actually e-mailed the New York Times asking about the name of the typeface, but of course they haven't answered back. Any clues, suggestions, answers would be helpful. Thanks.\n\n-Mariel\n\nLink to T Magazine: [http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2009/04/19/style/t/index.html#pageName=homem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140448/http:/www.nytimes.com/indexes/2009/04/19/style/t/index.html#pageName=homem)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140448/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_241.png) | 12.46 KB |\n\n",
