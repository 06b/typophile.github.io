      "content": "The best match I've found by far for the lighter heading is Neue Fraktur in Typoasis' [Blackletter Revival](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725014230/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm). It even contains very similar didone-style numerals. The download contains two files, Neue Fraktur & Neue Fraktur Extra Bold. The latter is too heavy, but perhaps manually bolding the regular weight would work.\n\nThis collection was lovingly digitized by Manfred Klein and cybapee (Petra Heidorn) almost a decade ago and offered via Petra's Typoasis website. The internal copyright of these fonts state, \"Johannes Wagner, Hausschnitt\" with the Extra Bold adding a date of 1927.\n\nYou won't find cybapee or Manfred's names in the copyright of most of this collection. Having been in contact with Petra Heidorn several times back then, I know that she valued privacy rather than accolades, offered all her fonts for free and both of them wanted to credit the original designers. Unfortunately, that has a negative consequence since, years later, you only have the word of a guy like me to assure you that the font is legitimate and not a clone of someone else's font. In fact, back when these were made, several were the very first digitizations of some of these blackletters.\n\n"

As for the use of the right Fraktur, for better or worse most people today can not read Fraktur capitals with any ease and they tell the swirly ones apart mainly from context. The exception may be mathematicians who use very standardized versions of the capitals as math symbols. But for other readers the mix and match choices offered by Mike and myself should work fine.  \nDon\n\n"
