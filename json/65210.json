I'm very excited to finally have this URL and have updated my website to be integrated with wordpress. This will mean more content, searchability, and timely updates.\n\nI'd also like to announce my new typeface, Hessian. Inspired by motorcycle culture, the circus, heavy metal, and old tuscan wood type, Hessian will rock you.\n\nAvailable now at [Myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091847/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/hessian) and [YouWorkForThem](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091847/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0419)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091847im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hessian_01_4148.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091847im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hessian_02_4024.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017091847im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hessian_03_6106.jpg)\n\n",
