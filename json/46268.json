      "content": "Thanks Bert.\n\niKern is (still) a service. It can't be purchased or licensed. The font files are reworked by Igino and then send back. It's not just a push on a button, because many variables are possible. We did some test runs to determin spacing (family wide) and the level (tight \\<-\\> loose) of kerning. In the process of the test runs I adjusted character shapes that needed a better fit. In the final release I adjusted a (very few) things manually. iKern makes it own classes for kerning and is extremely flexible. All still (fortunately) has to be judged by the human eye, but when decisions are made, all that is handled by iKern is in optical consistency truly great. For me it was a real time saver. It nearly felt that I only had to draw the glyphs ;-)\n\n"

As a freefont it was my second most popular font with about 10,000 downloads a month and I've seen it used in quite a variety of designs. I hope that with the extension of the family this will continue. I have plans to update the family with a (free) bold italic and maybe with small caps for all weights/styles.\n\n"

That's a real compliment!\n\nHow succesfull it will be has to be seen :-) I've timed the release and publicity around it so that I could reach #1 on the Starlets list in order to get mentioned in the [Rising Stars July 2008 newsletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015170911/http:/www.myfonts.com/newsletters/rs/200807.html). Of course I hope it will hit #1 on the Bestsellers list, but the sales boost from Rising Stars that brought it on second place is allready over. It is going steady now and I hope it will hover somewhere next to [Museo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015170911/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html) in a while.\n\n"
