  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nMy name is Dan, and I am trying to ID some fonts and symbols from a movie prop. I have reliabe information that the prop maker used Letraset fonts and symbols. I’ve attached an image of the symbol. It appears to be a “D” and a “V” with the “D” rotated 90 degrees clockwise with a colon off to the right.\n\nI thought the letters might be Impact or Haettenschweiler, but they are not quite right.  \nI appreciate any help!\n\nFYI- The time period would have been between 1978-1980. I also have a couple other symbols I’d like to identify, Letraset again, but I don’t know what kind of reception my intial inquiry will get. If there are any vintage Letraset typophiles out there, I could use your help!\n\nThanks again!\n\n-Dan\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dv.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=dv.jpg) | 5.71 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Dan I think a number of us still have Letraset catalogues that date from that time… but mine’s currently buried in a packing crate! Last time I saw a Letraset catalogue for sale it was $2 - invaluable!  \nTo hazard a guess I think these characters might come from the old Helvetica Condensed Black (not the NeueHelvetica) or possibly one of the Condensed Grotesques (Monotype? Stephenson Blake?) that Letraset had licensed. Looks like there’s a slight fattening in the strokes.\n\n"

Sorry for the newbish questions; I’m a web-guy and get quite lost outside of pixels.\n\nBesides Ebay, are there any other places to pick up one of those old Letraset catalogs? If anyone has an extra one, I’d be interested in buying it.\n\n"

      "content": "The trouble with old Letraset is that it dries out and is very difficult to apply you might be better served by scanning a rubbed down letter (as greyscale, so final size is about 1200 dpi) and manipulating them in Photoshop to get the size and position. I expect most Letraset catalogues got thrown out in the 80s with the rubylith and snopaque, so finding one could be tricky.  \nTim\n\n"
