Some say there PC only and vice versa.\n\nThanks to anyone how can help.\n\n",

But I am relatively sure, that there also is a font folder on the Mac, that belongs to the Illustrator directory, where you can put in PC Type1 fonts. (Search for fonts in the Adobe directories to locate font folders, if nobody else replies, that can specify the path.) I donâ€™t know, if there is a free Mac tool for font conversions. Except from the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO), with the help of which you can build OpenType fonts.\n\n"
