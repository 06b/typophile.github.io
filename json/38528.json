ANYONE AMONG YOU EVER HEARD OF LOMOGRAPHY?\n\nI WANT TO ASSOCIATE TYPOGRAPHY WITH LOMOGRAPHY IN A WAY BECAUSE I DO FEEL THAT IN TYPOGRAPHY, WE ALL HAVE THE FREEDOM AND NOTHING LIMITS US. (THOUGH THERE ARE PROBABLY RULES OR GUIDELINES IN TYPOGRAPHY SUCH AS KERNING, SPACING ETC..) BUT THE ALL IMPORTANT THING AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PASS OUR MESSAGE ACROSS AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE FIND OURSELVES LIMITLESS IN WHAT WE CAN DO.\n\nAND OH BY THE WAY, KNOW MORE ABOUT LOMOGRAPHY PHOTOGRAPHY HERE: [WWW.LOMOGRAPHY.COM](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416175712/http:/www.lomography.com/ \"WWW.LOMOGRAPHY.COM\")\n\n",
