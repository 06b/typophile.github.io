      "content": "I have just searched all of Dafont and most of MyFonts blackletter fonts, and I think this is custom drawn. The tails on the n's are not really in blackletter style, I think, and so I guess they were added. The other lettering seems a bit simplified, probably for legibility, but maybe from lack of lettering skill. I noted a few fonts that could be close enough to be starting points to re-create this: [Wittenberger Fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055426/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/wittenberger-fraktur-mt/?refby=bowfin), [Royal Bavarian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055426/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/royal-bavarian/?refby=bowfin), and [Carol](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723055426/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/classic/carol/?refby=bowfin).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
