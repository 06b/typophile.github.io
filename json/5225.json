Bravo.   \n   \nAs a long time fanatic of Polaroid technology and someone who enjoyed Peter Wensberg's book _[Land's Polaroid](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019080553/http:/www.biblio.com/books/10018798.html)_ and then dearly ached for ever more information about the company, your blog is a great find.   \n   \nThank you.\n\n"
