But, it was specifically designed to feel like a sans serif, yet hold it’s crispness at small sizes. This is the reason there was no lowercase... The metal simply would not have held the small shapes. This explains it’s very wide with very fine serifs.\n\n“It does what it was designed to do very well. It was never intended to be a display face. (Same with Bank Gothic and Bell Gothic!) Fred Goudy must roll over in his pantheonic grave when Copperplate ships on hard drives everywhere.\n\n“With this context I actually think it’s a bit of genius. Makes me want to take a second look at the Goudy stuff I usually pass over.\n\n"

Yes, I highly enjoy their brutal critiques of everything design, but sometimes they are rife with inconsiderate anarchism and lack of appreciation for the past (which are not present in this article, by the way.)\n\nHowever, they are a good reading if the client just rejected your third comp and you want to get back at the world in a witty, intelligent manner ;-)\n\n"
