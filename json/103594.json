  "content": "So I made good on my threat in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133724/http:/typophile.com/node/103299) to build a font on the basis of some nice lettering from the 60ies I found on a residential building in Berlin... I've got a pretty complete set of paths now, whose look in the Glyphs editor I rather like.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133724im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blumenkind_3944.png)\n\nProblem is, I need to stroke those paths to make a usable font. I'm not happy with the path expansion tool in Glyphs (it doesn't support rounded end caps and does unsightly things to sharp turns), so I've tried exporting an OTF from Glyphs to FontForge and doing it there. The workflow is pretty atrocious, crash-ridden (on the side of FontForge) and doesn't work well for very thin weights, so I'm very much hoping to find a better solution.\n\nDoes anyone know of a really good path stroking tool? Preferably free to use, though if you have a paid license, I might be interested to hire your services for a free license of the final font...\n\nHere's what it looks like when I stroke the font at 25/20 units with a 40° angle in FontForge. Not too bad, though as I said things break down at very light weights.\n\n",

      "content": "As far as expanded path fonts go, this has some potential. The terminals need a bit of tinkering to look more natural. If you're set on going down the expanded path route, I'd suggest only using this model for the lightest weight. Add some contrast in unexpected places (maybe thicker in curves, where the pen would slow down) and I think you'll have something interesting. It reminds me of fifties lettering on space themed adverts, and weird contrast seemed to be all the rage then.\n\n"

I put up a provisional Behance page for illustration:\n\n[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Blumenkind-a-bright-utopian-script-font/1...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133724/http:/www.behance.net/gallery/Blumenkind-a-bright-utopian-script-font/10159067 \"http://www.behance.net/gallery/Blumenkind-a-bright-utopian-script-font/10159067\")\n\nAnd here are two of the posters for the click-lazy among you. ;o)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133724im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bposter01_cut_5924.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133724im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bposter03b_cut_4081.png)\n\nAs you can see, I went with a monolinear approach for the default cuts — it seems to work well enough for Rolling Pen after all... also, it makes the round stroke terminals look natural. I also made a heavily contrasted \"calligraphic\" cut with diagonal stress. I found sharp cutoffs at the stroke ends look the most natural there.\n\nI'm thinking of releasing Blumenkind in the next few days. Any last-minute thoughts?\n\n@ Dave: Adding stress in unexpected places sounds like fun, but also like more work than I was planning to put into Blumenkind. Perhaps an idea for a \"Blumenkind Pro\" further down the road...?\n\n"

The {ü} was one of the letters I found most inspiring about the source, though. I agree the overlapping forms are quite unconventional, and I could make Blumenkind more widely usable with more conventional diacritics. I might just make an alternate cut of the font for that, then. Good idea!\n\nYes, the {UuVv} look too much alike for my taste, but I haven't found a satisfying way of resolving the issue. I certainly want to keep the current shape of {Uu}, which I find very attractive and in line with the font's design philosophy. That doesn't leave much space for {Vv} to be different, though. I don't suppose two crossed slashes would work... Then again, the {UuVv} distinction is probably not very crucial to readability in most languages, is it?\n\nI've given the inverted {G} a couple of tries on paper, and I don't like it much — it looks top-heavy and menacing. One reason why Blumenkind looks so friendly is its teddybear-like cuddly and bottom-heavy shapes. The current design of {G} also allows its bottom terminal to angle inwards with a minimum of tension on the bottom corner, which I like.\n\n"

I can see some of the quirky appeal you're talking about but I also find them confusing and distracting.\n\nOn the /U/u/, if you don't want a downward stem on the right (and I can see why you don't) just de-pointify the bottoms as much as you can without losing the triangular character.\n\n"

It seemed to lose all the springy tension that characterizes the font. I guess I'll just keep it the way it is.\n\nI'm putting it on the test server now. If there are no glitches it should be out within a week or so.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
