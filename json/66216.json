So you could set 8 Latin-script  \nlanguages with it. :-) The only missing piece would be the Cyrillic.\n\n\\* You could set the Regular large and the  \nBold small to end up with a visual balance.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Below is the image I've made.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819231253im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ambi_3454.jpg)\n\nThe other one is to use only text in 'interesting' way. Maybe it can be done with only one font (using different styles, like Hrant suggests, for the different 'voices'), or can be done with totally different fonts, one for each language.\n\nAnd to add another problem the arabic text can't be set in indesign. For that reason I think is better a font with the cyrillic than a font with the arabic language. What do you think of Gentium? (money is another problem)\n\nI don't think my client want to split it in more than one poster.\n\n"
