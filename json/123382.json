      "content": "AFAIK this is not a retail font.  \nIt could be a modern hybrid of styles produced for Cranes.  \nThe base letters are in a style developed in the early 19th century, which is known as \"Tuscan\" and is characterized by the fishtail terminals.  \nThe clean line rationalist structure and minimalist flower ornamentation reminds me of some 18th century initials.  \nIf you only need the letters \\_L\\_, \\_C\\_ and \\_I\\_ your best solution might be to have them scanned to make vector outlines for your laser cutter.  \nNeedless to say, I could be wrong and someone has made this into a font. All I can say is that I have not seen anything like it in the sources, both printed and online, that I usually check.  \nDon\n\n"

Anyway, to me, the base looks like some sort of refined [Figgins Tuscan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/figgins-tuscan) or [Bujardet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415043812/http:/www.fontmenu.com/site/_Bujardet.html).
