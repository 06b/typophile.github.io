A multidisciplinary approach to graphic trace making”** to be held at the University of Southern Denmark, Odense, on November 19th to 21st 2014, in the hope that you would like to attend.\n\nThe symposium has a multidisciplinary agenda, seeking to place the study of graphic traces close to the core of contemporary humanities, and to link it to studies of communication, culture and cognition. More specifically, it aims to study (i) the processes of making and perceiving graphic traces, (ii) the graphic traces themselves (as texts) and (iii) the relationship between articulatory dynamics, gesture and traces. It brings together scientists, scholars and practitioners from a number of fields, including social anthropology, social semiotics, eco-social semiotics, cognitive neuroscience, typography and calligraphy, in a shared effort to understand the profound impact graphic traces have on large-scale human cultural patterns as well as on individual scale cognition.\n\nPlease visit the [symposium’s website](http://web.archive.org/web/20140717050622/http:/www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/C_CMC/Forskning/Symp_MakingTraces) for further information and registration. Please feel free to forward this information to anyone you think might be interested. We hope to welcome you in Odense, Denmark, in November.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n",
