  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m currently building a website for myself in HTML and wanted to include a .swf file in it. Its a 220x100px, 12k file, basically a logo that slowly changes colour. Thing is, when previewing the site the .swf loads just late enough to show a white background (site has black background) for a split second before loading and running normally.\n\nIs there anyway around this without resorting to a preloader in the beginning?\n\nHope this wasn’t too unclear. Thanks.\n\n [‹ Corporate Identity and Magazine Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111140824/http:/typophile.com/node/40720 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Bullets, Outlined Lists and Indenture - Rule of Thumb ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111140824/http:/typophile.com/node/40697 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I insert the SWF using Dreamweaver/Insert/Media/Flash and get the following code:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111140824im_/http:/typophile.com/files/code_3739.gif)\n\nDoes it have to be in a specific place within the code? I put it in under the line setting the quality.\n\n"
