  "content": "Hello!\n\nI have long lists in the format of\n\n**[word] [normal space] [more words]**\n\nNow it would be great if I could format it automatically into:\n\n**[word in bold] [n-space] [more words]**\n\nI can get the nested style sheet to change the first word to bold, but how can I change the normal space to a ’n-space’?\n\nI could of course do a normal find&replace but then there are so many normal spaces that don’t need to be changed, that it does not make much sense. Can nested style sheets solve this problem?\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n [‹ classic and beautiful handtooled fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906210728/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43621 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Something for Endre ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906210728/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43645 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
