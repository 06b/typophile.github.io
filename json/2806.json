  "content": "hi,   \n   \naddfoto.com will be a photographers gallery + stock photo + photography theory & tutorials project. The concept off ADD something made me use the universal (+) symbol that will be the visual brand of the site & logo. For now, the colors are not final, and I'm quite happy with the results. The card is of course not final, just to show the (+) cut I want to use on this ID.   \n   \nI want a strong ID, very simple and easy recognizable (memorable).   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526120955im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24703.gif)   \n   \nThanks for all the feedback.   \nadriano\n\n",

      "content": "Gosh�with the \"F\" the \"T\" and Hrant's \"O\"s suggestion, I can see a myriad of ways to incorporate the \"+\". Is it safe to assume that you have explored incorporating the \"+\" into each of these letterforms in several ways? Your current design is nice, but it isn't captivating, and IMHO if you're going for \"very simple\"�I think this is the most complicated concept of all the ones I can visualize.   \n   \nI like the die cut, but do you think it might be more practical to design the card around a die cut on one of the top corners instead? Reason being that a lot of bizcard storage products (i.e. rolodex) hold cards at the bottom corners. Then again, I guess the card could be stored upside down.   \n   \nI'm interested to see where this ends up. It's a great start.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

I will use the (+) as the gestalt.   \n   \nAbout the bottom corners, you are right, I did this so fast as the idea was good that I really need to put the stuff on illustrator. I think Daniel is correct on the cross hairs... I have to think anf try a bit more.\n\n"

If its pure white it works. ButLittle Gettyimages with a color scheme if your going for a new brand. hmmm... play with it in other colors see how it works other flat colors.   \n   \nLove the communication though, elegant simple brings addition to photography with a corporate functional voice.\n\n"
