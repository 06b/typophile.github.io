It's for a logotype, so I'm making my own letters, but I was looking for some inspiration as I haven't made this type of letter before (the R and N are a pig to get looking right ...). I think I'm getting it working now though.   \n   \nR\n\n"

Some of those look useful. I think I'm still going to go with custom letters but these are at least a bit out of the mainstream. [BigDots](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224316/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=302&page=1) and [DS Point](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516224316/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=302&page=3) are definitely in the right area.   \n   \nThanks guys, very helpful as usual.   \n   \nR\n\n"
