Tamye Riggs and her crew really did a great job.   \n   \nStealing Joe's format:   \nThe funniest thing at TypeCon:   \nJohn Downer's strip tease at the auction.   \n   \nThe most frustrating moments:   \nNot being able to go to all the really great workshops offered.   \n   \nThe most unbelievable moments:   \nEvery once in awhile I would step back and realise that Ken Barber of House was teaching me how to draw letters, or that I was having dinner with Akira Kobayashi of Linotype and it was hard to believe. I thank TypeCon/SoTA for bringing together people who may not have otherwise meet.   \n   \nThe second worst moment:   \nFinding out Josh Darden couldn't make it.   \n   \nThe worst moment:   \nJoe--I had the same problem with the business center. I tried to go across the skyway and poach a computer at the Marriot, but theirs were heavily guarded.   \n   \nBiggest regret:   \nNo regrets.   \n   \nThe simplest pleasure:   \nThose beds.   \n   \nFunnest time:   \nAll the planed and unplanned evening events. It's really great to get to talk (in person) to like minded typo folk.   \n   \nI'm already looking forward to the Bay Area. The west coast crew really has their work cut out for them.   \n   \nSustain SoTA: Join SoTA as a member now!\n\n"

(Why don't camera reviews make a bigger deal of this? Sigh...) Even when set to manual everything I feel I'm making a request for a picture to be taken, not taking the picture myself. It turns photography into something akin to video: you press the button with the hope that the desired shot is imminent, and shooting tons of footage you use your \"creativity\" in the editing process. The difference between film & digital stills may only be 0.2s or so (~0.1s vs. ~0.25s), but psychologically that's huge. To capture moments, stick with SLR.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> In fact 0.1 seconds is the approximate fastest human finger reaction time.   \n   \nThe relevant physiological constraint is not reaction time, but with what precision can one operate a trusted piece of machinery. From experiments (aged 11) I know I can stop a stopwatch within 0.02s of the full second quite reliably. A photographer sees moments coming, and can adjust for a 0.1s delay in a mechanism to an accuracy better than 0.1s. But with longer delays, there will be a rapid fall-off of such accuracy. The probability that you can predict what's going to happen 0.1s from now in a complex environment, is much higher than for 0.3s hence. This is armchair musing, of course. We should both ask good photographers whether they agree... But I liked a story I heard from a friend who once found himself at a party with Henri Cartier-Bresson. The great man would stand in a corner on his own, chain-smoking Gauloises and looking depressed. Every few minutes though, he would whip out his camera, click!, then hide it away again. Hardly anyone had noticed a thing. This seems to me to be the human equivalent of a frog catching a fly: a neuronally complex, supremely precise action, the perfect result of those minutes of observation. Any error in its timing - just by a tenth - would mean the prey would escape both frog and Frog.   \n   \n\\> Or full-motion (hi-res) video and then select a frame? :-/   \n   \nA smaller version of [this camera](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051021/http:/bssc.sel.sony.com/Professional/webapp/ModelInfo?m=0&sm=0&p=2&sp=19&id=62139) might be ok.\n\n"
