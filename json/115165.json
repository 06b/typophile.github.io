I ran across problems similar to those encountered in [http://typophile.com/node/115128](http://web.archive.org/web/20140717204854/http:/typophile.com/node/115128 \"http://typophile.com/node/115128\"). The serifed I on a sans font is relatively rare. The following fonts have it, together with a matching G: Lettera, FF Fago, Elsa, ITC Officina Sans, Droid Sans, FF Info, FS Albert, Ubik, and FS Me. However every one of these fonts has mismatches for other letters. Perhaps the closest of this lot is FS Me [http://www.identifont.com/find?font=FS+Me&q=Go](http://web.archive.org/web/20140717204854/http:/www.identifont.com/find?font=FS+Me&q=Go \"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=FS+Me&q=Go\") It's the only one with the right style of Q.  \nAnyone else prepared to take a stab at this?  \nDon\n\n"
