Preferably with knives, but they are aiming beyond that and always willing to explore new possibilities and fascinating workflows. I am very proud to present to you below some previously unreleased rough drafts of Slasher covers due to appear in approx. 2152 AD (given that the editors are still alive then).\n\nAppypollyloggies if anyone is offended by this.
