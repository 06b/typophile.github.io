  "content": "What if the J. Crew catalogue still showed all their stone-washed jeans from the 80s. You know, just in case someone wanted them.   \n   \nI don't want my last post in the [Beginning a Font Collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805014555/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/22787.html) thread to leave a negative tone, (it's the holidays for cryin' out loud.) So, I have a recommendation for the shepherds of the big, old collections at Bitstream, Linotype, Adobe, ITC, etc. (Nick, you won't mind me piggybacking off your earlier observation?)   \n   \n**1** Weed out the duds / oldies immediately. (Come on, you know which ones, they match those tweed jackets with the elbow patches.)   \n   \n**2** In 12 years re-release them as a retro pack. You're just sitting on a gold mine that just has to age for a while. In the meantime you'll be helping keep Hobo off our streets (pun fully intended).   \n   \nWhat foundries already do this? I know the good stock photo agencies do. They have to for their own credibility. (Oh, and Getty, if you're listening, Photodisc is ripe for the \"archive\" bin.)\n\n",
