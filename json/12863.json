I've seen a number with pretty fancy ornaments and borders. I'm not sure how expressive any of that was in regard to the plot and themes in the actual movie. I can't think of any good examples off the top of my head.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm not a type expert, but Stewf sent me this thread for my film expertise.\n\nThe most expressionistic intertitles are probably found in, appropriately, German Expressionism. This can be seen in Hollywood productions like \"Sunrise,\" by the movement's greatest director, F.W. Murnau. In \"Sunrise,\" the intertitles are in many instances animated, alternating size or at one point taking on the form of water. (Guy Maddin, mentioned and linked above, obviously took inspiration from these styles in his intertitles.) Among silent film scholars, these intertitles are a point of contention with purists, who prefer them stationary, and there is debate over whether or not Murnau was actually involved in those titles since he generally made an effort to use little to no intertitles in films like \"The Last Laugh.\"\n\nA restoration of \"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" from a few years ago tried to make titles in the same distorted type (or at least the spirit of it) as the German original. I don't know if you can get your hands on the original German, as I've only seen English versions, but you might be able to get the feel for it if you find the quality transfer. Many films don't have their original intertitles because their only surviving copies were found in other countries, where they were re-shot in a different language, but those are generally easy to detect, especially for typophiles.\n\nAlso, due to problems with copyrighting early films, a monogram was often used in the intertitles (and in some films, especially Biograph productions, built into the sets). This tradition continued after some of the legal issues were resolved.\n\n"

The type think I am working on, as encapsulated in the presentation I gave at ATypI in Rome, is ongoing and has expanded, but the font based on the font in this film is still part of it.\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/MeyerTwo](http://web.archive.org/web/20140820010241/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/MeyerTwo \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/MeyerTwo\") is based on this era as well. . .\n\nI think each studio had its own staff or hired from the foundries, to create fonts on film for film. I wish someone would catalog them all but...\n\nThere's also this guy named Joe Clark(.org), but you might need some help figuring out what's goin' on there, or at least I did. He's primarily interested in Captioning fonts, which he seems to think are \"totally different\" from intertitles, or to come to my extreme, screen fonts. I think, they are all the same because of their intent, which is to bring the dialog from the screen to the user via type. . .\n\n"
