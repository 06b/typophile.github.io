Helvetica's R alone is enough to endear it to me. Why do so many other sans serifs have such ugly capital Rs? \"Frankenletters\" that look to have been cobbled together with spare parts?   \n   \nCompressed, Condensed, Neue, Ultra Light... there are so many ways that it's good. And Helvetica is versatile, too... Nothing awkward about it, Helvetica manages to be utilitarian without being soulless. Though even the most virtuous typefaces can be abused, I guess... flinch.\n\n"

I always thought, and still think, that the use of Helvetica for text in wide columns on glossy-paged books of the early '70s was hideous and unreadable, but as a heading and display face it seemed to work okay.   \n  \nThen I had the great pleasure of being commissioned to design a new Cyrillic, Greek and Hebrew for Helvetica, which obliged me to spend a lot more time looking at the design than I had previously. I'm still not inclined to make much use of Helvetica, but I have a lot more respect for it than I used to. One of the things I really came to appreciate was the sheer quirkiness and unpredictability of what most people think of as a very rationalised and geometric design. It's actually pleasantly perverse.   \n  \nNote that I'm talking here about the original Helvetica. Helvetica Neue is a completely different design: superior in almost every way, but much less quirky.\n\n"

I can't think of any typefaces that have become as popular as Helvetica that have not had the same over-exposure problem with designers. I used to like Times Roman a lot more before it became a default font.   \n  \nAs a young proto-designer in high school in the '70s, I was infatuated with Helvetica. My first sheet of Letraset was a sheet of 72-point Helvetica Medium, and I remember marveling over the subtle curves or the lowercase _a, e,_ and _s._ My design teacher in college said \"when in doubt, use Helvetica.\" I, like many others I think, imagined it as some kind of ultimate standard that all others were to be judged by; that it was a typeface with all the pretensions of style and ornamentation peeled away.   \n  \nI grew out of my infatuation (or got bored with it) within a couple of years as I became more acquainted with the charms of other typefaces. But I can still remember a time when I imagined that in a perfect world everything would be set in Helvetica. (Ha! Heaven help us.)   \n  \nI mostly think it's boring now, though I find that the way it has come back into fashion is interesting, were it's brought to center stage again. I couldn't use it like that without feeling ironic. Helvetica used to represent end of style. Now it's just another style.\n\n"

While I personally think that such a thing is unlikely to actually happen and also that it isn't wrong at all to get between those two and to interpret and act as a catalysator in the communicative process, it seems that Miedinger succeeded in making Helvetica very very invisible. I think it says a LOT about German companies that they're so in love (or simply used to) this typeface... and I think that as a designer we shouldn't take Helv as granted but look for alternatives... but sometimes there simply is none. I know of know other typeface, except maybe DIN that is as sterile and functional as Helv... And in a minimalist design you WANT a typeface to look that way.\n\n"

It was used, exclusively, in the   \nsignage for an exhibition:   \n   \n ![neue H 75, lc figs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020211540im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7811.gif)   \n   \nBut there was nothing new here, in fact. Akzidenz Grotesk,   \nthe mother of all Helveticas, had already had lc figures   \nfor some time (but only in the \"light\" weight, curiously).   \n   \nI don't think, BTW, that this was such a necessary thing   \n(small caps would be particularly pathetic). In my case,   \nthe motivation was to follow the exhibition logo, designed   \nby Goebel Weyne, a great designer here:   \n   \n ![ESdi30](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020211540im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7812.gif)   \n   \nIn the case of Futura (and Gill Sans!) the lc figures are,   \non the other hand, essential, in my opinion.

Luc's version retains a very modern touch.   \n   \nRe Tv-Channel-Identification.

The 50s/60s screendesign, although there were terrible poopers as well, it just felt more relaxed than the overcoloured overanimated stuff we have today.   \n   \nBy the way, most German TV-stations use Helvetica or something similar.

While Futura harkens back to the Capitalis Monumentalis in that it is based on circles and squares as base forms, it is a geometric contruction, done with compasses and ruler, not created in a more dynamic way by hand with a nib/pen. That is what I mean by sterile. Although the finished version, of course, is by no way as regid as the first designs (the o, e.g., isn't just a circle anymore but rather returned to the slightly oval form we know since the 14th century to be optically correct, it still, imo, was a statement against the old-fashioned typography that went before the 20th century.   \n   \nThe digital Futura, btw, isn't too good for longer text, I think. The digial version needs a lot of manual kerning because of the geometric shape of the letters, and while with a LOT of manual editing you can get a decent looking text, it's just too much work to bother. Also, I tend to think that a more dynamic letterform is just more gentle on the reader :-D. I couldn't imagine reading a book or a lengthy article in Futura, even Helvetica would be better.\n\n"

Its weakness is that it is one of the most unreadable typefaces as a text face. Its value as a display face has, however, been almost totally eliminated by overuse.   \n   \nEven in display sizes, it can have problems with readability. Frutiger's opening up of letter forms in a Sans Serif certainly helped readability, and has been widely imitated.   \n   \nStill, I wouldn't be surprised that if after 10 or 15 years, it couldn't be used judiciously as a display type and look very good again.\n\n"

Probably because he used CorelDraw, as Swiss is part of that package. The rest of the design is overwhelmingly awful as well. I remember Erik Spiekermann blasting it to pieces in the Page, and even the German newsmagazine DER SPIEGEL was having gun at the expense of the design :-D.   \n  \nThe 'broadband group' at Razorfish, New York (formerly Lee   \nHunt Associates, circa 2000) did the ZDF stuff. So I can at   \nleast vouch that they didn't use CorelDraw to do it. =)   \n  \nI won't comment on the ZDF stuff (since I've never seen it),   \nbut I will say their recent work for PBS, PBS Kids and the   \nDisney Channel is great.\n\n"
