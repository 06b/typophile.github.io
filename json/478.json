Sent you a copy.   \n   \nCurrently, whether I am that person or not, I am printing a book on Joseph Moxon. He said something and I respond.

Started using photopolymer in 1991.   \n   \nPhotopolymer is just a great printing surface; with a platemaking machine it's like having your own Monotype caster but not being limited to Monotype. And desktop publishing software and digital type is a blessing, is now and has been for some many years.   \n   \nWell, yeah, Moxon will be prohibitively expensive. About a grand. When you are printing a book with a hand-operated press and using handmade paper that cost $7.50 a sheet, and it sucks up a couple years of your life, yeah, it gets expensive. On our last book, a speculative book on the proof of Gutenberg, I think my partner and I spent around $70,000 on a book that was printed in an edition of 146 copies. Now that's a risky investment when you are not making a book that is intentionally directed at any market whatsoever. More like, this is what we want to do and this is what we have to do, so let's get down on our knees and pray.   \n   \nBasically, just an idiotic career choice.   \n   \nA wish-we-could book currently in research stage is on the 16th century astronomer Tycho Brahe!!! A very interesting and strange and important fellow. We will have a lot of fun with this one. Well, at least, initially.\n\n"

First person, at the age of 12 or something to look at the stars holding the first printed ancient star maps and realizing they were wrong. Is able to prove this. Loses his nose in a sword fight over who is the best mathematical student. First scientist to use the printing press to print his work, papermill and all. Trains the great Dutch printer and scientific publisher, Willem Janszoon Blaeu. First to establish what we now call a scientific research facility. The King of Denmark gives him his own island and he imprisons the inhabitants. Has a couple of dwarfs for entertainment. Invents running water for the sole purpose of a practical joke on unsuspecting visitors. Has a jail under his castle. Never lets an apprentice leave the island, ever. Invents all his own instruments, of which their were very very many. His entire castle revolves to follow the movements of the stars. Contributes significantly to astronomy; on his death bed he gives his apprenctice Kepler all his data. Dies from mercury poisoning associated with the several hundred false noses he had.

      "content": "Hrant,   \n   \nI see what you see, only I read it differently. I see cleaning out the corners. The metal must be clean or it will not relieve when cast. It will \"hold\" when the type is removed. What I can see is evidence of gravure slippage, or manipulation error on the top crotch of the \"h\".   \n   \nOn the \"b\" if your theory was correct the punchcutter has lost control. Please draw your eye to the top bowel-crotch of the ascending stem. Either the top crotch is an error, or the bottom crotch an error? Take your pick. There is no need for one without the other. If you take issue to the nature of stems and placement compare the situation on the companion areas of the \"d\".   \n   \nSo no more yeah buts . . . please!   \n   \nIf \"ink trapping\" were \"the intention\" the application \"should be even\". His work, as you can easily see, is not that fussy.   \n   \n   \nOr, lots of theory, little ability to apply.   \n   \nMeaning this artifact lends little support to your hypothesis. If he is cutting ink trapping intentionally he should have enough skills to apply his principals evenly throughout. I am not disparaging the beauty of his letterforms in fact the cut-look-&-feel is integral to the very beauty. The crudeness is in effect, much more than secondary to the design.   \n   \nBut \"ink trapping\", come come.   \n   \nThese letters are much as if they were cut in linoleum or wood. Those are the characteristics which come easily when using similar tools such as a gravure. There are large and small gravures. Tools, including needles are used in small point sizes or tight areas. These cuts are \"humongoumamouth\".   \n   \nLooking at these letterforms I see forms worked by mostly a single gravure, large by type cutting standards. Certainly it, possibly them, would be used only in the crudest of work when cutting an 8 pt. character. Probably, not even then.   \n   \nThe very nature of these letterforms does not required fine gravures. The large gravure(s) have given the design the intended emotions of the designer. Cutting emotions. I suggest a more finished look would have greatly reduced its appeal.   \n   \nIf you view the crotch in the Q you will see a place where it would \"certainly deserve\" the \"ink trap treatment\" you refer to \"if the punchcutter believed as you\".   \n   \nI see a punchcutter seeking a-cut-look-&-feel to his letterforms, and getting it. Forgiving people such as yourselves for mistaking them to be either faults, or \"in your(s) case(s)\" inktraps in order to achieve the characteristic nature of the letterforms that have drawn our attentions. By the way, which because of the tooling, are acidly beautiful.   \n   \nYou have to love it for what it is, not for what you want it to be. You should remember that boys, and the girls shall be forever thankful.   \n   \nThere is an acid sharpness throughout, and I suspect lots of \"gravure\", little \"file\".   \n   \nThere is a general crudeness throughout and if you notice the \"h\" has another mis-cutting on the top left curve. Also if you view the beard of the same character you will see a flatness on the lower portions of the gravure straightening into perpendicular at the top of the stroke meeting close to the same error. He is giving a lot of meaning to free handing and that I believe issues much of the beauty of this particular typeface.   \n   \nI highly recommend that some of you consider cutting types yourselves. The impossibility is merely an obstacle in your minds. But remember, there is few of us left. Contact Jim Rimmer.   \n   \nGerald Giampa   \nLanston Type Company\n\n"

Those are classic traps. Why so much resistance? Is your stance that trapping doesn't even exist, that it's only my imagination? Come on. The traps in that font are all over the place, but nowhere that they don't belong: there's nothing \"mistaken\" about it.   \n   \nOn the other hand, the traps are indeed too big for that point size, and also, it's simply not a very good trapping job in terms of maintaing size and shape - it's hard to do consistently, which is probably one reason not many people do it. Look at the trapping in DTL Fleischmann, a digital face where there is no graver to slip: it's all over the place.   \n   \nBTW, Pascal is not a \"crude\" face, intentionally or otherwise. Are you at all familiar with it?   \n   \n\\> If you view the crotch in the Q   \n   \nSo you've failed to see the trap there? What about the micro-traps around the join of the \"f\"...

So it was not an aesthetic decision on the part of the designer himself (and hopefully the punchcutter didn't make any aesthetic decisions on his own, certainly not at the larger sizes!), it was a technical decision on the part of the punchcutter.

How would this have affected the role of the pantograph?

Work into a crotch there will is a lifting motion.   \n   \nThis is very interesting, and I admit very logical. But a good punchcutter (or the pantograph?) would be able to reduce/eliminate this effect, no? I have many questions - much to learn... Where exactly do you see the effects of this phenomenon you describe in the Pascal 60? Maybe in the fact that the \"b\" has a much deeper cut than the \"d\"? It might be important here to state explicitly that the scan has been flipped horizontally, for easy decipherment of the letters.   \n   \nBut it also seems like some shapes have symmetrical cuts (both with respect to their flanking sides as well as with respect to the location on the letterform), irrespective of cutting direction. And also, some shapes (not necessarily the ones I've scanned) are missing traps/nicks where I would expect to see some - these are generally secondary ones, like the asterisk, but sometimes it seems like they just forgot (which also happens in digital too, like in the DTL Fleishmann I mentioned).   \n   \n\\> The 12 point appears natural   \n   \n?   \nIt has a huge trap!   \nAnd remember, that was a _print_.   \n   \n\\> I ask again whether the type was cut and then \"electroplated\" or just \"punched\".   \n   \nI would have to ask Henk Gianotten, who used to work for Tetterode before they went under.   \n   \n\\> Font le Roy, San Francisco you will see sparkling \"ink trapless\" type.   \n   \nCould you elaborate on this?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I certainly recall that in using your comparator to re-drawe letters for you from your Lanston punches that just the reverse was true. In the corners and pinches, the shapes were terminated with a small radius, because of the revolving cutter on the pantograph.   \n   \nIt seems that Lanston did not deem it necessary to hand-nick out these tight spots. You and I both know that a person can print with no problem with Monotype type. It's all in the hand of the pressman that scoops the ink out of the can. A little bit goes a long way. I don't think it has ever been the responsibility of the type manufacturer or punch cutter to try to anticipate with how much vigor and enthusiasm the pressman applies the ink.   \n   \nSince I am not a member of ATypI I cannot get involved in the forum. Perhaps that is a good thing. There is slittle to be gained from getting heated about a thing like that.   \n   \nI finally got finished with the job of cutting flat mat accents for 18 point Nicholas Cochin for Lucy lambert, and am now involved in the alignment and   \nfitting of the 14 point Cartier Roman font that I cut 14 point flat mats for last month. I have to gop back and recut a few letters, but overall it is   \nlooking quite good.   \n   \nIt will be necessary to hand rub all the casting becasue of the leave created by directly engraving flat the mats. If more than a few people are interwsted in buying type, I am going to ship the type in individualbaggies, and send each buyer a free file along with the type.   \n   \nHope all is well with you in your new island paradise.

Soon I will show you some Palatino.   \n   \n\\> In the corners and pinches, the shapes were terminated with a small radius, because of the revolving cutter on the pantograph.   \n   \nAnybody relying [only] on a pantograph to cut punches certainly doesn't care about admittedly secondary refinements such as traps. But refinements nonetheless.   \n   \n\\> a pattern has a mistake and it is used for multiple sizes, the \"mistake\", allow me, will be multiplied.   \n   \nBut:   \n1) My point was that the 24 doesn't have trapping (at least not to the extent that the 48/12 do), so it wasn't an aesthetic decision (like you proposed).   \n2) The traps in the 48 and 12 are different.   \n   \nAlso remember: Mendoza y Alemeida drew separate versions for different sizes - or least small ranges - certainly the 48 and 12 weren't from the same drawing. The really good guys didn't rely on the pantograph too much.   \n   \n\\> His cure is worse than the ailment.   \n   \nAt 60 point especially, the traps -certainly the one in the \"b\"- are indeed too big. But there would have to be a difference of a couple of bottles of Muscatel for the guy to be so bad at cutting on the \"b\" and then so fine on the \"A\" for example.   \n   \nThe point isn't how badly/well the cutter did his job, the point is the _intention_. And to me it's crazy to claim it wasn't there.   \n   \n\\> Jim and I can certainly offer knowledge previously unavailable to you.   \n   \nCertainly, and I appreciate that greatly. The one thing I'm most anxious to learn about involves something on your site: \"One of Lanston's\n\n"

But for the last decade I have seen Jim maybe twice, and only briefly.   \n   \nFor absolute accuracy nothing could beat a Benton Pantograph. The specifications were beyond reproach. Far smaller than the human eye could perceive. For instance the tolerances of measurement was no more than 1 / 100,000 of an inch. The measuring scale is 2 feet long in degrees so fine that it requires a microscope to read them. Technology used in punch cutting for mechanical type manufacture had tolerances and requirements far in excess of what is humanly possible.   \n   \nFurthermore in setting up the tool to measure it must be sent to the standards bureau in France. The freight, because of the heat requirements and vibration prevention cost us over $2700. and that does not include the cost of adjustment. The device must be in a constant operating temperature, the work to be measured had to be in the same room until it reached its own room temperature.   \n   \nSure we cared about type. You bet.   \n   \nYou would kill for the dedicated comparator. This was a special magnification device for viewing types or matrices. It might not agree with your theory however.   \n   \nThe height-to-paper machine was also a microscopic device. If you made a slight mistake in motion you could loose the face of the matrice for weeks, literally. Tiny matrices became a moonscape.   \n   \nYou have to understand the importance that mechanical typesetting was to mankind. You speak of the reading public. Without systems of which I speak we would all be illiterate. Spacing was also far superior in a Monotype than hand-set. I resisted that thought but soon came to appreciate the systems that were developed.   \n   \nThese matters are an entire new area of discussion. There is a book you should read by Krimpen that was put together by John Dreyfus. It deals with this very topic in letter form back and for with someone you are biased against. Stanley Morison. I enjoyed Krimpen\n\n"

The pantograph wasn't guilty of anything - the Benton boys even tried to get people to use it properly - but they failed: people used it to save effort/money, nothing more. Even though the pantograph's technology allowed for it, optical sizing died - it simply became too easy _not_ to do it anymore. So this tragedy happened way before phototype.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
