Danger signs: you passionately and publicly comment on a typeface, and people look at you as if you have some strange illness. You do.   \n   \nThe only cure is to avoid infection.   \n   \n::Warning::   \nThe following books are especially dangerous: 'Elements of Typographic Style' by Robert Bringhurst and 'Letters of Credit' by Walter Tracy. Do not, repeat, do not visit 'Notes on Type Design', the web site of G. Briem. And above all do not frequent that asylum of the afflicted, Typophile.com!\n\n"
