The Western habit of relying heavily on chirography on the other hand is very old-fashioned, and any native who uses a computer is likely to like that even less (even though I personally think it's less bad). But they haven't been given many real alternatives to the two \"schools\", so...

      "content": "My opinion on the subject is based more on intuition and less on thorough research so I am going to be careful on what I say (it's the heart talking rather than the mind on this one).\n\nI totally agree with Chris Lozos's position on the way modernist values have changed into something universal for almost all \"western societies\". In fact some of the best works (imho) in greek poster design have been made during the 60s/70s by graphic designers like Michalis and Agni Katzouraki, and Freddy Karabott and were very much influenced by modernism.\n\nSo, yes Greece is most of the times a \"user\" and not an \"initiator\" (and when it comes to typography, that is the case), and, yes, Greece has for many years tried to decide whether it considers itself east or west. The thing is though that our (my) dilemma has now changed - and it's based on Chris's conclusion: we are able to purchase typefaces and get inspired by designs from all over the world. So, do we really need to think in terms of \"nationalistic\" or \"latinized\" or \"exoticized\" or whatever designs, rather than thinking in more universal terms.\n\nGerry Leonidas's analysis is truly detailed and correct. But in my opinion what is rather interesting to see is that Helvetica (and Helvetica-looking typefaces) has been the default in several applications in graphic design for a lot of years from the 60s up to the 90s, and then Meta and Din came and replaced it, and then (a few years ago) Myriad came and replaced them, and then (fewer years ago) Fedra came and conquered the contemporary greek typographic world. As you can see they are all contemporary and mainly geometric (instead of calligraphy based) typefaces. And then, in the book industry, Didot (like GFS's Didot), and Times were the default. And they never left the scene, only to find themselves occasionally replaced by Minion or Warnock (in the past few years).\n\nSo, what I am trying to pinpoint is that foreign (that is non-greek) typographic designers have now (and I guess always had) a \"power\" to lead the trends in greek typography without too much critique or even competition. And of course it's not them to blame (if there is anyone to blame). The think is that you can count the greeks that actually try to understand and thoroughly research the phenomenon called \"greek typography\" in your two hands. Their work is undoubtedly remarkable. But the educational and research gap is something that literally prevents upcoming greek designers to be critical when faced with an \"imported\" interpretation of the greek alphabet, let alone innovative when it comes to designing their own interpretations.\n\nSo, to conclude, for me there is no such thing as a preference towards traditional or geometric typographic forms in comtemporary Greece. There are just people trying to cope with constant change or mimicing imported norms. And there are fewer people trying to fathom how did we get here and (if they should/could) change it.\n\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr\n\n"

You can't easily know that your progressive text face is in fact a flop. In fact in your case when an expert tells you so, you choose to turn the tables in your hubris. You have to listen to and trust others to tell you what's most likely going on with your designs.\n\n\\> if you do your homework.\n\nIt's not only a matter of homework. Formalism only covers half the ground, the rest is incommunicable, non-transferrable subconsiousness, nativity. It is known that the formative years of a person's childhood bestow certain affinities that cannot be gained later. It is known for example that children who learn two languages early on end up being fluent in both to a degree an adult can never attain.\\* Never.

Greeks, or any of us anywhere, are not limited to what happens between here and the next village so designers do not confine their work to what was done in that bygone era. What is the value in reconstituting the past for everything we do? If past generations had done that, there would not be any typography today. Greeks were seaman and traders and explorers and invaders. They gathered from the foreign lands they saw and developed a culture and a language and an alphabet. If they took nothing from Phoenicians or Babylonians or Assyrians, perhaps that writing would never have come. The Romans borrowed from the Greeks, and later, the Greeks borrowed back. Mix in the Turks, and later the rest of Europe and you see what a conglomeration it was. This all took thousands of years by slow ships and by foot. Today, cultures blend in an instant. Today, what used to be the next village, is now the entire globe and at the speed of a T1 line.  \nJust think of having this conversation among us all, separated by thousands of miles. If we just did what our older culture had done, we would never know each-other.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The Latin caps are made to fit (mostly) between two lines, and the Latin lc (mostly) between four. In Greek however historically there's been a certain leaning towards a single <cite>median</cite> line (especially in the caps) as well as a large degree of deviation from the \"x-height\" as well as the extender lines in the lc.\n\nSo I think it might be possible to sometimes make Greek more  \n\"authentic\" by being a bit naughty about vertical alignment.\n\nhhp\n\n"

The difference is on where and how they are used. As G.Trianta remarked, Gill Sans Hellenic, DIN Greek, Meta Greek or Myriad could be a trend for a corporate or magazine design use, while Warnock, Fedra B, Omonia or our Apollonia (which like many GFS type families are designed by T. Katsoulidis) could be a trend for a book design.\n\nAnd again, I totally agree with G.Trianta' quote  \n\"So, do we really need to think in terms of “nationalistic” or “latinized” or “exoticized” or whatever designs, rather than thinking in more universal terms.\"\n\nWhat I would question though, is some information about a brief history of Greek script in modern times. Especially, I don't see any relation between the social or political status in Greece of the early seventies and Linotype's typeface development to a so called \"western\" texture.  \nThis texture existed decades before and had there been an influence on type, this would surely be towards a \"non western\" or a more \"exoticized\" direction.  \nAll Greeks who lived that period (1967-74) remember that during the military junta, everything \"western\" was considered as a bad influence or even a sub-cultural product.  \n(Not to mention that all english speaking songs were banned from the radio, or that famous records such as the Beetles \"Sgt Pepper's...\" was first released in Greece 8 years after its original release and a year after the fall of the dictatorship).  \nAlso anyone would remember these tacky revival parades at the Stadium dressed in ancient clothes or like byzantine emperors.  \nAnd of course, the motto \"We belong to the west\" was not repeated then, simply because the first time it was pronounced was 4 years after the fall of the dictatorship by the late Karamanlis (uncle of today's PM) on his effort to track the country into the European Community and back to NATO alliance. Instead, the sound bite used by the colonels was the triangle \"state, religion and family\".\n\nSo, as written above, the Thessaloniki conference in June, or even finding some Greek newspapers, books and printed material would be a good resource to have a more spherical of what Greeks prefer.\n\n"

This \"covertness\" I guess allowed the Greek newspaper people of the 70s to tell Linotype to make those fonts as Western as possible without getting in trouble. At least that's the version we always hear, including from people like M Carter! I guess it's possible that Linotype and its designers would like to deflect \"credit\" for the highly Latinized Greek typestyles of the 70s, and in reality it was mostly their idea (probably because such a style would have been easier to make for them) but I have to doubt it.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Mike Parker relates that Linotype were approached by a Greek businessman who wanted to be their sales rep in Greece. He claimed that he could get Linotype composing machinery into every newspaper and typesetting house in Greece if Linotype would undertake to produce any Greek typeface requested by the customers. Linotype had no significant Greek type development prior to this, and the faces produced were as requested by the Greek customers, communicated to Linotype via their sales rep, who apparently succeeded in gaining for Linotype virtually the entire Greek type composing market.\n\nWhy did the Greeks want Helvetica, Baskerville, etc.?

On the other hand, I myself value an effort at authenticity even more than actually achieving authenticity, because the latter does not of itself preclude a mere mimickry of precedent (which I can't stand) and the \"innocence of desire\" is more likely to -eventually- produce real progress.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I'm always nervous when someone makes reference to something I said e.g. four years ago. Am I going to have to explain why I said it, or why I might have changed my mind in the interim? In this case, I think the comments pretty much stand. In reference to your comment about the final sigma, I actually don't find this a problematic letter in Cadmus: the transition from the top part of the final sigma to the descender should be more fluid than the transition in zeta and ksi.\n\n"

      "content": "\"I don’t know exactly what the design-to-manufacturing process was.\"  \nAhhhh. It was slow. As slow and meticulous as the letterrdrawing was, the making of plaques and then fonts and then proofs took 30-60 days from the time manufacturing got the drawings until the office got proofs. Take this and put it in a tube and send it to Greece, London or Frankfurt for comments and you'd add another month. Make changes, two more months. etc...in 4-6 months you migh have one style...each style after that took more time not less, as it most often doesn't today.\n\n\"I really like the idea of a customer coming along saying ‘We need this typeface!’ and being able to respond ‘Okay, come back in two years...\"  \nLol. yeah I never got to say it but it was normal then and customers would say \"AWLRIGHT, can't wait!\" Time passed differently too, I think.\n\n"

After all, the generals pressed for the use of Katharevousa instead of Dimotiki, thus they wanted Greece to purge Turkish words from its language - to abandon Eastern influences, and get back to its Western roots.\n\n"
