      "content": "Rub-down type was the low end of the display type market. It was mainly popular with students, freelancers and do-it-yourselfers (which included me). Letraset was at the high end of this low-end market. It was more expensive than other brands (around $10 per sheet/font), but it also was the highest quality and had the best selection of typefaces. They also sought out and published original typefaces by independent designers (see Robert above). Most, if not all, of Letraset's original type designs were published in mainstream font formats (phototype, digital type) later on, though not always with authorization.\n\nLetraset's marketing rivaled any other type manufacturer of the time. They published an annual catalog with quarterly supplements as well as a (I think) quarterly publication about type called [Baseline](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016070508/http:/www.baselinemagazine.com/about_contact/history_and_awards/)(which still exists, but is not published by Letraset anymore). Their promotional materials were often designed by prominent designers. They were sort of the Veer of the 1970s. :-)\n\n"
