I guess there is a technical reason for that. Does anyone know why that is?\n\nThe problem is: this makes it almost impossible to use the CT fonts for body copy texts on websites. If you declare the fonts in a CSS like:  \n“calibri, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif”  \nyou will have to choose the right type size for either the ones who have the CT fonts or the ones who doesn’t. If you focus on the old Core Fonts, the CT fonts will be rendered much too small and if you focus on the CT fonts, users without it will see much too large type. So as a web designer you are really in a pickle here …\n\nThere were plans for a CSS attribute that would scale the fonts according to the x-height (font-size-adjust), but it has been dropped in the current CSS specifications.\n\nAny ideas or solutions on this subject?\n\nRalf\n\n",

For instance, Constantia has correct metrics, but the other fonts have incorrect metrics, i.e. the other ClearType fonts are technically faulty.\n\nThe top height of capital letters of Latin typefaces should be 70% (+/- 5%) of the font grid. PostScript fonts have 1000 units per em, and hence the top serif of the uppercase “I” should be 700 units in the case of PS and OTF fonts.\n\nFor TrueType and also for the ClearType fonts, the grid is 2048 units, and 70% of 2048 is slightly above 1400 units (i.e. 1433 units, to be exact).\n\nIn the case of Constantia, the height of the capital “I” is exactly 1400 units, and this is perfectly correct. A deviation of +/- 50 units (i.e. the range below 1400 down to 1350 and above 1400 up to 1450) is tolerable for TrueType fonts, but if the caps height drops below 1350, the metrics must be regarded as incorrect, because such fonts can no longer be mixed with other fonts in the same line of text, since the letters begin to dance (see below).\n\nThe metrically worst ClearType fonts are Calibri, Candara and Consolas, all three of them with a caps height of only 1300 units. Cambria is tolerable with a caps height is 1365 units.\n\nIf we mix Constantia (which has correct metrics) with Calibri (with has faulty metrics) in the same line of text, the faulty metrical design becomes apparent by “dancing letters”, whose top capital heights do no longer align:\n\nsee [http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522121630/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri.pdf\")\n\nIt is hard to believe at first glance that all dancing letters in the file calibri.pdf are typeset in exactly the same point size (here 48p), but this is the case, as anyone can find out himself or herself by typesetting a line of sample text using and mixing Constantia and Calibri.\n\nKudos to Mr. Hudson, who was able to design his Constantia font with correct metrics (and non-kudos to Mr. de Groot, who was not capable of designing Calibri with correct metrics).\n\n"

How far was this a criterion of the development process?  \nIt doesn’t seem to be much of a factor, given the format of “Now Read This” which, like the vast majority of type specimens, shows new faces in isolation.\n\nHow do the bolds of Calibri and Corbel (as sideheads, for instance) work as contrast faces with Constantia and Cambria (for the rest of a text blocks)?

Then Uli can’t categorically condemn a designer’s abilities.\n\nUli, from what rule book did you get your pronouncement about the cap height of typefaces? There’s not much call for lines of all caps, in mixed fonts of any kind; there is common use of different styles of the same design in the same line. X-height is indeed a more useful alignment. Have you taken up grunge typography? Sounds like another pointless opportunity to whine. And you didn’t address the actual question, which pertains to web use. Since the CT fonts were made much later than Georgia/Verdana, and some of them have much larger, more diverse character sets (see Cambria math), perhaps there is something you are missing.

The grid is the same, but there is too much white space around the black glyphs (if printed in black color on white paper), and hence they look too small as compared with Arial, Helvetica and similar sanserif fonts.\n\nLet’s look at\n\n[http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri-arial.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522121630/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri-arial.htm \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri-arial.htm\")\n\nIn case you don’t have Calibri and Arial installed on your computer, you can instead look at the PDF file\n\n[http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri-arial.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522121630/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri-arial.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/calibri-arial.pdf\")\n\nIt is obvious that Calibri in the left column looks much smaller than Arial in the right column, although the sample texts are typeset in the very same point sizes. How come that Calibri looks smaller than Arial? The answer is that the glyphs of Calibri do not sufficiently fill the 2048-grid of this TrueType font, as compared with Arial and Helvetica and similar fonts.\n\nLet’s look at\n\n[http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/grid2048.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522121630/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/grid2048.gif \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/grid2048.gif\")\n\nTo the left we see the uppercase “I” of the TrueType Helvetica (version 1.0), which has a caps height of 1470 units, followed by the uppercase “I” of Calibra, which has a caps height of 1300 units.\n\nTo the right we see the lowercase “x” of the TrueType Helvetica, whose x-height is 1071 units, followed by the “x” of Calibra, whose x-height is 956 units.\n\nThis means that the absolute values of BOTH caps height AND x-height of Calibra are too small, and hence there is too much white space around the glyphs in the 2048 units TrueType grid, and hence Calibra looks too small.\n\nSince the caps height occupies usually two thirds (2/3) of the grid, i.e. roughly 70% of 2048 units, it follows that the caps height measured in grid units or in percentage can be used to determine whether a font looks too small or not. This can be proved by the following test:\n\nLet’s look at\n\n[http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/caps-height.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522121630/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/caps-height.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/caps-height.pdf\")\n\nIn the first row (H1470-100%) we see the original TrueType Helvetica with a caps height of 1470 units. This original vertical size is regarded here as 100 per cent for comparison.\n\nIn the second row (H1176-80%) we see the down-scaled Helvetica, where all glyphs (both uppercase and lowercase) have been reduced to 80% of the original size of all glyphs.\n\nIn the third row (H882-60%) we see the down-scaled Helvetica, where all glyphs (both uppercase and lowercase) have been reduced to 60% of the original size of all glyphs.\n\nNow look at the three “Hamburgefonts” sample texts, all three of which were typeset in the very same point size of 36 points on 36 points body:\n\nThe H1176 sample text looks smaller than the original H1470 sample text, and the H882 sample text looks still smaller than the other two sample texts.\n\nThis proves: Whenever the glyphs of a font do not sufficiently fill the 2048-grid of TTF fonts (or the 1000-grid of PS fonts), the glyphs look too small, because there is too much white space around the black glyphs.\n\nThat is why Calibri looks much smaller than Arial, Helvetica and similar sanserif fonts, since the glyphs of Calibri (both lowercase and uppercase) do not sufficiently fill the 2048-grid.\n\n"

The uppercase Vietnamese diacritics in Arial are only kept within the vertical metrics by horribly squishing and distorting their shapes.\n\nMany of the world’s orthographies need greater vertical space than the inherited scaling and metrics of Anglo-American and western European font development. If you are making fonts that you anticipate being extended to support additional languages, the last thing you want to do is to make them too large on the body, since vertical metrics usually cannot be increased due to backwards compatibility and document reflow issues.

Basing such decisions on what characters a font supports in its first development phase is short-sighted, especially when the font is being made for a company that is dedicated to internationalisation and that has a long history of extending their fonts to support additional languages. The phase 1 CT font development was aimed at modern European languages, but it would be naïve to think that this would be the limit of their support.\n\n"

Since many Americans do not regard Vietnamese as human beings, but as “weed” belonging to the “axis of evil”, and therefore annihilated millions of them as “weed” using herbicides (“Agent Orange” etc.), it is laudable that today some Americans plan to offer fonts in the future for those who survived the herbicidal annihilation.\n\n2)\n\n\\> it will be clipped in all GDI applications\n\nFor those who have not yet experienced this phenomenon, I have prepared an illustrative example.\n\nsee [http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/l-candrabindu.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522121630/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/l-candrabindu.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/l-candrabindu.pdf\")\n\n\\> the most vertically challenging accent to squeeze in, at least in my experience as a type designer, is capital A ring.\n\nThis is a challenging case indeed, but the worst case of all in my experience is not ordinary capital letters with ring etc. diacritic, but lowercase ascender letters such as “l” and “k”, which often extend the ordinary capital height, especially in almost all old-style typefaces, as shown by above ascender letter “l” with candrabindu on top of it.\n\n"

Also the “Americans” in question are Welsh, Irish, Pakistani, Engish and Canadian.\n\nAnyhow, in the process of adding Vietnamese to these fonts we did have issues with Cambria, whereas for Calibri and Consolas things went pretty smoothly.\n\nWith respect to clipping it’s been our experience that printers do not clip, and that increasing leading mitigates the issue. I feel that for a document font clipping is preferable to having marks that crash together or crash into the base.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"
