In [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123130243/http:/typophile.com/node/29655), he wrote “Swift and NuSwift, its counterpart with oldstyle figures.” Hence, I assume it is just another (unofficial/made-up/wrong) name for Swift 2.0. I posted the link to the PDF, so that Mads can confirm if that is the typeface he is looking for.\n\n"
