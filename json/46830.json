      "content": "The design goal for Poliphilus, as everyone here should know as the story is told in Talley of Types, was to provide a type so that you could set a page of Aldus’s original and have it be indistinguishable from the original. This was considered to be an error soon after, and Bembo was the result. There is a good Scangraphic version, but it may have a different name. That will probably have fitting by Albert-Jan Pool or Volker Kuester - - if it does, it would be worth looking at even for that.\n\nHowever, much though I hate to agree with Joe Clark about anything, he is absolutely spot-on in his comment. Bembo and Poliphilus look pathetic unless printed letterpress. Because our expectations of Poliphilus are lower, I have a feeling that the digital version may not be quite so disappointing.\n\nBembo Book was designed after the Monotype ’C’ photomaster, which was optimized for 13 points - - arguably not the best approach.\n\nBut seriously, if you want to use Bembo - - go to a letterpress printer! It may be cheaper than you think!\n\n"
