  "content": " **Fountain and PSY/OPS in a joint release**\n\n**Catacumba Pro** - inspired by tomb inscriptions\n\nFountain and PSY/OPS come together in a special joint release of a  \nnew typeface from Portuguese type designer Rui Abreu.\n\nCatacumba Pro is a six-weight typeface inspired by the painted  \ninscriptions of the _Igreja de São Francisco_ church's catacombs in  \nPorto, Portugal. The forms are clearly influenced by Victorian  \nstyle, with an unmistakable French heritage, and yet they somehow  \nconvey a decidedly Portuguese sensibility.\n\nCatacumba's centerpieces are its two titling styles: the exuberant  \n**Excelsa** , and the Didonesque **Moderata**.  \nFrom these two decoratives, four new cuts are derived. These,  \nthe **Text** fonts, are tamer and more understated, but maintain  \nthe same artisanal grounding and DNA as the display fonts.  \nEach Catacumba font includes a wide selection of OpenType ranges  \nand features, allowing for extensive use within the Latin range.\n\nDesigned by Rui Abreu and mastered by PSY/OPS\n\n**Catacumba Pro can be found at:**  \n [http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023021/http:/www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba \"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba\")  \n [http://psyops.com/catacumba](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023021/http:/psyops.com/catacumba \"http://psyops.com/catacumba\")\n\n**Video for Catacumba can be found at:**  \n [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzrc5ARH3k](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023021/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzrc5ARH3k \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dzrc5ARH3k\")  \n [http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba/about](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023021/http:/www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba/about \"http://www.fountaintype.com/typefaces/catacumba/about\")\n\n**For a limited time (until May 16) we are offering  \na special price of 89 Euro / 124 USD for the complete family.**\n\nThank you for your time  \nand have a nice day\n\nPeter W.
