I've excluded any that really aren't close, like Cronos, Frutiger, Formata, and Chianti.\n\nYour problem isn't that you need an alternative, it's that you need a budget. If they don't want to pay, you could:\n\n- Buy yourself the best Humanist Sans family for your general needs, and use that, since it will have to be close enough\n\n- Buy Scala Sans for yourself and use it for this job, and every other job you can get away with it since it's so trendy and desirable\n\n- institute a policy that you will always keep a healthy budget for type in future jobs as part of your expenses\n\n"
