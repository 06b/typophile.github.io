Was there one that began interestingly, but you just simply ignored after it descended into flames? Was there one thread that made you split your seams with laughter at each succeeding comment? Was there a bit of information that somehow saved your hide?

Leave it, ok? ; )\n\nI spend most of the time at typophile going through old threads and trying to follow the debates especially those related to the history of type or technical issues. Sometimes I just give up, it’s simply too much (read difficult) for me but most of the time there’s something useful and interesting or just plain funny.  \nOn a personal level I’ve learned <cite>a lot </cite>about myself. It’s a wonderful learning environment and an amazing experience so Papazian if you are reading this: I don’t hate you anymore, I think you’re super cool.\n\n"

I have to agree with those who have stated that seeing typefaces submitted for critique, the comments made about them, and the development of the faces is an amazing education.
