I look for the distinctive ends on the capital C and G...\n\nSearching the forums here I found a few references to Runic apparently being stretched manually for book covers, logos, etc, but I wondered why this would need to be done at all - usually a demand for a particular typeface doesn't go unsatisfied for very long. So I can't help feeling there must be something already out there...\n\n",
