The guiding principle in all of Linnemann’s work, accordingly, is legibility. Engelhardt used to open up glyphs such as A, M and N. Linnemann’s face VIA for the Danish Railways (DSB) has inner spaces bigger than those of Helvetica, which was the face used previously by DSB. VIA’s identity is in the lower case g, a neat feature found in more and more corporate typefaces these days. — <cite><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20141016185619/http:/cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/atypi01.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luc Devroye: Report of ATypI 2001</a></cite>\n"

The font name ›Eklekt‹ was chosen because the word ‘eclectic’ reflects the characteristics of the typeface. It means taking the best of everything. So it just did. This typeface taken all the best features of its source fonts and creates a unique font with lot’s of character.\"</cite>\n\n"

The small \"g\", that's by the way just one of the greatest \"g\" ever made is and a arrow. The font Eklekta is a mix of total 4 different typefaces. The name \"Eklekta\" means, to take the best of all and merge into something new. That's exactly what we did with this font. But beside the fact that we took elements from existing fonts, we spend a lot of work and energy in making a well design and drawn font that in it's self is quiet unique. I agree with you that this is not best practice, but in this case, the font is only used internally for the corporate design for the agency. It's _ **not** _ for sale or public available.\n\nWe just put together what we like a lot and shaped our own version from it.

Doing this in public will surely  \nhelp more people make each other happier in  \nthis case and in the future. Call me hopelessly  \noptimistic!\n\nThat's said, it's still not OK. Meaning ideally  \nsome steps should be taken, or at the very  \nleast practices should change in the future.\n\nThe \"g\" is a special case in the Latin alphabet;  \nmany people need help making it work. Maybe  \nthis isn't what happened in your case - it sounds  \nlike you were simply deeply inspired by it. And I  \nagree that the font isn't a clone of the original(s).  \nBut that does not excuse copying outlines. If you  \ndid \"spend a lot of work and energy\" making some-  \nthing (sufficiently) unique, you should have just  \nspend a little bit more energy making a new \"g\".  \nIt's really too cavalier swiping its outlines. I do  \nbelieve that inspiration is highly necessary; but  \nthis practice isn't.\n\nAlso, saying that your design is only for internal  \nuse doesn't excuse this. Via was only for internal  \nuse too and look what happened! :-/ I also have to  \nwonder how the other inspiration-fonts were used  \nin the making of Eklekta.\n\nI'm not some sort of judge, and I only want to help,  \nso here's what I recommend - it might be hard to  \nswallow: make a new \"g\" yourself (it can look very  \nclose); tell Kontrapunkt what happened; and give  \nReinhard & Ostmann the new version, even if they  \nprobably won't care (and wouldn't want to go the  \ntrouble of replacing the existing version).\n\nGood luck, and again, thank you.\n\nhhp\n\n"
