  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am in the process of designing my blog (amateur designer).\n\nWas wondering if someone would be kind enough to offer some advice on font selection for the header?\n\nTrying for a simple retro theme. Attached clip-art will feature prominently on main page. Header will be underneath.\n\nLooking for,\n\nRetro  \nSlightly comical + self deprecating  \nA little authoritative.\n\nI have been looking for a bold sans-serif (headline) but possibly with slightly irregular lettering.\n\nMaybe something like,\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/pacifico/regular/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090718151157/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/pacifico/regular/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/aerotype/pacifico/regular/\")\n\nor\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olnewsbytes/bold/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090718151157/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olnewsbytes/bold/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olnewsbytes/bold/\")\n\nSo many choices its easy to get lost !!\n\nWould appreciate any suggestions/pointers.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nMatt\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PonderingMan.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090718151157/http:/typophile.com/files/PonderingMan.jpg) | 46.77 KB |\n\n",

I searched in Veer’s type collection with the [search terms](http://web.archive.org/web/20090718151157/http:/www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=1950s%20retro%20bold%20sans&producttype=TYP&resulttab=vr&category=Type) “1950s retro bold sans”.\n\nIt may also be fun for you to have a rotating nameplate, sort of the way the T changes here at Typophile, or the way the banner changes over at [Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20090718151157/http:/new.typographica.org/). Maybe your blog won’t be so much about type, so it’s not as appropriate, but sometimes fun should win out over propriety.\n\n"
