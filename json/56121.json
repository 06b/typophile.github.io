      "content": "Hi Eben\n\nWell I just googled \"musee imprimerie nationale france\" and got [the local museum.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144659/http:/www.imprimerie.lyon.fr/imprimerie/) Although [this alternative site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144659/http:/www.garamonpatrimoine.org/news.html) might be more interesting.\n\nIf you're in Paris and you like votive statuary and inscriptional type, the cemetery Pere Lachaise is what we might call ’dead good'! They have a [nice site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144659/http:/www.pere-lachaise.com/perelachaise.htm) too.\n\n"
