Still I'd like the forum to comment on the letterspacing and such in order to give it the final refinement.\n\nThe company is a bit similar to Manpower just on a smaller scale. The final color of the logo is P877 (Silver).\n\nAppreciate it - thanks!\n\n/Henriko\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [wg01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020082225/http:/typophile.com/files/wg01.jpg) | 14.5 KB |\n\n",
