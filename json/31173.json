There was ad for Christopher Farr rugs in upscale interior design magazine and I have to say it looked pretty good in that setting. The FontFont site listed this font as PL Brazilia. Any idea what this means or who the designer(s) is?\n\nThanks,\n\nMike Diaz\n\nPS......\n\n“BTW Lari, you are indeed my favouritest Grotesque, although I wouldn’t know if you’re extended or not.
