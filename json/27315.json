I will also cover fonts designed to answer special technical needs (signage, screen, ...).\n\nMy list so far:  \n\\_ Jean-François Porchez (Mencken, Deréon, Parisine, Costa, ...)  \n\\_ Erik Spiekermann (FF, Meta, FF Info, DBahn, Nokia, ...)  \n\\_ Matthew Carter (Bell Centennial, Verdana, Georgia, ...)  \n\\_ the Clearview project  \n\\_ Nick Shinn (Richler)  \n\\_ Underware (Ulrika)  \n\\_ H&FJ (Mercury, Verlag, ...)\n\nAny other milestones I should consider? Do you have sources of informations (www, books, magazines, ...) that would ease my research?\n\nThanks for any suggestions and your help!!!!!!!\n\n",

See my web site.  \nAnd Brown Gothic and Walburn for the Globe and Mail -- although custom types designed for newspapers and magazines are a separate category, there are so many of them, Century, Times, etc. What foundries do is give the commissioning customer an exclusive licence for a limited time, and then release the face commercially. It's a great way to finance new product, although it does direct foundry output in a very staid direction, given the traditional look of newspapers, and the conservatism of the biggest market, American mass media.\n\nFor more Canadian content, Usherwood's Flange for a government program, and perhaps his face used for the launch of Canada's Wonderland, Sycamore? No doubt he did others, check with Matt Warburton, who is something of an Usherwood expert, or Steve Jackaman of Red Rooster, who publishes a lot of Usherwood faces.\n\nFrutiger was designed for an airport.\n\nThere are a lot of custom corporate faces in the UK.  \nDalton Maag makes a specialty of it.  \nMy currrent favorites over there include Jason Smith's design for Channel 4 (2004) and the national Westminster Bank typeface, by David Quay, I believe.\n\nSources: _Goudy's Type Designs_ will reveal many.\n\n"

Among them are Century (1894), Cheltenham (1896), Times New Roman (1931), Bell Gothic (1937), Californian (1939).\n\nIn my opinion, Romain du Roi is a fine example of a proprietary typeface...\n\nThe typeface for the Prussian Railroads (1905) is probably the earliest proprietary design for railway car lettering and signage. It precedes Edward Johnston's typeface for London Underground by ten years.\n\nPackard (1913), Metropolitan Oldstyle (1914), Saks-Goudy (1934), CBS Sans and CBS Didot Bodoni (196?), Bloomingdale's Gothic (197?) are some of the long-forgotten American branding typefaces.\n\nThere are two useful books on the subject: [_Branding with Type_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221211834/http:/www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568302487/sr=1-1/qid=1154489617/ref=sr_1_1/103-4457932-5827061?ie=UTF8&s=books), and [_American Proprietary Typefaces_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221211834/http:/www.printinghistory.org/htm/pubs/proprietary-typefaces.html).\n\n"

The fonts for corporations were usually designed by teams, and some of my collaborators were Lucas de Groot, Ole Schäfer, Albert Pinggera, Henning Krause, Erik van Blokland, Just van Rossum, Conor Mangat and Christian Schwartz. I know I've left some faces off the list, as I can never remember all of them and as we shouldn’t get too much credit for adaptions like Univers for Audi Sans, Frutiger Condensed for FF Transit or Futura for VW Headline. And I just noticed that I left out The Economist, so I’ll have a think, try and find the original file and post an updated **spiekertypes** image soon.\n\nIf anybody is interested, I can supply that article as a text file.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221211834im_/http:/typophile.com/files/spiekertypes06_5427.jpg)\n\n"
