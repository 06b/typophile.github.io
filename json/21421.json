Also, any automobile-inspired faces that you like in particular from that era?  \nRecommendations for display font sets from the time period would also be appreciated.  \nRevival faces that have the feeling of that time period could also work.\n\nThanks!  \nFG\n\n",

It seems that the high-contrast, condensed sans serif, most notably Radiant, can be identified with that era. But looking at Eunoia, while the caps are reasonably authentic, the lower case isn’t. I’m not sure this style is automobile-related, as such types tend to be extended, and/or slanted, qualities expressive of speed.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090410162231im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eunoia_5175.png)\n\n"

Commuting on 101 gives us an eyeful, and the most interesting logo we saw the whole time was Nubira by Daewoo. Stephen, thanks for sharing that link! I may add some pics soon.\n\n"
