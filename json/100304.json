  "content": "Hi There,\n\nI've got a brief to make a small book/booklet in the style of a \"Dockers Workbook\" celebrating one man (union leader Walt Cunningham's) life on the docks of Hull between 1950's-1980's.\n\ni have been looking everywhere for a nice clear legible serif typeface to use for my body copy , i found one that i loved FF Scala Pro Regular [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff\\_scala\\_pro/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417044900/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_scala_pro/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff\\_scala\\_pro/\") it works n perfectly with the ethos of my type having been use in books depicting democratic revolutions/movements and in Museum booklets.The elegance of this typeface is exactly what i need but don't have the € 299.00 to purchase it on a student's income.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any alternatives to FF Scala with a more friendly price tag. or any other typeface what would communicate perfectly the struggles of a working class movement which have been in mostly forgotten.\n\nThanks for any response\n\nMatt Russell\n\n[mattrusselldesign@gmail.com](mailto:mattrusselldesign@gmail.com)  \n [www.mattrusselldesign.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417044900/http:/www.mattrusselldesign.net/ \"www.mattrusselldesign.net\")\n\n",

I guess it does have some such attributes, but it also seems a bit too mannered to me here (look at that \"a\" for one thing). Something like Bookman (even though I personally don't like the way it looks) or Cheltenham (which I do like) might be better. Or do you think slabby serifs are helpful here?\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Matt, FF Scala has been used for many subjects - I have seen art and recipes books set in it - and it isn't a \"democratic\" or political typeface per se (\\*).\n\nIf you're stuck with the idea of finding a typeface related to the subject of your book, or to a particular cultural climate (the union struggles in Hull in post II world war Britain), why don't you look, for example, for a book typeface used in that period in your country?\n\nYou could try to have a look at the classic Monotype catalogue set by Stanley Morison or at the Penguin social essays published in 50/60/70's.\n\nEric Gill's work has a strong, unorthodox connection to socialist ideas in XX century Britain: perhaps you could try to have a look at his Aries, Golden Cockerel or Johanna serif types.\n\nOr, more simply, try to look for a typeface from Britain's typographic heritage - Baskerville and Miller comes to mind.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n(\\*) Martin Majoor on the origins of Scala: \"FF Scala is named after the Teatro alla Scala (1776–78) in Milan. There were two reasons for this name: FF Scala was made especially for a concert hall, the Vredenburg in Utrecht, and the design has it roots in around the time Teatro alla Scala was built, the mid-eighteenth century\".\n\n"

Not to say i don't like Baskerville (great typeface) but just feel as if would be slightly hypocritical to the narrative.\n\nI have a meeting with a manger at GF Smith's (paper) tomorrow morning and his father owned the print company that printed the handbook's and all the forms for the dockers so that could really be a positive move forward.\n\nThanks again for all the help,\n\nReally appreciated\n\n"
