  "content": "Hi :)\n\nI am looking for a typeface that says 1920's...30's...old new york, conspicuous consumption era...opera concert programme\" type of font.\n\nOne of the typefaces I am looking for is a script typeface that will work well with a bolder more masculine typeface like Copperplate. I am not too fond of Copperplate though, so if someone could suggest a similar typeface to it that would be great!\n\n(so far i have paired copperplate with bickham...but am not too happy)\n\nThanks!\n\n",
