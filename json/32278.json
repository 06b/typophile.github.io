  "content": "With technology changes in the printing industry, color matching has become a major hurdle for everyone involved in the printing process. From the computer screen, to laser printouts, followed by printer’s digital proofs that are produced on a variety of substrates using multiple chemical compounds, true color results are often confusing and disappointing. There is no consistency between the computer monitor, digital proofs and the final printed press sheet.\n\nTintbook sets a new CMYK color standard for everyone involved in the Graphic Design Industry. Working with Tintbook is the best way to achieve desired color and avoid disappointment at the printing stage. It is printed under the same conditions as any offset printing project. Tintbook shows how your colors will appear on paper before you print.\n\nMost printing projects are created with 4-colors, comprised of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black. All the colors printed in Tintbook are already created in simple CMYK formula components. Every chart page shows the percentage value for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black that are contained in each printed color. Now, using the components from these printed colors takes the guesswork out of CMYK color matching when preparing digital art files. The process is simple. The Tintbook color formulas determine that ‘what you see is what you get.’\n\nEnter the CMYK component values into the color palette of any graphic-design computer application. The Tintbook color formulas are the same no matter which design application you are using. Whether you are working in Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Quark or Corel Draw, you choose the identical Tintbook CMYK combinations. Tintbook has two volumes. Printed on Coated and Uncoated paper stocks, Tintbook shows the way color prints on different paper surfaces.\n\nTintbook creates a communication tool for printers, designers and their client. The print designer, their client and the printing vendor should work together with Tintbook to determine all are in agreement about color choices for each printing project.\n\nThe creative process becomes satisfying when everyone involved in the project is pleased with the final results. Color management is consistent from start to finish on printing projects by working with a Tintbook.
