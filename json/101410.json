It will come in both serif and sans serif and all will have the characteristic of ruff cut messiness :)\n\nShown is the stencil serif S with color fill. When all's done\\*\\* it will have three weights and one weight in stencil ...maybe two if this thing keeps growing.\n\n\\*I have something like a half dozen fonts in 'progress'.  \n\\*\\*So far I have 5 letters in satisfactory state, and some punctuation marks.\n\nJust thought I'd share.\n\nn.\n\n",
