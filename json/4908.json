So, I was thinking of making some funny typ-o-shirts myself, silkscreening them and wearing them proudly.   \n   \nI was looking for some funny one-phrase jokes, but couldn't find anything practical. The \"seems-once-it-was-funny\" link at [EyeWire](http://web.archive.org/web/20051127081729/http:/www.eyewire.com/magazine/features/bumperstuck/index.htm) is not working properly - as if all the images except for the only one were deleted or something...   \n   \nCan anyone help me with some jokes? Eh? :D\n\n",

I should know where stuff is, because I built that site. Now it's nothing more than a shell of it's former self. Hey Agfa! Ever heard of a link-checker? Yeesh.   \n   \nHowever, I did happen to archive that very page on my own site.   \n   \n [http://www.splorp.com/junk/bumperstuck/](http://web.archive.org/web/20051127081729/http:/www.splorp.com/junk/bumperstuck/)\n\n"
