I'm also working on the kerning, hinting and all things that needs to be done to make it more 'professionnal'.\n\nThanks by advance,\n\nBernard.\n\nEdit :\n\nSorry for bumping guys, but I think my post should be in this place rather than in Release, as it's still a work in progress, and I'd be very glad to get any comment.\n\nI'm not here to tell you \"Yo Dude, buy my font!\".\n\n",

I agree it might benefit from a little more polish here and there, but it's a very cool idea for a font, and seems quite nicely executed too.  \n(BTW, Motion/Experimental? I'd have put it in the «Display» category.)\n\n"

I'm always wondering if that idea is a good one.\n\nDo you think making a complete \"basic latin\" set would be useful for this kind of font ?  \nAs it can't be used for something else than headlines, I'm wondering if spending my time making it is a good thing or if It'd better for me to get a beer and start watching TV ?\n\nFor the forum, I'm a bit confused. As nobody was saying anything when I posted it in the Release section, I've reposted it in Critique/Display, then I saw \"Experimental\", so I thought it'd be better here. But I can move it back to Display if it's more appropriated.\n\n"

My first language is German, and without Ä, Ö and Ü I can't even set all headlines that I might need to. :-\\ So yes, I think making basic diacritics for this font should be a good idea – and a cool little challenge, actually. I could imagine you can come up with some pretty cool solutions.\n\n"

One thing that bothered me about the original was the counter of the Q, so I'm glad to see you've already changed it for the better. Numerals, currency, braces are great.\n\nAsterisk and daggers lack twist. I would have expected them to be all outward loops.  \nExclamation could be wider.  \nBottom half of Yen symbol should probably be a vertical rectangle.  \nAmpersand seems rigid. I'd try trading the two little loops in the upper right for one big diagonal loop.  \nFor @, I recommend starting over and not basing it on the A. I can see a big spiral with the inner end connected to the outer end.\n\n"

      "content": "This is a really innovative take on a display font. I like it lots. Not only is it very different but it's also legible. Complete it and put it out there. I'm sure it will get used. Very nice indeed.\n\nAbout your variations: I think the only one that's actually working is the middle one. Filled shapes with negative outlines. But you may as well forget about the other two. If anyone wanted to get the effect of the first variation, they can do it with the original outlined font, and the last one doesn't look good and has some legibility problems.\n\nAbout some shapes:\n\n/H/ is not good. It doesn't resemble H. When I see it in alphabet I know it's an H, but if I'd see in in text I'd have problem recognising it. All the others are.\n\n/!/ exclamation mark should be heavier. Considerably.\n\n/%/ should be changed. I suppose it wouldn't be bad to try to overlap circled with the straight\n\n/@/ although similar to how reg.trademark and copyright are done I suppose it's not a good solution. Although it makes me think who would want to write their email address using this display font (stupid of me... who would want to use Comic Sans in formal papers either?! We can see that many = this means you have to make @ recognisable).\n\n"
