  "content": "Not through searching for aeons for spectacular books on online antiquarian bookstores, but rather: followed a link in an ad-e-mail from Amazon I found the book ABC3D by Marion Bataille (no telling if she's related to the late great Georges). If you don't enjoy pop-up books you're heartless. Follow this [link](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017074244/http:/www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/m3DNVC4GL17O4J) to watch the video. Enjoy!\n\n",
