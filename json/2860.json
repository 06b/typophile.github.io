      "content": "Hi,   \n   \nThis is a very nice first effort, if I read your post correctly. It appears that your Uppercase \"S\" is falling over to the right. The lowercase \"g\" seems too wide and the bowl is too large. I would give the \"a\" and \"p\" more space where the top of the bowl meets the vertical stroke. There also appear to be some spacing issues, the uppercase \"P\" for example. Otherwise, a very nice start. Reminds me a little of Antique Olive.\n\n"

      "content": "I think this is a solid font. Many places though the curves need polish. And the weight is off: too dark for a Regular and a bit light for a Bold. Unless the intention is setting small text (~7 point), in which case the color is fine for a Regular, but then the spacing is a bit tight overall.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
