You can see it being used here [Graf Von Faber Castell](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417171255/http:/www.graf-von-faber-castell.com/), although I can not find a similar web font for the life of me. The web font is listed as 'GVFC light' so I couldn't find it that way either.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I was hoping to find some similar typefaces and then figure out if they offered a web font.\n\nActually, I couldn't find any useful information on google. I even used fonts.com and indentifyfont.com identify tools, but didn't come up with anything helpful. Hence, here I am.\n\nHere is what I found on google below. Don't worry, I am actually trying to find the answer myself and not just coming straight here. My main goal was to find some individuals who are more knowledgeable regarding type then myself. I love it, but still have a lot to learn.\n\n[Google search](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417171255/https:/www.google.com/#q=Typefaces+similar+to+Nofret+)\n\nAgain I tested other key words to find stuff, but surprisingly I didn't not find much help.\n\n"
