      "content": "Hey Joshua\n\nGet yourself an old Letraset catalogue from the early ’70s; I think the Cooper Black and the Premier Shaded both featured in their Letragraphica collection.\n\n’Waves of Change’ appears to be handlettered from two different faces; a condensed grotesque with the crossbar of ’H’ repositioned higher – and something like Avant Garde for the big round characters. That ’e’ may have been resized and redrawn from the lowercase of the same face. You could artwork this easily enough in Illustrator or Freehand, but I doubt any of it exists as a single digital font.\n\n"
