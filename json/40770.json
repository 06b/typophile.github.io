  "content": "I've seen some discussion before on here about matching Futura with a complimentary body face that is not itself, but it never really answered the question. I don't like the look of Futura in lowercase for semi longer body copy.\n\nI tried using some interesting pairings others have like IKEA with New Century Schoolbook, but my client doesn't have that earthy, warm feeling to use that. haha. The client is a commerical properties painter mostly. If that helps get ideas flowing.\n\nI'm using Futura Medium and Bold(cliche) set in uppercase for titles.\n\nWhat should i try for body? Sans serif suggestions are welcome as well. Maybe i shouldn't be so afraid of lowercase Futura, but it just irks me.\n\nThanks for the help in advance.\n\n",
