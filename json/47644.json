To me it says that Till is a creative person that comes up with exciting ideas.\n\nMaybe that is enough. Love the simplicity.\n\n"

But maybe its an idea to see the whole word as a camera and ... hm, I'll think about this.\n\n@aluminum, spire: yes, I had this symbols in other approaches - but felt the are too much in combination with the excl. mark. Although they would symbolize photography.\n\nRight now I'm struggling with the mark in another typeface like some of you suggested. Not easy, it tends to loose the simplicity ... I hope I can post some versions later.\n\n"
