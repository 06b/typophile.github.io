Alright...   \n   \n- I'd increase the word space.   \nYes, it was very needed.   \n   \n- Some of the sidebearings (like the Dalet's left) should be zero.   \nI don't agree. The terribly small size of the letters makes spacing crucial. Zeroing a sidebearing on any of the letters (I've tried numerous tracking combinations) yields very odd implications. Kerning would be super if I could get it to work... Haven't mastered that field technically, I'm afraid.   \n   \n- I like your vertical proportions, I just wonder if it wouldn't be better to give the Lamed a 2-pixel ascender.   \nYou're right on. I hate making Lamed \"ascenders\" (in Hebrew we call them \"poles\") too short, it just isn't natural. Look at this caricature from an old Hebrew calligraphy/typography teaching book:   \n ![Cutting off Lamed's pole](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144718im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28580.gif)   \n   \n- Widths: I think it's better too wide than too narrow, I just wonder if width variance can't be used to diverge the confusable letters even more, like in the Bet versus Kaf.   \nTrue, but that is not my main concern about these wider letters. I'm more troubled by the notion it makes the eye linger on them, trying to decode these odd shapes' meanings. I'd hate having to part with this incredible addition to my font.   \n   \n- Alef: what about making the top-right arm shorter (coming out from higher up in the diagonal)? That would reduce the distracting symmetry.   \nI've made it assymetrical now, correspondant with the Tzadi, which I believe is a letter meant to be similar to the Alef.   \n   \n- I really like the bravery of the Gimel.   \nThank you! It stayed that way from the 2000 version.   \n   \n- The wobble in the Zayin is valuable, but it's too jittery in small bitmaps - I'd try not bringing the down stroke back to the right after the left shift. So basically a flipped Vav (shorter by a pixel) with a flat top added.   \nShifted the upper pixel back. I don't like the idea of Zayin being too narrow, I want more-or-less similar widths for the letters, because I believe it improves readability.   \n   \n- I wonder if the Yod needs to be stronger.   \nI've widened the Yod, Vav and Nun-Sofit.   \n   \n- What about giving the (non-final) Mem an ascending pixel?   \nThat wouldn't be very wise, an ascending pixel would make it seem bigger than the other letters. I've taken off a pixel from the bottom, to emphasize its Mem-ity :\\>   \n   \n- What can you do to make the Nun less like the Kaf?   \nI've added a pixel on the bottom right edge.   \n   \n- What about giving the Samekh an extra leftward pixel on top?   \nNah, I don't want the letters to be too square.   \n   \n- Smart divergence between the Qof and the He.   \nThanks! This has also been in the 2000 version.   \n   \n- The final-Mem is too square. Hey, it is a square! What about curling in the left stem at the very top?   \nOops! Got me there.

The base matrix for this font is 5x5 pixels, meaning 25 pixels give an overhaul 100% for a single, average letter. Altering one pixel would affect 4% of the entire composition - that is a lot! And when we're talking about its perimeter, that's almost 6%, and when we're talking about a single edge, well, now we're at 20%!   \n   \n ![The font matrix](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144718im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28650.gif)   \n   \nOh, and also referring Hrant's question about making it bolder - I wouldn't dare making this specific font bolder, but when it comes to making heavy-weight Hebrew fonts, I either strengthen its horizontal strokes, or make both horizontal and vertical strokes bolder.

If italic fonts are supposed to mimic handwriting, then it only makes sense that this should be the direction of the font.\n\nTzvika likes to call italics that are in the direction of English fonts, \"italic\" and italics that are forward moving (like in David Italic aka MF Ramot in the Masterfont library) oblique. I personally think that this is an incorrect definition, but the debate will no doubt continue.\n\nFontbit has just released a new text font with real italics called ktifa, which has italics in both directions in order to keep both camps happy I guess!\n\n"
