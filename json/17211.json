My wife and I have been together since 1969 but that is peanuts compared to 50 years!\n\n\"Old newspapers prove full-justified type is a bad idea.\"\n\nJustification takes love and care in hot metal. The time pressures of a daily newspaper and narrow measures spell trouble. I'll bet that the wedding announcement pages were set by apprentices instead of the journeymen type setters too. :-)  \nToday's newspapers are far better looking. Computers really make a difference.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
