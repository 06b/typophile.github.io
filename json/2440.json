The first is from the Icelandic newspaper Morgunbladid:\n\n<center>&lt;img&gt; The second comes (oddly) from some sort of herb advert. For ages, it was wonderfully used in the british <i>Total Film</i> magazine though I could never figure out what it was. <br>&lt;img&gt;</center> Thanks so much for the help! \n",
