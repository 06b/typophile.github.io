We are limited by the capacity of the familiar lecture hall at St Bride, but there are still places available.\n\nThis day at St Bride makes an excellent post-ATypI event for those of you still in or around London; email info [at] stbridefoundation [dot] org or call +44 (0) 20 7353 3331 to register.\n\n",
