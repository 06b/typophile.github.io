  "content": "My first \\*proper\\* sans-serif. I have been labouring through the night, driven by a surge of adrenalin brought about by a university acceptance. So here it is... Dent ... at least most of teh characters. s,u,v,w,x,y,z are still to be done in lc. no uc have yet been done. Am I doing everything wrong here? It is basically a fusion of gill, verdana and others.   \n   \n ![dent](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144005im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2877.gif)   \n   \nMatthew\n\n",

      "content": "Hi matthew   \n   \na good start i would say...   \nLook at the 'c', the width of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the 'd'. Is it the same stem-width as the.   \n   \nThe horizontal stem of the 'f' and 't' is to short in my opinion. BTW: the angel of the 't' down-stroke and the 'f' up-stroke looks very different to the others round shapes. (dont need to be the same... maybe it is only my own flavor)   \n   \nThe 'n' needed a little improvement at the left stem.   \n   \n'd' where the bowl go in to the stem looks round at the punch but linear a the outside (hope you understand what i mean)   \n   \nThe 'm' is to small   \n   \nokay hope this helps a little   \n   \nGreetings Jens\n\n"

      "content": "Very nice start. Reminds me a lot of Bernhardt (Agfa) or Bernhard (Font Company). I think overall your spacing is a little tight. (Although you probably aren't addressing spacing just yet.) I agree with the remarks made by Jens overall. It looks as if you are designing a monolinear design, but I think the main vertical strokes on all the characters (which have them) would benefit from a little modulation. I'm interested to see your version of UC for this style of face. Post soon?\n\n"

But it doesn't take a genius to decipher most of what you say.   \n\\>Look at the 'c', the width of the bowl is bigger than the bowl of the 'd'   \n   \nyup, noticed that. have corrected.   \n\\>The horizontal stem of the 'f' and 't' is to short in my opinion   \n   \nI was unduly influenced by a common newspaper font in England here. You are right.   \n   \n\\>BTW: the angel of the 't' down-stroke   \n   \nAm I right in thinking you meant to say \"angle\"?   \n   \nanyway, will fix the 'm' and 'n'. I can see what you mean about the 'd' in the gif, but in fontographer it seems OK. strange.   \n   \nanyway, here is the font so far..   \n ![blit](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144005im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2879.gif)   \n   \nm still needs work, as does s\n\n"

I form germany...   \n   \nlets go on: :-)   \n'm' and 's' you saw by yourself... but look where the bowl meet the stem and compare/make it similar to the 'n' (the same to the 'r'). The 's' seems to be mirrored. You can do this I guess but I would try to do something like this:   \n(simulation)   \n ![2xs.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414144005im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2884.gif)   \n   \nThe width of 'v', 'x' and 'z' is to big, inverse the 'w' is to small.   \nFlavor: the middle stroke of the w maybe have to go up to the x-height   \n   \nThe horizontal line of the 'e' need improvement. Also the 'down'bowl as not smooth   \n   \nBTW: Please dont care about the typography name I make, maybe they are wrong..   \n   \nGreetings Jens   \nBTW: wich university is it where you will go?
