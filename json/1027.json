      "content": "First, I don't think this is a commercial font, because it looks like the logo for Dennison office products, and is probably a custom design.   \n   \nWith that said, there are a couple of fonts that have a similar style such as Holly Script (aka Quigley Wiggly, by Nick Curtis) ![QuigleyWiggly](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051116im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14693.gif), or ITC DeliSupreme ![DeliSupreme](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051116im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/14694.gif). These images came from Part 7 of the Script Font ID Guide, which has a few other styles that could also be considered similar, like Einhorn/Salut.\n\n"
