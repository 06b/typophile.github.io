The most common one is for ligatures:\n\nfeature liga {  \n sub f i by fi;  \n sub f l by fl;  \n} liga;\n\nAnd that's the most basic version of it.\n\nOT fonts only seem to work properly if they have at least one GSUB and one GPOS. (Kern is the \"big\" GPOS. GSUB is how small caps, alternate numeral sets, etc. are achived.)\n\n"
