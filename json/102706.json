  "content": "Hi,\n\nWould really appreciate any thoughts on the letter spacing of this wordmark. The U-V-E is really bugging me and I've been looking at it for too long now. Hoping that a quick glance from fresh eyes might help.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419145125im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vn_wm01_5407.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I'm no big city typographer but I'd align the lettering to a grid, even keeping the spacing the same but reduce each letter slightly.\n\nVisually, the 'V's look like they hang slightly below the baseline which creates a slight wave to the lettering, when you hit 'uve' it throws it off symmetrically. It might be a case of staring at it too long.\n\n"
