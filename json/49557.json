So can you explain me why you can see this font is gotham and not avenir?  \nthank you really much in advance  \nsorry if this question seems stupid. And my english too ;)\n\nt\n\n"

As Tommi asked, it is difficult to distinguish the difference between Avenir Heavy and H&FJ Gotham. Perhaps the 'ascenders' are quite tall, yet the 'x-height' is quite low (check that out, I've just been reading The Encyclopaedia of Fonts, yo).\n\n"
