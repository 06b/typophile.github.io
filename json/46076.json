A good value.\n\nIf you can fix the naming conventions. See this **[thread.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821125655/http:/typophile.com/node/45930)**\n\nCycles Eleven is extraordinarily readable at small point sizes, but it lacks Bold italic. And (or but) it is beautiful. The corresponding display font is Arepo.\n\nWhy do so many type designers insist on being so idiosyncratic?\n\n"
