The original type inspiration derived from an old mid-50's berthold wolpe masthead with strong, triangular serifs that I pushed very hard for. It was felt too 'masculine', and the lack of brackets caused much consternation. We tried everything from the delicate curve to the bracketless wedge, and in true committee style, it ended in middle-ground, and with the serifs reduced in weight. The masthead is based on the headline font, but is significantly different in detailing.\n\n"

That \"after 221 years\" bit is just more spin of course. I did enjoy Ellis's elaboration on the coat of arms though. Plus it's nice to see mention of logography - the idea only failed because the compositor's union sabotaged it. With logography Latin might have become something richer, since it's an idea that naturally lends itself to ligation.\n\nComing to the design itself, I actually rather like the masthead. It has a nice newsy edge to it. On the other hand I confess to being a sucker for the wedge serif! As for the headline face itself, I'd really like to see a PDF. Luke, tell them to submit to newseum.org! From the onscreen renditions it looks maybe a bit too \"emotional\", with the high contrast and cupped serifs - but I guess that's what a newspaper needs to be these days. BTW, it also seems to have a certain Dutch flavor, which is both good and bad I guess.\n\n\\> I see Luke gets a nod at the banner.\n\nAnd a slightly better mention in this new article.\n\nhhp\n\n"
