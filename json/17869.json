  "content": "Dear forum members,\n\nI’m working on my first italic font face\\*, so there is a lot to explore for me in there yet. Are there any tips, guides, books, etc. that talk about italics specifically?  \nAlso, are there special things to consider for swash characters? Are there only uppercase ones usually, or also lc?  \nEvery annotation is useful for me…\n\nSpecific question at the moment: What characters stay upright even in an italic version of a font? I’ve read about it somewhere (can’t remember where and when), and I’ve already seen typefaces, that have no italic mathematical operators. Are there more characters that stay in their roman form?\n\nThanks for your help  \nsebilar\n\n\\* an italic version of [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329213657/http:/typophile.com/node/17136).\n\n",
