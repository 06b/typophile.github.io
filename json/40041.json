      "content": "For TrueType-flavored OpenType fonts, if your font only has \"GPOS-table\" (OpenType) kerning, you will get zero kerning in applications that don't support GPOS kerning but only support \"kern-table\" (non-OpenType) kerning. Incidentally, Microsoft Office 2007 for Windows only supports kern-table kerning but the new default fonts it ships with (such as Calibri, Cambria, Constantia, Corbel, Candara) only include GPOS-table kerning. Result? No kerning at all. I'm still trying to figure out why Microsoft did here what they did. So if you make an OpenType TT font with just GPOS-table kerning, there will be no kerning at all in applications that don't support OpenType Layout.\n\nFor PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts, the operating system takes the GPOS-table (OpenType) kerning, extracts the kerning pairs for the Western codepage only, and produces a virtual kern-table kerning on the fly. So if you make an OpenType PS font with just GPOS-table kerning, there will be kerning in non-OpenType applications but only for Western codepage characters. Cyrillic, Greek or Extended Latin characters will have no kerning at all in those apps. However, if you include kern-table kerning as well, you will get kerning for the non-Western characters at least in some apps. The kern-table kerning is not officially supported by the OpenType specification, but I don't know of any situation where it would actually break anything (the principle behind the OpenType font format is that you can put whatever table you want into the font, and applications must ignore the tables they cannot process).\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch\n\n"

I wrote: \"For PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts, the operating system takes the GPOS-table (OpenType) kerning, extracts the kerning pairs for the Western codepage only, and produces a virtual kern-table kerning on the fly.\"\n\nNote that this is only true if the GPOS kerning in the font is built to certain standards (one lookup of type 2). GPOS kerning may employ other techniques as well (multiple lookups, extension lookup type 9 that allows to overcome the subtable size limitation without using subtable breaks, contextual kerning) — but if your font uses any of these, the virtual kerning conversion done by the system will no longer work, so non-OpenType applications will have no kerning, not even for Western glyphs. In such case, placing the kern-table kerning may be the only solution as well.\n\nBut still, keep in mind that the OpenType specification states:  \n\"OpenType fonts containing CFF outlines are not supported by the 'kern' table and must use the 'GPOS' OpenType Layout table.\"\\*  \n [http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/kern.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20110326211921/http:/www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/kern.htm \"http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/kern.htm\")\n\nThe spec does not say that the kern table must not be present in an OpenType PS font, nor does it state that OpenType PS fonts must use only the GPOS kerning. But it says that OpenType PS fonts with kern-table kerning are not \"supported\" by OpenType, whatever that means.\n\nA.\n\n"

But if that font is loaded into an old non OT-savvy app, many pairs will not be kerned that should be.\n\nThat really stinks. I can't wait until all apps are OT-savvy. Hopefully this will happen, and happen soon. Right now I am so annoyed when I see kerning that I have worked hard on failing to show up when I use the font in various apps. I'm trying to get all of them to show up and there are certain problem kerns I'm facing. I have many new ideas and possible solutions that I have read about lately that I'm going to try to fix this problem with, but maybe the apps I'm loading the fonts into aren't very OT-savvy and there isn't anything I can do in that situation - or is there? I'm using TextEdit 1.6 on mac, and Microsoft Word X.\n\nDoes anyone know how OT-savvy Mac's TextEdit app is? What about Microsoft Word X? The thing that I will say about these apps is 95 percent of the time it seems to me that all kerns are showing up. It's that 5 percent that is the problem. Maybe I'm being too demanding and will have to accept 95 percent as being the best I can get?\n\n"

You can explicitly convert your class-based FontLab kerning into the \"kern\" feature in the OpenType panel flyout menu, \"Generate kern feature\". If you don't do that and the option \"Generate \"kern\" feature if it is not defined\" is enabled, then FLS will generate the \"kern\" feature when generating the font.\" It asked me if I wanted to rebuild it, and I clicked yes. That fixed all my kerning problems. It looks perfect in textedit now. I haven't tested it in Word yet but my version of word is old anyway and may not be opentype savvy. But hopefully that's fine too. I'll report back on that soon.\n\nI highly recommend anyone with kerning issues to try this if they haven't.\n\nTHANX AGAIN TWARDOCH!\n\n"
