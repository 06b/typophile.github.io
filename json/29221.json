  "content": "Hi all\n\nI'm doing a project focusing on Pakistani-Bangla and maybe Indian people and I'm in search in a display font that has some sort of feeling or quality that links with these communities. The project is for 2 of the UK's major cities, so I'm looking for a latin font. I know these are communities use different alphabets. Therefore, it's difficult to find something that appeals to both. If any of you is from there and can give me some suggestions or have any ideas of types that look conformable within this target audience I'd be glad to know. Any design elements, decorative motives will be great a deal of inspiration. They just need to link aesthetically to that part of Asia, no only to Pakistan or only to Bangladesh...\n\nThanks\n\n",
