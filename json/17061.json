The logo they drew for this cover was either the inspiration for a number of such curlicue typefaces surfacing in those days, or was simply a harbinger of these creations destined to come out due to that period’s interest in 60’s and 70’s styles.</cite>\n\nRemedy was designed in 1991; Jokerman, in 1995. I think the sample is Jokerman due to the holes in the ’a’ (a-holes?).\n\n- Lex\n\n"
