Is kerning in SVG fonts supported by any web browser?\n\nI'm just trying to add kerning to my SVG fonts and it didn't work. I'm not sure what the source of the problem is, is it the lack of browser support or is it my font.\n\nAny info or reference implementation would be helpful.\n\nThanks in advance  \nEigi\n\n",
