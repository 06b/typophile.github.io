Family planning reduces the drudgery of parents, and increases the life expectancy of women, many of whom would otherwise die of complications from pregnancy or childbirth.\n\nLarge families were worth that risk in the past when infant mortality was higher, but not now.\n\nContraception in marriage reduces the danger to mothers of childbirth, and is also more humane than the rhythm method. Even if carefully practised, the rhythm method fails 20% of the time, as ovulation is too variable to predict accurately. Most dangerous, eggs fertilized at the extremities of the fertile period of the menstrual cycle — which is most likely when the method fails — are more prone to non-viable pregnancies, resulting in natural abortion of the foetus. So using condoms is less dangerous. In fact, surgically aborting “condom failures” results in less aborted foetuses than the rhythm method.\n\nCondoms are also safer than the birth control pill, which has significant side effects.\n\nOf course, these are statistical arguments based on human behaviour as it mostly is, rather than the way fundamentalists would like us to be.\n\nBTW, nice font...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123032214im_/http:/typophile.com/files/durex_6445.png)\n\n"

I believe that instead it is related to:  \n1) the ability of men and women (but especially women) to decide if they want to be married or not, and\n\n2) the ability of men and women to decide, if they are already married, that they do not want to be married any longer.\n\nBoth of these decisions used to be quite more difficult to make, and in many parts of the world are still unlikely options.\n\n"

The other big factor is late marriage. Contraception has promoted late marriage; I don’t see how you can argue otherwise, as this is the main factor that has changed. Whether this is good or bad is another issue.\n\nThe NY Times report was, however rather tendentiously written, wanting to ’prove’ the unpopularity of marriage. Here is another interpretation of the same data:\n\n“Even including the younger, supposedly “post-marriage” generation, and considering all women above the age of 30, some 61% are currently married and another 12% are widowed. In other words, nearly three-fourths (73%, a crushing majority) of all women who have reached the tender age of 30 now occupy a traditional female role as either current wives or widows - avoiding the supposedly trendy status of divorced, separated, co-habiting or single.”\n\nAlso it is still true that over 90% in the US marry during their lifetimes. The lower numbers currently married primarily reflects late marriage and divorce, not a lack of desire to marry. However, marriage has, in a very bad sign, become increasing divided by class, with the poorer people less likely to marry, and more likely to raise children alone.\n\n"

Sometimes it gets heated here: abortion, illegal immigrants, sexuality, morality, the war, etc. These topic have absolutely ZERO connection with typography and most moderators wince at threads as these. Be yourself without trying to hurt others is name of the game. :-)\n\n"

What about statistical modeling packages and GRASS and things like that which are used at public universities around the world? Should college students be forced to go into debt to buy commercial software, when kind-hearted and socially responsible developers want to give them something for free?\n\nI honestly have never encountered vitriol directed at people who let their intellectual property be used for the good of everyone. I had no idea that an opinion like yours even existed. However, viva la difference, right?\n\nand on another note: I think God is probably the best and worst of all social constructions (math would be the other, probably). Maybe not quite as much good has been done in its name as bad, but a lot of good that - in a world that believes in things like angels and fairies and easter bunnies - probably wouldn’t have happened without the fear of or love for God.\n\nCan’t we all just get along?
