I suppose it takes a real-world connection to retain these things.\n\nBut speaking of FontShop, I notice Scangraphic often has a lot of these unique typefaces for a fraction of the price. How does the quality match up to competitors such as Elsner+Flake?\n\n"

Incidentally, E+F isn’t much of a competitor because they now own Scangraphic.\n\nIncidentally again, Anna and I reviewed Stilla for [Printmag.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919072403/http:/printmag.com/design_articles/HotTypeStilla/tabid/260/Default.aspx) last month.\n\n"
