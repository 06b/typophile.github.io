This definitely infringes our patents.   \n   \nThey didn't even change the em square either, so it's easy to see that the outlines seem to be stolen too (modulo conversion to TrueType), which would violate our copyright as well.   \n   \nI've pointed our legal and anti-piracy folks at it.   \n   \nT\n\n"
