  "content": "Hi,  \n(Point 1) Have been running my font through Font Validator and researching, and I cannot in layman's terms find an explanation or definition of 'head.yMax'\n\n(Point 2) Also noticed that Font Validator nearly finds fault with every Font I own that I run through it. What is it with that?\n\nI run free & nasty fonts off the web through Font Validator.  \nProblems found with the font.\n\nBeautifully designed and reputable commercial fonts through it.  \nProblems found with the font.\n\nFonts that come with Apps through it.  \nProblems found with the font.\n\nFont Validator normally has issues with most of my fonts.  \nYet, the Fonts run correctly in real life?\n\nSo I think, what chance has a newbie got with Font Design when Font Validator picks out something on every font!...whether it's processes or standards being left out,wrong sizing, contours or nodes not being to its liking, etc?\n\nPlease comment on either point.  \nCheers\n\n",

Regard results as hints -- in the end it is _you_ who decides if this or that is an error or not.\n\n"
