The competition was a great success - see the 5 winners and 5 answers in the section below. Our congratulations go out to the winners, and our thanks to everybody who took part. We were able to persuade the foundries mentioned in the answers to put in place some great promotions relating to the competition - see the Promotions section for details. Rest assured, we'll be thinking of more fun competitions in the near future!   \n   \nI'm pleased to announce we've now got on sale the complete Scriptorium collection. On our recent review through the collection, we were struck by (among other things) the mouth-watering collection of initial letter fonts. (Check out also the new \"Sattler AS\" from ASType.) Such fonts contain highly ornate alphabets, traditionally used as \"drop capitals\" at the start of chapters in books; we've also seen them used well on greetings cards and websites. (Most word processors and page layout programs have a \"drop cap\" feature: select the font you want to use, choose \"drop cap\", tweak the position, and it's done.) Typographic health warning: Using more than one decorative initial per page may overload the esthetic faculties of your readers!   \n   \nThis month sees the debut of the Masterfont collection of Hebrew typefaces - read more below about this definitive collection, designed by award-winning type designers. Interesting to note that the interest in pixel fonts - producing and consuming them - shows no signs of abating. For web design using Flash, there's no more precise way to create menus and lay out text. The latest entrant is Pixietype (read more about them below) - who use a clever new method to reduce the blockiness of these fonts. A special mention goes out to Pr\n\n",
