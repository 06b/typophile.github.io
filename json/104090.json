  "content": "Hey y'all,\n\nI had the pleasure of having a piece of lettering and illustration accepted to the newly formed, designer-driven, profit sharing t-shirt company Cotton Bureau. I have two more days to achieve 3 more pre-orders, or nobody gets to sport my intricately crafted design. Would love to see this go to print and worn with pride, I'm not sure why I didn't think to post this here earlier.
