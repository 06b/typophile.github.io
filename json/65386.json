  "content": "Help! I hate the childish, inconsistent, heavy-handed scrawl that passes for my handwriting. However, I'm not much happier with the readily available learn-at-home alternatives: italic or modern cursive. They are legible, but that's about it. They reek practicality, without having elegance or sophistication or individuality.\n\nI am looking for a font to use as a model for my handwriting. My ideal would be something modern, distinctive, legible, fairly easy to write quickly and arresting or \"cool\" (whatever that means when applied to handwriting). A lot to ask, I know.\n\nI would so appreciate any suggestions. Thank you in advance for your help.\n\nNick\n\n",

I'm asked to address special envelopes and such.\n\nMy handwriting started to become distinctive after I took art school classes in Lettering 101. We first learned a basic upright style using a broad-nibbed pen.\n\nI stopped writing in the slanted, cursive style I was taught in 3rd grade (Palmer?). To me, that seems to result in sloppiness, with the letters all too often running together and resembling each other (m-n-w-i-e).\n\nI started writing habitually in an upright, unconnected style, with each letter formed separately, with a 2-story \"a,\" and large capitals. When written hurriedly, the letterforms are more dramatic.\n\nIt resembles [Genial](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420150058/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/genial/)\n\nor [Coral](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420150058/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/coral/)\n\n"

I also write differently depending on the pen I'm using.
