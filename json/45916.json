  "content": "I don't know why I didn't notice this before. The Fontlab \"Insert\" command is one of the most useful things I have discovered in a while. It's basically a paste command that will paste the points in the clipboard in the place of the points selected in the glyph window. Here is the use case: you have have drawn out your whole font, and all of the sudden you decide that you want to add another subtle curve to each serif. You can:\n\nA. tweak them all by hand (could take years)  \nB. Try the find/replace (also cool), but since there are likely to be a few points that got bumped here and there it won't work.\n\n[or]\n\nC. Copy the fixed serif, and Command+Shift+V insert paste the fixed version on top of each serif. Voila! All of your serifs are now updated.\n\nIt's a simple command, and I don't know why I didn't see it before, but I'm glad it found it. It's also great if you just want to make sure that all of your serifs are the same, and haven't wandered around too much.\n\n",

Actually I initiated [a thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140135/http:/typophile.com/node/37262) long while ago but didnt get many replies. Please add this shortcut to that thread so that later we can compile a pdf and float over.\n\nThanks\n\n"
