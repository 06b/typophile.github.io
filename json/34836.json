  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nFirst post and so on - but I’ve been lurking around as a guest for a little while now. I love the site, the design and the ideas discussed - hope I can add something to the discussion where appropriate, but warning now, self taught know-nothing in most respects...\n\nSo - the question - I was wondering if there was a respectable open source or free-to-use (for non-commercial applications even) win32 or OSX program that people are using to build fonts with?\n\nWhat kind of programs are used to make fonts for linux distributions too? Is there a gpl tool which is used... or are people using commercial applications to build things which are then donated to the distirbutions..?\n\nThanking kindly!\n\nDan\n\n",

      "content": "The most established such tool is FontForge. It started out as something of a Fontographer clone for Type1 fonts only, but has grown considerable sophistication for TT and OpenType as well.\n\nMy own fonts, including Inconsolata, are developed using my [Spiro](http://web.archive.org/web/20091107124024/http:/levien.com/spiro/) tools. The underlying math is quite sophisticated, but the polish and packaging to make it a smooth, easy-to-use app is absolutely not there yet. I will continue to chip at the code in support of those goals, but I expect progress to be very slow unless considerable new energy comes into the project from other collaborators.\n\nSee also Dave Crossland’s talk at [LGM](http://web.archive.org/web/20091107124024/http:/www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2007/program.html) (audio and video links of the presentation inside that link). There is a bit of information about less mainstream tools on the [OFLib Wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20091107124024/http:/openfontlibrary.org/wiki/index.php/Tools) as well.\n\nBest of luck!\n\n"
