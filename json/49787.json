We already have K and S for that sound, so who really needs X?\n\nShould I include X in my fonts or should I leave that one out?\n\nI think, I think so.\n\n [‹ fontlab question contours don't close/connect](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201135657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49980 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typophile: Do we need it? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201135657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49795 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Like I said in [this other post](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201135657/http:/typophile.com/node/49788), about 15 years ago, I created for myself a phonetic alphabet in which all unnecessary or redundant characters were either omitted or re-assigned new sounds. I used the x to precede long vowels and did away with the silent e and all other letter formulas we use in the English language to indicate long vowel sounds. And I created a brand new letter to indicate the long bowel sound.\n\nThe alphabet was first called Planetease, and then I changed it to Earthish. I even matched it up to <cite>Twinkle Twinkle</cite> (that’s <cite>Sparkling Stella</cite> for the music snobs), like the real alphabet song. I showed it to my mom and she could actually read it without instruction. I thought I was a genius for a little while and it was a neat way to journal but then I quit using it.\n\n"
