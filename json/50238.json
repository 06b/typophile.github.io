Those are close, but I went with Bodega Sans and extended it and letterspaced it to mock it up close enough. I know, blasphemy to the true typograher nature, but I got over that a few years ago when I quit priding myself on being able to duplicate logos. I figure if I’d been born in Michelangelo’s time I’d be making a living duplicating works of art instead of creating them. Rick Kirkman\n"
