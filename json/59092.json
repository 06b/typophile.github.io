  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm working on a typeface with two versions of each character. I made two sets and called them @set1 and @set2. Every set has five characters after which I like to 'swap' to the other set. The characters are C E J S Z and c e j s z.  \nFor example. I like to go like this: ABCdeFGHIJklmnopqrsTUVWXYZabcDE etc  \nI can't get the code working, can somebody help me?  \nThanks!\n\nPieter\n\n",
