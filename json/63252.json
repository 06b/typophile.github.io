  "content": "Hi folks. Need some help ID'ing the fonts in the new Renaissance Hotels logo. Apologies for the small sample; it's the only one I could get:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021243im_/http:/typophile.com/files/br_logo_186x94_4680.gif)\n\nSo, any ideas for the sans-serif there? My guess is the 'R' is a custom jobbie, but if anyone could suggest what font it may have started off as (if any), I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\n",
