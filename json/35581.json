It works great for display and text, and it also seems to hold up pretty well when printed at low resolutions (like inkjet). My only complaint is that the g tends to stick out a little in text blocks, but I've been very pleased with it.\n\nCultura is also one of my favorites. The shapes are beautiful and the spacing is a little wider than normal, so it reads a little more smoothly in my opinion. I'd love to see it available in OpenType.\n\n"

There is also a further discount when buying full families – well worth the buy.\n\nI bought Cultura a few months ago for a job (soon to be completed) and I’m more than pleased with it. My only problem is that it would be handier in Opentype format.\n\nSo… buy buy buy!\n\n"

The price was too good to turn down. Volupia likewise, great price and perfect for some quirky theatre production.\n\n"

As it stands, if a project that needed that sort of treatment came up, I wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price for it at all. The amount of work Dino puts into them is evident and certainly worthwhile.\n\n"

I also like very much Ezzo, even if it seems to me a bit decorative (perhaps this isn't the right word, pardon my English) and better suited as a display than a text face. Did anybody try that?\n\n\\> _Estilo and Estilo Script were just too cool to pass up for how cheap they were._  \nSo true!\n\n"
