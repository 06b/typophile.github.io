I've tried to get a sample, but for some reason I can not create a registered account on CBS web site. Other attempts to get a sample, are from countries other then the US and the font a different. The font in question appears to be Celtic, with dropped caps.

Your sample does have similarities. The cap \"D\", in the screen credits is very distinctive. Celtic, most likely But calligraphy/brush stroke characteristics. What is the font you presented???\n\nAgain thinks for your help\n\ngary\n\n"

Guess that's a factor in my baldness\n\nAlso, concerning the font in question, I have come to the conclusion that it is not Tempus Sans. I captured an image of the font off a DVD and while there are a few similarities I have to continue looking. Is there a way to include Jpg file in my post. I'll include my email address if anyone is interested in continue the search. I can atleast reply with the image.  \nLink to show [http://www.cbs.com/primetime/medium/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102044528/http:/www.cbs.com/primetime/medium/ \"http://www.cbs.com/primetime/medium/\")\n\nCherrio\n\n[formula1.unitedstates@gmail.com](mailto:formula1.unitedstates@gmail.com)\n\n"
