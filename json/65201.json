It's something I have been trying to ID â€¦ without any success. It appears similar to Aldus, but it's not; the r is especially hard to match.

Its T serifs angle inward and the upturn on the r is sharp, not curved (see the following image for comparison). Identifont's \"by similarity\" engine didn't suggest any good solutions, by the way.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202112018im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Belwe_Tr_5649.jpg)\n\n"
