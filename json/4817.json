The other possibility, now that I look at it closely, is that it could be Monotype's clone of ITC Bookman, Bookman Oldstyle, with swashes added, and the cap \"S\" taken from the original Bookman swash characters.   \n   \nI think I need a vacation.\n\n"

Tango BT is nice, but I'd love something that includes some of the lowercase swashes, too, for when I need that full 70s feeling. Especially that \"r\" that just reaches up over it's neighbor. It's so bad it's good!\n\n"
