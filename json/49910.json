You might need more.\n\nThe bold 'e' (\"Boulevard\") gets too clogged - you will likely have to compromise on the equal stroke widths to make it work.\n\nThe spines of 's' and 'S' look like they're trying a little a little too hard to reach horizontal in the middle.\n\n"

      "content": "First thing that strikes me is optical correction. Even when you are making a typeface based only on geometrics, optical corrections are really important.\n\nProblem areas are:\n\nWhere strokes join a stem (e.g. on the a, c, d, g, and also the r !) Usually it looks better optically if you let the strokes become _slightly_ thinner where they join the stems. Eventhough this goes against a geometrical approach, it will look better. It will, for example, eliminate evil black blobs from appearing. You create some open space.\n\nAlso horizontals. Those should be slightly thinner than other strokes. This is because our eyes make horizontal lines look heavier. You have to adjust this by eye, so that it _looks_ the same weight as the rest. Look at your 'e' for example (especially in the bold 'Boulevard). Lightly thinning up the crossbar will also open up the counter(s).\n\nThe same goes for diagonal lines, those usually also look fatter when they are actually exactly the same as the other strokes. Those need adjustments by eye as well.\n\nSo you have to 'cheat' here and there: it's all about _making it look_ geometrical. Apart from that, I think you are nicely on your way. You could ask yourself if people are waiting for another geometrical sans serif, since the competition in that area is pretty heavy. But designing it for yourself; as a means of learning type design, it's perfect. :)\n\nFor better critiques on lettershapes themselves, it's best to post a PDF, so people can take a better look at them (and maybe even print it so to be able to judge it even better).\n\n"

      "content": "@eliason  \nI myself seems to be bothered at how the S's intersect in between. Looks like they are not meeting up smoothly as it should be. I'll fix that soon.\n\n@Quincunx  \nthanks for some wonderful tips and will surely have a play on that optical illusion technique.\n\nI've Attached a pdf file of the family(except the dot version). I didn't include the dot version since i am having a problem importing the paths i made in illustrator to FL without having too much distortion. It looks ok in small to medium sizes but really messed up in a close up view. Any tips regarding this will be appreciated.\n\n"

      "content": "What kind of messing up do you mean?\n\n[edit]\n\nDo you mean the vectors getting all ugly? Since it seems this also happened to the dashed version. If I zoom in very close on some of the dashes, they aren't all nicely rounded and neat. They have... bulges on them. It looks like the control handles have gone bezerk.  \nNot quite sure what you can do about this. Possibly upping the UPM size could help (i.e. the grid is now too coarse).\n\n"

I have tried 2000 and it seems better than before but not yet perfect and the bulges are still noticeable.\n\n@eliason  \nnice read indeed..\n\nAlso, i have uploaded another pdf. I have changed the squiggle in letter Q to avoid touching problems in some letter combination (i.e. QATAR). Let me know what you think about it.\n\n"

If 2000 wasn't working, I doubt 2048 will make much of a difference though...\n\nMaybe there are other ways to keep the rounding nice and clean, but I don't know how. Maybe someone else has any ideas. If it weren't such complex shapes, I would edit it by hand, but that's not really an option here I guess.\n\n"
