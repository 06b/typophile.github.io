I never was really into that whole scene so I am somewhat lost.\n\nI am just beginning my search, so I don't have much information. I'm going to be looking around online tonight, but I decided to start off with a post in case anyone had some suggestions or interesting type-faces that are out there.\n\nBembo\n\n",

I'm trying to have maybe a typeface with similar qualities, or something else unique that someone could suggest.\n\nI will lists some bands I have been looking at. A lot of their logos are modified type, so its hard to tell what they are.\n\nPink Floyd  \nLed Zeppelin  \nRolling Stones  \nTwisted Sister  \nThe Who  \nAerosmith  \nThe Doors  \nKiss \\*\\* I am leaning toward a type similar to this.  \nACDC \\*\\* This gothic look is also interesting.  \nGuns n Roses  \nVan Halen  \nThe Eagles\n\n"
