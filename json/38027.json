But if you like that black style I'd recommend a look at identifonts search with the key [»Font similar to Black Boton Bold«](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822153118/http:/www.identifont.com/similar?5DD) or the excellent Fontfeed-Feature from Stephen Coles [»Extra Bold to Ultra Black Fonts«](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822153118/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/extra-bold-ultra-black-fonts/), especially the category »The Blackest« (Scroll down).\n\nBTW, without the redirect-thingamajig it is verryvery easy for us users outside the USA to visit the fontshop.com-fontfeed. Wasn't always as comfortable. Thanks.\n\n"
