  "content": "whoa. awesome, Winston! thanks for finding that huge logo.\n\ni actually came back to this thread to repost some more images we dug up, but neither are as good as your find. my original hutches based on the first tiny sample were off, and it's obviously not Microgramma (though strangley, we found images of one of the channel's old sister networks, which did use Microgramma-- tiffany must have some sort of logotype ESP).\n\ndoesn't seem to be Cosmos. we here are thinking that it may be a custom typeface or just one that was never resurrected into a font. likely to be a french designer, maybe someone associated with Adolphe Cassandre due to its similarities to Peignotn and Anisette.\n\nanyone have any thoughts?\n\n[http://www.jfrarier.net/logotv/view.php?nom=gtf1-2](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829112229/http:/www.jfrarier.net/logotv/view.php?nom=gtf1-2)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [television\\_francaise\\_2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829112229/http:/typophile.com/files/television_francaise_2.gif) | 6.71 KB |\n\n",
