Does anyone know when Volvo Broad was designed? Elston was digitized in 1993, but I don't know what year Usherwood's original dates from.   \n   \nI know OF Jan Middendorp: I barely know him, as he kinda replaced me after I left in the mid-nineties.

I used to do this kinda stuff for a living when I was the local so-called \"type expert\" at FontShop Belgium (I used to study the FontBook nightly before going to bed, which proves how type-nerdy I can get). You're right about the attractiveness of Volvo Broad: the vertical stress in combination with the rounded corners give it a nice tension, making it an extremely sexy face.   \nAnd Scoles, don't you go stealing my thunder: I was the one who pointed out at the beginning of this thread that Volvo Broad was \"completely proprietary\" (which proves what a vain glory-hound I am) ;P   \n   \nAs far as similar faces go: although there's more than enough condensed grotesks out there, the typical straight \"S\" (almost a mirror image to the \"Z\"), \"C\" and \"G\" with horizontal endings, as well as the signature \"W\" make it extremely hard to find a substitute. [Berthold Block](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112232433/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90004.html) Extra Condensed is the closest match I can think of. It has the vertical stress, the rounded corners, the signature \"W\" et al, but its wobbly outlines lack the tension of the real thing.\n\n"
