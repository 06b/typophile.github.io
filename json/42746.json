      "content": "<cite> &gt; Hard to believe that huge news companies don’t have composition systems that include basic typography elements.</cite>\n\nNot all that hard for me to believe, actually. Consider: Through much of the 20th century, the vast majority of newspapers used Linotype systems for setting their newspapers. As we all know, Linotype metal technology did not allow for kerning. Most faces included f-ligatures, but they were time-consuming to implement, so they weren't really used in newspapers. (Imagine if you had to actually type shift-option-5 every time you wanted an ﬁ ligature, instead of today's software handling it for you.) But since Linotype f's were designed not to crash, it wasn't really an issue.\n\nI can imagine a pretty straight line from that predominant newspaper technology through the development of digital pagination systems for newspapers, with the result that today there are still many such systems without the kinds of typographic niceties that we take for granted in other applications.\n\nI'm not defending, just trying to reason out an explanation.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

Quality may have been higher when craftsmen were doing the work, rather than machines, but it has never been a concern of the proprietors.\n\nAsk at any newspaper how many proofreaders are left. If there are any, it will be less than 5% of what there was 40 years ago. Are reporters spelling better? I somehow doubt it.\n\nFinally, I am reminded of a story about when the first pagination systems were coming out.

The other part is that the original development of pagination systems, following on what came before, probably did not put a premium on new features. There is a good chance that much of the layout infrastructure is still built upon something very close to the initial systems. The older and larger the paper, the more likely that would seem to me.\n\nNewspapers are massive undertakings, with very intricate and interdependent editorial & design interfaces/workflows.

Before you know it, the entire works was dominated by the software, primarily because of a newspaper's primary source of revenue, the ads.\n\nThese systems are designed for the placement of ads, keeping track of ads, and billing for ads.

So it's easier to tuck the ball of \"f\" and the dot together in display type. Nonetheless, it can sometimes be a bit of a trade-off, and I think the ball of the Chicago \"f\" and the ear of the Nicholas Bold \"f\" are a bit twee, but not hopelessly so, and they do combine neatly.\n\nLigatures may not really be appropriate for headline type, in as much as they are too fussy for news. So they have the opposite effect to their original function at text size. Is it possible that for ordinary readers the typophile-offending example Chris posted is fine, and a ligature would be problematic?!\n\nIMO the ideal solution is a \"ligature\" glyph (or contextual alternates), but with non-ligating forms nuanced for good fit, but of course, that won't work with CCI just yet.\n\n"
