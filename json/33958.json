If you superimpose a capital \"U\" on a capital \"S\" then drop the lower part of the \"U\", what you end up with is a version of the dollar symbol with two strokes. This theory was endorsed by the American libertarian philosopher and staunch defender of capitalism, Ayn Rand, in her novel Atlas Shrugged. Chapter 10 is entitled the Sign of the Dollar. Rand claimed the dollar sign was the symbol not only of the currency, but also the nation, a free economy, and a free mind.\n\n**Origin of the Euro:**\n\nArthur Eisenmenger designed the € as a generic symbol of Europe years before the new currency was mooted. 'I drew it without much consideration,' he said in an interview some years ago. 'I wasn't thinking of the Euro at the time, but just something that symbolized Europe.'\n\nSo my guess would be they chose the Latin R for Russia, not Ruble, and that the symbol should represent Russia more than just a simple mark representing the type of currency.\n\n"
