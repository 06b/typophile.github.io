Or they are really the same with another name?\n\n",

      "content": "As far as I can tell, the proper name of the attachment is 'hook'. 'Tail' is a description, just like \"i-bar\", \"h with stroke\", \"turned h\", \"small capital R\", \"turned y\", and lots of others, rather than the mouthful \"ulveolar front labial trill\" they describe. Font creators are not that good in phonetics.\n\n(On the other hand, I suspect the guys at IPA sometimes just make up characters as they write. \"Anyone got dibs on a _mirrored_ small capital upside down R? No? Okay, it's mine!\")\n\n"

The Unicode Consortium's name for a given character or feature doesn't always agree with the IPA's name.\n\nThe \"tail\" and \"hook\" are indeed the same thing (the feature that indicates retroflexion); you will probably need at least two versions, one for letters like ɖ and ɳ where the tail is an extension of a stem or leg, and another for ʂ and ʐ where the tail is an appendage to a horizontal stroke. If you need more fonts with IPA characters for reference, you could also look at Gentium, Charis SIL, Doulos SIL, and Andika Basic, all available from [SIL](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131142242/http:/scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&cat_id=FontDownloads).\n\nNice to hear you're putting IPA characters in your font!\n\n"
