  "content": "Hello Typophiles\n\nAttached is the results of the first serious attempt I've taken to design a font, I'm 20 and a student studying Graphic Design, previously I have only really edited existing faces, (please be gentle, this is my first time at the rodeo).\n\nI've tried to make it kooky and memorable, while still having a consistent approach. This is a headline display font, hence how little stroke variation there is, and I think it can only go as small as 24pt before it gets too weird.\n\nI was inspired by a pair of unique street signs in my home town of Wellington, but through further development I found myself looking at the type used in the Tintin magazines of my childhood. I can also definitively say Colophone's incredible Raisonne and Grilli Type's entire catalogue were guiding hands as to the boundaries between feature and distraction that I'm trying to balance.\n\nFor some strange reason, I started with a bold weight. Will eventually move this down to Normal & Light.\n\nPlease let me know what you think, dying to hear.\n\nSeb\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled\\_2nd-Draft.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160159/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled_2nd-Draft.pdf) | 319.2 KB |\n\n",

I know you said this is a display face, but if you're going to include that stuff then you might as well make them awesome.  \nIt is odd that you still haven't decided on a name, imo.\n\nRest of it looks pretty boss.\n\nHere's my first typeface as well if you wanna check it out. I haven't made as much progress as you.
