Real life takes time I guess :-)\n\nAnyway, I'm looking for some inspiration and new blood to my font collection, so I'm hoping to find a list of favorite fonts from leading brand designers in the world. I have found some examples on [http://fontsinuse.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804220833/http:/fontsinuse.com/ \"http://fontsinuse.com\") (amazing site!).\n\nAny links people?\n\nTIA and Merry X-mas :-)\n\n/S\n\n",
