  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm designing a UI for a kids video game and I had chosen House Industries CoopBlack display face to do some of the titling.\n\nWe've been doing some testing with an early years education centre, and they have raised the issue that kids in the game's age group (2-4) have not yet been taught to read capital letters. Unfortunately CoopBlack is caps only!\n\nThere is a lower case version of the face which was created by Christian Schwarz for Toys R Us, but it's not publicly available: [http://www.orangeitalic.com/coop.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20140404190142/http:/www.orangeitalic.com/coop.shtml \"http://www.orangeitalic.com/coop.shtml\")\n\nCan anyone recommend a similar fun and chunky display face with a lower case?\n\nAll suggestions greatly appreciated!\n\n",
