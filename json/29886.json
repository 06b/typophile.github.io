  "content": "I notice that a bunch of [Typowiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20121028120551/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typowiki) pages have just been renamed. (To name one example, wiki/faq\\_free has been renamed wiki/faq\\_free\\_fonts. For other examples, go to the [Wiki FAQ index](http://web.archive.org/web/20121028120551/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FAQs) -- three of the articles in the list seem to have vanished, because they have been renamed.)\n\nWho is making these changes? Did anyone think it through?\n\nAll of those pages are already linked-to from other Wikis, and those links don't work anymore. (They're also linked to from outside the Wiki, to be sure.) If all the current Wiki entries are now filled with bad links, that reduces the usefulness of the Typowiki.\n\nDistressingly, when you go to the OLD address, you get a page which says that the entry does not exist -- and which invites you to create one. Soon we'll have people creating new entries for subjects which already have them.\n\nSo, two possible solutions: Is the person who is renaming the pages willing to change the names back? If not, can that person create referring pages, so that people will be automatically sent to the newly renamed page?\n\nSkylar\n\n",

In the meantime, I've just set up a dorky referring link on the [old Faq\\_free page](http://web.archive.org/web/20121028120551/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FAQ_Free) which takes you to the new (renamed) one.\n\nNote to other users: if you've been maintaining certain Wiki pages, you might want to check that they're still where they used to be. If they're not, you might consider setting up a manual referring page the way I did.\n\nSkylar\n\nP.S. In the two hours since I set up the referring link on the old page, that page got 51 hits.\n\n"

Who is doing this? What's going on? I've been maintaining that page with a high degree of sensitivity and care.\n\nIt would be great if some of the moderators on this site could look into this and join this discussion so it's not just me wondering aloud to myself. =)\n\nSkylar\n\n"

I agree, by the way -- the new page address was more elegant.\n\nBut let's keep in mind that the Wiki pages, when renamed, seem to disappear.\n\nPersonally, I think the answer is to leave the current inelegant addresses alone, and to name future pages more elegantly! =)\n\nOne person's opinion.\n\nSkylar\n\nP.S. What about all the other articles that seem to have disappeared? Were they also renamed? For example, on the main FAQ page, [http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQs](http://web.archive.org/web/20121028120551/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FAQs \"http://typophile.com/wiki/FAQs\"), two other FAQs (besides the \"free\" FAQ) have disappeared. Are you planning to change those back, as well?\n\n"
