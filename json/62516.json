It is named after Ferdinand Theinhardt, a punchcutter and type designer (Halle 1820–Berlin 1909), whose radical design approach led to the contemporary modern sans-serifs.\n\nFrançois Rappo developped the Theinhardt family after researching the DNA of Grotesks from the early 20th century to design an optically optimized contemporary font family organized in a wide range of weights.\n\nReleased in OpenType format only, it features extended latin character set, tabular and proportional figures, contextual and stylistic alternates, case-sensitive forms and arrows.\n\n[Download the Theinhardt Specimen pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134416/http:/www.optimo.ch/~opt_stock/Optimo_Theinhardt_Specimen.zip)\n\n[Optimo](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134416/http:/www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=22)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134416im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Theinhardt_3583.gif)\n\n",
