Kinda similar philosophies.\n\nObviously, the Bauhaus works incorporate those ideals. Might be a place to start. and as the learned gentleman above says, building signage is a good place to look for an architects type discipline.\n\nPersonally, I think van de Rohe would have been a fan of Futura.\n\n"
