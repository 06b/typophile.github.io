First post here, although I've been frequenting the boards for a while.\n\nSo a brief summary of the concept... After moving to Wellington, NZ a few months ago, I began working on this as an observation/exploration of the type and design in the area. I was originally particularly struck by the Wellington logo(see below) but wanted to try to come up with something that would be a little more practical, while reflecting some of the more conservative signage around the city.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wellingtonlogo_5694.png)\n\nOriginally I intended for this to be a display face, but I'm thinking I'd like to get it to work at smaller sizes such as 8 or 10pt. I haven't worked too much on the spacing yet, and still have a few glyphs to fill out. The PDF below has all the glyphs I've completed and some text samples.\n\nI'm fairly new to typeface design, so I'm sure there's lots of room for improvement on this. Any thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [otariComp.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105/http:/typophile.com/files/otariComp.pdf) | 52.61 KB |\n| [otariComp19.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105/http:/typophile.com/files/otariComp19.pdf) | 472.53 KB |\n| [otariComp026.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105/http:/typophile.com/files/otariComp026.pdf) | 271.16 KB |\n| [OtariJan23.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105/http:/typophile.com/files/OtariJan23.pdf) | 848.5 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "How do!! Looks really nice. I like the concept. The first thing that stuck out for me was the lower case e, it seems too sharp compared to the rest of the glyphs. Something else that strikes me is the little serif you have on the capital H, I, K, L and U. Why isn't it replicated on the B, D, E, F, J, N, P and R? It could be too much if it was done, but at the moment it doesn’t seem to be solid; the L's stick out in \"wet lands plan approved.\" maybe it is just that one sentence? The lower case looks very good though. Again I like where it’s going!\n\nStef\n\n"

The serifs on the caps is something I've been struggling with, and I'm glad you brought that up. I was trying to follow the logic of the lowercase, with the serifs being more of an entry and exit to the glyph, inspired partly by the scripty l, i and n from the logo. But it is kind of awkward and inconsistent in its present form. I'll give it a try with the serifs carried all throughout, as well as without any, and let you guys have a look.\n\nThanks again.\n\n"

      "content": "A fuller crit...\n\nThis looks really nice in text. I like the wide tracking and leading and think the serifs work very nicely...I'd add them to lots more letters, especially caps. The contrast is really nice and the glyphs seem to flow well and make nice word shapes. It's also really nicely drawn.\n\nThe glyphs I'd look at are:  \nA: looks narrowish.  \nD: maybe a hair too narrow?  \nG: maybe a bit wide and/or the bottom corner could be lower?  \nH,I: nice serif treatment.  \nM,N: Nice joins.  \nP: deeper bowl?  \nV,W: Nice like the M and N.  \nY: a bit narrow?  \nZ: corners a bit too pointy; try bevelling more?\n\na: seems to need narrower sidebearing on the right.  \ne: bevel the nose? or curve the crossbar?  \nf: wider crossbar?  \ng: ear looks stumpy and sad. Needs more energy I think.  \nk: what about a looped arm? It's got a very pointy terminal.  \no: pull out the bcps from the nodes more, it looks too oval.  \nr: terminal needs more oomph at the end. Try cutting it more vertically?  \nt: see f. Foot may need to be wider too.  \nu: looks ever so slightly too wide.  \nw: pull the feet apart more? Looks light.  \nz: see Z.\n\nNumerals: lovely. The join on 9 needs thinning.\n\nThe punctuation is really neat. Comma and quotes look a little too fiddly/detailed. The tail is very thin.\n\nGood work, keep going :)\n\n"

If not, should I give it a full serif treatment, or just get rid of them? I also added a few serifs to the diagonals in the lowercase.  \n2. The LC serifs are a bit rounder than the UC serifs. Is this weird? I had originally drawn the UC with round serifs, but they just didn't look solid.  \n3. Is the e still too pointy? I tried a more cursive e, which looks nice on its own, but is really distracting when set in text.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture2_4443.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174105im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture3_5145.png)\n\n"

One thing to watch is that a too-thick spine will start to make the terminals look weak. But this kind of contrast adjustment is best done looking at the other letters alongside.\n\nThe first new 'v' terminal - where it just turns vertical at the top - best fits your other letters' character, I think. And yes, I think that treatment is promising for helping out 'V' and 'W'.\n\n"

I'm not sure what I'd do to it.\n\nI'd make the tail of Q deeper and M a bit wider.\n\nThe e is super!
