  "content": "Hi everyone! I have an upcoming project about creating a brand identity for a hardware store. My concept is based on a beaver and wood textures, but I’m having a lot of trouble finding a typeface to fit this design.\n\nCan anyone suggest for me a typeface that is suitable for the logo? I was thinking a font that’s chipped or textured that reflects this nature.\n\nIf anyone can suggest another typeface or one that would fit better, that’ll be great too!\n\nThanks.\n\nVincent.\n\n",

Thanks guys! =)\n\nI really like Chase, Grot Wood, and Vendetta cause they got a really nice design or texture to it.\n\nAre there any fonts that look like they've been chewed i.e. bitten off maybe?? I was thinking more of a funny theme generated from the typeface.\n\nNonetheless, I very much appreciate your opinions and recommendations! Keep the comments rolling! =)\n\nVincent.\n\n"
