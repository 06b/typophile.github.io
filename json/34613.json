I used my own handwriting for a job and the client loves it, problem is they keep editing the text and I'm getting tired of rewriting it.\n\nIs there a relatively inexpensive software that easily digitize handwriting? I don't need a full character set, just upper and lower case and punctuation.\n\nOr is there someone here who has experience doing this? If you are interested, contact me through my page here. I'd need this done fairly quickly, as in the next week or so.\n\nI'm also attaching a jpeg of my writing if anybody can think of a font that could reasonably approximate it and is not wildly expensive.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [julian's mother.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140706185814/http:/typophile.com/files/julian's%20mother.jpg) | 440.22 KB |\n\n",

It's an Open type font, with alternates like Hj, kk, os, st, aa, ta, ll, etc. I don't know how long it took her to design it, but it works very nicely and looks quite realistic.\n\n"

But thanks.\n\nDon - you're right, of course. Problem is I kind of backed into it - my handwriting was just supposed to be a stand-in but now they want to use it.\n\n"
