  "content": "Hello,\n\nWorking on a logotype for a friend's Christian college ministry. Rather than develop a trendy shield/crest sort of thing as he asked (ugh), I thought a simple logotype would be much better. I'm not particularly well versed in drawing letters from scratch (versions 1 & 2), so please be gentle.\n\nWith all of these the idea was to hint at a shepherd's staff with the lowercase f.\n\n[http://metagramme.com/Flock\\_dd1\\_pres.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015104107/http:/metagramme.com/Flock_dd1_pres.pdf \"http://metagramme.com/Flock\\_dd1\\_pres.pdf\")\n\nThanks in advance for any/all advice.\n\nMatt\n\n",

If you want to move away from that, focus on something that more clearly represents the idea of a flock, the staff-like F was completely lost on me. I love your custom text, but the logos look like they're for a trendy restaurant and not a college-aged ministry.\n\nWhat about creating something based of shepherding imagery that kinda fits the bill of a crest? Like this, only more custom:  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/plasticmind/1269521880/in/set-7215760146502...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015104107/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/plasticmind/1269521880/in/set-72157601465024153/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/plasticmind/1269521880/in/set-72157601465024153/\")\n\n"

Crests are so completely played these days, especially for anything geared toward young people. It's even in Target, for crying out loud.\n\n"

It's clean and has great character to it.\n\nI wouldn't have gotten the shepherd's crook from the f had you not said anything I don't think, but I'm not sure it's completely necessary to be so blatant about it. I think if it were too apparent it might be distracting. As it is, I can see that you were influenced by the idea of the crook but still kept the idea from taking over.\n\nI think I'd stay away from the circle around the text as it looks quite a bit like the food network logo.\n\nIterations 3 and 4 remind me too much of the citibank logotype and I don't think they have the right character for this.\n\nOne suggestion I might make for number 1 would be to thicken the crossbar of the \"f\" a bit. Other than that, I think you've got something really great here.\n\npenn\n\n"

But your f-l combo does read like an f-i ligature, and the last thing you want people to read is fiock. Traditionally, in an f-l ligature, the f drips right into the l. I guess that takes away your crook, though... What if you just made the f taller to accommodate a fully ascending l?\n\n"
