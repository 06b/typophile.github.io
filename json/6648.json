These fonts used to be sold by Precision Type, but they recently ceased selling fonts.   \n   \nAdobe also sold it as ['Rosewood'](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225016/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/).   \n   \nThe Solotype Catalog (p.36) calls it 'Coffee Can Initials'.   \n   \nMore than you ever wanted to know.\n\n"

What am I missing ... ?   \n   \nTo me, it looks like someone took a set of those spear point decorations   \nand plopped them onto a different font, with little concern for getting them   \non straight, no adjustments for size with different letters and no curving in   \nthe G or R.\n\n"

The patterning is basically the same, but the letterforms are almost [completely different](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225016/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/rosewood/regular/testdrive.html?s=EXTRAVAGANZA&p=72).   \n   \nSo what is the sample? Looks to me like [Goudy Heavyface](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225016/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/goudy-heavyface/heavyface-d/testdrive.html?s=EXTRAVAGANZA&p=60), squoooshed to about 65% and decorated to look like Rosewood/Coffee Tin. I think it's squooshedï¿½ Goudy Heavyface rather than Goudy Heavyface Condensed, because the spur at the lower right-hand corner of the 'G' is still prominent in the sample, but appears to be absent in both URW's and Bitstream's digital versions of the Condensed.\n\n"

I apologize for my lack of precision.   \n   \nHowever, Rosewood is NOT the same as all the others, at least in the way the diamonds are on the A.   \n   \nMike F. and Metadox have probably nailed it, as an attempt to approximate one of those fonts.   \n   \nI need to stop 'impressionistic' IDing.\n\n"
