      "content": "hmm, unsure about typographic, but i spent six months in Vienna at one point.   \n   \nMuseums: the Belvedere (includes Klimt's The Kiss and Schiele's The Embrace) and the Kunsthistorisches Museum (lots of Breughel are two of the world's best. But my personal favorite is the Secession House, a masterpiece of Jugendstil architecture which features the massive Beethoven Frieze by Klimt-- this spans four walls and is Klimt's interpretation of Wagner's Interpretation of Beethoven's interpretation of a poem by Schiller, and absolutely stunning. after you see the Secession House, you're right next to the Naschmarkt, an open air market where you can get massive Doner kebabs (like massive gyros, basically) for dirt cheap.   \n   \nBeing lazy: chilling out in the gardens of the Hofburg (imperial palace) when the sun is out.   \n   \nKartner Strasse: the city's main street, make sure you check out the American Bar-- don't let the name fool you-- this is a hundred year old masterpiece of design by Adolf Loos-- the bar only fits about 16 people, but every table, wall, and counter is impeccably concieved and crafted in this modernist style. you'll probably admire the type on the signs as well! The mandatory Big  Church, St Stephen's, is also on Kartner Strasse and worth going in.   \n   \nfood and drink: beer + wienerschnitzel are excellent. there's also of bunch of wine gardens slightly outside the city but easily accessible on the metro. although it's a touristy thing, eating a Sacher Torte (Vienna's most famous cake) at the Hotel Sacher is really a great experience, with the right company.   \n   \nnightlife: the obvious answer is the Bermuda Triangle, an area with tons of bars, but really, anywhere you go will be fine.   \n   \ndo you know what area you're staying in?\n\n"
