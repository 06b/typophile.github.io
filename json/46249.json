Therefore, whatever it is they say a brand is, is what it is.\n\nTry it out. You’ll find it’s very addicting. And it’s even more interesting to see what tags emerge for companies like [Barbie](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615134544/http:/www.brandtags.net/browse.php?id=423) or [Volkswagen](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615134544/http:/www.brandtags.net/browse.php?id=94).\n\n",
