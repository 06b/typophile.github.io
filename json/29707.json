See what's on book covers, in magazines, on posters in shop windows, and screened onto t-shirts. Keep in mind that font trends vary by region. I just flew back in from Arizona, and I think about half the type in local magazines had been set in script faces—mostly Zapfino—and people out there are still carving new metal letters in Papyrus, as opposed to here in DC where it's just the font for the bottom feeders lately.\n\n"

For anyone in the designing business it might look a bit out of date, but I think that's mainly due to overuse & not to its appearance. Its a multifunctional font & that's something to admire regards of whether you like it or not.\n\n"
