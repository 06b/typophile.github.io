  "content": "I'm having trouble installing a new font I've made. The font is numerals and certain other characters only - ie non-alphabetic. It generates ok from fontlab and shows up in MS applications, but won't show up at all in illustrator, even at the bottom of the list where all the non-latin fonts go. I've got other fonts without complete character sets (generated at some point in testing before all the glyphs are filled) that show up fine in illustrator, and I can't see anything different in the settings. Anybody got any ideas where I'm going wrong?\n\n",
