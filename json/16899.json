That would lead me to believe if there is a typeface, it is custom (based off the original illustration) and proprietary.\n\nHowever, with the [new movie](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101406/http:/www.curiousgeorgemovie.com/) coming out next year (and the [number of books](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101406/http:/www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/cgsite/) over the years) there might be something floating around out there that is similar / a knock-off.\n\n"
