This question, or similar has been asked far lots of times in these forums, even if we all came back with our opinions, thats all they are, opinions. You’ll be better off looking into the subject and researching it yourself. You’ll learn far more too... In all honesty, there’s nothing better than good ’swiss’ books on the subject.\n\nBest of luck.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nRez\n\n"
