I think Illustrator is the only big app that is entirely Adobe-made. Even InDesign is based on PageMaker, which was Aldus. Then there is all the Macromedia stuff.\n\nWhile it might seem a great idea to pick one interface, the problem is choosing which one. Folk get upset when you start moving shortcuts and workflows around on them.\n\nI think Adobe has done a pretty good job, with the interfaces getting closer and closer together all the time. I suspect we will see more this version, but still short of perfection.\n\n"

If there are five applications with diverse interfaces in the suite, fully debug each of the five interface styles for each application, and make it a user-configurable setting which one is presented by the application to the user.\n\nThat way, users comfortable with the traditional interface for any of the applications can keep those interfaces, and they can set the other ones to be similar for when they move to the other applications from the one most important to them.\n\n"
