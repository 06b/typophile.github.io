My choices are, of course, personal, but I hope to convince my  \nhearers that they are well worthy of their consideration.\"\n\nKen Garland completed his studies in graphic design at the Central  \nSchool of Arts and Crafts, London, in the 1950s. He was Art Editor of  \nDesign magazine from 1956-62, when he left to establish his own  \ngraphic design studio as Ken Garland and Associates. Ken has written  \nseveral books on design, contributed many articles to design  \nperiodicals in the UK, US, Europe and Japan, and has taught and  \nlectured all over the world. His photographic work has been seen in a  \nnumber of one-man exhibitions; the most recent being Metaphors, a  \nportfolio of text and image (Brighton and Coventry, 2002, Hull, 2003,  \nGlasgow and Portugal, 2004); The children of Bangladesh/The rickshas  \nof Bangladesh (Coventry and Reading, 2006).\n\n………\n\nFor anybody interested in type and graphics, and their place in the  \nworld, our conference is the event to see and be seen at.\n\nCome and join us for edification, conversation and visual provocation.\n\nBooking  \n=======  \n.
