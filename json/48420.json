I discovered this by having renamed a font family and reloading the font. InDesign was still showing the OLD font family name in its menu. All I had to do was to rename the font FILE and InDesign saw the new font family name.\n\nDoes anyone know where InDesign is storing such information?\n\nMany thanks,  \nKen\n\n [‹ FONT FILE ORGANIZATION](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122065249/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47999 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Coding problems in Fontographer ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122065249/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48405 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
