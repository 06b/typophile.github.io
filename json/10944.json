My intention is not to steal from   \nanyone that participates in Typophile but rather to   \nlearn through the exchange of ideas.

I have a z in my name and have   \nnever found a good way to use it.   \n   \nIn my view, a lot of free design assistance happens around   \nhere, particularly in the Design section of Typophile. Topics   \nsuch as _What serif faces go with Interstate?, Suggestions   \nfor book typeface, Wine & typefaces_ all seem to be asking   \nabout the same sort of question as mine and all seem to be   \npaying jobs as well.   \n   \nPerhaps the letter\n\n"

This year, though, I'm giving people the benefit of the doubt and in your case it's paid off.   \n   \nUnfortunately, you gave the impression that you hadn't done any research yourself and wanted other people to do your work for you. Even worse, perhaps, you also gave the impression that you don't know much about what you are doing.   \n   \nI think, your second post cleared most of this up. That said, I think you have a point about the amount of people looking for free advice in here.   \n   \nGood luck in your project and don't forget to let us know when you've come up with something.   \n   \nMatha.\n\n"

      "content": "Anonymous   \n   \nDespite Stephen's admonition, I think this is an interesting exchange about something not often discussed here.   \n   \nIt's not just that design is a business, which it most definitely is, and a very competitive one. \"Cost\" is not specific to our culture but has been around ever since the idea of the \"marketplace\" and the beginning of \"culture.\"   \n   \nBut, let's say Sean liked the Goudy Thirty alt Z and used it in his client's piece. Yeah, he gets the money. But more importantly, he gets the credit for the design. And based on this, he may even pull in other work, undeservedly, in this regard. I doubt he'd actually feel good about that.   \n   \nThere isn't anything new under the sun, and yes, ideas and inspiration generally come from our exposure to the work of our peers. But there is a bit of a difference in how this is working here. Its one thing to show a piece and humbly ask for a critique, its another to ask others to contribute to your work and then take credit for it. I'm sure Sean understands this based on his recent post.   \n   \nI certainly am inspired by the work of others and will drawn upon what I find useful, but quite frankly, I would never ask someone for design advice as I don't know how I could then say the piece was my own work (for better or worse). And this has got nothing to do with money.\n\n"

Although it's not reasonable to give public/explicit/formal credit for every bit of inspiration a designer unavoidably gets, ethically it's expected of anybody who benefits beyond a certain threshold to state his debt, and there's no reason to assume Sean wouldn't do the right thing. To me asking isn't so bad - but pretending you didn't ask is indeed a big problem.   \n   \nAnd if somebody wants to actually share any resultant \"wealth\" that would be even more commendable. Maybe a small donation to Typophile? For example, my own membership payment here has little to do with getting yet another cool t-shirt.   \n   \nIt's really all a matter of reasonable behavior, not satisfying every person and every Law out there.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
