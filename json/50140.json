It seems well-made, but it’s still a 33 year old design. Either some looks never go out of style, or there is a failure of imagination (or both?).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

And the comments sound very pertinent :-) Fashion also hits typography and also here winds of revival seem to blow — and I’ve seen a renewed wave of interest in the rounded forms of Bauhaus and related cousins... Anyway, many thanks for the feedback.\n\n"
