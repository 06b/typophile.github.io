  "content": "Hello all, Im looking for a font called “Benjamin Cap”. I cant find it anywhere, it seems to be a popular wedding invitation font. I keep finding a different cursive like Benjamin, but not the one I am in need of (image underneath is of the correct font). Can anyone point me to a place that offers this one?  \nThank you,  \nFidel\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408050108im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Or4304_6632.2_inv.jpg)\n\n [‹ DVD font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408050108/http:/typophile.com/node/43954 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Slant Magazine (Condensed Sans-Serif) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408050108/http:/typophile.com/node/43948 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
