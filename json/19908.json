  "content": "Please help me convince a coworker (a marketing guy) that one does not set books in a bolder font. (He wants to please a small percentage of readers who complained that the font was too light or hard to read.) The editors don’t want a font that will increase page count. It’s like a war-zone in the office!\n\nThe books are 8.5 x 11, type is set at 9 pts. on 11 pts. leading, Palatino Roman, two columns, 22p0 wide. Some paragraphs are long, but the majority of text is written in bite-sized chunks. I’m reluctant to change the typeface to Palatino Medium or any other typeface with a thicker weight since the paper is thin and text shows through slightly.\n\nWhat other typefaces have a large x-height, comparable (or better) to Palatino at 9 pts., not too light, not too dark?\n\nThank you!\n\n [‹ Choosing a font for a book that is evocative of New York](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121095457/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19846 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rule for Kerning apostrophes ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071121095457/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19897 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The four grades will offer you four (slightly) different weights that allow you to increase or decrease the weight without changing copyfit. If possible, it would be best to test all four grades on press and choose the best grade for your readers. Mercury is also one of the most legible (and best looking) text faces available.\n\n"

Look at the work of  \nFred Smeijers for some good morena faces.\n\nAnd if you need something that’s also narrow,  \nand classical, consider Octavian - of my top favs.\n\nhhp\n\n"
