We were debating whether American designers are better off devoting more time to drawing better letters instead of creating extended character sets to support languages we don’t know based on the advice of a handful of people on the internet. Seeing how much more there is to just this one mark is really making me wonder if I should just stick to what I really know and leave support for these languages up to native typographers.\n\n"
