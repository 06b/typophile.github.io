I simply like looking at them and using them for work and pleasure.\n\nAs to the picture in your post: the bar on the lowercase “e” in ITC Galliard is straight, and not slanted as in the picture your provided.\n\nFurther, the ascender on the capital “J” is too short, that is, the tip at the bottom isn’t elongated enough. In ITC Galliard, it slants noticeably to the left, even beyond the “roof” of the “J.” I don’t see that in your picture. Nor is the “roof” of the “J” in your pic as pronounced as it should be. It might be a case of your pic being slightly blurred, but I stand by what I see.\n\nAgain, I’m not using a designer’s eye. I simply compared what I have at various magnifications to what you provided.\n\n"
