I want to write something in the same type but with different letters. I will in know way be reflecting anything poorly upon the school or taking money by knocking off trademarks.\n\nIf anyone can suggest what type it is, similar to, or a good way to replicate it I would be so thankful.\n\nThanks  \nChris\n\n",

[FB Agency Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20130215050435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/fb-agency/) is also somewhat similar, take your choice.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
