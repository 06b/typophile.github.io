It sounds interesting to me since I once, many many moons ago, started to learn Russian. I made it as far as being able to read sentences and paragraphs, not understanding a darn thing of course, based on their simple pronunciation rules and a basic understanding of Cyrillic.\n\nAs a newly dedicated type designer, I guess it’s my responsibility to understand all I can about scripts other than Latin.\n\n [‹ Centaur fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34526 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Good New Wave books? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41874 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "In the Soviet times _Poluzhirnyi_ was the standard term for the companion boldface. _Zhirnyi_ was used for ‘black’, like in [_zhirnyi grotesk_](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104025/http:/paratype.ru/pstore/default.asp?search=Black%20Grotesk&fcode=PT_BLG&params=1) (‘black grotesque’). That nomenclature was borrowed directly from German (German foundries dominated the Russian market in late 19th–early 20th century). The peculiar and often confusing [German terminology](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104025/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schriftschnitt) was [discussed](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17643) here a number of times. In current practice and usage Russian terminology mirrors the English, so [_poluzhirnyi_](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408104025/http:/paratype.ru/help/term/terms.asp?code=304) translates as ‘semi-’ or ‘demibold’.\n\n"
