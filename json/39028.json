It’s a young pentacostal church founded four years ago and consist of students and young families, mainly aged 25-30 years. They strive hard to not grow older - thus the logo is aiming a bit lower.\n\n**Brief:**  \nØystein: “Strong, but still nice and caring. You know, like my two meter tall grandfather with the worlds kindest eyes”.  \nPer Olav: “It should maybe express fellowship?”  \nØystein: “Hey, be creative!”  \nPer Olav: “Yeah. We don’t really want our people to love it at first. We want to get responses like ’this is really challenging me’ from the church.”  \nØystein: \\*grin\\*\n\n**Some of my thoughts:**  \nChurch identities have a long tradition of graphic misery.  \nIt should not try to say “everything” (with crosses, doves, hands and perhaps some architechtual drawings filtered into each other).  \nIt needs to be a bit tough.  \nIt has to be very simple.\n\nI’m presenting it tomorrow.  \nShoot!\n\n [‹ Help with Diamond Jewelry web logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232259/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41756 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Windsor Freezer Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232259/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13197 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When the puzzle starts adding up I might post some samples.  \nI agree the logo could be stronger, but keep in mind the extremely low quality and conservative symbolism of similar identities.\n\nIn the church the logo is used as:\n\n1: A small mono symbol in the lower right corner, or centered at the bottom.\n\n2: A large filled decorative shape.
