He bites your hand.\n\nWhether individually I can handle this or not is not the issue. The issue is: is it good for society? In this particular case: is it good for Typophile?

This does not mean however that we shouldn't do  \nhim any favors; that would be a poor reflection on us. Our greatest  \ngift can be patience combined with candor.\n\nhhp\n\n"
