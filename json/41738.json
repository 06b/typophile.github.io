I was reminded of the article written by Luke Williams of Frog Design comparing the iPod to bathroom fixtures.  \n [www.frogdesign.com/design-mind/articles/early-articles/the-ipod-and-the-...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081104100050/http:/www.frogdesign.com/design-mind/articles/early-articles/the-ipod-and-the-bathtub.html \"www.frogdesign.com/design-mind/articles/early-articles/the-ipod-and-the-bathtub.html\")\n\nI then went the way of dr’s/nurses’ scrubs: powder blue only to find out that the color is called ceil blue. Webster defines ceil as:\n\nceil\n\nMain Entry: ceil  \nFunction: transitive verb  \nEtymology: Middle English celen, from Medieval Latin celare, caelare, perhaps from Latin caelare to carve, from caelum chisel; akin to Latin caedere to cut  \nDate: 15th century  \n1 : to furnish (as a wooden ship) with a lining  \n2 : to furnish with a ceiling\n\nTo me, it had no real connection to the color blue. I know cielo means sky in Italian. That makes much more sense to me than Webster’s definition. I had never heard of ceil blue before and thought it a color made up by a company making scrubs. Apparently it has transcended that market and made its way into shoes, necklaces, etc. Have any of you heard of ceil blue before and possibly know its origins?\n\n"

I hear it on the radio, tv, print ads etc. Yet, none of us has a toothbrush that is white. With the advent of the two-shot injection molding process, toothbrushes have gone crazy with color and texture. I find it fascinating that white comes to mind most often as the color associated with hygiene, yet something we place in our own mouth to clean our white (hopefully) teeth is a myriad of colors/textures that don’t necessarily evoke hygiene. Yet when we clean our ears its with a white cotton tip.\n\nThe thoughts that keep me up at night. . .\n\n"
