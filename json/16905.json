  "content": "I’m working on a logo for a high end bike shop in a fairly upscale neighborhood. The owner and employees are very young and open minded so I’ve been trying to reach a compromise in the design. The logo will be used for business cards and shop signs as well as for shop clothing which will include jerseys, T-shirts, etc.\n\nI went with clarendon bold for the type and used an image of three links of a bike chain attached at the middle. The name “Lamorinda” is an abbreviation of three towns, Lafayette, Moraga, and Orinda, the shop is located in the middle of all three and hence the image of three links of chain.\n\nAny feedback would be greatly appreciated. Not sure if the Clarendon is too stern? Also, I’ve been having difficulty breaking up the text.\n\nThanks,\n\nPatrick\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Lamorindacyclery.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20061127143822/http:/typophile.com/files/Lamorindacyclery.pdf) | 70.27 KB |\n\n",

What if you took your top direction, joined the links at the ends to make a traingle and substituted that for the A. I’m not reading the mark as the O in the first choice.\n\nAlso, what’s the origin of the name? Might try some types with national blood if it works that way.\n\n"

Who cares about a crank spider? Use a more generic graphic like a spinning wheel or something enviromental like a local mountain or location. You might even make multi graphics with different graphics representing different locations in your geographical area.\n\n"

I’ve been working on a number of ideas which I will post and it would be good to hear more feedback.\n\nI tried the triangle chain symbol which worked ok but I think I need to thin out the links to make it more effective, bad contrast. I also got rid of the previous chain symbol, it started to look like a propeller to me.\n\nReplaced the O with the symbol in it with a chain in the shape of the O.\n\nAlso, experimented with breaking up the lettering in an attempt to liven up the type, I think it is a little to conservative for the shop.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/lamorinda2.jpg)\n\n"
