The vertical line in your A’s are slighty coming out of the horisontal line on the right...making a little bump that looks like an error.  \nAlso the Yaratıcı Post should allign with something in your big logoletters.\n\nGood luck with it...\n\nMark\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for the comments.\n\nthe bump on the right side of the A’s is an error indeed. But i thought it was a nice error so i kept it. I’ll try it a bit longer, so it won’t look like an error or i’ll just get rid of it.\n\nbtw, this is another version of the logo which i think i like better. what do you think?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153704im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/makinalogo4b.gif)\n\nea\n\n"

      "content": "I prefer this one so far. It holds together more, with better balance. I would perhaps close the letterforms together SLIGHTLY more (more like the kerning on your original post) and put the ’Makina Yaratici’ text back in. You may want to experiment with the typeface/weight of this ’Makina Yaratici’ text though.\n\nAny help?\n\n"
