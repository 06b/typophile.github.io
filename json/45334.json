It is excellent, however, I'm looking at it (purely subjective) as a conflict between good and evil (devil horns vs angel wings). The colours work, but what if the swirls are more pronounced?\n\n"

It looks like a tasty, sensual, delightful, joyful yoghurt, and we all connect these things with fat (you know that foods tastes better to westerns because of the fat). Fat-free on the other hand is more like following a strict diet, have some discipline, etc. I like the word game, colors, evrythng, I just think that the sans-serif font fits more into the brand.  \nFinaly, how about using Oldstyle figures for numbers?\n\n"

So I'm thinking it is ok to use a bolder typeface for something that is natural and not skinny. No?\n\nI liked how the tails on the y and g matched before. And the counter of the Omnes g is changed a bit. But, you could take a cue from that shape for the o (s) as in a way they are like you drew them with yogurt. No?\n\n"
