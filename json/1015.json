Perhaps this should apply to the lc \"k\", \"y\" and \"z\" as well.   \n   \nI like the ever-so-slightly wide lc \"z\", too.

I still need to shave some weight from the \"x\", but otherwise they're fitting in much better as far as color goes.   \n   \nAnd I shortened the descenders a bit (thanks for pointing that out, Eduardo) - I hadn't even noticed how incredibly long they were. The \"g\" still needs a lot of work. When I shortened the descenders, I redrew it with the Beziers to bring it in line, but I think I really need to rework it on paper. It seems too light and perhaps too narrow all the sudden.   \n   \nOh yeah, I also fiddled some more with the terminal flares and notches at som eof the joints. I moved the top notch on \"p\" because the top joint is already tapered - it seemed more logical to trim the bottom joint.

It is one of the most readable sans I have seen, and your face promises to accomplish the same thing in a different way. He has rounded counters, and a narrow, humanist structure. He gets the openness partly by very narrow joins between round and straight strokes - a general feature of his designs.   \n   \nYou are approaching this in a different way, which gives a wonderful liveliness as well as good 'color'.   \n   \nI like your new 7 and y.

Is the problem that the link between the loop and the top of the g sticks out too far to the left? That the link should narrow more in the joining to the top?

      "content": "Ok, here are my thoughts on spacing sans serifs. They come only from experience of looking, not designing.   \n   \nSpacing between letters, according to Walter Tracy and others should relate to the space in the counters of the letters, as well as varying with external letter shape. I think the thickness of the stems is also a factor.   \n   \nThe challenge with san serifs is that absent serifs the spacing looks wide, tending to break up the words. So sans often more closely spaced than serif faces. But this close spacing can hurt readability, IMHO. Here Helvetical/Arial is a prime offender. When you have very circular letters, as opposed to narrower ovals then balancing the spacing with the counters can get ridiculously wide. But putting them very close hurts readibility, as the shapes of the letters become lost in the crush. If you look at a text setting of Meta, which is narrower and has more space in relation to the counters, it is much more readable than Helvetica.   \n   \nI tend to think that Hrant is just mistaken about the greater importance of the external outline of the word, the 'Bouma' as he calls it, compared to the discernment of the shapes of the individual letters. I think that both are important. Thus wider spacing, to a point, helps, not hurts readibility.   \n   \nAnother factor here is x-height. Another reason Futura is more readable than Helvetica, in spite of its circular letters, is that the smaller x height allows the space between letters to be looser and hence both more balanced and legible in relation to the spaces in the counters. And, yes, taller extenders also help on differentiating more the external outline of the words.   \n   \nWith all these ruminations in mind, my reaction your spacing is that in the more black text setting the spacing is OK, but it is too loose in the case of the lightest weight.   \n   \nIn the lighter weights you might consider also narrowing the letter forms. If I am not mistaken (I don't have the font) I believe that is what Gerard Unger does with his Vesta. That way when you narrow the spacing - which the narrow stems also seem to call for - you still have balance between the inter-letter space and the internal counters.   \n   \nAs I said earlier in this thread, I am really struck by how readable Vesta is as a sans. Unger has written a book about is views, and I am looking forward to the English edition, which I believe his site says he is working on.   \n   \nAs Randy said, and as I noted earlier when you posted a smaller text setting, it is striking how readable Ardbeg is in smaller text settings. I think you have going for you not only the narrower shapes and the open counters that the angularity gives you (a la Dwiggens), but also a more generous x-height than Vesta.   \n   \nAll of this promises to have you end up with an exceptionally readable sans, which I think is great. I think playing with the letter widths as well as spacing with the different weights, as Vesta seems to do, may help you get to this goal.   \n   \nOn the differences in the weights, Unger likes the relatively small differences between different weights, I guess based on the idea that what pairing of weights a designer would want would depend on the design and the paper. James Montalbano also gave a very interesting rationale [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012091540/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14103.html?1060892227#POST25607).\n\n"

(But about 2/3-rds is still done in the parafovea, where internal details are simply unavailable.\\*)   \n2) A huge determinant of a bouma is its width.

Here goes: A larger x-height means a smaller ascender/descender height, means a larger looking face compared to others of the same point size, requiring more spacing at the same optical size... Meanwhile, the shorter ascenders/ascenders gain you vertical space by decreasing the needed leading, which in shorter lines of copy controls the space economy much more than the width of a typeface or looseness of spacing. So you can easily afford a bit more width. As for examples I will leave that up to him! \\*breath\\* Monarchy fovea bouma notan.

However, because of Ardbeg's squared-off structure Eric Olsen may be right (or not!) that your normal weight hmnu could benefit by being slightly narrower. I guess one issue to check is the relationship between the counters in the pbod and hmnu, which should balance.   \n   \nIt looks to me like Unger's seven weights run the range between your five middle weights. He says this is deliberate because he doesn't think the lightest and heaviest weights are much used. I like your heaviest weight a lot. Your lightest works the least well to my eyes.   \n   \nBy the way, I agree with Randy about bringing down the height of the f slightly.

Because the bloated lowercase eats up the white space. I am, most probably, wrong on this count.   \n   \nHere's a random guess about x-height/letterfit.

Look at it \"absolutely\": simply when you set a given font smaller (= smaller x-height) the space between the letters gets smaller too. (But more than \"allows\" it's \"needs\".)   \n   \nFutura has wider spacing than Helvetica because it's designed better.   \n   \nLeading/x-height:   \nRandy and Nathan are both right! A larger x-height normalized to the same apparent size needs less absolute leading, but at the same point size it needs more relative leading.   \n   \n\\> It's really pretty amazing.   \n   \nBTW, I've measured it. Its behavior is \"bilinear\": a line from 4 point to 12; a more shallow line from 12 to 72; and flat below 4 and above 72.

When I track Helvetica progressively wider, and the same with Futura, the words of Helvetica seem to fall apart and the whole look too loose long before Futura falls apart.   \n   \nI think the longer extenders hold together the 'Boumas' (ack! did I say that?) better, so the smaller x-height sans can take looser spacing. In other words, I think the Helvetical designer did the spacing he did for a good reason, even though it messes up the readability at small sizes.   \n  \n\\>a larger looking face compared to others of the same point size, requiring more spacing at the same optical size.   \n   \nWell, Tracy says that the spacing should match the counters, which don't change with varying the extenders. But he didn't discuss sans serifs. If you look at digital Gill sans, and type iio, the space between the ii is much smaller than the counter of the o, whereas in say Times it is very similar. Now I think I read that Gill in metal was spaced much wider, but again I think the digital adjustments were in response to a problem that the spacing looked too loose in the metal.   \n   \nOk, the following is just a pet theory of mine, but there may be something in it. My theory is that without serifs you not only have problems visually finding the line of text, but also the spacing problems become substantial. Space a sans like a serif, and the words fall apart. Space it closely, and the legibility and hence readibility decreases in small (text) sizes. Hence sans are usually harder to read in text sizes. Large, the tight spacing is not a problem, as the absolute space between letters is big enough that legibility is not hurt.   \n   \nI think the x-height and weight of the stem also affect how spacing works, especially with a sans. Also with narrower designs, the problems aren't so severe. I don't know what Unger has figured out about all this, but from the PDF of his Vesta, which mixes sans and serifs impressively, he has some new insights.   \n   \nSo even two Hrants (shudder ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012091540im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)) don't convince me.   \n   \n\\>Monarchy fovea bouma notan   \nDemocracy, iris, letter, notan (ok, I like notan).   \n   \nThe relevance to Nathan's spacing challenges in different weights is this the following. I don't have a clear theory of how to space a sans. But my point is that there is more in spacing a sans than is usually realized, and that therefore it is worth experimenting with both letter width and spacing, rather than just one or the other, if you have a goal of readability in text for your sans.\n\n"
