I'm into raw hand drawn type, new and old swiss, bauhaus, and all the weird custom type from the northwoods / wisconsin area.\n\nLooking forward to posting / crits.\n\nYou can get an idea for the trouble I'll cause here:\n\n[http://www.kylefletcher.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019061553/http:/www.kylefletcher.com/ \"http://www.kylefletcher.com\")\n\nCheers!\n\n",

I wouldn't call it grand design. Just fun.\n\nThese days I spend more type hacking ASP.net code and the like with the odd freelance gig and typophile to keep me sane. ;O)\n\n"
