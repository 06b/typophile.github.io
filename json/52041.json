  "content": "// THE CHALLENGE\n\nSearch out and take a picture of interesting, hand-drawn lettering. Then, design a set of numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, ...9) in the style of the found lettering. Be sure to submit a photo of the original with your design.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi  \n- Color: Black and White only (for the design)  \n- Format: JPG or PNG\n\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE [TYPE BATTLES](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072909/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles)\n\nThis is your chance to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this battle: **[http://www.typophile.com/battle30](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072909/http:/www.typophile.com/battle30)**  \nLink to the battle directory: [http://www.typophile.com/typebattles](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072909/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles \"http://www.typophile.com/typebattles\")\n\n [Please Read: Design Forum Suggestions ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201072909/http:/typophile.com/design_readme \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
