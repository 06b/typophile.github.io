I was slightly confused whether I should call it Rounded or Soft? Any suggestions?\n\nHere is how it looks:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414114832im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Quantum01_6389.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414114832im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Quantum02_4939.png)\n\nThanks,  \nSatya\n\n",

Satya's typeface to my eye is a different thing--more inflated than router-carved.\n\n"
