I'm not sure if this is the kind of leg I should use or not, but so far it's the only one that has looked ok. Hoping for some advice / critique on this. Thanks so much!\n\nR:\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-R1.gif)\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-R2.gif)\n\nP (original):\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-P.gif)\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-P2.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pennsylvania-illustrated-R1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-R1.gif) | 16.82 KB |\n| [pennsylvania-illustrated-R2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-R2.gif) | 8.76 KB |\n| [pennsylvania-illustrated-P2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123/http:/typophile.com/files/pennsylvania-illustrated-P2.gif) | 7.53 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks George, I appreciate the useful feedback. Spot on. I'd love for you to take a look at the finished design when it's done (I'm about 1/3 of the way through the rest of the letters now) and tell me if you still think the leg extends too far. I agree with you that normally it shouldn't, but as the leading character in the logo I wonder if it won't end up looking better over-extended as it is now. Can't wait to get the rest of the characters finished so we can see in context!\n\n"

      "content": "Your design of the leg has a lot of flair, No matter how you make it narrower it's going to loose some of this. Here is one possible starting point. This is clip & paste on a jpeg image. In vector the curves of the leg could be improved considerably.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417043123im_/http:/typophile.com/files/P2Rtest_4311.jpg)\n  \nThe bowls on \\_R\\_ are often do not descend as far as the bowls on \\_P\\_. An idea might be to shift the bottom of the bowl on \\_P\\_ upward before doing this type of leg for the \\_R\\_.  \nDon\n\n"
