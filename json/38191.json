I have a report to do for a class, and so far, browsing the web has been hit or miss. I already have a copy of Macro and Microaesthetics from the school library and am currently waiting for the copy of his other book to come in. However this doesnt give me a good sampling of his work and style. So if anyone knows of a good source of info that’d be great.
