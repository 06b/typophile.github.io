Even Goudy had a go at [Trajan](http://web.archive.org/web/20120428180605/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-trajan/) in 1930 (Revived by Jason Castle).\n\nShe won the Morisawa award for ['Mirarae'](http://web.archive.org/web/20120428180605/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/mirarae/), but you don't see that too often.\n\nMy personal favorite of hers, in a completely different vein is ['Nueva'](http://web.archive.org/web/20120428180605/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/nueva/), a lively, casual font that has a great range of color and utility, where you are not trying to weigh down the world with 'meaning' and importance.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
