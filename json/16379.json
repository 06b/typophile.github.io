  "content": "So I was bored on my train ride out of NYC the other day so I busted out my PowerBook and opened up Font Explorer. I proceeded to check out the character map for some of my typefaces and stumbled upon tons of extra glyphs (dingbats?) that I had not known about. This was kind of sparked by my current wallpaper created with Underware's Sauna and an included dingbat: [http://veer.com/download/wallpaper/relax1440x900.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043414/http:/veer.com/download/wallpaper/relax1440x900.jpg \"http://veer.com/download/wallpaper/relax1440x900.jpg\")\n\nI'm curious, because the only alternates I know are holding the option key to access other included glyphs/marks. Essentially is there a way to find out the key commands that trigger these glyphs? if that IS in fact how its done? Thanks!\n\n",

No, you _really_ don't. Trust me. :^D\n\nWe licensed [PopChar X](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017043414/http:/www.macility.com/products/popcharx/) for the whole studio. Does the trick.\n\n"

Just enable the U.S. Extended keyboard layout using the International control panel in System Preferences. Instead of bullets, math symbols and such, it turns most of the option-key combinations into \"dead\" accent keys so you can enter, for example, opt-m followed by e to get ę (e with an ogonek). It helps to have the Keyboard Viewer open so you can see which keys to type to get different accents. (Note: It doesn't work for every possible accent/character combo--they have to be combinations that exist in Unicode. Also, not all (or even mosts) fonts have all those characters.)\n\n"
