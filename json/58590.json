      "content": "I know the reflex answer would be to say Avant Garde Gothic Alternates for the A and V, but the R is totally wrong for that font. The A and V could have been drawn, as they are just straight lines. So I would say find the R and you have the font. My first impulse was Univers, but the R in [Brazilia Three](http://web.archive.org/web/20110630223201/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atbrazilia/atbrazilia-three-25492/) has a bit less flare in the leg. There are probably other, better choices, that was the first one in alpha order that seemed pretty close.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
