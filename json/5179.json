They manage to take the pain out of .ca registrations, as well as handling all of the other popular top level domains. And if you're stuck for finding that perfect domain name, their alternate available domain suggestion feature is very handy.\n\n"

      "content": "well, the best to my experience is to use a registrar who is in the same country as you + one who provide online managing of your dns and such things related. Avoid to use the domain registration offered by a host, because it doesn't help to leave the host if trouble with it, because of the domain+dns.   \n   \n [http://www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102922/http:/www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html)\n\n"

You can have one company register   \nit and another host it, but it's less hassle if you know who   \nyour host is and just have them register it.   \n   \nIf you just want to register a domain and not host anything there   \nfor a while, then Dotster is a great choice because it's dirt cheap.\n\n"
