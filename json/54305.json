  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to select the right paper for my Moroccan wedding invite and each printer I have asked seems to suggest something else.\n\nI want the look of French paper, the Speckletone look, but in a paper with some cotton in it so that it will take the impression very well. Most of my printers seem to feel that French paper is better for silkscreen than letterpress.\n\nAnyone know what might be a good choice?\n\nthanks!\n\n",
