(Not eLance, craigslist, or Contracted Work - I have tried these services, and the designers are way sub-par for my interests.)\n\nIs this a place I could solicit bids?\n\nThis board offers some of the most respectable designers on the web, and I figured I'd come here for answers.\n\nThank you.\n\nAdam Dolch\n\n",

I don’t mean to suggest that AIGA designers are better or more reputable than other designers, but I find that most of the really bad/sleazy designers out there aren’t willing to pay for an AIGA membership and create another online portfolio.\n\n"

There are plenty of people looking for professional logo design as spec work. I would highly discourage posting a job on any of the [crowdsourcing](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023195651/http:/www.renderedred.com/the_crowdspring_experiment.html) sites (crowdSpring, 99designs, etc), especially if you're looking for quality work.\n\n"
