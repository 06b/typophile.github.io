First thought was of Dave Wests Behemoth, perhaps with an outline?? Or is there another similar font that i just failed to recognize. Giza??  \nThanks in advance. \n",

A little extra stroke thickness would do it, I think. [Quadra 57](http://web.archive.org/web/20090619091845/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/quadra-57-bq/) was the other font I looked at, but the serifs are not bracketed.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
