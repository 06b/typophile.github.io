It’s supposed to represent a private language school named English Academy.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090827081659im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_v4_500_5428.jpg)\n\n(Don’t mind the colour scheme please.)  \nCould you suggest me a suitable sans type which is not too bold and would complement the logo well? Also I’m not sure about the placement of text, do you have any other ideas?\n\nThanks =)\n\n",
