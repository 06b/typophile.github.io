  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI'm currently designing a brochure for a cultural season. The brochure cover/poster is based on a photography (rather classical atmosphere), and I'm looking for a font to set the title of the season. I might be using a shape in the back to support it (maybe a round shape). Do you have any ideas of modern sans serif fonts I could use? Commercial fonts sugegstions are welcome, I have a budget for that. I'm looking for something modern, new, distinctive, appealing.\n\nThanks for your suggestions!  \nHed\n\n",
