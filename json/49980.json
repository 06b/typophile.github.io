Probably because they aren’t meant for drawing complete shapes.  \n•Zoom in a little more and make sure that you’re clicking right on the point. The cursor will have a circle over it when positioned to close the path.  \n•Sometimes closing paths just doesn’t work right and you just have to keep moving the points over each other again and again until it works.\n\n"
