There was more text in a style that seemed to be the same, unfortunately I didn’t have a camera with me.\n\nIt is simalr to (but not the same as) Process Type’s Klavika\n\nThanks  \nRichard\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [eurica.gif](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=eurica_0.gif) | 3.93 KB |\n\n",

Uppercase fora seem to have disapeared completely, “Access Denied” to various threads and the Wiki, etc.\n\n"
