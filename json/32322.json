It's from the cover of Joy Division's Closer album, designed by Peter Saville.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018220444im_/http:/typophile.com/files/joy_5745.png)\n\nI cleaned it up and wrangled it so many times to get something out of Identifont that I'm going crazy.\n\nI thought I had a good answer when I found a typeface labeled \"Joy Division Closer\" at Saville's site, but it's a forgery! (Omigod, someone alert Uli!) They dumped a typeface named Helios SSi onto the site. Changed the name, but didn't bother to change the copyright. To make it worse, it's not even the same typeface. Bla.\n\n",
