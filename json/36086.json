  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI am looking for a typeface for a church logo/re-brand.\n\nThe church is called \"New Life\" and I am looking for a typeface that is rounded and looks good as lower case. I have had a look through various font sites without much success, and I refuse to resort to something like Comic Sans.\n\nI basically need a modern, san serif, rounded typeface that does not look like it is drawn.\n\nAttached is the general feel of the logo so far.\n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014103805im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NewLifeLogo_6111.jpg)\n\n",
