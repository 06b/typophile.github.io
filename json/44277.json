You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/battle22](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102054851/http:/www.typophile.com/battle22 \"http://www.typophile.com/battle22\")\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi  \n- Color: Full color or BW -- you decide!  \n- Format: Please save your graphics as PNG or JPG\n\n**// THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE:**\n\nIt is time to leave the comforts of digital technology (at least partially) and get back to the basics. Utilizing the tool of your choice, scratch the following word into an object or surface:\n\nEpigraphy\n\n- Tools might include: a knife, a stick or your fingernails.  \n- Objects may be: an apple, a stone or your arm.  \n- Photograph or scan the results and submit to the battle.  \n  \n<cite>There is no photoshoppery or digital manipulation of any kind allowed! </cite>\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May be the best designer win.\n\n",
