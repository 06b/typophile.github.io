The topic is: High End Condos $450,000 - $950,000 / 55 and older active adult community / lots of pictures / descriptions of amenities, floor plans and area attractions.\n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I’m just starting the process. My instinct says serif, anyway.\n\nI’ve enclosed some elements of the brochure.\n\nTHANK YOU,  \nKate\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [SharronBillWEB.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122806/http:/typophile.com/files/SharronBillWEB.gif) | 26.06 KB |\n| [WinnCottLogoWEB.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122806/http:/typophile.com/files/WinnCottLogoWEB.gif) | 18.85 KB |\n| [Winnapaug-CottagesWEB.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122806/http:/typophile.com/files/Winnapaug-CottagesWEB.gif) | 219.77 KB |\n\n [‹ A Caslon to call home?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122806/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20893 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [National Australia Bank's new logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122806/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18388 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
