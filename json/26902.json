In fact we're going to extend the deadline to January 15th in hopes of giving some of you the added time you need. You can start by designing and submitting your birthday month.   \n   \nThe 2004 calendar is our first collabo for the new year. Typophiles will be able to download and assemble twelve 11\"x17\" PDFs to create their own 2004 calendar from all submitted designs.   \n   \n [Full details here](http://web.archive.org/web/20101227041748/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/19057.html)   \n   \nWe're looking forward to seeing what you come up with!\n\n",
