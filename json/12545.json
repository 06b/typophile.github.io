  "content": "I posted this in the General Forum but have some additional information that applies more to building fonts than using them. I have a font that contains logos for my company. The font has worked fine in all applications until I installed Tiger. Now Office applications and Suitcase report to the OS that the font is bad, then the OS disables it. I used Fontographer to painstakingly copy each character to a new font file, regenerate the font then test the character. It turns out 3 of the logos are the culprits. If I leave them out of the font, then Office and Suitcase are fine with the font. I’m not a type designer so I don’t know what to check within the font. Any suggestions? The font verifies fine with Font Book and Font Doctor.\n\nOriginal Post  \nI haven’t been able to get any support out of Apple or Microsoft so I thought I’d try here. I just upgraded to Tiger (21 PowerMac G5s with 10.4.1) and now Word and other Office applications are reporting that I have a bad font during the “Optimizing Font Menu Performance” routine. The message actually comes from the operating system but is triggered by Office applications. The system disables the font. If I reinstall the font it works fine in all other applications until I run an Office application. This is a font I’ve used for 10 years (its a custom in-house font) from OS 7.1 through 10.3.9 with all Office applications. The font verifies correctly in Font Book and Font Doctor. I’ve deleted the Office preferences and cleared font caches. It’s happening on all computers running Tiger. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.\n\n",

One of the logos that does not work is a single line of text from the two line logo.

After all, Tiger has only been out a week and a half and no one else seems to be having this problem with any of their fonts.\n\nWould mind posting the font here? That way, one or several of us would be able to take a look for ourselves and maybe figure out what’s up with it.\n\n"

The system will attempt to disable this font but to avoid further problems you should quit all of your open applications and remove this font file or replace it with a new version.\n\nI can’t post the entire font - it has signatures and other proprietary logos in it, but I can post a subset with the offending characters. Do I have to create a new topic to post the font? I don’t see a link on this reply page.\n\n"
