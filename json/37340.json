  "content": "Hello out there!\n\nI recently made a typedesign and try to make it work for text.  \nI am quite satisfied with the spaces for now even though I know there is much much room for improving.  \nYet what strucks me most is how bad it works on screen (and also in small sizes printed I assume).  \nIn certain size letters begin to jump up and down the lines. A disaster.  \nI know this is a thing to be solved with the hinting tool.  \nYet, I have to admit I never learned how to use it correctly.  \nI tried to do something in all charactes similar to the u I show here. Obviously I tried to keep values equal.  \nI suppose I have to add other hinting lines that prevent the characters from changing sizes in a vertical direction.  \nIs this true and if so how is it to be made?  \nAnyone there eager to help me with this prob?\n\nSalute  \nStefan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011053649im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Bild-1_6046.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011053649im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Bild-2_3597.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011053649im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Bild-3_5911.gif)\n\n [‹ School yearbook fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011053649/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36631 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Billboard Typography - Readability From A Distance? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011053649/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37338 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And I guess that helps hinting.\n\n"
