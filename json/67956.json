  "content": "I'm working on an annual report for school and have been using Sabon Next and Courier so far. I like the feel of Courier but it's set width is pretty wide. I was wondering if there was a typeface with a similar feel that doesn't set as wide. It doesn't have to be a monoface.\n\nAlso I'm curious if you guys have any suggestions for a third typeface (a sans-serif) that may complement the two.\n\n",

It's one of the MS core web fonts so you should have it. It's a sans-serif, and a bit narrower than Courier, so it has more of a coding than typewritery feel to it, and I don't see it used all that often compared to other such system fonts.\n\n"
