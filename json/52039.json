  "content": "(I've submitted the same topic under 'General Discussion')  \nHey typophiles! I thank you in advance...\n\nI’m redesigning a logo for one of my clients, which was set in Book Antiqua and has a very clunky outdated symbol. I’m getting rid of the symbol and focusing on the typeface. I’m redesigning the logo with Rotis semi-serif and I wanted to customize some of the letterforms, so trademark Rotis letters like ’e’, ’c’ will be different from the original typeface.  \nDoes anyone have any good alternative suggestions?\n\n",
