  "content": "Hi,\n\nI was looking through some Computer Arts tutorials and came across Mark Bloom's modular grid system in illustrator.\n\n[http://www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials/create-modular-grid-system-illustrator](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417152654/http:/www.computerarts.co.uk/tutorials/create-modular-grid-system-illustrator)\n\nI thought it was refreshing to see Computer Arts highlight how a designer works with a grid system in their day-to-day design projects.\n\nI was wondering what people thought to the process Mark uses? I am interested to hear everyones thoughts about creating Modular grid systems, perhaps you feel you have a better solution? or perhaps you work for a design studio that likes you use grids a certain way?\n\nAppreciate anyones thoughts?\n\nThanks  \np\n\n",
