  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm just curious about how you all make typeface decisions for clients when you dont have a licence for a particular typeface?\n\nI know that Fontshop and most foundry websites have functionality to preview any text with a choice of sizing etc. This is helpful for having a quick look, but its not really flexible in that there is no kerning control, and nuisance backgrounds make them hard to work with for mocking up a design. I understand that foundrys can't be distributing typefaces in the hope that people will buy licences if they actually use it, because we all know that a lot of people simply wouldn't.\n\nI have a logo to redesign for a business, and I dont know how to go about making the choice. I cant develop finished artwork with different faces without buying the licences, and the value of the job means that I cant afford to buy several.\n\nI guess I can present type samples and gauge which one they like, and work from there. Is that something designers often do? Or are you lucky enough to have a wide range of typefaces at your disposal?\n\nThanks,  \nJonny\n\n",

And I almost never decline; my philosophy is that the font scene is too competitive so the most one can hope for in the retail market is to hook people onto your product by letting them use it a little bit. By the same logic, I never cripple my live online samples, and I believe that any font house that does that probably isn't thinking straight.\n\nhhp\n\n"

It started out as a showcase the new capabilities of the app, but slightly turned into a \"be careful what you put on the web\" lecture. In about 30 seconds they showed how you can take a bitmap image from MyFonts showing the character set of a typeface and basically auto generate a working font. Obviously there are numerous implication of this feature; surly there are many legitimate uses where this would be great. On the other hand, it might make designers/distributers think again about how they showcase their types.\n\nr.k\n\n"

Sometimes my pdf-specimen will do the job of convinsing the client for a purchase. If a bigger and more complicated project needs a few\"try-outs\" that could be fixed as well. It vary a lot from case to case. I agree with Hrant you have to be customer friendly as much as possible in order to get new clients.\n\n"
