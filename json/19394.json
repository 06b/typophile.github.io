  "content": "Dear All,\n\nI am an architect/industrial designer with an interest (maybe even a passion) for type design and typography. That makes it particularly difficult for me to accept the design and font choice of the logo for a project which I am currently working on. The product is a protective item for the active sports market and is primarily aimed at a youngish male audience. The general product or brand name is POD or PODMX.\n\nThe logo on the left has been adopted and used in the actual product itself; the logo/type on the right is what has been put forward to accompanny the main logo in all promotional materials and uses (printed brochure, packaging, website, etc…).\n\nThe main logo is just OK (at best) while the choice of font on the right is just plain awful. I am now trying to convince the client group that there are better options available in terms of font choice and design.\n\nI am now looking to put forward some alternative font choices which have the same feel as the original suggestions (muscular, strong, dynamic for want of better words) but which also have a more professional appearance. After a quick scan through some foundry samples I thought that perhaps something like Font Bureau’s ‘Shimano’ family might be a worthy replacement and work well(‘ish) with the main logo.\n\nI would be grateful for any suggestions which you might with regards to font choices as well as any advice on how to bring the clients around a more professional type solution. Please bear in mind that expensive type options will probably be even less attractive to the client.\n\nThanks,\n\nGrant\n\nPS I’m sorry, but call me stupid but for the life of me I cannot get the logo image to upload, nor can I find any information on how to correctly attach a file. Please help me or point me in the right direction?\n\n",
