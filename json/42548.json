I got this as part of my logo design for my business cards from a company that no longer exists so I can’t contact them. Now I want to update part of the card but want the fonts to match. The phone number belongs to the senior partner that he no longer wants used or published and is one of the things I want to change so I blacked out duplicate numbers. I included the numbers just to maybe increase the odds of this getting identified.\n\nThanks for any help you can give me.  \nJacob\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907044741im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/entertainment01_3924.GIF)\n\n [‹ O'Neil Theatres Inc.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907044741/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42543 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [CELEBRITY Theatre ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907044741/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42539 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
