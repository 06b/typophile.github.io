  "content": "Hey everybody,\n\nI'm in the \"looking for inspiration\" phase of the design process in creating a classic logo.  \nMy client wants a logo in style of Hermes.\n\nHere is my moodboard so far.  \nDo you have any extra ideas and of course fonts that would go well with a classic (1900 style) logo.\n\nThank you !\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423162521im_/http:/typophile.com/files/inspi_5333.jpg)\n\n",

Best to be prepared with Extra Ideas ...good thing I've gots lots :) Not all good Extra Ideas tho. I guess it all depends on how one manages their Extra Ideas as to how effective they can be ...and become main Ideas!\n\nAnyways... back while ago now I snagged this link to a whole book of Extra Ideas ... it's not called that tho....\n\n[http://archive.org/stream/1923AmericanTypeFoundersSpecimenBookCatalogue/...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423162521/http:/archive.org/stream/1923AmericanTypeFoundersSpecimenBookCatalogue/1923ATFSpecimenBook#page/n0/mode/2up \"http://archive.org/stream/1923AmericanTypeFoundersSpecimenBookCatalogue/1923ATFSpecimenBook#page/n0/mode/2up\")\n\n...they called it the 1923 American Type Founders Specimen Book Catalogue.\n\n...whatever.\n\nFor me the fun really starts around page 586 of the ...1923 American Type Founders Specimen Book of Extra Ideas ...beginning with a spiffy selection of Typographic Accessories.\n\n"
