  "content": "Hi,  \nI have started designing a Cyrillic character set for my typeface, despite the fact I did not know practically anything about it. However, it was quite a big challenge for me. I have found little resources in books (mostly Russian ones) as well as on the internet and I checked few typefaces which I consider well done. But still, it was quite complicated to find any relevant information.  \nSo I would like to ask you whether you could give me any feedback, I want to move on.  \nThank you.  \nJan\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [image.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317165650/http:/typophile.com/files/image_197.jpg) | 212.78 KB |\n\n",
