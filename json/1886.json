The fonts have the extensions .afm .pfm .pfb. I'm aware that there isn't an adobe type manager for os x. unfortunately ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000700im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif). anyone got a suggestion?   \n   \nthanks in advance\n\n",

Its good software.\n\n"

Every now & again I have to use a font on a Mac (I'm a die-hard PC user - mostly because I'll die with hardly any money) and CrossFont usually does a good job of making them usable on a Mac platform.   \n   \nIIRC, the trial version is fully functional except that it doesn't do batch conversions. If you have a bunch of fonts, it might be worth the $45 for the license.   \n   \nHope that works for you.\n\n"
