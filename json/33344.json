As a rule (and one with a lot of exceptions I realise) people who are going to use the underground start with a geographically correct map to find their destination, then find the geographically nearest station. Once you are in the underground/subway system all ordinairy sense of geography is lost, in fact in many London station all orientation dissapears by the time you've taken the many stairs and corridors to the platform.\n\nFrom limited personal experience I have to say I found the numbers on the existing NY subway map a little confusing. I think they put doubt in the mind of visitors - too much choice can be a bad thing. The London map is simpler; but then again so is the system!\n\n"

That's why I think the existing focus on nodes (with less clarity for lines) is better than the focus on lines (with less clarity for nodes) in this new map.

Fifteen years ago the same line might have signs in different places calling it the IRT local, the Broadway line, the 7th Avenue line, or the South Ferry train.

Nice thing about growing up in NYC was high school pals working doors and bars at VIP rooms in clubs thus getting access normally denied young peons.\n\nSeeing David Byrne doing karaoke (my first time ever seeing karaoke) at the tunnel in the 80s was da bomb. He sang 16 Tons and Whole Lotta Love.\n\nAlways liked hearing music at the Cat Club and the old Ritz, the old Knit. I was never lucky enuf to see the real good bands at CBs (mostly saw friends bands) but did catch up with some of them at the Dr. Pepper concert series in the park when I was in high school. Too cheap/broke to buy tix, we'd sit outside and listen and smoke pot.\n\nFor female singers of a certain era nobody beats Patti Smith and she's still bringing down the house.\n\n"
