I'm mostly interested in TrueType fonts--can Fontographer handle this or no (money is an issue for me, and Fontographer is cheaper). What's the word?\n\n",

      "content": "Fontographer has not been updated for more than five years and is unlikely ever to be updated again. It is not in development, and is becoming more obsolete all the time. It makes reasonably good -- although far from perfect -- Type 1 PS fonts, but the quality of its TrueType fonts is not very good, and you have very little control (it exports TT fonts as conversions, only letting you work in a PS outline and hinting environments).   \n   \nIf you are looking for a less expensive option, check out TypeTool from the makers of FontLab. It is a stripped down version of FontLab that is better for TT development than Fontographer.\n\n"

Yes, a pity that it is not updated, but I still use it, though am getting Type Tool2 now.\n\n"

      "content": "There was another program around in the mid 80s, Ikarus, and it was expensive although it was very good. The Dutch Type Library includes it as a part of the current DTL FontMaster which operates using Mac OS Classic and Windows. Yes, Type Tool 2 is a very good choice. I believe the Windows version of Fontographer first appeared in 1992 or so, after the Mac version.\n\n"
