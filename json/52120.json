  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI'm creating a series of posters incorporating examples of famous or well designed typeface samples/promotion/teasers (not sure what the correct term is). For example,\n\nHelvetica:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/helv_6512.png)\n\nAvant Garde (I realise this wasn't designed to purely show off the typeface, but it still fits my idea):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/avant_4406.png)\n\nBlack Slabbath:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slabbath_5384.png)\n\nIt's for a student project - promoting a typography exhibition. There will be classic type exhibits as well as events launching new faces etc. The samples will be used in a similar theme to this (still work in progress):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fdg_4057.png)\n\nAny other examples of good design specifically to show off a typeface (particularly for serifs) would be very helpful.\n\n",

      "content": "Well sort of, more like examples of the typeface being shown off to promote or display it. A piece of design created to advertise a particular font, or a logo for 'Bodoni' or 'Times' set in that particular face. Another example I thought of was Wim Crouwel's New Alphabet:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/images_3436.jpeg)\n\nOr this kind of thing for Futura:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001533im_/http:/typophile.com/files/images-1_4469.jpeg)\n\n"
