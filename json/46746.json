Beyond the Park lay Fifth Avenue–and Fifth Avenue was where she wanted to be!\n\nShe had read in the ’Boudoir Chat’ of one of the Sunday papers that the smartest women were using the new pigeon-blood note-paper with white ink; and rather against her mother’s advice she had ordered a large supply, with her monogram in silver. It was a disappointment, however, to that Mrs. Fairford wrote on the old-fashioned white sheet, without even a monogram–simply her address and telephone number.”–Edith Wharton, _The Custom of the Country_, 1913, The Library of America edition published by arrangement with Charles Scribner and Sons.\n\n",
