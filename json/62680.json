      "content": "What Monotype is actually doing is making use of Google's ad service which places ads based on keywords, i.e. advertisements for fonts get placed on webpages dealing with fonts. But Google has no automatic way of knowing whether a given website dealing with fonts is a pirate site or a legitimate site. So by all means write to Monotype and alert them to their ads appearing on a pirate site: they can then contact Google and have that site added to a blacklist of sites on which their ads should not appear. It's not as if Monotype have gone out and deliberately paid the pirate site to host their ads.\n\nI think the Google ad model as currently implemented is very problematic. The non-Internet equivalent would be putting an ad on a sandwich board but then not giving the guy carrying the board any directions about where to walk in the city, and only after someone spots him standing in front of a brothel next to people doing a heroin deal telling him not to go down that street.\n\n"
