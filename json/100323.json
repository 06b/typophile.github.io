      "content": "I think this is a custom-made wordmark, not based on any existing typeface. The one who did it apparently tried to derive many forms from others. The results look somewhat off to me. ‘r’, for instance, is almost the same as the left half of ‘n’. ‘g’ and ‘b’ have virtually identical bowls. Also, rounded letters have no visible overshoot below the baseline. Maybe autotracing worsened the appearance of the logo (a look at [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011103058/http:/www.engbers.de/uploads/pdf/Mediengestalter_HP_engbers.pdf) PDF seems to confirm that). If you aim for a similar (but more professional) look, I agree that Verdana (or Tahoma) is your best bet.\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry for the late reply. I've been ill. The flew is chopping away on Holland.\n\nI've also got the feeling the basic is Verdana, but because it's not well executed it thought this might be a freeware font swirling the internet. The weight seems heavier than the Verdana Regular, the logo font is wider but the balance is off. The 'e' for instance seems to wide for me.  \nBut seeing the fact that this is quite an old company it seems strange to me that this is a freeware font or even Verdana.  \nSince the company doesn't use Verdana in any publication I skipped this font. But I think I should dig a bit deaper in the companies archive. Perhaps the've got some old file on a disc somewhere.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n"
