  "content": "Many of the Greek capital characters share the same glyph form as Roman capitals.  \nFor an OpenType font, where there are different character positions for Roman and Greek capitals, is there any reason, other than convenience, for the glyphs to be identical?\n\nIn typographic situations where both Greek and Latin text appear together, harmony may be necessary, but if that can be achieved with different versions of the common capitals, why not?\n\nIdeally, as with the ClearType faces, it makes logical design sense to start from scratch and consider the criteria for all the alphabets which are to be represented in a typeface. However, even then the situation still ends up with the usual tally:  \nRoman caps: approx. 50 serifs  \nRoman Lc: approx. 50 serifs  \nGreek Caps: approx. 65 serifs  \nGreek Lc: approx. 15 serifs (many of which are \"fudged\" terminal endings)\n\nI'm including Greek characters in a typeface I'm working on at the moment. It's a revival of a Roman typeface with large serifs. Going the usual route of having common cap glyphs, there is the usual stylistic disparity between Greek caps and lowercase, slightly more pronounced than in Constantia and Cambria, for instance, but as there are plenty of other common stylistic elements (stroke weight, contrast and angle of stress in particular), it's perfectly acceptable.\n\nHowever, while remaining within the overall mien of the face, it would be quite possible to create a separate set of Greek cap glyphs with fewer serifs, and certain Greek caps could be more easily made properly Greek, such as Upsilon, with curved arms, rather than aping the Roman Y (in fact, Cambria does have this distinct form). Delta and Phi would also benefit by fewer serifs elsewhere among the caps.\n\nHas this already been done?  \nIs the disparity between Greek caps and lower case, in a traditional serifed face, the desirable norm?  \nOr do you think the idea of a full set of different cap glyphs is worth pursuing?\n\n",

Especially for a text face.\n\nOne obvious rationale for this is that the spacing is different (Greek having much more round forms, at least in the lc) and this should affect the black bodies too. Related to this is the fact that serifs are indeed not as \"authentic\" in Greek. And a rationale that's harder to justify but much more powerful in my mind is that communication depends on contrast.\n\nVeljovic's Sava (at your favorite font house :-) is worth looking at.\n\nhhp\n\n"

The lowercase of the Greek is completely different than Roman and the Greek capitals were romanized by whomsoever has adapted roman faces to Greek usage.  \nIt makes much more sense to me to make the Greek caps Greek caps and not retrofit them to the roman model. I think that the curves prevalent in the lowercase need something different than traditional roman caps. I don't feel that the roman N is quite right for Greek. I also feel that the width proportions are not the same. The roman H feels too wide; the M too vertical; the O too full. Understand that this is my personal opinion and not that of any Greek scholar. All of the ancient Greek inscriptions that I have seen feel narrower than Roman and the Roman feels too rigid.  \nI also wonder about kerning implications as well as fitting of the Tonos. There may be an advantage of fewer kerning pairs by making a separate Greek set of caps.\n\nChrisL  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nI may have 100% Greek blood flowing in my veins, but I do not have scholarly knowledge of Greek writing flowing from my brains :-)\n\n"

Constantia is an example of a hybrid lowercase, in which the ductus of the lambda, pi and tau tends towards the traditional ductus, while many other letters are closer to the ductus of the Latin for greater harmony of appearance. This may be the last Greek typeface I design in this way: I'm pretty happy with the result in Constantia, but I'd rather work more fully with the traditional ductus.\n\nI'm not sure that anything can be done about the disparity with the uppercase. You can't apply the traditional lowercase ductus to the uppercase letters without making something very freakish, and you can't apply the typical uppercase ductus to the lowercase letters without effectively Latinising the Greek letters. The Greek bicameral alphabet is the result of a shotgun wedding between two different alphabets of independent evolution.\n\nNeedless to say, the lower the contrast of a typeface is, the easier it is to blend the treatment of upper- and lowercase Greek letters.\n\n"

Therefore, a sans serif like Carter's Greek Helvetica has proven to be a successful proposition, because both cases have no serifs. So nu looks like v, gamma like y? -- that's rationalization/modernization, not Latinization/Westernization.\n\nHowever, a Greek \"serifed\" face is a bit of an oxymoron, as the lower case is going to be relatively serif free, while the caps are going to have lots of serifs, especially if many of them do double duty in the Roman alphabet.  \nSo what I'm inclining towards now is a distinct set of semi-serifed Greek-only capitals, so that the glyphs for A and Alpha, B and Beta, E and Epsilon, etc., will all be different -- as has been done occasionally in the past with Y and Upsilon.\n\nI'll post a PDF when it's done.\n\n"

They are more like the exit stroke of a Latin lowercase a, which may or may not occur even in sans serif types.\n\nI disagree that Matthew's Helvetica is a successful proposition. For instance, I don't think nu should ever look like a Latin v. I don't think that constitutes 'rationalisation', considering that there is absolutely no precendence for the nu to take that form. What is being rationalised? Not the form of the nu, which is simply being ignored in favour of a mistaken belief that the Latin v is some kind of homograph. It is an arbitrary decision, as if one decided that a Latin w should take the form of a Greek omega. I mean, ωhat the fυck?\n\nThe most telling problem of the old Helvetica Greek is that it _doesn't look like Helvetica._ If you put text in the Latin and Greek side-by-side, they have completely different typographic colour.

It is a freak, not a new model for what the letter j looks like.\n\nWith regard to the form of the kappa, both shapes have been in use for some time -- indeed, there are plenty of examples of forms that make obvious the transition from one to the other --, and the appropriateness of one or the other is more dependent on the style of typeface than notions of archaic vs. modern. And I disagree with your characterisation of the second form as being a 'roman form small-cap K'. The second kappa form derives directly from the earlier one: the key structural difference is that the leg is a separate stroke, rather than a return from the upper right. The fact that this has been rationalised into something more like K in some typefaces shouldn't obscure the origins and variety of this form. [The two forms of kappa in the new Adobe Garamond Premiere Pro fonts are worth examining.]\n\nIf you are not talking about Helvetica Greek as being successful in terms of mass usage, I wonder in what sense you do consider it successful? I consider it successful _only_ in terms of mass usage. I don't think it succeeds in being Helvetica, and I don't think it succeeds in being Greek. Further, the rationalisation itself is inconsistent and seemingly arbitrary: why maintain the entry stroke of the gamma while removing it from the nu? why treat the poor sigma as an omicron with a stick attached when elsewhere the relationship of adjacent straights and curves is handled in a way that is both more sophisticated and more characteristic of Helvetica?\n\nAnyway, our disagreement about the (de)merits of Helvetica Greek aside, I look forward to seeing your semi-serif Greek caps. This sounds to me like a good idea to explore, and most likely fruitful.\n\nBy the way, if you take a look at the MS font Sylfaen, you'll note that the Greek caps Geraldine Wade made for the design are different from the corresponding Latin forms. In that case, Geraldine found my thick Latin wedge serifs to be too massive to work with her Greek lowercase, so reduced the weight of them.\n\n"

At the time, Linotype had a virtual monopoly on typesetting equipment in Greece, largely due to a promise to the local agent that Linotype would produce Greek versions of any existing typeface requested by the local market (this information from Mike Parker). At the time, partly due to the policies of the military dictatorship, the trend in Greece was to look western and modern. The result was a library of highly Latinised Greek designs: Baskerville, New Century Schoolbook, Souvenir, Times and, yes, Helvetica. Helvetica is not some separate programme of rationalisation and modernism: it demonstrates exactly the same approach to Latinisation as the other Linotype Greek types of that time, only more subtly because it doesn't have serifs stuck on every available appendage. [By the way, at the Greek type conference in Athens in the mid-90s, Matthew joked about being surprised that he hadn't been asked to add serifs to the Helvetica Greek, since they were so much the rage.]\n\nThe Helvetica Greek nu, far from being 'not a Romanized form', _is_ the Latin v glyph! The only difference is the spacing.\n\n_I consider Helvetica Greek to be succesful in integrating upper and lower case.

Some glyphs, such as delta, are more authentic on both counts, but overall the retention of tiny vestigial \"curly bits\" on characters like upsilon strikes me as tokenism\\*. It is subtly continued throughout the Linotype version, and forms an effective stylistic theme, but I don't think there is anything significantly less Greek in the more ruthlessly modernized Carter version. In fact, the \"dubious\" flat top to the delta echoes his treatment of the top of xi and zeta, which to my mind is a perfectly legitimate design feature for all three glyphs, and in this consideration of a shared feature, respectfully Greek.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that historic cultural authenticity is not the only game in town, and that I'm suspicious of its volkisch quality. It's also possible to be modern and local, or modern and international.\n\n\\*So John, as you hinted in that direction, I'm excited at the prospect of a contemporary, clean, Greek monoline sans from you that goes beyond tokenism, fully grounded in the traditional ductus.\n\n\\>Have you asked?\n\nNo, other than second-generation Greek friends in Toronto, and looking at magazines. But I'm aware of the main issue. It seems to me that there are functional problems today with the traditonal Greek letterforms, with their \"baroque\" stress, to use Bringhurst's terminology (i.e. stress at many angles), and a profusion of extenders -- which combine to create a dense, awkward text body. What to do, and who to do it, and who to decide on whether it's appropriate?\n\nThe forces of commerce in Greece are not afraid to throw out tradition and create bastard \"Latinized\" forms, if this results in more open, more even text color -- or use western imports to the same effect. On the other side of the issue are public sector traditionalists, who would like to educate the heretics about the error of their ways.\n\nOur frame of reference at Typophile seems to be faces designed for non-Greek multinationals by non-Greek type designers. Gerry Leonidas, a native Greek I'm assuming, has had some say in the ClearType Greek alphabets, but I suspect there are also other, less conservatively inclined Greek type designers at work.\n\nI'm not sure how important it is for a type designer to be indigenous, when designing \"foreign\" scripts. Type designers are doing multiple language encodings in FontLab now. Ideally, I'd like to see more indigenous type design and local typeface use, but the reality is that many indie foundries cater to an international web market.\n\nA little knowledge sets one off on a sensitive footing -- outreach by Twardoch and Bilak on CE diacritics has been huge -- but then the designer is on his/her own with regards to the degree of historicism, personality, theoretical constructs, etc., that goes into the face. It helps if you can read the alphabet, and for what it's worth Greek is part of my cultural heritage, having studied it at school, so I feel a comfort level that I don't have with Cyrillic; it's unlikely I will include Cyrillic encoding in any of my typefaces.\n\n\\>it’s what they feel.\n\n\"Sincerity is bullshit\" - Harry Frankfurt\n\n"

Because they don't understand the underlying mechanisms of scripts and reading (the same as most conservatives). So the two sets are not <cite>inherently</cite> linked - it's merely a generally-valid association.\n\n\\> I’m not sure how important it is for a type designer to be indigenous\n\nAs I said in my Spatium article, nativity is not required for making decent fonts, but it is a requirement for marking progress in that script; this is because there is an -incommunicable- understanding, an immediate feeling of right/wrong that comes through the subconscious, through extended exposure at a young (i.e. receptive) age, something that cannot be formally taught.\n\nhhp\n\n"

The Greek Font Society has made some revivals of historical types, and there have been a few other examples of more cursive designs, but the majority of fonts for sale and seen in use are decidedly non-traditional and most often Latinised. What you seem to be characterising as a new dynamic is, in fact, three decades old and, in my opinion, quite tired.\n\nIf I had to identify a current 'pull' or dynamic, I would actually say that it is in the opposite direction, but not in a ideological way. Both within and without Greece there are now type designers who are engaging creatively with the traditional forms again, and in the process revisiting assumptions of the past few decades about e.g. what a sans serif Greek type should look like. I'm not sure what your point was in linking to Natasha Raissaki's thoughts on the question, but she seems to agree with me: 'In this case, the substitution of greek letters with latin ones is no way an evolution but rather a violation (and of course a remnant of the Linotype/Monotype diffusion of greek latinised typefaces back in the 80's -a mistake now partially ammended)' -- citing specifically the design and redesign of Helvetica Greek in her footnotes.\n\n"

Nick specifically referred to 'a more historically sensitive form of progress'. I would prefer 'historically informed'. In either case, the emphasis is on knowledge over ignorance, and what one does with that knowledge -- how one combines it, for instance, with other information, intuitions and ideas in the design of new types -- is not a matter of dumb luck. No one is advocating a purely historical revival approach to Greek type design. The immediate programme of the Greek Font Society to date has been one of revival: but that should be seen in the context of digital font making as cultural preservation, not prescriptive for new designs. When designers like Natasha speak of a need for historical understanding as a corrective to a short-sighted and largely amnesiac view of Greek letters informed by the graphic design media of the past thirty years, I think they mean no more than that. I see it fundamentally as a call for the expansion of options in Greek type design and typography, and an opening up of discourse to include the past as an active agent.\n\n"
