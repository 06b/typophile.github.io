I know the reasoning behind why there are two but don't know if one font house (in my case adobe or berthold) is better than the other. Is there any difference in the quality of the type? What types of things do I need to take into consideration when given choices of font houses? Any input would be greatly appreciated.   \n   \nNote: I'm looking to purchase at Philsfonts which has been highly recommended to me, but have never purchased there before.\n\n [‹ Where do you buy fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012174004/http:/typophile.com/node/1391 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Archive through September 24, 2003 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012174004/http:/typophile.com/node/1525 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

For 20 years he's   \nmade a name for himself as an accomplished acoustic   \nand electric guitar player. He's also the inventor of   \nthe Daxophon [(sic)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012174004/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=FF010269X1P1&start=1), an instrument where thin strips   \nof wood are played with a bow to mimic animal sounds   \nand human voices.\"   \nReichel redesigned and expanded his popular Barmeno   \nfamily for FontFont, but had to change the name to   \nFF Sari to avoid being sued by the new owners of the   \nBerthold Type library. See [aforementionned article](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012174004/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/berthold.html):   \n_Berthold made FontShop change the name of two of   \ntheir packages (FF New Barmen 1 and 2, now called   \nFF Sari 1 and 2), which evidently must have cost   \nFontshop some money and embarrassement. The name   \nchange was because FF New Barmen was too close to   \nBarmeno, which is a Berthold font. As Apostrophe   \nputs it: \"I can only imagine the stream of curses   \nthat went through Hans Reichel's head when he was   \ntold of what happened._      \n   \nWhich in short means he doesn't own his creation anymore.   \nSame thing happened to Albert Boton who _can't use   \nhis own name_ to brand his type designs anymore   \nbecause one of his typefaces in the Berthold type   \nlibrary is called Boton.\n\n"

Please no dinosaur jokes!   \n   \nSo, Yves, you wrote about going to the source. Should I then be looking at FF Sari or stick with Barmeno? I had found a font example that gave enough character yet elegant simplicity for a logo I need to design. Michael Yanega (bowfinprints.com) was kind enough to identify it for me and put me on to this site. I started searching for Barmeno and found out about the Berthold \"scandal\" and also about the original type designer.   \n   \nThe font doesn't have to be perfect (it's going on tractors and excavating equipment), but I'm such a type-aholic that when I buy a font I want to get the best one out there at the best price I can afford. Notice I did not say cheap, low cost always helps...but quality is always first with me. And thanks for spending the time to explain all this.   \n   \nSo given all the controversy is there another font I should be looking at that would have a similar character? Or should I go over to FF?   \n   \nBTW, bored--absolutely not. I wish I had time to learn a lot more about the fine details of type. I found all the articles very informative and enlightening.
