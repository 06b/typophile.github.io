  "content": "Hi everyone\n\nI'm creating a prototype magazine for a class assignment, and am looking for two particular fonts to use within it.\n\nIt's a sixties-inspired magazine, but still contemporary. I want it to look clean and professional - nothing that reminds me of Austin Powers!\n\nI'm keen on Bodoni for headings, but what is a sans serif that goes with it? A typeface I can use for the body copy? Any good ideas?\n\nOn a side note - what are good serif fonts that go with avenir or avant garde (or serif for courier new - that isn't helvetica)?\n\nHope you can help!\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "Because of its construction, pointed nib pen, Bodoni's sans counterpart is something in circle of Helvetica and other \"swiss\" typefaces.  \nMassimo Vignelli had some good combinations of Bodoni and Helvetica - especially in period of 60's and modernism.\n\nAvenir and Avantgarde, that is a bit tough, because they are geometric fonts, and first answer would be Bodoni or anything in didone area. Avantgarde has its serif compatriot in Lubalin Graph, slab serif version of avantgarde.\n\n"

      "content": "Bringhurst suggests several traditional combinations. Off the top of my head:\n\nGill/Perpetua  \nFutura/Bodoni  \nFrutiger/Meridienne  \nHelvetica/Craw Clarendon  \nSyntax/Minion\n\nI have had success with Helvetica Neue and ITC Century, especially due to the fact that they are both large families. The trick when combining serif's and sans' is to counterbalance the x-height, stroke width, character width, ascenders, descenders, cap height, axis &c. That's a lot of different variables. Look at [this thread on Utopia and Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217234058/http:/typophile.com/node/55767) for a good Illustration. The traditional school of thought says go for similarity or contrast, but not in between (shit or get off the pot). Utopia/Univers is a good example of similarity while Futura/Bodoni is a good example of contrast. If you can afford to, I highly recommend investigating Berthold's Futura Serie as it has small caps and old-style figures.\n\nSome typefaces, such as Rotis, have both which can be convenient. And recently, I noticed that Font Bureau has a similar/compatible list of typefaces on the right hand side of their specimens. Also very convenient.\n\nAt the end of the day however, it's not the font, it's how you use it that counts.\n\n_(but that's just something people with small fonts say)_\n\n"
