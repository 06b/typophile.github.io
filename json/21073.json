This font appears to be the similar to the font on many other public buildings—schools, post offices, etc—built in the 1950s and 1960s around the Twin Cities.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091216174048im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/fire7_3840.jpg)\n\nFWIW, this is the Minneapolis Fire Station #7 on E Franklin at Cedar.\n\nI love the curved stroke on the ’7’.\n\n",

I’d even bet that a lot of the architectural lettering is even inspired by Kabel.\n\nI wonder why there are so many variations on this idea, though?

One is more geometric (Futura, Kabel, etc.) and one more along the lines of grotesk (Neutraface, Proxima Nova and what have you).\n\n"
