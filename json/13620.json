  "content": "fontBoy was launched in the summer of 1995 to manufacture and distribute fonts designed by [Bob Aufuldish](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204224908/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bob%20Aufuldish) and [Kathy Warinner](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204224908/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Kathy%20Warinner) of the design office, Aufuldish & Warinner. The foundry has released fonts ranging from the quirky and handmade to the geometrically precise. The current direction of fontBoy’s work incorporates more classical elements into the fonts. The designers try to stay focused on what interests them rather than trying to chase trends. Derided and celebrated as being part of the early 90’s grunge movement, the designers see themselves connected to the wide-open early 20th century version of modernism rather than the formulaic high modernism of the international style.\n\nSince its founding, fontBoy’s award-winning fonts have been published widely, included in: [Indie Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204224908/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Indie%20Fonts) 1, Critique Magazine’s Big Crit, Graphis Digital Fonts 1, [Typology](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204224908/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typology), by [Steven Heller](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204224908/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Steven%20Heller) and [Louise Fili](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204224908/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Louise%20Fili), Extreme Fonts, by Spencer Drate, emotional\\_digital, by Alexander Branczyk, The Designer’s Guide to Web Type, and The Designer’s Guide to Symbol & Icon Fonts Online.\n\n",
