I havent had a chance to totaly look at everything yet but It was really interesting to the progression of some of the identities.   \n   \nAnyways I am a high school student, my name is Tom and I am from Toronto, Canada. I am looking forward to my experience here :D   \n   \nA few friends of my parents who run small business and have a tight budget have given me the opportunity to do some small design jobs for them.   \n   \nI just got one to design a logo for a company that sells a variety of different UPS units to deliver uninterupted power protection incase the power goes out. they are called \"UPS For Less\"   \n   \nHere are my first few ideas, I am having a bit of trouble finding a type face to suit this and I am still working on the icon, which is a sheild combined with a power symbol. Any help would be much appretiated.   \n   \n ![Samples](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818155241im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36129.jpg)   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",

You can certainly keep the face you have, but add more space.   \n   \nIn the meantime, I've been poking around looking at varous other UPS system logos.
