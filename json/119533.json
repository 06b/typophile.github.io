      "content": "Thanks for the fast response! Proxima Nova Semibold Extra Condensed is very, very close but not exactly the same. The font used for JIM'N NICK'S has consistent line width while Proxima Nova Semibold Extra Condensed is slightly variable. The R crossbar is also lower on the glyph, just a tad higher than the A crossbar. The Q is also a bit more square in the logo. I have to say, this is quite a bit closer than what I have found so far though. any more guesses are welcomed for sure!\n\nLearning Curve is spot on!\n\nI think the third font (smaller text) belongs to the URW Signal family\n\n"
