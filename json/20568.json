      "content": "I believe you can do better than that, since the lower case is very close to a number of formal script styles. (I think the ‘O’ is not from a script face at all — probably an italic ‘O’.)\n\nFor the lower case, have a look at [Shelley Andante](http://web.archive.org/web/20061202100612/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shelley-script/) (or Allegro, for that matter, since the l.c. is the same). Others could be Palace Script, or Embassy Script, but you would want to flatten and bold them a bit. Look for the un-looped ascenders. There are a number in the Solotype Catalog in the Z-families, so this may have come from a film type. Some were digitized.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
