I've been looking around and found a font that is similar called Zag but this most likely to be better. Anyone have any suggestion or alternative for this kind of font that has yin / yang element?\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121105045144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/screenshot-92_4332.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [screenshot-92.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121105045144/http:/typophile.com/files/screenshot-92.jpg) | 41.47 KB |\n\n",
