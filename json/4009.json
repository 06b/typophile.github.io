  "content": "Hi guys,   \n   \nI'm hoping someone can help me track down some typo-research. A bit of background first...   \n   \nAbout 7 years ago I did some legibility research in which I created a booklet featuring text that gradually degraded and became illegible over time. It began with a clean sans serif face, and by the end of the 20 pages it had morphed into an illegible font. When reading through it the eye actually 'learns' the font and by the end of it is actually quite legible. The purpose of the exercise was to explore how 'illegibility' is something the eye/brain can 'learn'.   \n   \nI have since lost all the research work that I did for this, but I know that a few other people in the typo-community have also made very similar experiments. I really need to find references/samples of this same experiment. I'm not after other types of research, I need this specific approach in particular. Anyone have any clues? I recall reading similar reference to it here and there but I can not pin point a reference. The University of reading might have something in their archives...?   \n   \nIf anyone can provide any leads I would be most appreciative.   \n   \nThanks,   \nMonib\n\n",

      "content": "Monib, what you're doing is extremely significant.   \n   \nMostly because I actually don't know anybody else who's done experiements dealing with the extremely important issue of Familiarity in readability. I urge you to take this up again, and please keep me in the loop! And let me know if I can help. What you end up finding can validate/invalidate tons of anecdotal opinions that I for one can't trust on its own. Emigre says one thing, Noordzij says another. I think they're both essentially wrong, but one can be more wrong than the other! :-)   \n   \nThe careful gradual shifting of a typeface (serif would be better though) is a superb way of measuring the effects of familiarity. This is very valuable stuff - go all the way with it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
