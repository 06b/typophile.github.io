  "content": "Hi all,  \nThis font, which is pretty similar to New York is puzzling me because it was used in 1914 and, of course, NY didn’t exist. Any ideas? It had bold and italics as well, which NY doesn’t have. Seems like it should be really easy for some of you…  \nBest  \nRobert\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [mysteryfont.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20110518142227/http:/typophile.com/files/mysteryfont_1.gif) | 91.17 KB |\n\n",

With those I came up with 39 fonts, including Bruce Old Style, several Century versions, some Caslons, several Bookmans, including Phemister's original from 1860, Old Style No. 7 and a scattering of other faces too modern to be considered. If you could show a sample with a few more of the Guide's Key letters (such as E, J, K, M, R and U) the results could be narrowed down much more. As Mark suggested this could be something that has no perfect current match, but you might see something that would be hard to tell from it without precise comparison.\n\n(Unfortunately, the Guide is still in work, and we are still making sample images, but the names of fonts meeting the key characteristics are shown with the design, foundry and date information.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The clincher would be to see the R, because Antique No. 1 has an odd leg on the R that thickens toward the baseline, without much of a serif, unlike the Antique Old Style in Jaspert..\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I tried that fancy-dancy super-duper online font id'er using my loupe on the characters but it wasn't very helpful as it turned out some bizarre results. Perhaps it just can't deal with such old fonts.\n\nAnyway, I think that COS is pretty darn close and will have to do for this project.\n\nThanks again for all your help. Great suggestions and I learn lots everytime I come here!!\n\nBest,  \nRobert\n\n"
