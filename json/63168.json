  "content": "It is our pleasure to announce that we have finally launched the new website! A project long in the works, we have merged the typography portal Typo.cz and the TYPO magazine website — **[www.typo.cz](http://web.archive.org/web/20091025084531/http:/www.typo.cz/en)**.\n\nThe website is now built on the WordPress publishing system. This system allows the editors to publish articles and news quickly and easily, and offers space for reader discussions. As a result, Typo.cz has become a full-fledged blog that will be updated regularly.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091025084531im_/http:/typophile.com/files/web-en_6151.jpg)\n\nFollowing a lengthy debate, we decided to provide the most space on the homepage to the blog, which will be focused on news and commentary on graphic design and typography. What’s new, brief news from the sector that readers can submit by using a simple form, and a calendar, which functions on the same principle, have been added to the right column. Another new feature is a convenient form for readers to submit their tips for website of the week, font of the week and photographs for the photo of the week section.\n\nAll new articles, news and entries in the calendar are automatically sent to Twitter – tune us in at **[typo\\_en](http://web.archive.org/web/20091025084531/http:/www.twitter.com/typo_en)**. And it would be unimaginable for the site to be without RSS feeds and search tools.\n\nAn online order form for subscriptions to TYPO magazine has also been set up, making it possible for you to pay for subscriptions by credit/debit card or bank transfer. Individual back issued can also be ordered. The contents of all the issues published so far, a list of contributors and additional information about the magazine are also featured on the site.\n\n**Special discount**\n\nGet a **5%** discount for one-year subscription or **10%** discount for a subscription for two years. Just enter _TYPOPHILE_ as a promotional code on the subscription form.\n\n",
