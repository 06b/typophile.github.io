Are there any limitations? Where can i find the license for Myriad?\n\nMany thanks!\n\nManfred\n\n",

You may use the fonts as part of a hosted service in your internal network, provided that no external users can access the fonts, all users accessing the service have a license for the fonts and you do not exceed the permitted number of computers.\"\n\nDoes this mean, i am not allowed to create a logo for my website?

If you create your logo and save it as a JPG or GIF, then it's no longer a font file, but just an image file, which is fine.\n\n"

They are limiting your rights to let others used the same software. They are not limiting others seeing the type, either in print or on screen.\n\n"

      "content": "I think the key point is that Adobe does not want to limit the use of the type. You can put it into a logo, or make it your corporate font. But they do limit the actual font software to one machine (normally). In other words, you cannot take the Myriad Pro font files and supply them to everyone in the company to install on their computer. Your license (I think) is only for the machine CS was installed on.\n\nWith a logo, you can save the logo in PDF (or another) format that embeds the font, and then it can be used on other computers that don't have the font installed. Or you can do the Flash or sIFR thing for the web, or just create the text as a GIF. There is no way that I know of to make it yoru corporate font (to be used in memos, reports, etc.) without buying licenses for all the computers it will be used on.\n\n"

The file that is used by sIFR is basically the digital font embedded in a .SWF Flash file. I've seen websites that clearly violate the spirit of the EULAs by distributing that .SWF across the internet for free, possibly just renaming the .SWF file.\n\nI know in my heart of hearts that that is wrong, but where does that stand legally?\n\n"

Someone would need to go after one of these guys to prove that. Obviously that 'someone' would not be Adobe. ;-)\n\nIn the past I don't think type designers have shown any interest in testing the limits of Flash and font encapsulation. Turning a blind eye often comes back to bite you. This may be a case of that, and who wants to be bitten by a blind eye.\n\nI recall writing to the lead developer of Flash before it was even a Macromedia asset, regarding respect for embedding permissions. I don't recall the exact answer but I don't think it was positive. I have no idea what Flash does now.\n\n"
