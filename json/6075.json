  "content": "So I've been working on a website for an industrial consultant, and settled on this logo:   \n   \n ![rohr](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110141600im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4279.jpg)   \n   \nNow, I realize that the \"R\" in the circle-r device is Arial Black and the logotype is in Frutiger. I have yet to resolve the issue since I don't particularly like the rounded tail on the Frutiger \"R\".   \n   \nWhat I'm more interested in is a critique of the basic idea itself. Are there existing logos out there that are very similar? Is it just plain a bad idea or iffy execution?   \n   \nAnd if you'd care to peep the site itself, you may find it at [www.famished.org/rohr](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110141600/http:/www.famished.org/rohr) until the client gets his domain name.   \n   \nThanks.\n\n",

If the logo is reduced for letterhead and faxed, it could appear to be a registration and not a propreitary logo at all. hmm\n\n"

      "content": "Is it just me, or does this logo look like it's set in Helvetica? And the R in the circle is more like Akzidenz Grotesk. I'm a bit confused here.   \n   \nAnother way of going at it would be to center name, circle and \"R\". And by centering, I mean center mathematically along the horizontal axis and then adjust optically.   \nThen you might wanna print out both versions (Stephen's suggestion and mine) at the same size and look at them from a distance. You'll notice that in Stephen's version the circle will be higher up, but the common baseline will give it a sense of stability and sturdiness, whereas mine will have a more horizontal dynamic. It's your personal preference which will make you go for one version or another, as I think both are valid solutions.   \n   \nP.S. When you decide to opt for Helvetica for the logo, bear in mind that half the world and their sister's logo is set in Helvetica. Ask Erik Spiekermann (_Rhyme & Reason: A Typographic Novel_, pages 100-101). I've got a hunch he might be right.\n\n"

I suppose I could keep the logo pretty big (1\"?) and make the registration mark as small as legally possible.   \n   \nYves: I might be smoking crack on the Arial-Frutiger thing... either way, they should probably be the same typeface. I definitely want a straight tail. I don't really want to use Helvetica, but I am not terribly happy with how other faces look.   \n   \nMy all-time favorite sans is Interstate but the LC looks like poo. Maybe Champion?\n\n"
