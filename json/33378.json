Do not include specific religious symbols unless the business or product has a specifically religious nature or clientele.\n2. Do not include photos of hot chicks, unless the product is intended for use by, or are in themselves, hot chicks, or you intend to imply the customer’s enhanced sexual attraction by association with the product.\n3. It is not necessary to display all the products in the business’s catalog on the first page of the ad.\n\nI swear If I see one more ad for industrial water pumps with a Jesus fish and three bikini clad babes amongst hundreds of tiny pumps, with the copy lettered in Comic Sans and five other fonts, I think I might stab something.\n\nAre there any other rules you would add to the list?\n\n [‹ Hevetica vs. Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20071113060730/http:/typophile.com/node/33301 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Display face suggesting Duchamp ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071113060730/http:/typophile.com/node/33317 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If Head-On taught me anything, it’s that a commercial need not be slick, expensive, or well-produced, it just needs to get attention. When one’s target audience chews tobacco, watches Nascar, and reads Hustler just make an ad with a hot chick, an American flag, and the phrase ”God Bless America.” Then promptly cash the check and move on. Good design need not be pretty if something quick and dirty can get the job done.\n\n"
