Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007082951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) foundry sometime before the Second World War. Its \"author\" there would have been [Dr. Rudolf Wolf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007082951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dr.%20Rudolf%20Wolf), who among other things was the designer of the [Memphis](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007082951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Memphis) type family. [August Rosenberger](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007082951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/August%20Rosenberger) may have been involved. He cut several of Memphis' weights, and would later cut designs of [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007082951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf)'s, including [Palatino](http://web.archive.org/web/20141007082951/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Palatino).\n\nBefore the digital-era, this was by no means a universal string. Several American foundries began typeface design testing with the letters **Hono**.\n\n",
