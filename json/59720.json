The new seven-font ITC Legacy Square Serif and seven-font ITC Legacy Serif Condensed families, extends the existing ITC Legacy suite to a total of 35 fonts.\n\nDesigned by award-winning type designer, Ronald Arnholm, the new ITC Legacy Square Serif and ITC Legacy Serif Condensed fonts area “typographic tour de force,” according to Allan Haley, director of words and letters at Monotype Imaging.\n\nRonald Arnholm said that the new designs “suddenly came to me out of the blue that a square serif design was needed to round out the ITC Legacy family. As for the condensed serif typefaces, they turned out to be natural complements to the normal weights and the sans serif condensed faces I drew earlier.”\n\nThe full ITC Legacy collection of fonts, which includes faces that first became available in the early 1990s, is based on the Eusebius typeface by Nicolas Jenson, the French engraver, printer and pioneer typographer who created the design centuries ago in 1470.\n\nArnholm has designed more than 100 fonts that are available from Monotype Imaging’s e-commerce sites. He is an art professor at the University of Georgia, Lamar Dodd School of Art. The fonts can be viewed, licensed and downloaded from the company’s e-commerce sites: Fonts.com, ITCFonts.com, Linotype.com and Faces.co.uk.\n\n",
