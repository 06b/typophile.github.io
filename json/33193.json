  "content": "Does anyone know of a website, or book, any resource really, that displays and identifies some of the beautfully hand crafted thick and thin serif's of the sixties, a bit like the Monotype modern fonts or the one shown. If I search all the usual font foundries I get the same old stuff coming up again and again and if I seacrh for sixties fonts etc i get the usual rubbish trown up by tacky online PC font shops, nothing remotely crafted. Please help me find a better resource for beautilly crafted type of days gone by.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150228180828im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_6088.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Yeah, you gotta remember that the Sixties reintroduced a lot of styles that were popular in the late 1800s, primarily Art Nouveau. Look at Alphonse Mucha's illustrations of women with long, flowy hair wearing garlands and surrounded by flowers, and you'll see the similarities. Except in the 60s they bumped up the chroma of all their colors about 1000% so that everything vibrated... And Bodoni and Didot are contemporaries of Napoleon.\n\nI'd love to see the old beautiful types make a comeback, but it may be a while yet before they come back around. It reminds me of what my late grandfather said: \"You keep that tie long enough and it'll come back in style!\"\n\n"
