Now, I've modified existing type and created a number of hand drawn logos, but have never really attempted to vectorize a type sample from the ground up. Any advice for a type designer ignoramus? Besides the obvious, how would you even categorize this face? Any typefaces you can think of that are even close I could use for reference? If it would help, I'd be more than happy to scan all the letters. Disregard any kerning or tracking issues for now...still the scans from the book.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

If the tips of the serifs are chopped off, no matter how small the cut, it becomes an issue for scaling. Novarese's Symbol, for instance, dating from the phototype era, has a serif treatment that looks sharp in text, but gets clunkier the bigger it is used.\n\n"
