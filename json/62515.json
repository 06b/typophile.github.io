The Phoenician script, from which the Greek alphabet derives, is not an alphabet in this sense because it records only consonant sounds (it is classified as an 'abjad'). There are true alphabets that are not derived from the Greek alphabet, such as hangul, the Korean alphabet.\n\nA looser linguistic definition of 'alphabet' includes any writing system with symbols for separate sounds rather than syllables or words.

If alphabet is taken to be a term comparable to abugida (from the Ethiopean name of the ge'ez script) or abjad (adapted from a name for the Arabic script), then it makes more sense to use all those terms as purely structural categories regardless of the origins of the specific examples.\n\nWhat would the proto-Canaanite script be, for instance? The Greek, Ge'ez, and Arabic scripts are all ultimately derived from it, after all. And as far as I've seen the most common use for the term abugida is for various Indic scripts, which have very little to do with Ge'ez. The names are best thought of as being taken from well-known examples of each category, and not meant to restrictive to scripts actually derived from the said examples.\n\n"

You would prefer one over the other only in certain contexts, for example when you would want to emphasize the alphabetic nature of the script.\n\nNow, John Hudson makes a distinction that I think could be useful in many respects, but as far as I'm aware it's not one that's made conventionally. If I were to employ that distinction, I would explain it beforehand so the reader understands what I'm talking about.\n\n<cite>Surely the Latin script is only represented by the Latin/Roman alphabet?</cite>  \nJohn means that subsets of scripts derived from that originally used to record Latin ('the Latin script') may be used for different languages ('the English alphabet', 'the Welsh alphabet', 'the Vietnamese alphabet'). He would understand by 'Latin alphabet' only the collection of graphemes used for writing the Latin language. Again, a useful distinction, but probably too subtle for general discourse.\n\nIn this case, 'alphabet' is one of these general terms that different people have adopted to use in a technical sense, but with different distinctions in mind. Linguists will care about the sense of having signs for consonants and vowels in the same system, while others will see the opportunity to use the term to describe each case where the same script is adopted for a number of different languages.\n\n"

It gets used a lot in contemporary font making, and also in text encoding and processing circles, to refer to writing systems e.g. ‘Latin script’, ‘Arabic script’, etc.. I'm as guilty of this as anyone.\n\nIf I want to be very precise in this context, though, I use the term ‘writing system’ rather than script: the Latin or Roman writing system, the Arabic writing system, and so on. The nice thing about this term is that it doesn't have multiple meanings and it specifically references the system of signifiers and signifieds that make up that system, without reference to the forms of those signs. This also means that one can sidestep the classification issues of e.g. alphabet vs. abjad (which arise from the fact that there are almost no perfect abjads, and what seems to me the inevitable conclusion that an abjad is a subcategory of alphabet); ‘writing system’ can accomodate e.g. the use of _matres lectiones_ (letters as vowels) in classical Hebrew or the rôle of the alif in Arabic.\n\nThe biggest difficulty of the word ‘script’ is its use, both common and specialist, in labelling of specific styles of writing, e.g. the Carolingian Script (a stylistic category of the Roman writing system) or the Nas'taliq Script (a stylistic category of the Arabic writing system). The fact that these script styles were not developed by Romans or by Arabs only adds to the nomenclatureal fun.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi guys:\n\nI am not sure this help. Since I am from Malaysia and deal with Malaysian clients all the time, allow me to provide some historical background, perhaps that can give a different perspective to the whole topic:\n\n\"Malay is the main language of communication for the inhabitants of the Malay Archipelago, and it has been the lingua franca of the region for at least five centuries. The Malay script known as Jawi is derived from Arabic. Both Arabic and Jawi have been widely used for religious and secular manuscripts since Islam was established in the region. Jawi is a combination of Arabic and Persian scripts, with additional letters added as an adaptation to local phonetics. These additional characters are \"pa\", \"nga\", \"cha\" and \"gha\".\n\n\"Jawi script has been through various orthographic improvements over the years, to make it compatible with Malay phonetics. In 1904 a committee was set up to produce a guidebook to change Jawi to Malay 'Rumi' orthography, which was known as 'Romanised Malay Spelling'. It was also known as 'Sistem Ejaan Wilkinson'. Zainal Abidin Ahmad, also known as Za' ba, rearranged Malay Rumi orthography in 1938, affecting the Wilkinson Malay Orthography System which has been used by school since 1904\"\n\n(From \"The Malay Manuscript: An Introduction\", pg21, 26; Published by Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia (IAMM) )\n\nThis \"Romanised Malay Spelling\" version of this Malay language later became the national language of Malaysia, which we called \"Bahasa Malaysia\" ('Bahasa' means language) The same \"Romanised\" malay language was also used in Indonesia which later became the national language of Indonesia- \"Bahasa Indonesia\", with slight differences due to local adaptation.\n\nHistorically both Malaysia and Indonesia were located in the same region called \"The Malay Archipelago\" or \"Nusantara\". Both countries used the same language until the two countries declared independence. In fact, Singapore was also situated in the middle of this region and therefore Bahasa Malaysia is also the national language of Singapore due to historical reason. Though, most Singaporeans are more fluent in English and Chinese due to the education policy adopted by the Singaporean government after independence.\n\n( To divert a bit, that's why the 3 countries also share many cultural heritage. In recent months there have been many arguments among the 3 countries over the exclusive right of certain cultural practices, such as The batik, certain dances and foods, etc...)\n\nThat is from historical point of view. Culturally, we local Malaysians often say \"Romanised\" Bahasa Malaysia instead of \"Latinised\" Bahasa Malaysia.\n\nIt depends who are your audiences. If you are speaking to the local Malaysians, then to approach it both from cultural and historical point of view seems to be more appropriate. Therefore, \"Bahasa Malaysia uses the Roman alphabet\" would be a better choice and it sounds better to the locals too.\n\nThat would be my personal argument. And believe me, most Malaysian clients won't even know the difference, much less arguing about it. If they start to make noise over your choice of words, just quote the above excerpt I suggested to you to support your argument, and tell them that it's from IAMM. That would silent them.\n\nThe curatorial department of IAMM is quite authoritative in regards to this. If they have any doubt, ask them to call IAMM, I can give you the numbers.\n\nAll the best. : )\n\n(Aziz from Flower. Anything else to add?)\n\n"

Say: Bahasa Melayu.  \n2 Bahasa Melayu is a phonetic language, like Arabic,  \nand is best written (and read!) in Jawi.  \nBut Malays were fooled by a NATIONALIST,  \nand they are trying hard to revive the beautiful script.  \n [http://www.ejawi.net/converterV2.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021235/http:/www.ejawi.net/converterV2.php \"http://www.ejawi.net/converterV2.php\")  \n [http://dbp.my/tanya/Jawi](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021235/http:/dbp.my/tanya/Jawi \"http://dbp.my/tanya/Jawi\")  \n [http://www.jawi.ukm.my](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021235/http:/www.jawi.ukm.my/ \"http://www.jawi.ukm.my\")  \nMore in Bahasa Melayu:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/74436](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021235/http:/typophile.com/node/74436 \"http://typophile.com/node/74436\")\n\n"

At least the Roman Empire and its Latin language are the **source** from which most of this alphabet came. If we called it the _English_ alphabet, the Dutch and the French and the Germans and the Spaniards and even the Norwegians would feel we were appropriating ownership of the alphabet which they also use.\n\nOf course, since lower-case letters are such a prominent feature of the Latin writing system in current use, one could get really technical, and adopt as the standard term \"the Carolingian script\" - but if you started doing that, people would assume you were talking about paleography, rather than trying to use a technically accurate term for the writing system in _current_ use.\n\n"

If we want to use the English name of the language, do we say 'the Malay language'? (I'm assuming 'Bahasa Melayu' is the Malay language name?)\n\nThanks for those links, there are some beautiful examples of Jawi there.\n\nWhat language(s) and writing system existed in Malaysia before the arrival of Islam? I'm guessing Sanskrit would have been used, for example, during the times of the Srivijaiya kings?\n\n"

Thus, it is assumed that when nationalists in Turkey changed over to a form of the Latin script, this partly facilitated the improvement in that country's literacy levels. That may be, however, just chauvinism on our part.\n\nBut the fact that the one province in which Jawi now appears with Latin script did so _along with instituting Shari'a_ is very distressing, as this will diminish religious liberty, and the equality of people of all faiths, for people who live there. It is up to the speakers of Malay what script best represents their language, but any political movement which represents a movement away from the tolerance for which Indonesia has been praised is, of course, profoundly harmful.\n\n"
