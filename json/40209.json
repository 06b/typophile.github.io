Frames, and their replacements, are a feature of HTML and XHTML, and are used to layout pages. CSS is a system used to create a visual style for a web page, and may or may not affect layout, depending on how the HTML/XHTML is set up. It sounds like you should probably take a few web design classes to get a handle on this stuff—these are circa 1999 web standards, at this point there’s no reason to be designing a web site without a firm handle on XHTML and CSS.\n\n"

For the most part, they are bad, and antiquated. (see florian’s post).\n\nAs for showing another site within yours, well, that is actually the one main reason to use a frame, so yea, go for it. You might want to use an iFrame for that.\n\nThat said, are you SURE you need to trap the other site in a frameset? It’s fine to just link off to that site. And often much preferred by site visitors. Also, external sites can block your ability to load their site in a frameset if they so desire.\n\n"
