If you need something more playful, [MVB Grenadine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131192608/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Grenadine) and [MVB Pedestria](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131192608/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mvb_fonts/mvb_pedestria/) are bouncy but not blobby or bubbly.\n\n"
