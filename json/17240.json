I have tried but no-one responds via email. (I emailed these emails: [general@cape-arcona.com](mailto:general@cape-arcona.com), [king@cape-arcona.com](mailto:king@cape-arcona.com), [president@cape-arcona.com](mailto:president@cape-arcona.com))\n\nAnyone here know them?\n\nPlease send them my way. Thanks kindly.\n\n",
