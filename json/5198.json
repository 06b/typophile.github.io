What do they mean/represent?   \n   \nI've seen them one in print (just the first one) and once in the interface of a database software (first and second).\n\n",

      "content": "A good symbol dictionary (like Liungman's\\*) will tell you that the first is Scorpio (although it seems that usually the arrow either curls to point up or goes diagonally down-right, not straight), closely associated with birth, sex and death; it's also the symbol for Separation in alchemy. The second one is Virgo; Distillation in alchemy. The third sign I couldn't find (I checked in Koch's \"Book of Signs\" too), but it seems to be closest to Saturn/lead, although it's also similar to the sign for Leo/Digestion. Or it could be a \"facilitation\" of Virgo.   \n   \n\\* Interestingly, the first two signs are on the back cover of his book!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
