I'm looking for that retro soccer jersey/news station/toronto blue jays lettering that's typically very rounded and uses two lines to make the shape of the letter. I've looked all over on many freeware font sites to no avail, but if someone knows the name, it would make searching a lot easier. Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bluejays1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120627025106/http:/typophile.com/files/bluejays1.jpg) | 25.87 KB |\n| [cnn.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20120627025106/http:/typophile.com/files/cnn.gif) | 3.79 KB |\n| [channel2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20120627025106/http:/typophile.com/files/channel2.gif) | 579 bytes |\n| [cctv06.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120627025106/http:/typophile.com/files/cctv06.jpg) | 4.99 KB |\n\n",
