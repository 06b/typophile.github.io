  "content": "Typophile is made possible through the generosity of sponsors and efforts of volunteers, including time invested by us at Punchcut. We squeak time in on Typophile as often as we can without compromising client commitments.\n\nTypophile gets a lot of traffic. We’re seeing about 200,000 unique visitors every month, with actual page “hits” coming in around 300,000 per day. Google likes us. 20,000 Typophile users are depending on us. So we don’t take any site changes lightly.\n\nOn occasion we have to take the site down for maintenance upgrades. When we do, our general approach is to minimize downtime so that the community can keep moving, discussing and collaborating.\n\nHowever, we can only test so much on our development server before pushing the release live to the public. There’s no better test than unleashing thousands of simultaneous users (read as: ravenous type enthusiasts) on it. We really count on your goodwill during those times to pull together as a community to help us identify and squash bugs.\n\nWe’ve been down for a few days. A couple of the highlights from the recent downtime include:\n\n- Brand new server package with more processor power, RAM, disk space  \n- Editing bug has been fixed.  \n- A few Wiki bugs corrected  \n- Comment RSS is back  \n- Feedback/bugs form created\n\nHopefully, the most significant change you’ll notice is a speed increase. If you find bugs, let us know. We’re not promising a bug-free experience (yet). However **do not post bug threads in the forums**. Please direct feedback, comments, bugs here to our fancy new feedback form: [http://www.typophile.com/feedback/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825115600/http:/www.typophile.com/feedback/ \"http://www.typophile.com/feedback/\")\n\nThis new server package opens up lots of possibilities for Typophile, which will help us realize some goals we’ve had for the site for some time. Stick around, it’s only going to get better.\n\nJared, Joe, Christian and Zara\n\n—-\n\n_Special thanks go out to all those who contributed donations to Typophile in the last few days. We’ve seen an outpouring of support from around the globe. We’re extremely grateful for the vote of confidence. Thanks to your generosity, we will be able to cover several months of hosting for the site._\n\nIf you see any of these people online, be sure to thank them:\n\nRui Abreu  \nMichael Albright  \nSam Becker  \nTim Daly  \nPatricia Fabricant  \nMarten Fischer  \nFlorian Hardwig  \nHeron House Publishing Inc  \nDennis Hill  \nPaul Hunt  \nAndreas Kalpakidis  \nScott Leyes  \nEdward Maddison  \nConor Nolan  \nMarc Oxborrow  \nHrant Papazian  \nThomas Phinney  \nTamye Riggs  \nGary Schmidt  \nKris Sowersby  \nGraham Taylor  \nGeorge E.
