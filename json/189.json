So I figure it's worth looking into building my own.   \n   \nSince I'm already a hard core FOG user, I can't help but want to base my origins on this application and improve it as I have always wanted to see it improved.   \n   \nHowever due to my own technical limitations, I have always assumed making a font editor is heavy business until I found out about RealBasic. I have only dabbled in this program a few times and I'm not sure what it's capabilites are but I'd be interested in finding out if it has the ability to cobble something like this together.   \n   \nAre there any programmer types on the list that have any insight?   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n",

His website is [http://www.high-logic.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20060521015140/http:/www.high-logic.com/). This software is for pc's only right now and costs about fifty bucks.   \n   \nI use it at work here because I only do very rudimentary font creation and this software is cheaper than fontographer. But it is quite hefty for shareware. As a matter of fact, as far as shareware goes it is one of the best in any category.   \n   \nI would love to see it 'ported' to OS X so I would have an inexpensive (did someone say cheap) alternative to stretch my puny typographic wings on.   \n   \nAnyways, I think he would be a great resource to start with even though it is a different platform.   \n   \nTom\n\n"

I thought I made big changes and then ran the app and no different or little different.   \n   \nI was hoping to get deep enough into the application to figure out how to alias all the cursors and just see how much I could do with it - Like soupin' up my old bike. Let me know if you have found any good hacks for it.   \n   \nOtherwise, perhaps RealBasic isn't the best editor for this type of project, but with little serious programming experience other than HTML I truly wonder how difficult it really is to create an application that can do what FOG can. It's surprising how very basic it is and I would imagine some folks already have a good start on vector apps from RealBasic.   \n   \nThe thing that frustates me is that it would seem there is a way to build applications but because I don't have the knowledge, I am severly stuck with what's our there vs. what I can create. It's alot like font creation but in a different industry.   \n   \nAnyhow, thanks for the insight,   \nStuart :D\n\n"

Making even the tiniest change in one of those could totally hose FOG.   \n   \nMy ideal font editing program: The basic interface would be like FOG's metrics window, but you would be able to edit the outline too. Having a separate window to edit each glyph has always seemed rather limiting to me, and that they're done this way because that's the way it's alway been done. Apple's old bitmap font editor (FontEdit) was an exception. It would be especially handy for scripts.\n\n"

I can set words using the glyph I'm editing and see how my changes work in context. I can edit the side bearings in the outline editing window. If I decide that I need to edit another glyph in the sample word, a double click in the preview window makes it the current glyph in the frontmost editing window.   \n   \nWRT building a font editor from scratch - I've spent enough time writing code to know a bit about estimating the possibility of a project. My heuristic is such:   \n   \nA) If I think the project is going to be a piece of cake, then it's going to take a very long time.   \nB) If I don't know how hard the project will be, then it's far beyond my abilities at this point.   \n   \nThe \"build a boat only if you want to build a boat\" comment is dead on.

It just seems like it would streamline the process. This is one of the reasons I like doing my glyph design work in Illustrator. I can see everything in context.   \n   \nAaron's suggestion of keeping two windows open is a good one, but I think it would be even better if the two could be consolodated. It reminds me of the early versions of Illustrator where you couldn't draw and preview at the same time in the same window, so you would have two windows open--one to draw in and one to see what it looked like.   \n   \nI think this \"one glyph--one window\" idea is just something that's been around so long that it's never been questioned. Imagine if drawing programs worked like this. Each object would be stored in a library and could only be edited in its own window and could only be seen in context in a \"layout\" mode. It would be a real impediment.   \n   \nI'm not going to stop making fonts just because the tools could be better. The tools we have are light-years beyond what people used to create metal or photo type. But they could be better.\n\n"

If you want to get into the font editor business, then be prepared to spend a huge portion of your time for the next few years to do it.   \n   \nThat being said, FontLab's drawing capabilities are fully exposed to Python. That means that you can do additional drawing tools yourself and add them to FontLab. They already added FOG-like tools to FL 4.6 by doing this. If you don't like the way they did it, why not start by modifying their Python code?   \n   \nIt would be easier to change the drawing UI of FontLab than to get Fontographer up to FontLab's level of capabilities, IMO.   \n   \nMy two cents.   \n   \nT   \n   \nP.S.
