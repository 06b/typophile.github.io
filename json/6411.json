There's also a plate of the italic in something Smeijers once published, I think. Then I'm having this vision of all the UC glyphs in the RdR on facing pages, but I can't remember where I saw that. Sorry.   \n   \nDigitizing the RdR would be a great project - it's shocking that there hasn't been one yet. You might contact the Imprimerie Nationale of France for leads, and maybe informal \"permission\" as well.

      "content": "The RdR committee's engravings (I mistakenly wrote \"drawings\" before) were simply too precise. Without a pantograph it would have been impossible to get high fidelity. And then there was the issue of optical scaling you mention: it was something Grandjean implemented of course\\*, but either the committee didn't understand its need (only one of its members had any idea of type) or they created the \"spirit\" and expected Grandjean to \"distill\" it in the smaller sizes (which is not unreasonable). The way Grandjean totally dumped the engraved italic however was not a matter of accuracy though, but of taste and practicality.   \n   \n\\* Some people say that -because of the \"physicality of scale\"- the pre-pantographic designers didn't really see optical scaling the way we do, they \"just did it\", making each size look \"correct\". Some however were more sloppy than others - Caslon for example was just wanton in terms of consistency (although the variance in the italic \"Q\" is genial).   \n   \n--   \n   \nDan, a question: would you make a literal revival, or a mild adaptation? I think if you want this to be more than of historical interest, if you want people to use it to give their setting the RdR \"air\" but in a versatile manner, you should take some small-to-medium liberties with it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Dan, over the weekend I did something I should have done much earlier: check the wonderful Imprimerie Nationale specimen book of 1990, which shows the bulk of their metal collection in great depth and detail.   \n   \nFirst of all, there's a font called Jaugeon (in 12 sizes from 6 to 20) which is basically a very close rendering of the original engraved plates, done in the beginning of the 20th century. To me it's very attractive, and actually has a nice dark color. The italic is NOT the one shown in the plates\\* (it doesn't have all those serifs), but it's much more rigid and regular than Grandjean's cut. And the italic has some strange features, like a somewhat blackletter-style \"k\", and get this, it has those short lefthand spikes on the ascenders on the \"h\" and \"k\" as well as the \"el\", not that even the \"el\" needs the spike\\*\\* in the italic, since it was there to differentiate the lc roman \"el\" from the cap roman \"I\", but in the italic that problem is gone! Very strange.   \n   \n\\* And I guess this means the RdR had _three_ italics...   \n   \n\\*\\* BTW, I realize now that the claim that Grandjean incorporated the spike of the \"el\" is bogus, since the source engravings have it.   \n   \nThen there's the Grandjean font, which was made two centuries earlier, so it seems to be considered the \"official\" RdR font, but besides being too light I think, it's not nearly as pure, and some characters (like the \"f\" and especially \"?\") are really malformed. Also, the caps are _way_ too dark, and -as we discussed- the italics are very organic and cursive, really way out of character with the Roman. The Grandjean however was available in much greater a range, with 19 sizes from 7 to 64 (the Jaugeon has no real display cuts) as well as titling initials (16 sizes from 12 to 120).   \n   \nIn terms of doing a revival, I guess you might do one of Jaugeon, but you would really need some kind of IN consent there. Or better yet might be doing a revival directly from the plates, including the slanted-roman italics. According to what Patrick has shown me there has been a metal of that in the past, but certainly no digital.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I still haven't gotten my copy of the recent Lyon exhibition catalogue from Vendome, and I've just come back from a brief trip to Vienna, so I haven't had time to scour the libraries in Frankfurt for samples either.\\*   \n   \nA friend of mine who just came over from the States on Sunday did bring me my copy of Friedl's _Typography,_ and I enjoying perusing those low quality examples.   \n   \nMy gut feeling is to go for as close of a revival as is possible first. I can always do something more interpretive later. I like the slanted-Roman Italic alot, and will probably work on that first, instead of any other oblique/italic option. It is becoming more common though to design more than one variety of italic for a single Roman... so there will always be room for more.   \n   \n   \n\\*This is Germany, so school isn't going to start up again for another five weeks... everyone helpful in my neck of the woods is still on vacation...\n\n"
