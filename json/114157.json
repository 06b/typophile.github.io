      "content": "\"Would you have made it better if it were not free?\" seems backwards. I'm also slightly skeptical about to which extent there is a correlation between quality and price. It's certainly an implied correlation, but you have many deviations in practice. Hrant, I think finck was right to correct you when you said the main reason it doesn't render well is because it's free. I suppose in most cases one would ask money for a font which has been properly hinted and optimized, but this isn't always the case and it doesn't make your statement inherently true.\n\nI also wouldn't necessarily say a font is poorly made when it doesn't render well on the web. Many fonts are simply not optimized for the web. People love Helvetica, but if there is one font which renders horribly on the web in a Windows environment...\n\n"

In fact, they should take away his medical license, right? So much free care means he's gotta be incompetent, in spite of the thousands saved!\n\nAnd yet, and yet, you're on record as stating you prefer to check books out of the library rather than buy them.

      "content": "<cite>Charles, I'm also not following your logic.</cite>\n\n<cite>The main reason it doesn't render well is that it's free.</cite>\n\nBasic principles of any system of logic. (1) It must be sound. It's sound if, and only if, everything provable in the system is also true. (2) It must be complete. A system is complete if, and only if, everything that is true is provable in the system.\n\nSo, either way, counterexamples have weight. I guess the Wikipedia account of Paul Farmer doesn't give any hint of how much he's given without any monetary compensation, but the expertise is surely chronicled. <cite>Mountains Beyond Mountains</cite> is worth reading, not only for how much Farmer's given without financial motivation, but how, amongst other things, he changed WHO doctrine on treating resistant TB. And AIDS. The Wikipedia entry on the book, perhaps paradoxically, gives a better hint about the man: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains\\_Beyond\\_Mountains](http://web.archive.org/web/20140728054813/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_Beyond_Mountains \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains\\_Beyond\\_Mountains\")\n\nIf Dr. Farmer has a net worth of only $10,000 after 40 years of work, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nWell, maybe Hrant's <cite>logic</cite> is that the only successful motivation for good work amongst **font designers** is money. Perhaps, in his system, other people can have acceptable non-financial motivations, and be successful. That didn't come through, though.\n\nEven if that is the system: Now, Hrant, when informed that there was soon to be a new book by Rich Hendel, with a chapter by Kent Lew, remarked that he would not buy it. If he read it, he'd check it out from the library. So the author -- Hendel, in this case -- isn't going to get any payment, even if Hrant reads it. No \"advances against royalties\" for most academic work, you know.\n\nQED, Hendel & Lew have done bad work, so judged by the monetary decision, before reading. Or perhaps because Hendel is a book rather than font designer, he's allowed the exception. Poor Kent.\n\nIt probably will come as no surprise that I admire Farmer more than Papazian. But I also believe there is good work done with open source fonts, and that the motivations for such are not always misplaced.\n\n"
