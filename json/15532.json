  "content": "Hello,\n\nI`ve created a fashion logostyle for a young fashion designer,  \nwho is oriented for men and women clothing. From briefing this identity must  \nreflect classines, fashionableness. Must be wearable, but not quirky and not  \ntoo high luxury. For the understanding “fuchs” is in german fox, so I tried  \nto avoid typical association of logo with fox. I plan fox-heraldy-sign for  \na monogram or for jeans-sub-brand, where fox is in the right place I think :o)  \nSo I`m ready to be beaten with critics and would be happy to get some  \ntips and ideas. How good is kerning? Color is replaceable.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [File](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104810/http:/typophile.com/files/drupal_56) | 16.11 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Yes Miles, I see now the accent is to0 definitive. It have to be discreet. I modificated accident grotesk extended`s “F” to avoid reading “f…s”, that we get at small sizes and fast looks. :o) After that, the result of ligature must adumbrate the infinity sign, that signified the christine`s vision how clothing have to be. But if that don`t occured, then I go wrong way. Thank you for precise tips.\n\nOne thing you must confess… Are you Miles Newlyn, the owner of [http://newlyn.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104810/http:/newlyn.com/) ? Then you are my logo-god! Your “3” is number one in my logolist and “ish”, “unilever” top 10. Respect. My answer to your logostyle, better to say the try, you can see here: [http://www.kahlkopf.com/deu/vita](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104810/http:/www.kahlkopf.com/deu/vita) .”Kahlkopf” means skinhead in german. So it was near idea to create skined and nacked “K”, but what could stand infinite times without boring.\n\n"
