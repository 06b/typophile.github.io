I just think, for what seems to be a sophisticated film critique magazine, a sharp and crisp face would work better. I might have some further suggestions later, I’ll have to look around a bit.\n\nAs for discretionary ligatures in body text, I wouldn’t advise it. It can affect readability and can be a bit gaudy. The body text needs to be transparent.\n\n"

Geometric Sans are crisp allright.\n\nAs for the body text’s transparency, I would totally agree with Geoff; but, really, it depends on the content and context. How wide would the text column be? Is this magazine going to be read quickly, or be savored like an old Cabernet? How sophisticated is the publication? What kind of movie would it cover? These are the kinds of questions that would need to be addressed before deciding upon the usage of discretionary ligatures.\n\nBut, like Mr. Riding, I’m totally leaning toward the usual choice.\n\n"

I really like the other letters im using on the cover (the cap ’W’, old style ’dropped’ numbers). I think by the writing so far the mag would be read more than a few times, and it mainly covers art films and performance, so I thought discretionary ligatures could be a nice spice. Ill try to post some images of how its looking (the body text that is).\n\ncheers for the comments.\n\n"

Wasn’t sure about Mrs Eaves, I know about the spacing issues, so would be hard to use as a really readable body text, but headings were ok. Captions in Scala sans worked nice with minion ( ahh, neo-humanists), its a pretty standard pairing, but standard for a reason i guess. Mrs Eaves small caps for headings... it just worked for me this time. Used Minion SC for body Subs.\n\nI wasn’t so sure about mixing two serifs. the headings weren’t to close to the body (literally), and it looked nice. I just kept in mind that it can be difficult to mix.\n\nThe back page had an ad for the NZ film commission, and managed to set it with serapion.\n\ncheers for the comments and help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120082629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Cover-002_6256.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120082629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Film_6314.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120082629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Detail-2_3506.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120082629im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Detail_4654.jpg)\n\n"
