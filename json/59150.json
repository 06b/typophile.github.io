  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI've been working on my font [Mint](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220300/http:/www.typophile.com/node/55891) and my company is interested in licensing a beta version of it for the logo, so only a small subset of the glyphs will be used. My company is paying a design agency to create the whole logo including graphics and text. If we ask the agency to use Mint, I have two questions.\n\n1 Am I licensing the font to the agency or to my company? Should I charge?\n\n2 What sort of licence would be best? I haven't written one before so I just want something very quick and easy. I want them to use it **only for this logo** as the font is still being tweaked and is not yet released. I guess I can write any kind of licence I want?\n\nAll advice gratefully welcomed.\n\nThanks :)\n\n",

So I would be inclined to not play hardball with them. Why not provide the logo outlined? That might avoid all the complicated licensing effort.\n\n"

The agency thought that was the best for the job so I'm going with their judgment. I think also it will be more useable since there are four weights that can be used for supporting documents. Mint is not at that stage of readiness yet.\n\nSo now I'm using Bryant for titles and stuff, can anyone recommend a companion body face for it? Currently I'm using Minion which doesn't quite look right. I'll have to have a dig around but if anyone has paired it with a serif before I'd love to hear which.\n\n"
