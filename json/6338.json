  "content": "I saw this lettering on one of the traincars when John Kerry made his whistle stop here in the grand town of Winslow, AZ. I'm afraid i was more fascinated with the lettering than listening to Mr. Kerry speak. Unfortunately, I didn't have a camera on me. I was wondering if any of you would have photo samples of this lettering or have suggestions on how to go about finding such samples. Any help would be appreciated. Thnx.   \n   \np.s. The California Zephyr is an old Amtrak line, the best information i could gather was at a [virtual museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126213920/http:/calzephyr.railfan.net/). they had pics of everything but the lettering. Some great 50s brochures to look at though!   \n   \np.p.s. if anyone knows of a font based on this lettering (or fairly similar) that would be great to know too, thnx.\n\n",
