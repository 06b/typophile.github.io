I set the word ’Inventec’ as the sample text and scanned through the Techno\\>Sci-Fi and \\>Various categories at Dafont and came up with a similar font called [Rezland](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705105905/http:/www.dafont.com/rezland.font?nb_ppp=50&text=Inventec) by Fraser Davidson.\n\nIt’s not exact, but maybe some tweaking can get you close enough.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
