  "content": "I have tried on several occasions to get InD CS2 to save a file as interchage format, .inx, so that it can be edited on a machine running the older CS version of InD. It saved the file just fine but I have never been able to open it (or have any of my clients or subcontractors) in CS. It just crashes no matter how simple the file is. It seems to involve a font issue but I have the issue when the only fonts I use are the Myriad bundled with InD so I don’t get it.  \nHas anyone had success using the .inx format and been able to reliably open it in CS without crashing?\n\nChrisL\n\nPS: do we need the Phinney signal?\n\n [‹ Chinese Fonts & Adobe Software](http://web.archive.org/web/20071101042416/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19200 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Opentype font that isn't part of any language... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071101042416/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19268 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
