  "content": "Good day to all. I'm brand new to this forum and still checking it out. I've had a love of typography for ages and this year decided to get more pro-active about doing typography myself. So, here I am, to see and be seen (as it were).\n\nAnd, since I'm new (in good old fashioned style) the first round is on me. Here's a nifty wallpaper I made called [Mixing Typography Volume One](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020141939/http:/jamesrandom.tumblr.com/post/322699072/mixing-type-volume-1-this-is-a-wallpaper-to). (2560X1600). It was inspired by the Periodic Table of typefaces.\n\nIf you'd like a 1680X1050 version, then go [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020141939/http:/jamesrandom.deviantart.com/art/Mixing-Type-Volume-1-149620962) and download.\n\nHope to have lots of fun with you all!\n\n",
