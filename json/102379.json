The alternate design was called \"Workplace Gothic\", and aimed for more of a grotesque style. A few months ago I dusted it off and started trying to rework it into something fit for the life of day.\n\nLike Workplace Sans (with which it shares most of its basic proportions), Workplace Gothic is intended mainly for user interface text in computer software. It's not hinted beyond TypeTool's autohinting; I expect it'll typically be anti-aliased where used.\n\nSample PDF: [http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/workplace/Type-Gothic.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021559/http:/www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/workplace/Type-Gothic.pdf \"http://www.altsan.org/creative/fonts/workplace/Type-Gothic.pdf\")\n\nAnd some images for the link-shy or lazy:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021559im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wpgoth1_4126.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414021559im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wpgoth2_5153.png)\n\n...no, it's not particularly original, or beautiful. (It was the second font I ever designed, and started before I'd ever done any real study of fonts & design principles, although I've updated it a fair bit now.) But it seems to work OK for its intended purpose, and IMO looks better doing it than its older sibling Workplace Sans.\n\n",
