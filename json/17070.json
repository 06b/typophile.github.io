Very close, but neither exactly match... unless there is a display version.  \nThe lower case \"f\" of the sample is narrower and tapers towards the top more \"gracefully\" than the others. Or is that just the optical foreshortening caused by the curl of the magazine's spine?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121117122902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_lc.png)\nsupplied sample\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121117122902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni_SH.png)\nBodoni SH (Scangraphic)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121117122902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni_SB.png)\nBodoni SB (Scangraphic)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121117122902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bauer_EF.png)\nBauer Bodoni, Elsner & Flake\n\nI even looked at Vignelli's custom Bodoni... and it's not it either.  \nPatty, Stephen... any other suggestions where to look?\n\n"
