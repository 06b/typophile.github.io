      "content": "In Word or InDesign just copy and paste the unicode character using a font which supports it: ̑.\n\nIn LaTeX there are multiple ways to achieve this:\n\n- LaTeX has a series of built-in diacritical commands. Leaving the argument empty produces the diacritical mark. For instance, `\\^{}` renders as ˆ. Here is a [list of such commands](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804223108/http:/en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Special_Characters#Escaped_codes).\n\nIf you use a XeTeX (putting `\\usepackage{fontspec}` in your preamble):\n\n- Type the character directly.\n- Type the unicode (hexadecimal) codepoint into the `symbol` command, with a preceding double apostrophe `''`. To produce an inverted breve you would type `\\symbol{''0311}`.\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, I don't know if there is an inverted breve (might also be called \"roundcap\") in Unicode that isn't ALSO a combining diacritic.\n\nAs has been suggested, easy enough to get one to print -- just use the combining diacritic over, say, a thin space between word spaces, but odd things happen to space characters in some applications, such as EPUB.\n\nIf the mark can be longer, as with a scansion mark, you could use one of those over a word space.\n\nNot sure why you need it, but things can be found in odd places in Unicode -- like the glottal stops for Guatemalan Mayan in a section generally devoted to Chinese...\n\nIt could be that if you described the need, one of the people more familiar with the Cyrillic alphabets could help. I forget which, but either Brill or Gentium is pretty good with extended Cyrillic characters.\n\nOtherwise, while most of us are never in favor of using Unicode characters for a purpose outside their intent -- like a combining diacritic for a spacing modifier -- in this case, you have have no choice.\n\n"

Here is an example:\n\n    \\documentclass{article}\n    \\usepackage{polyglossia}\n    \\setdefaultlanguage{serbian}\n    \\setmainfont[Script=Cyrillic,Language=Serbian]{Cambria}\n    \\setlength{\\fontdimen2\\font}{2\\fontdimen2\\font}\n    \\begin{document}\n    \n    на првоме слогу и са \\phantom{a}\\symbol{\"0311}\\, на другоме.\n    \n    \\end{document}\n\nand here is the output:  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804223108im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ndiacr_3506.png)  \nThe `\\setlength` command doubles the interword spacing, so as to look more like your picture; a phantom \"a\" is used for the combining diacritic and the command `\\,` puts a thin space after because otherwise, it looked ill centered.\n\n"
