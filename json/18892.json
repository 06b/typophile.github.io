I don’t see why a record company called “apple corps” is threatened by “apple computer” even though apple now has itunes, they are merely selling music, not producing it themselves, and really there isn’t any competition between the two companies (that I can see). The lawsuit is really about the use of the word “apple” which seems generic enough that no one company can “own” it. It will be interesting to see how this turns out.\n\n"

So, apple corps wants to stop apple computer from selling music, but apple corps would receive royalties from every song sold, just as they would from any other retailer. The dispute is over the word “apple” which is ridiculous to me. Nobody could have forseen the internet becoming the source of music distribution that it has become back in the 70’s. WIth 3 million songs being sold daily that is a great channel for bands and artists to sell their music, and make an income.\n\n"

Apple Computer is not cutting into their slice of the pie or taking their customers or giving the impression that they represent the Beatles estate. It makes me wonder if this is a PR move to keep the old record label name alive. Today’s young record buying clientele may not even know about Apple Records without the law suit pushing it into the news.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

But then the Beatles were ripped off by their own business partners back in the day. Now, so many years later Apple Computer is in the music business. There isn’t a lot of logic in it, but a contract is a contract. If they want to change it they should re-negotiate it.\n\n"

I imagine your products wouldn’t be so prohibitively expensive if you didn’t slip up and get slammed every few years by Apple Records, a company whose business used to be producing Beatles albums, but is now chiefly in the business of leeching your profits with litigation every time you do something even remotely related to music. I think it’s unfair.\n\nSo I have a perfect solution for you. _Change the name of your company_ and then you’ll be able to do whatever you want. To some, this would seem like a rash thing to have to do when one has been in business for a long time… but I don’t think that’s a problem in this case. Just going out on a limb here, but try this on for size: Macintosh Computers. Not only is it a trademark you already own, but it’s a brand that’s been on _practically every one of your products for the past twenty years._ I think the transition would be pretty smooth, don’t you?\n\n"
