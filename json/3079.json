  "content": "I'm designing my portfolio site for English and Japanese users. I've been studying japanese for about 6 months and it's just occurred to me I've only a handful of Japanese kanji fonts and no idea even of how many exist.   \n   \nFor anyone familiar with the language they'll know there are three alphabets, kanji is the one with thousands of characters, does anyone know how extensive the range of kanji fontsets is? We're used to choosing between thousands of fonts in the west but do graphic designers in Japan just have a handful of kanji fonts to choose between?   \n   \nAnyone know any good font resources, retaliers where I can browse a good range and get an idea of what's available?   \n   \nThanks - Edwin.\n\n",
