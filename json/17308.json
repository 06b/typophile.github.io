The business was very unsuccessful and a year later was sold to Warren and A.E. Barnhart, newpaper publishers from Iowa. The Barnhart Brothers first got into the type business when they accepted type as payment for a debt and sold it. The Barnharts made Mr. Spindler, the foundry foreman, a partner and formed [Barnhart Brothers & Spindler](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204231034/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Barnhart%20Brothers%20and%20Spindler) foundry.\n\n",
