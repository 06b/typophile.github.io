Not so specifically type design, but typographic design and a few with no formal design background at all. There seems to be a big emphasis on content and giving appropriate form to the content – whether it be self generated or given\n\nAt the moment my year are working on a 'reader' project which will eventuate in a book on the subject of biography\n\nAlso the WT is open to commision work, and every so often something comes in. For example a student here has just completed a series of stamps for the TPG Post. As for the review process, it is quite informal here, but we have an evaluation in december – so then I can tell you more!\n\nHope this helps,  \nDavid\n\n"
