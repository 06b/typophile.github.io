  "content": "First off, I would like to thanks all of you who have participated in my previous post for Centinella logo. This is the following up post. The world \"Centinela\" means \"guard\", client like a shield or perhaps a symbol to protrait trust, confident. So I stick with 2 of my old design (I know some of you did not like them) and made a new one out of a trojan head. I have one more version that I'm working on and I will post on here as soon as I finish. So here it is agian. Thanks you guys.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020195236im_/http:/typophile.com/files/centinela_2_6476.jpg)\n\n",

I think it could be enlarged in relation to the text, perhaps somewhere (size-wise) between the top one and where it is now. Also, not a huge fan of the shiny button look. What would it look like without that effect on it?\n\npenn\n\n"

      "content": "yes. lose the gloss/chrome looks - they're not adding anything.\n\nThe centurian is a nice direction but I don't think it's working quite as well as it could. Its placement in the box/diamond isn't great. The first one seems to have a slight rotation upward which in my impression doesn't create the authoritarian pose it 'should' ... i.e, not much confidence. The diamond version doesn't work at all in my opinion, but the idea is nice.\n\nI don't mind the first one, but it didn't work in one colour from memory. Also ... if it's a shield, does the idea of the shield having been pierced by a sharp object create any unwanted stories?\n\nForget the second one.\n\n----------  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Logo Design Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020195236/http:/www.solid-creative.com/identity.htm)\n\n"

      "content": "I don't like the shield version because it's too wide compared to its height. Shields were normally differently dimensioned.\n\nSome sure things:  \n1. Don't pursue any more in the #1 and #2  \n2. Use the simple helmet as in the rest of logos.\n\nThe only concern I have is that this symbol has been used many times. It depends how wide is this trademark going to be seen.\n\nMy gut tells me to go with #3 with minor changes: Top of the symbol continues the light square. I'd make it rounded as the symbol goes. It looks very nice and strong. Type goes well with it and it will be capable of small size applications. But I don't know how are you going to make a BW version of it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
