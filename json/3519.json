  "content": "I suppose I qualify as a type hobbyist since I'm not self-employed. I purchase for personal use and tinkering mostly, with the occasional freelance gig. Because I don't have big budgets to throw around, I look for inexpensive fonts to satisfy my cravings. For example, two of my favorites are shown below: Monteverdi and Montrachet from Fountain (by Lars Bergquist) and Antique Modern from the Storm Type Foundry.   \n   \n ![Type sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526221842im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/28246.gif)   \n   \nTo me, finding these fonts was like discovering a treasure in a flea market -- and Mr. Bergquist and Mr. Storm are no amateurs, so I feel these are beautifully crafted products.   \n   \nI guess my point is there are great fonts for $100 and there are great fonts for $1,000 (and up!). I'd like to hear more background on the smaller foundries and lone practitioners of type design who produce these treasures -- or just see what kinds of discussions this prompts.   \n   \nThanks,   \nAddison\n\n",

      "content": "I think the pair makes a very nice set. And while the Dutch Type Library is a \"legendary\" provider or historical text fonts, Mr. Bergquist's contributions are great for people like me who can only drool over DTL Fleischmann. I read comments on Storm's work fairly frequently (which I agree is amazing), but I hear few or no comments on designers like Mr. Bergquist and Mario Feliciano, or the digitizations of Goudy's fonts by Gerald Giampa. Does a lower price make a font any less well-crafted?   \n   \nFor instance, Goudy and Van Krimpen are both historic figures in type design. DTL Haarlemmer, a Van Krimpen revival, is $1,620. Lanston's revival of Goudy's Kennerley type is $185. Robert Bringhurst called Lanston Kennerley an \"excellent digital version.\" Any thoughts? (I am most certainly not bashing DTL -- their work is beautiful and probably worth every penny.)   \n   \nI apologize if I didn't label this thread clearly. I feel like I'm veering off...\n\n"

The firm I work for purchases their own type, so any type I purchase I use to make things for myself. (If you were just joking with me, sorry I missed it... I'm still not quite awake.)   \n   \nBTW, Peter Bruhn of Fountain seems to be a really nice guy. His emails -- and posts on this site -- are very polite and friendly (Fountain is the friendly foundry).   \n   \nMr. Storm and I have also corresponded via email and he is just as kind. I had an historical typeface website for a while where I linked to a few of his types. He contacted me out of the blue -- it was very cool!\n\n"
