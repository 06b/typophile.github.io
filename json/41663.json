Second it make you look like an also-ran not a proper company. 3rd it would kill any self respect.\n\nI like the 3rd one best. But I would keep batting ideas around. You might want to open up the space between those letters - that compressed look is a bit dated in my opinion. I would take aleaf out of apple’s book and make thing look simpler. Why not get a techy sans from FontFont?\n\n"
