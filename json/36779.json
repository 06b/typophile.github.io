Your best bet is to look for one that seems similar in feeling to you and use that instead. One place to see a wide selection (which tells you where they came from) is the [Script Font ID Guide, Part 11](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202204027/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html), and another place would be the free handwriting fonts at [www.dafont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202204027/http:/www.dafont.com/ \"www.dafont.com\").\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
