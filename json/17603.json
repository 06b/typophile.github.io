  "content": "I have been approached to layout a book in French and I was wondering if there is anything special I should think about before I accept or decline the project. My wife speaks french and was the editor of the english version of the book in question. She will be helping me if I accept the project. What should I know about layout in French that differs from what I know about laying out a book in English?\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ epsilon figure?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033258/http:/typophile.com/node/17620 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rights & Ownership of Logos and Corporate Identities ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033258/http:/typophile.com/node/17607 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

[Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422033258/http:/french.about.com/library/writing/bl-punctuation.htm) is a summary, but you would probably want a French stylebook, including rules for the order of matter in a French book.\n\n"

Perhaps there are French hyphenation dictionaries or plug-ins for the program you will be using to lay out the text.\n\nAlso, if I am not mistaken, the text on the spine of French books traditionally runs from the bottom up rather than from the top down.\n\n"

Also, I find a lot of french publishers don’t indent paragraphs, but I think that’s weird. I have also learned that European book design to a large extent is far plainer and less decorative than American. I have no idea why this is or why it should be.\n\n"

Just to clarify, I didn’t mean that I wasn’t concerned with the content at all, like Ricardo pointed out, my wife will be reviewing the book for its content. I was concerned about whether or not I should accept the job of laying out the book in french, not how to proofread it.\n\n"
