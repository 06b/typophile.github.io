I have a friend and client who is a pro blogger. She does blogs for TV and Film companies. I prefer photos, they say more than words. So I tried a bit of bloggin just to keep a central location for many links I like to visit.\n\nIf I need to say something I can say it here.\n\nI finally have a place to show the first Comedy based on Comic Sans that was filmed for Channel 4's show This is a Knife back in April.\n\n",
