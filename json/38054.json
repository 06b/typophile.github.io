      "content": "I'm a Giza fan, too. Nick Shinn's [Figgins](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/shinntype.com/) is based on the sans-serif font that Figgins (on whose Egyptian David Berlow based Giza) brought out, so that could be sympathetic or even be used instead of Giza. It's not out yet, but I believe it will be soon -- e-mail Nick if you're interested.\n\nIn the same vein as Figgins, I think a slightly idiosyncratic and 19th-century-feeling sans or serif might work nicely. [DynaGrotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-55-dynagrotesk), [Maple](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/maple/index.html), [National Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/www.klim.co.nz/national_samples.php) (soon-to-be-released), and [Parry and Parry Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/ourtype.be/) could be some really nice possibilities. And [FF Bau](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/christianschwartz.com/bau.shtml) would be a 20th-century-style alternative.\n\n"

      "content": "Great recommendations, Reed. All of those would play very well with Giza.\n\nSince you're using a 19th-century face for the logo you might want to consider using something more modern to reflect the product. Perhaps a grotesque sans (like FF Bau) would be best. Or maybe [Maquette](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/maquette/), [Region](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/region/), or [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_ot/). Perhaps a modern gothic like [Scopex](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021145229/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/primetype/ptl_skopex_gothic_complete_ot/).\n\n"
