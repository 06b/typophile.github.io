But Kepler is very flexible, so you can fine tune quite well to your needs.\n\nIt turned out quite beautiful in print, I would do this again.\n\n"

So Caledonia, Dante, Electra and Fairfield would be suitable pairings.  \nOf these, probably the \"Scotch\" Caledonia is best, as both it and Trade Gothic are revivals of 19th century genres.  \nSpeaking of [Scotch](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417163547/http:/www.shinntype.com/scotch.html)...\n\n"

Both are wider and slightly lower-slung than other Garamonds, like Adobe, which is why they would work better for you. Clean, not funky, almost transparent in effect--that's what you want, because that's Trade Gothic's personality.\n\n"
