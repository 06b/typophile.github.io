  "content": "I'm a beginner typographer with two fonts released about a year ago, which I created in HighLogic Font Creator. Recently a user who downloaded one of my fonts emailed me saying that the top and bottom of the font are being cut off when she uses it in a program. It's just an issue with line spacing, which I know how to adjust quickly in Font Creator using the Metrics options. However since making the fonts I've switched to a Mac which doesn't support Font Creator, and I've been using FontLab. I can't seem to make any sense of the metrics options in it.  \nIs there an easy way to adjust line height in FontLab?\n\nThank you!\n\n",
