  "content": "Hello, I came accross this forum while trying to track down a site that offers the MetaPlus font. I've searched on all the big font sites (Fonts.com, MyFonts.com, Adobe Type Library, etc) but no one seems to offer this font for sale or otherwise. Is there something I'm missing?   \n   \nI really need it as a project I've been handed was started using the MetaPlus font. Alternatly, what would be a comparable font that I could substitute with?   \n   \nThanks!   \nChris\n\n",

      "content": "Jennifer --   \n   \nAs Yves explained (quite thoroughly and admirably), Meta 1, 2, 3, and MetaPlus are all essentially the same typeface family. But MetaPlus was an earlier release. If you are trying to work with a legacy document which uses MetaPlus, then you should contact one of the FontShops directly to get a copy of the old version, as the recent versions have some subtle differences.   \n   \nI had to help a client in this situation once. After getting them a license for Meta 1 and 2, I spoke with a representative at FontShop who gladly provided a legacy copy of MetaPlus at no additional cost, in order to work with documents that an outside firm had designed using MetaPlus.   \n   \nIf you are not working with a previous document and don't need to worry about changes in metrics, then Meta 1 and 2 are the current versions which match (and exceed) the range of MetaPlus.\n\n"

      "content": "_\\> Actually, many of Erik's fonts look quite similar,   \nOfficina, Info, Meta, Unit -- while all distinctively   \ndifferent, they all share certain similarities._      \n   \nSome further theorizing and reactions from Erik himself   \nat [Typographi.ca](http://web.archive.org/web/20150407020447/http:/typographi.ca/000622.php#000622).   \n   \nOriginally, back in 1991 when the very first batch of   \nFontFonts was released, there was **FF Meta 1** (Normal,   \nBold, Small Caps). Hanging figures and additional   \nff-ligatures were already present in the Normal and   \nBold weights, with lining figures in the Small Caps.   \n   \nThe first expansion came in 1992 with **FF Meta 2**  \n{Italic, Italic Small Caps, Bold Small Caps}.   \n   \n**FF MetaPlus** , released in 1993, was the big leap   \nforward which tripled the number of fonts to 18, and   \nincluded a fine-tuning of some characters (most notably   \nthe correction of the crossbar on the lc 't'). The family   \nat that point featured Normal, Book, Medium, Bold and   \nBlack weights, all in Roman, Italic, Small Caps and   \nItalic Small Caps (except for the Black weight which   \ndidn't include Small Caps). Still hanging figures in   \nthe 'normal' weights and lining figures in the Small Caps.   \n   \nEventually, in 1998 it was back to **FF Meta** , which   \nsaw a reorganization of the family into subfamilies:   \nFF MetaNormal, FF MetaBook, FF MetaMedium,   \nFF MetaBold and FF MetaBlack, all in Roman, Italic,   \nSmall Caps and Italic Small Caps, which all got   \ncoupled with their respective Expert and Lining Figures   \nweights: yep, 60 fonts indeed. Biggest change this   \ntime was the addition of the Black Small Caps, and   \nmoving the extra ligatures (ff, ffi, ffl which were   \npreviously in the regular fonts) to the new Expert fonts.   \nAnd of course the Lining figures weights which means   \nyou don't have to switch weights anymore to get the   \ndesired type of numerals.   \n   \nSo, to conclude: don't mix the original six weight   \nFF Meta with FF MetaPlus nor the new FF Meta family   \n(different spacing, some redesigned characters), and   \nwhen substituting FF Meta for FF MetaPlus be careful   \nwith disappearing ff-ligatures and different types of   \nnumerals.   \n   \nThis concludes the lecture for today (whew). ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150407020447im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
