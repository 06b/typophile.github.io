I disown that cover.   \n   \nnote that last sentence -- nobody likes the damn thing. however, judging by the interviewees, it should be a useful contribution to any typographer's library. \n"

I feel for David on the cover issue - I've been in his helpless shoes in that regard. But the guts of the book sound promising, and should prove well worth ignoring the less-than-lovely exterior.\n\n"

      "content": "Honest appraisal from the author:   \n   \nThe introduction is self-absorbed and self-indulgent. Sorry. The cover is horrible, and I told my editor that countless times. Its ugliness is compounded by the fact that, amazingly, the repro house screwed up the alignment of some of the glyphs moments before going to print. If you buy the book, burn the dust jacket and send me a photo of the flames. Please.   \n   \nThe main bulk of the book comprises of the interviews, however. There are some good chapters and some bad chapters, as you might expect from a first-time and inexperienced author, and from the range of those interviewed. Matthew Carter had some great things to say, based on a long and immensely enjoyable phone conversation with him, for example, and Jonathan Hoefler had some very valuable things indeed to share on the subject.   \n   \nThe interviews are accompanied by examples of the designers work, both straight typeface design and graphic design, and where possible there are early developmental examples to illustrate a typeface's progression. Jeremy Tankard's and Erik Spiekermann's early development work, both for typeface and typographic design, spring to mind as particularly strong examples.   \n   \nOne thing that pleased me was the diversity of approaches from all the designers, mainly due to their different age ranges and cultural backgrounds, and I think this has been reflected in the book. Its non-prescriptive as a result.   \n   \nAnyhow. Its ok. I'm not Robert Bringhurst.   \n   \nOne final point - the book is primarily aimed at students and designers in the early part of their careers, and the text will naturally reflect this. The tutorial bit, for example, is aimed at those VERY early on in their type design career, so dont beat me too hard on that one.   \n   \nThat said, there is plenty in the body of the book to be of interest to those further along in their hopefully lifelong studies.\n\n"
