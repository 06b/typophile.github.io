To make the spacing consistent, you would have to overlap to make them actually connect like a script, and I don't think that's your intention.\n\n"

The \"h\" looks like it could also use this treatment. the name of the font looks fantastic in the font I must say.   \n   \nI noticed that the \"h\" is not listed in your character set display. Have you completed all LC? Any ideas on what your UC is going to look like?\n\n"
