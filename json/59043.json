      "content": "I had spent some time looking for this one, because the LITTLE DARLIN lettering looked so familiar, but the best I could come up with in digital form was House’s Bullet, Red Rooster’s Radiant and Image Club’s Serpentine Sans. None was a complete match. I also looked at some of the Photo-Lettering Catalogs from the 60’s and 70’s and found some candidates with names like Rhein Rapport, Manifesto, and Pacella Pace Biform. The last one looks quite similar and even included the same style N. All of them were stressed (uneven) sans styles. I’m afraid many of the typefaces of the 60’s stayed there, and never made it into digital form.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
