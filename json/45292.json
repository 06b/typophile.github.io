Yes it needs a little bit fine tuning... but you're on a good way!  \nIt would also be nice other experiments... perhaps some way to communicate sound trough words in different typefaces and weights.\n\n"

While I was doing this I found out that if I increase proportionally the size of each part I would have had in most cases a seamless bolder weight. I'm going to publish this variant as well asap!\n\n"
