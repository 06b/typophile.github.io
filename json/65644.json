It's close to Varsity, but small differences (long middle and exaggerated serifs on E, lowered R centerline, right-angle serifs on S characters) make me think it's either custom, or another lesser-known font. Any ideas?\n\nSorry for the small sample, but these five letters are all I've got!\n\n(note: This is not the same font used on their vintage jerseys, **[shown here](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202082537/http:/www.fansedge.com/Images/Product/51-29/51-29902-F.jpg)**. It's a new style for this year, a modernized vintage, if you will.)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202082537im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sixerslou_3566.jpg)\n\n",
