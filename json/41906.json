I was scouting around this afternoon when I came across a graveyard from 1800, on which the carved lettering looked really really out of date - I mean, much more modern.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\ndr\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tomb.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023140454/http:/typophile.com/files/tomb.jpg) | 152.84 KB |\n\n",

It's a truely both creepy and fascinating frankenstein architecture. Here are some pics of the thing, the letterforms are sometimes amazing, especially when put altogether like this, side by side.\n\ndr\n\n"

But no quite like that. Of course around here, 1800's is old. I'll post some images in a day or so.\n\nThe sans is quite interesting. I often wonder how much type or lettering styles are influenced by the medium (stone carving is, after all, different from calligraphy with a broad nibbed pen.. ) or contemporaneous fashions and styles. And, I'm guessing in the case of a European cemetery in Turkey, the cultural background, training and influences of the stone carver has something to do with it.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

About the letterings, it's very interesting for me to see some letters which remind me a lot of Bodoni's style on graveyards that were carved very far away from italy, and of course this very modern sans...\n\ndr\n\n"
