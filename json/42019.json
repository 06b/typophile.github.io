I think I can answer Sharon and logosam simultaneously.\n\nThe reason I’m not going to use either suggestions (though they are both really good ones), is because I like the fact that the seemingly abstract symbol for the love garden is in truth the o,v,g, and a of the name. Typically we’d expect “LG” to be the wordmark, but instead it uses other letters in the name to create a symbol that to me feels both “mod” and arcane/alchemical/psychedelic—which is the “big idea.”\n\nhere’s the tilt:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080917172032im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/tilt_4239.jpg)\n\nHere’s the symbol by itself:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080917172032im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/symbol_4856.jpg)\n\nand here’s an example of it in use:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080917172032im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/tshirt_6218.jpg)\n\nI just REALLY dig that.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nAwesome\\>\\> [www.biklopsdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080917172032/http:/www.biklopsdesign.com/ \"www.biklopsdesign.com\")\n\n"

The ’g’ alone might be an issue but in the context of the word as a whole, it seems to read just fine.\n\nAs a poster, I think the elements work great together. As a logo, I think the wordmark stands best on it’s own without the duplicated enlarged circle and triangle elements.\n\n"
