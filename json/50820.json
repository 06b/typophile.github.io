I doubt if this occurs more in Mendoza’s bolder weight than in the MAN RAY sample above.\n\nLook at the very top of the capital A in Mendoza, which has a distictive cut out, which is missing in the bland MAN RAY sample.\n\nThese are two strong supporting proofs that the MAN RAY sample is not set in Mendoza.\n\nBut thank you for turning me onto Mendoza, which has some nice design attributes.\n\n"
