However, Photoshop doesn't have those fonts in the font list even when other programs like MSWord does. Other recently installed Chinese fonts do work like ones from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415210805/http:/www.sinosplice.com/chinese/fonts/). Is there a way to fix this? :\\\n\nI have Windows XP with Window's own language input thing and PS6.\n\n",

I'd say the fonts in the second link are of better technical quality.\n\nYou could try to \"fix\" the fonts by starting to change their names with a font editor, like [FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415210805/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontLab), for example. However, there might be additional problems with these fonts, as the Unicode values and glyph names seemed to be all over the place.\n\n(Disclamer: I know nothing about Chinese fonts)\n\n"
