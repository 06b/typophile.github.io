Brian Eno - Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy  \n2. Bauhaus - Gotham  \n3. Daft Punk - Alive 2007  \n4. T Rex - Electric Warrior  \n5. Royksopp - Melody AM  \n6. Wire - Pink Flag  \n7. The Orb - Orbus Terrarum  \n8. Can - Soon over Babaluma  \n9. Japan - Assemblage  \n10. Sex Pistols - Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\n\n\\* Feel free to substitute Downloaded music, 8 tracks, singles, CDs or wax cylinders as you think appropriate.\n\nAlso, I would have phrased this differently except that the whole idea is so tied to the notion of the \"album\" in the first place that it would have seemed silly to me to phrase it any other way.\n\n",
