I went back a looked at an original logo versus the eps that was sent to me and lo and behold, Walbaum. It's been squished a little and it has fake small caps, but it's not as bad as that mess.\n\n"

It's   \nfull of inconsistencies.   \n   \nNote the hairline stems of the 'N' and 'W', they   \nappear to be way too thin in comparison with the   \n'M'. Both the spine of the 'S' and the tail of the   \n'R' look cramped. The serifs on the 'C' are much   \nthinner than on the 'S'. The lower left-hand serif   \nof the 'R' is too heavy, and the bracketing of the   \nserifs is all over the place: from fairly rounded   \non the 'N' to almost straight on the 'M'. And the   \naforementionned lower left-hand serif of the 'R'   \neven seems to jump upwards at the edges.   \n   \nCould this be... \\*gasp\\*... Mary Shelley's typeface   \nof Frankenstein? Arghh... the horror!\n\n"
