Just instant associations and whether it's memorable and easy to recall if needed. I'm really curious how it looks to other people :-)\n\nThe image is [\\_\\_here\\_\\_](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804203604/http:/swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/bvckup.png).\n\nThanks\n\n",

It sounds that it needs tweaking though so that it would've not been _that_ evident.\n\nEleanor, it is indeed not centered nor is it kerned for that matter. The whole thing is a rough sketch. Good point re: the 'f' in the tag line evoking the association, never thought about it from this angle.\n\n"

We've all heard of \"Phucket\", right?\n\nIn your new example, the upside down 'A' feels like an arrow pointing down...which confused me momentarily because it insinuated \"back down\". I like the first insinuation better. :)\n\nBTW - Those two examples look identical to me. Am I missing something?\n\n"

Let me try this again:\n\n- [numero uno](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804203604/http:/swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/bvckup-2.png)\n- [numero due](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804203604/http:/swapped.cc/stuff/tmp/bvckup-3.png)\n\nI think the second option is not bad, because V looks like an inverted A _and_ the upper curve implies the U. Though good point it looking like a down arrow..\n\nBy the way turning A into an _up_ arrow would match the \"backup\" word very well. I don't think anyone has done this before. Too bad the word itself is too generic and not really an option for a product name.\n\n"
