  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm designing a web site for a major company and was looking into using [Burbank](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405164942/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=565&subpage=viewfontspecimens) from House Industries. However, it appears (I'm still waiting clarification) that it will cost us $7500 to embed into our Flash experience. I should also mention that this site needs to be translatable into 18 or so different languages, so a robust character set is needed.\n\nThe client feels that this price is too steep, and I'm wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of a similar typeface that would have a similar feel.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
