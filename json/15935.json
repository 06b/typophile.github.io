Jonathan Hoefler pointed out in an interview that regular caps are designed primarily to go with the lower case, whereas titling caps are designed for an all-caps setting. This is the essential difference. For example, Hermann Zapf did two versions of Titling Caps for Palatino, one thinner than the roman and one thicker—Michaelangelo and Sistina, now with different names in Palatino Nova. In both cases I believe that they have a greater variation in width from the regular roman caps. This is a tendency in Titling Caps, following the Roman letters on the Trajan column in Rome. Also titling caps will generally be spaced looser because of the intended all caps setting, I believe.\n\n"

Contrast can increase at large sizes and there is less need for trapping. You can also have a true hairline sans because it won’t be used small.

Thus, in a 60 point titling font, the caps would be nearly 60 points tall (minus overshoot space and other design considerations). Also, the J and Q would be designed not to extend below the baseline since there was no metal down there. Etc.\n\nTitling caps in modern fonts are not really the same thing. I know of none that are designed to fill the em square in the way that traditional titling caps did.\n\n"

One reason (probably the main reason) was for large inset initial caps on paragraphs. Since there was no extra space for descenders below the cap, you got a nice snug fit.\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind (and this relates to Thomas’ comment about optical size), titling caps were made only in display sizes, not text sizes.\n\n"

      "content": "The design conventions for smallcaps are pretty clear, because of the height and weight relationship to the lowercase and regular caps.\n\nI disagree with Thomas that ’titling caps’ implies a large optical size of the regular caps, although that is certainly one common kind of titling caps. I think there is a lot of stylistic leeway in the design of titling caps, and they may be lighter or darker and may be significantly different in proportion and detail from the regular caps. Eric Gill’s Golden Cockerel type — shown here as drawn for digital type by Dave Farey — is an interesting example of a design in which the treatment of some letters varies between the regular and titling caps (note the C and Q):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012075751im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Cockerel.gif)\n\nWilliam made reference to Jonathan Hoefler’s comments on the subject, and I think one of the most important points Jonathan made is that in titling caps there can and perhaps should be more variation in the width of the letters (hence, for example, the famously narrow E and F in the Trajan letters).\n\nAlso note that the relative height on the body has varied in some classic titling sets, such as Mardersteig’s brilliant Dante:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012075751im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dante.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "\\> the relative height on the body has varied\n\nIn metal, titling caps almost always fill the entire EM height. This is for reasons of efficiency as well as the lack of negative leading: if you wanted tight multiple lines of all-caps the lc descender area would get in the way! In digital, because of the ease of sizing and negative leading, and because there can always be an advantage to lining up baselines (between a titling font and normal one) I think it’s better to avoid the old metal standard.\n\n\\> the J and Q would be designed not to extend below  \n\\> the baseline since there was no metal down there.\n\nSometimes they kerned though.\n\n\\> in titling caps there can and perhaps should  \n\\> be more variation in the width of the letters\n\nThis can be considered an optical compensation though. When Thomas focuses on optical compensation, I think he’s about 90% there actually - at least in relation to a text cut - the further elaborations can be said to explain the differences between titling and display cuts.\n\nAs for the nature of titling caps, I’d just  \nadd one thing: you need a lot more...

      "content": "Let me re-phrase that slightly. The difference in optical compensation is the required element of titling capitals compared to a text face. An optional element is to have design differences, which may be minor or major.\n\nIf it is a really different design, I think of it as more of a companion titling face rather than the titling version of the same face. For example, Michelangelo is being renamed and re-released as “Palatino Titling.” I can understand the marketing reasons for it, and it also clarifies the use of the typeface, which are both good things - but from a design perspective I am not sure that I agree with the naming, because it’s just a little too dissimilar to Palatino.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
