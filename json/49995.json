  "content": "Hello,\n\nJust wondering if somebody could suggest a quite modern cut on VAG Rounded, we currently have VAG, Cocon and Co Headline but would like something quite similar to Dalton Maags creation for Telewest ( [http://www.daltonmaag.com/about/commissioning/case\\_studies/telewest.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041909/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/about/commissioning/case_studies/telewest.html \"http://www.daltonmaag.com/about/commissioning/case\\_studies/telewest.html\") )\n\nAny help would be more than appreciated.\n\nCheers,  \n1981\n\n",
