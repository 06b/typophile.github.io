This includes the chars on the second line.\n\nI got the glyps to overlap horizontally by setting the width to 0 in the HMTX table.\n\nIs there a way to set zero height as well? I read about the VMTX table but it looks like its only used for vertical fonts. Can you set zero height a different way? An line height of 0 for the entire font, instead of setting it for each character, would work as well.\n\nAnd my zero width chars only appear when I prepend with a normal width character. Say I have A, B and C of 0 width, then\n\nABC\n\nwill be invisible, and\n\nXABC\n\nwill show an X and then the A, B and C overlapping eachtoher. Is there any way to get zero width chars to show without prepending them with a normal width char?\n\n",

But Firefox on Windows 7 indeed shows the overlapped ABC without any extra chars. Good to learn about this difference.\n\nI've converted my TTF to a TTX XML file. How can I start playing with the line height? I don't see any values that seem to represent it.\n\n"

      "content": "Just in case anyone else ever wants to do this and finds this thread:\n\nI got chars to overlap properly by giving the first char (A) a width of 512 and a left side bearing of 0. All the following chars (B and C) have a width of 0, and a lsb of -512. I can do this because I know I'll always start with the A — I don't know how you can do this reliably cross-browser if the order is unknown.\n\nI'm still looking into the line-height thing, but it seems that both Apple and Microsoft have different approaches to calculate this from the font's properties. A font's height could be based on the bounding box measurements, the ascender/descender values, or other values in the OS2 table. My conclusion is that if you want to tweak the (line-) height of a font, do it in CSS.\n\n"
