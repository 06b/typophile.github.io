I've currently got it set in a modified (the B) but am struggling to find a sans face that pairs well and has enough weights to complete the company name and a lighter descriptor underneath. I've looked at quite a few faces—FF Clan, FF Marselis and Proxima Nova to name a few—but just am not yet satisfied with the results.\n\nThere is a great article written by the designer regarding its creation. I don't have an extensive knowledge of what pairs really well together so I am looking for suggestions. Any would be appreciated.\n\n[http://ilovetypography.com/2011/10/05/the-making-of-ff-tundra/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720184339/http:/ilovetypography.com/2011/10/05/the-making-of-ff-tundra/ \"http://ilovetypography.com/2011/10/05/the-making-of-ff-tundra/\")\n\nThanks.\n\n",
