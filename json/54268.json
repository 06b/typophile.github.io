The duplex model has more RAM (faster) and comes rather cheaply, but with a smaller toner cart, so the first cart (comes in the box) runs out fast (it's smaller than the normal ones), but then you can replace with to the regular size cart.\n\n"

Is there any decisive importance/advantage to having \"real\" PS support? I'm in the market for a printer too, and it seems that everything that's halfway in my price range only does PS \"emulation\". I wonder how badly that matters.\n\n"

It's probably improved.\n\nI love my Ricoh too FWIW. I have the Aficio AP610N - it does up to tabloid size which I need but you may not.\n\n"

The Swiss Ricoh website lists \"PostScript® 3 emulation\" in the [specs](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821061117/http:/www.ricoh.ch/products/printers/smalloffice/sp3300dn.xhtml) of the printer James mentioned – whatever that means … the whole PS business seems quite convoluted.\n\nFWIW, I use a HP printer currently, and Dan Reynolds told me over on the German Forum not to use any hinting during the design process because the HP emulation tends to misinterpret hints & ends up ignoring overshoots. :-|  \nConcerns like that would certainly be nice to avoid.\n\n"
