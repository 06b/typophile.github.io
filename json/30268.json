Shortly afterward his financier foreclosed, sold the bibles, and became the first commercially successful printer.  \n **[1458](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1458)** [Nicholas Jenson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Nicholas%20Jenson) went to Mainz, [Germany](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Germany) to study type-casting.  \n [1460s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1460s)  \n **[1462](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1462)** Rebellion in the city of Mainz causes many of the typefounders their to flee (or be expelled). Gutenberg moves downriver to Eltville. [Conrad Sweynheym](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Conrad%20Sweynheym), [Arnold Pannartz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Arnold%20Pannartz), and Nicholas Jenson move to Italy.  \n **[1465](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1465)** [Conrad Sweynheym](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Conrad%20Sweynheym) and [Arnold Pannartz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Arnold%20Pannartz) are hired by a monastery in Subiaco, Italy. Seeking to find a more Italian alphabet for their new employers (as opposed to the Teutonic blackletter type of their homeland), the two sought to research classical Roman literature. However they unknowingly were reading ninth-century transcriptions in Carolingian Minuscule and falsely assumed that this was actually an Ancient Roman invention, just like \"capital\" monumental letters. The two combined the two alphabet forms in text—upper and lowercase—just like we do today (actually, we only do it because they started it…). The first italian \"Roman\" typefaces (like Nicholas Jenson's later work in Venice), borrowed this two-case innovation from the scribes.  \n **[1469](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1469)** [Johannes da Spira](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Johannes%20da%20Spira) established the first press in [Venice](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Venice).  \n [1470s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1470s)  \n **[1470](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1470)** Johannes da Spira died and Nicholas Jenson took over the press.  \n [1480s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1480s)  \n [1490s](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023174230/http:/typophile.com/wiki/1490s)\n\n",
