      "content": "To me it doesn’t really develop the dynamic side of the name, the splines/grooves should expand from the same centre point and possibly enlarge, while the weight of the stroke increases as they explode, so you get a v-shaped wedge. I would also move the centre of the radii to the vertical centre of the x-height. The legs of the k and the a, e and i look a bit too rounded rather than using a similar terminal style that is used on the others, and as Jan said the m is too narrow. Have you tried a vertical style?  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "It’s funny, my first reading of the name was as a play on ’dynamic’.\n\nI agree about the ’m’ feeling cramped. Also, the radiating curves are pretty dead. As Tim said, they don’t feel explosive or dynamic. Even the grooves in a record change width and rhythm. A good DJ can read them and find bass lines and breaks, so that might be something to play with. Anything to enliven the rhythm.\n\nBuilding on the shapes in the terminals, I suggest that you modify them to give the whole word a more directional feel, particularly since there are curves ’blasting’ and ’radiating’ outward from the right side. Some of the terminals are oriented inward in relation to each other, like on the ’n’ and ’m’. Try customizing the characters to work in that specific word, rather than as an alphabet for any word.\n\nYou’ve got a good starting concept that you should punch up and really push in new visual directions.\n\n"

      "content": "I’d recommend playing with the spacing of the grooves just a bit. Plus the curves seem at little shakey, in a not-intentional way (maybe it just appears that way at this small screen size, hard to tell?). If you could make them perfect circle-segments, then tweak the spacing a bit, you’d be almost there. Is the “m” still a little cramped? Spacing is a little off between a-m and m-i. The e might need a click to the left as well, but personally, I’d rather add a click between each letter except the t-e and m-i.  \nLooking good though.  \nAlso, I’m thinking people may overlook your updated file/progress. You might post it up top with a new name to be more visible?\n\n"
