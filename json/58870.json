And <cite>empty inside</cite>. More discussion and comparisons [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020232254/http:/www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2008/september/an-ordinary-world). You can add the new Xerox logo to that list too; what is it with shiny balls and 'friendly' text?\n\n",

I actually quite like the way the ball moves and flashes like a photocopier, though not sure that's intentional or not.\n\nThis Barclaycard one looks like all sorts of weird things. Some kind of shredded tulip, a rubber glove caught in the wind, an empty egg, a vortex of paperwork...not really what a bank wants to convey surely!\n\nMaybe I'll make a compilation of naff logos; I'd have to do the same for nice ones though ;)\n\n"
