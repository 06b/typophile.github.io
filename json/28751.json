The Howl cover looks rather traditional, could have been any other author. The only pieces of this time I have seen, in photocopy, are two little publications of poems by Jim Carroll: inside 'typography' in typewriter; one cover rather traditional, in Centaur; the other cover appears to be a cut-and-paste piece of photo, hand-drawn stars and text in Cooper Black (caps only). Obviously, 'Beatnik style' was dictated by the means that a self-publisher or very small publisher could afford which at that time obviously was: typewriter.  \n(And this doesn't seem to be restricted to Beatniks. I remember having read that, a decade earlier, the cover for a Moondog LP was calligraphed by Andy Warhol's mother, which won an AIGA award.)\n\nMaybe you should typewrite and scan instead of digitally faking typewriter-style.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)\n\n"
