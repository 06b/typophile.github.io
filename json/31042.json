  "content": "The type community has a variety of means for testing characters - pangrams, brute force testing, language based character frequency lists ( and words ), all of which are good, but I may have thought of another wrinkle. No doubt others have preceded me if it's a good idea (or perhaps it's a silly one), but in any event:\n\nWhat do you think of making a shared Unicode text file that has words made to highlight a glyph in use? It's purpose could extend to kerning etc but the emphasis I want to give the list is aesthtic and and to a certain extent cultural and linguistic.\n\nSo for example for C, I think Cancer & CANCER are quite good. These two forms of the word seem like an elegant and concise way of examining if you like the way the C & c in your font looks. For Cap W I think WAVE, Wave, LAWYER, Lawyer would be good ones to use. The idea being that when a glyph has cases where it fits well and also where it sometimes fits poorly ideally they should both be presented. It would probably be good to have 3-5 words in each case to allow for a variety of aesthetic issues and combinational issues like double letters, round vs. flat neighbor glyphs and position in the word as well. So for C again maybe we would have cc: (the contaction), PINOCCHIO, Pinocchio, as well as a word with c At the end like ZINC, Zinc. And maybe one or two more.\n\nThe real reason I started thinking like this has nothing to do the glyphs used in English. Instead, I started thinking about this when I was looking at glyphs whose diacritics seemed especially aesthetically challenging because of their novelty. And what I wanted to see was a word that used them so I could start to build aesthetic context. Of course it would be good to have samples of the glyphs in use to look at too but what I want to have words which highlight the aesthetic concerns for glyphs like: ẗ, ť, ǻ Ǻ and ď etc. Ideally someone from or well versed in the cuture or cultures that use the glyph would give the examples.\n\nLet me know if these last glyphs don't render for you. They were: latin small letter t with diaeresis, latin small letter t with caron, latin small letter a with ring above and acute, latin capital letter a with ring above and acute, and latin small letter d with caron.\n\nDoes something like this exist already?\n\nObviously there is\n\n[http://diacritics.typo.cz/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018102446/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/ \"http://diacritics.typo.cz/\")  \nand  \n [http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=10](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018102446/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=10 \"http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=10\")\n\nWhich will continue to improve (and provide in-use examples) which is excellent!\n\nBut for the purposes of testing my fonts I would like to go further and have a text file like the one I have described as well!\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n",

I thought the word 'cancer' was an excellent test word not just because it has a 'c' at the beginning & in the middle but because it does a good job of showing the 'c-ness' of the c's used in it.

You can use all kinds of words for the goal here, like 'rhythm' and 'color' and 'notan', but this is all about getting the letters to work together. To me there's an additional 'pizzaz' factor, which is that it doesn't only work, but brings some beauty or excitement or authority to the words.\n\nI switch back and forth between faces, comparing the same name in the Preview Panel in my typeface and in other type faces I admire.

And so on. Think about this : it has been noted that type made for german looks better in german & type made for latin in latin. It's true. There are real reasons for this. Lots of them. All the little details! They all interact. Plus the pattens and habits seen in the language/s supported must be factored in and in that a balance has to be struck. So type made specifically for say Danish if it's well made will express itself in the context of Danish needs and priorities and will look and 'act' differently than one made for English.

Or is because German words are longer?  \nHm, less space, because it is more easy to separate words.  \nLonger german words - yes, you can add this.\n\n#\n\nFor non-german speakers – a nonsense text; \"Wortberge\" (what is Blindtext called in english?) to get an \"original feel\" for the \"rhythm of german\". Maybe you should add an text out of the medical, technical, science field to get the feeling for the real long words .\n\n[http://www.newmediadesigner.de/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018102446/http:/www.newmediadesigner.de/ \"http://www.newmediadesigner.de/\")  \nBlindtexte  \nWortberge\n\n#\n\n@Eben  \nI brought the list because i thought i could be interesting to see caps followed by an umlaut in real words. Maybe an kerning issue, too.\n\n\\>Do you have words where Ö is doubled?  \nI think there is no doubled umlaut, i don't remember\n\n\\>umlaut at the end  \nMalmö ist eine Stadt in Schweden. (Malmö is a swedish city.)\n\n\\>Does it also have to do with Caps being too dark/heavy in US & UK designed fonts for german setting?  \nDo you mean something like Caslon?\n\n"

And when you get into Celtic....\n\nAs a principle, I'd say it's OK to have umlaut dot accents a tad lower than the i dot, if they're also smaller, and because they're two of them. But really, the dot on the eye IS an accent (note Turkish), so it should be treated consistently.\n\n"
