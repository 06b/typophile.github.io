Clearly not from the digital font era and perhaps not even photo-lettering. Agree 100% with your classification as Fraktur. Very unusual to find sloped Fraktur script. This is not in script section of Jaspert's \\_Type encyclopaedia (1970)\\_. Worth digging further.  \nDon\n\n"

So far from all the sites I posted the picture, just you reply in this forum.  \nI sent a message to Mr. Unger Ralph, [http://www.myfonts.com/person/Ralph\\_M\\_Unger/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140606005058/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/Ralph_M_Unger/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/person/Ralph\\_M\\_Unger/\"), wait for reply.  \nKeep in touch and good luck!\n\nRegards!  \nDelia Petrescu\n\n"

It is striking and bold, and is designed for advertising. I have supplemented the font with ligatures and used the UNZ1 coding. This font is free for personal use only. [This font is based on Deiter Steffmann's digital font, so I still don't know what is legitimate.]  \nDon\n\n"
