They still do not show up.\n\nIs there a something that I need to indicate in the font info area? Like language support? or make it a unicode font. I have run out of ideas...\n\nthanks in advance\n\n [‹ Software for TrueType collections?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104015708/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19341 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Chinese Fonts & Adobe Software ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104015708/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19200 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
