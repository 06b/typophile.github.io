Hence the repetitive use of Trajan, Compacta, etc. for titles -- don't fix what ain't broke.\n\n"

As someone who does both, I find that a lot of illustrators don't know much about type and many designers don't respect illustration. I was trained as a designer and a fine artist and I think both fields (design and illustration) are so closely related they can stand to learn a thing or two about the other.
