I need to find some more recent ones. Like from the 60s to now.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ TDC2 2008 Results](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011133524/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42446 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Great typography in the Washington Post :-/ ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011133524/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42746 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
