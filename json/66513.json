      "content": "I answered your question in a non bitchy manner.\n\nThere's no mass of interested font collectors with a taste for current font releases fonts who use torrents. At least not the public trackers. I think that's why the majority of font torrents are ancient collections of converted junk, graffiti font collections or mainstream big company collections. I'm not saying that to discourage people. Anyone can Google the words font & torrent and see for themselves. The foundry collections, while they sounds exciting and useful, tend to be really outdated. I'm not going to name specific ones but I think they're really only useful to font historians.\n\nI'm not sure why, but the font scene is mostly a Rapidshare (or similar) scene. Usually when I see my own fonts being posted, it's usually a Rapidshare link. Whenever I see my own fonts in torrents, they're usually old versions of my early fonts mixed in with the usual 40,000 or so font grab bag mixed with free fonts . . . I think you know what I'm talking about.\n\nI'm not sure about the Usenet font scene . . . those cats are hard core. But so many Usenet search sites are fake so who knows? From the Usenet search tools it looks as if there are some current font collections being traded but it sounds unlikely. I've seen supposed Usenet collections, supposedly containing fonts of which I had only sold 3 copies. Unlikely.\n\nI don't think it's that way by accident. There's a real lack of availability and a fairly high price point (compared to music, movies, tv) which prevents torrents of new fonts to be released as torrents in the first place. If a font is $50 and sells 25 copies, how likely is it that one of those is going to end up on a tracker? Since, I think, most font buyers are designers, are those designers really going to take the time to post a torrent with single font family? Prolly not.\n\n"

Isn't this thread really about a bigger issue, which is that foundries should work to create a better preview mechanism? Several foundries offer an effective way to preview display fonts (MyFonts, H&FJ, and vllg come to mind), but there is still no really good way to visualize what a typeface will look like for extended text in the context of your document.\n\nTomi has suggested contacting the designers, and I think that this is a great idea. However, couldn't foundries offer some sort of automated service in which you feed in your point size, leading, column width, etc., and it spits out say 12 column-inches of lorem ipsum as a pdf for you to place in your document? I think that this would be a very useful tool.\n\nBut on the original topic, the type community cannot become like the RIAA and unilaterally condemn any mention of file-sharing. I recognize that the analogy to the recording industry is problematic, since the musicians lose much less from having their music downloaded, and type designers don't sell merchandise and play concerts. There's a reason that I have very little problem with downloading music but won't illegally download fonts or aid anyone in doing so. But the type community needs to avoid being seen as a curmudgeonly bunch of old coots who can't get with the times. Type designers need to figure out how to work the current climate to their advantage; just look at Jos Buivenga.\n\nThat's an awful lot of words just to say \"don't shout down anyone who mentions file sharing, regardless of intentions,\" but ultimately I feel that we can benefit fro the conversations that these kinds of threads start.\n\n"

      "content": "A couple more thoughts on the subject.\n\nThere are effectively three types of people interested in fonts:\n\n(a) those who do not realize that fonts require licensing  \n(b) those who know that they should be licensed and use them without licensing  \n(c) those who know that they should be licensed and do in fact license them\n\n(a) are potential customers  \n(b) are not paying out of principle  \n(c) are paying customers\n\nNow, let's see what does going after the torrent sites do. First of all, who ends up searching for a pirated copy of the font ? Those who have just been to the font retailer and could not download a copy without paying. I.e. people who _know_ about the licensing requirements, the group (b) or (c). Or those from (a) who were shocked by a sticker price and did not find a way to justify it.\n\n(b) is not paying, but (c) does. Why is (c) looking at pirated copies ? I think the answer is damn obvious - they want to evaluate the font in detail before committing. They are in a sense compensating for the shortcomings or the inadequacy of previewing systems at the font retailer's site.\n\nThis in turn means that taking down the torrent'ed copy eliminates the font from the consideration by such customers. It effectively translates into lost sales.\n\n--\n\nIf the goal is to entice people not to use torrents, then the only effective way to address this problem is to provide some form of return policy or to offer selected weights free of charge. Based on how well Jos's Museo is doing, latter is working.\n\nFormer is not something that I've ever seen in the wild, but, again, twist your brains a bit and consider who would be using this option - this would hardly be pirates, wouldn't it ? Every single \"return\" will come from honest, paying customers that will in the end be grateful for the flexibility; and that in itself will establish a great deal of goodwill and make them more likely to return for another purchase.\n\nIn other words - _do not worry about the piracy_.\n\nFocus on simplifying the experience of those who are willing to pay instead of going after those who won't pay regardless.\n\n"

      "content": "I throw music/font analogies around like something in a something. Here's something that I think differentiates font/music piracy. It's not a morality thing, it's a money thing.\n\nWhen a song is pirated, it's not likely to be broadcast. It goes into an MP3 player. The lost income is a lost sale.\n\nWhen a font is pirated, it may be used for something the public will see, in a sense, broadcast. A blog heading, decal, logo, game etc. This exposure causes a kind of erosion of style. The more people see it, the less novel it becomes. You can certainly see that with free fonts: they quickly become uncool from overexposure.\n\nFor recording artists, it's been argued that exposing people to music who normally wouldn't but it creates fan bases . . . agree or not, you've heard that side of the music piracy argument before. I think there's some truth in it. I don't think it means music piracy is a great boon for recording artists (2000 vs 2010) but more of a big downside with a tiny little upside.\n\nFor font makers, there's not much of a positive side to piracy. The increased exposure lowers the value of a font. There's little prestige in being included in a torrent, especially since the collections are generally trashy. According to apakrat, being included in a font torrent junk pile can potentially increase sales but I think it's pretty far fetched. But I agree about not worrying about it. You can't stop it anyway.\n\nFree font styles fueling pay font sales: I think that's a myth. The effect on sales is very subtle. If it worked, I'd keep doing it but generally a free version seems to have no effect on sales of the rest of the family whatsoever. I've been including free commercial use font styles since 2001. If it had a noticeable positive effect on sales, I'd be including free styles with every family.\n\nMaybe Museo does so well because it's awesome.\n\n"

I went there and explained to them that this font family was made for exclusive use of that publisher, and I could not see how that could have ended as a logo of a lunch diner.\n\nMy friend said that he just copied ALL fonts from the company he left, and liked my font for the job. He never even considered that the name of the font was the name of the publishing company.\n\nIn the end I made some design changes to the font, and everybody were happy.\n\nBut here you see how fonts are appreciated.\n\n"

And some other people think that designing typefaces is not a big deal, so they feel the prices are too high: they pirate fonts because for them the prices are abusive in the first place.\n\n———\n\nThat said, I can think of a possible motivation: to get the job.\n\nLet’s say that a publisher wants to do a book in Quadraat, a not so expensive typeface (because that’s the way the collection is or whatever other reason). He asks two freelances: the first one can do the job for $1000 + $204 for the four basic styles of FF Quadraat OT. The second one is pirating the fonts, so he can do the job for just $1000 (BTW, he has not only the four basic styles, but the whole family). Who will get the job? In my experience, the publisher will not care about licenses, he only wants his book the way he likes it. The “good” freelance can license Quadraat this time with his own money and keep it for him (investment), but tomorrow he is going to need another one and the next week a new one that most likely he will never use again… You get the picture.\n\nIn an ideal world, in these cases you should charge your client for the font licenses. In the real world, since not everyone is playing fairly, trying to do that may mean not to get any job at all.\n\n(Did I say that nobody has asked me to do a book in two years or so? But it’s ok, since I’ve been forced to do type design.)\n\n"

You need that some other people (prepress service, an employee) gets the font in order to complete the job. You give it to them. They don’t erase the files after the job is done.

Well, yes, that’s like stealing, but nobody gets hurt, the big foundries are rich anyway and the type designers… well, they need to get another job or change the way they distribute their typefaces because in this globalised world everything is changing and the information should be free and I don’t have the money to pay for it but I really need that typeface and blah, blah, blah.\n\nBut we still doing typefaces…\n\n"

Most designers know - even amateurs - that a well designed typeface can take months, even years to create.\n\nUnfortunately, many up and coming designers are too poor to buy the typefaces they would really like to be experimenting with. As a result, they will resort to torrents and other file sharing methods to get the fonts they want to use.\n\nI'd argue that most of these same people, once they've become more established in the design world, will purchase all the fonts they use.\n\n"

      "content": "You guys don't have a clue as to who the font pirates really are. Let me break it down for you. Roughly 6% are actually in the design industry. Mostly coming from 3rd world piss holes like Bolivia or Zimbabwe, and make less than a peso a project. The major bulk are those who download a font, stress on 'A' as in 1, to decorate their Myspace pages with. The last group comprises of about 22%, of the true Font Pirates who collect typefaces like Chuck Davis collects Beanie Babies. These people admire type but only use them in avatars or signatures for their favorite warez forum, or any forum for that matter. And then there's me, less than 1% of the above 22% that also releases just to piss Fontographers off.\n\nThough there may be some examples as above, there is no grand conspiracy of corporate greed to use your work without compensation. That's just your wishful thinking. A large portion of the faces are bought by pirates for the sole purpose of sharing among other pirates. Only about a quarter are actually extracted from files. And then those end up at a torrent tracker for the Myspace kiddies. The pay is usually distributed among many people. You get 100 people paying $5 for a $500 font its all win/win for everyone.\n\nYou can buy that starving artits bullshit if you want to. Fact is, you're all just tools. Make us these fonts, make them good, and if you no longer make them then you no longer matter. Someone else will gladly pick up where you left off. Many of you don't spend months making fonts. Like Richard Kegler, you just scan public domain books and artwork and copyright the digitizations- claiming the glyph designs as your own original works. A day to run scans through scanfont, a day or 2 to adjust the kerning. Maybe another day to poorly re-create the nonexistent characters like the elipses or tilde. Or you could be like Nick Curtis and crap out 3 to 5 sub-par-yet-original typefaces every month.\n\nAs for the original poster, all you need to do is Google top 10 torrent trackers. Then search for the font names, then foundry, then designer. You will find a lot of crap. Mostly Lino/mono/itc anti-p2p groups releasing dafont font packages to show you what you can get for free. Ugly fonts, like from Ray Larabie et al( BTW Ray, overexposure? You wish you could create a font half as famous as Helvetica). Don't listen to Nick Cooke either, I torrented his recent additions the other day. Just don't search for 'Fonts'.\n\n"

People talk in community environments. The font piracy community is very small. It ALL comes from the same ~2000 people. And its not about the Weiden Kennedy guy sharing Stainless to his inept designer friend in Norway so he can make extra money.\n\nDon't take my post too hard. Consider it an informative PSA to the Fontographer community. Not all of you are going to make millions sueing a company like NBC for a $100 font.\n\n"
