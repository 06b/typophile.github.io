However, I've had a difficult time listening to design blogs, blogs that have information that I'd like to at least kind of absorb. I've finally given in and am finding a way to sort of do it.\n\nThese guys are funny and irreverent.

Somehow I seem to have time to lurk around the Type ID board here... :^)\n\n"
