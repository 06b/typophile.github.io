  "content": "FREE SUNFLOWER SEEDS WITH ANY PURCHASE  \nFor the month of April, I’m sending out a pak of sunflower seeds to anybody who buys a font at Chank.com. (U.S. residents only, sorry!) Get with your seeds free with purchase of Chank Fonts here:  \n [http://www.chank.com/fonts\\_all.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20060511182410/http:/www.chank.com/fonts_all.php)\n\nAPRIL FONT OF THE MONTH: SUNFLOWER!  \nIt’s a new typewriter font. Made with an old typewriter. In new OpenType format. It’s new and old at the same time!  \n [http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5580](http://web.archive.org/web/20060511182410/http:/www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5580)\n\nFREE FONT: FLOWER POWER!  \nIt’s a quirky new display font.

My presentations are sponsored by Extensis, who can help with font management solutions. Best of all, the conference is happenin’ in Vegas.  \n [http://www.howconference.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060511182410/http:/www.howconference.com/)\n\n",
