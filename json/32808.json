  "content": "Hi\n\nI'm to be working soon on an optimization of fonts to be used in a phone book listing. I'd greatly appreciate any information that could help me regarding legibility at small sizes and a selection of potential fonts.\n\nWe are using Bell Centennial right now, but might well decide to change.  \nWhitney, Martin Majoor's Janszen, ... suggestions will be most appreciated!\n\n",
