  "content": "Hello, typophiles,\n\nCan anyone help me find the closest match to this sample from 1922 (book cover for Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West - looks like gold leaf or perhaps embroidery?)\n\nIt is a Trajan-style, however Trajan itself doesn't match the serifs, which are almost half-serifs. Once I have a typeface that's pretty darned close, I can make modifications like the swashes etc.\n\nThanks for any assistance you can provide!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012044312im_/http:/typophile.com/files/200px-Decline_of_the_West_1922_5722.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012044312im_/http:/typophile.com/files/02082013-DSCF0758_5366.JPG)\n\n",

Schneidler and released in 1936 with the name \"Schneidler-Mediaeval mit Initialen.\" It is usually called Schneidler Initials. I recommend the version by Castle Type, released as [Shàngó](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012044312/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/). Good selection of alternates. The monoline version [Shàngó Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012044312/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango-gothic/) is also useful.  \nDon\n\n"

I hadn't thought about the specific German history of the type, other than classical-revival generally, so thanks for these ideas.\n\nI'm trying to re-draw the lettering/reproduce the cover type, but was looking for the best starting point, and perhaps this is it.\n\n"

      "content": "You're welcome. It seems to me that the lettering for Untergang may have been intended to have an effect that was monumental & architectural to suggest the importance of the subject and Spengler's very structured approach to it -- thus the use of Trajan as an inspiration, in a very similar way that important buildings were graced with neo-Trajanesque inscriptions -- plus a contemporary feel that suggested a measured and scientific approach to the subject. Best wishes for your redesign. Shango with a touch of Ehmke & Weiss should do the trick.  \nDon\n\n"
