Assuming, of course, the job would be at least LOOSELY based in typography — although I’m sure doing work for Rob Halford would, indeed, be pretty f-ing sweet. Oh and kudos if the answer is “myself.”\n\nSecond — and I’m _really_ excited to hear what you have to say on this one — if you could have any typeface made (or , if you prefer, you could have infinite time to draw and dote over one yourself) — what would it be?\n\ndeeeeeeeeeeeep\n\n [‹ Timely Masterpiece of Arabic Calligraphy](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410040442/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28985 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Alphabet Aerobics... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080410040442/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37242 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And underwrite any workshops I’d like to enroll in.\n\nHe would also buy me the complete font collections of all the foundries, and a staff to organize them, so I could find the perfect font for what I am doing at all times.\n\nHe would also want me to test all the latest electronic gizmos, and would provide a credit card for that purpose.\n\nWanting me to be relaxed at all times, one of my staff would double as a massage therapist.\n\n(If this sounds like you, you can contact me on my profile page).  \n; )\n\n"

The following is from the movie “Office Space” and will maybe offer a brief comedic break...\n\nPeter: Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you’d do if you had a million dollars and you didn’t have to work. And invariably what you’d say was supposed to be your career. So, if you wanted to fix old cars then you’re supposed to be an auto mechanic.\n\nSamir: So what did you say?\n\nPeter: I never had an answer. I guess that’s why I’m working at Initech.\n\nMichael: No, you’re working at Initech because that question is bull”stuff” to begin with. If everyone listened to her, there’d be no janitors, because no one would clean “stuff” up if they had a million dollars.\n\n[Later]  \nPeter: What would you do if you had a million dollars?\n\nLawrence: I’ll tell you what I’d do, man: two chicks at the same time, man.\n\nPeter: That’s it? If you had a million dollars, you’d do two chicks at the same time?\n\nLawrence: Damn straight. I always wanted to do that, man. And I think if I were a millionaire I could hook that up, too; ’cause chicks dig dudes with money.\n\nPeter Gibbons: Well, not all chicks.\n\nLawrence: Well, the type of chicks that’d double up on a dude like me do.\n\nPeter: Good point.\n\nLawrence: Well, what about you now? what would you do?\n\nPeter: Besides two chicks at the same time?\n\nLawrence: Well, yeah.\n\nPeter: Nothing.\n\nLawrence: Nothing, huh?\n\nPeter: I would relax... I would sit on my ass all day... I would do nothing.\n\nLawrence: Well, you don’t need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my cousin: he’s broke, don’t do “stuff.”\n\n"

At this point it’s very much a back-burner project because I lack the skills to pull it off; I think it will end up being a 16-year project like Beorcana. I also wanted to do a simpler sans, something along the lines of a grotesque or a contemporary design, so I made that my senior thesis.\n\n"
