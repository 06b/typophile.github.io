Does anyone have any recommendations on type-related [or any other interesting] events that will happen in Europe close to ATypI? Conferences, workshops, exhibitions? I know “Europe” is a bit vague, but once you’ve crossed the Atlantic, a few more miles are no problem. ;)\n\n",

So we were thinking of traveling a little, since we can only have trips like that once every few years, because of distance and money.\n\nOh and by the way, your work is fantastic, I’m a fan :)\n\n"
