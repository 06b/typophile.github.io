      "content": "I too am a student, and the way I see it, a logo for myself is not a great idea. If you are going to have a firm or something of your own, then I would name it, and give it a mark of some kind. Since I see this as something for your portfolio, and you may be trying to show your portfolio for the purpose of getting a job, I would stick to a type system. Create a hierarchy of typeface, weight, size, etc., and carry it throughout your materials. This shows you as an individual, and someone who knows what is goin on. If you have a mark, it looks like you're a firm.   \n   \nwhichever you are going for is fine, but I think a clear distinction needs to be made.   \n   \nAnd yeah, I agree that you should push it. You mention Swiss somethingorother, maybe look for an expressive USE of a typeface, rather than script.   \n   \nAaron\n\n"

JII is my simple logo now,\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153745im_/http:/typophile.com/files/selfid_5599.jpg)\n\nThe reasoning for the logo.. Joseph Thomas Maguire III JTM III JII...  \nI have a strong family line 20th most noble last name from Ireland. I am the the third, My last name begins with an M and first letter starts with a J. It's all of me, its encompassing and its simple. I found it through alot of sketching, and playing. and I am very happy with how it came out. You can see it in action along with my family coat of arms on my website at [www.sisudesigns.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020153745/http:/www.sisudesigns.com/ \"www.sisudesigns.com\")\n\nThanks to all who critiqued!\n\nJoseph Maguire III  \nCommunications Designer\n\n"
