  "content": "Hi All,  \nI just stumbled upon this brilliant magazine called The Fashion (Autumn/Winter 2000) from the UK. Sadly, it's gone under but I'm dying to know what serif they've used. The layouts are amazing. Here's an example I've scanned. Any help would be lovely!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [thefashion.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109082909/http:/typophile.com/files/thefashion.jpg) | 171.05 KB |\n\n",

I think I've seen that wild ry ligature in the PDF, but I don't see it right now.\n\nIt is related to Caslon as many say that the types of Van Dijck, which are the basis of DTL Elzevir, served as models for William Caslon.\n\nBy the way, heinous use of Caslon 540 :)\n\n"
