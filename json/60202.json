  "content": "Greater Alion Typefounders has just released it's next family of faces. Gildersleeve evokes the spirit of the Arts and Crafts movement of the 1920s. Think of a hand-cut Roman display face, with loving care lavished over each serif and letterform.\n\nGildersleeve is offerered in the classic combination of a regular face, a bold face, an italic and an italic bold. Any of them are ideal for poster or cover work, as well as for chapter and section headings in a longer document, in combination with a text face such as Vertrina or Clementhorpe Text.\n\nYou can see some examples of Gildersleeve in use on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202221002/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/), or try it out for yourself at [Myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202221002/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/gildersleeve/overview.html).\n\nIn the meantime, here's an example of Gildersleeve in action:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202221002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gildersleeve_Gallery4_3432.png)\n\n",
