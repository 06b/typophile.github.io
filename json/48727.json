Think about italics: they weren’t invented to be used alongside romans to create a hierarchy.\n\nWhen I think about diagonals I often think back to a professor who would often catch lazy students using diagonals to try and whip up a dynamic composition. When confronted with the question “Why do the diagonals make this composition dynamic?” the students never had an answer.\n\nBut at the same time I guess one can always find diagonals from a strictly mathematical perspective: in a shape with an odd number of sides all sides are at diagonals to all others, none are parallel (At least I think it works that way, I’d have to write a program to test it). So within the mathematical structure of reality there are always some kinds of diagonals.\n\n"

      "content": "An interesting question. I think the concept of the diagonal would be meaningless without our instinctive bodily awareness of the vertical and the horizontal as defined by gravity. This is very basic. Aziz’s stairs is an excellent example: They lead up (or down) and also cross a ’horizon’-tal distance. In geometry the diagonals join the corners of a square or a cube, or of the capital letter N; or can be found in the Arabic medial kaf. The formula for a diagonal is y=ax with ’a’ some constant defining the slope. If a=1 the line is at a 45 degree angle. In the case of the lower edge of the eyebrow in hrant’s thumbnail it is 9 pixels high and 27 across so a=0.3333 :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122111315im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/hrant_5565.jpg)\n\n"

You’re definitely looking for one or a pair of perpendicular axes as a reference.\n\nAlternatively, diagonal literally means ’across angles’ or similar. Thus a diagonal could be horizontal or vertical depending on how the shape whose angles one is crossing is placed on the page, or in its own space relative to the ground (which is ’flat’ if it is perpendicular to the gravitational pull, so gravity comes into it too... maybe?) Suppose you draw a regular pentagon sitting on one of its sides. The line that you draw between the two points below the apex would be both ’horizontal’ and yet ’diagonal’ too.\n\nMy head hurts.\n\n"

A bee hive has perfectly regular (meaning all sides are the same length) hexagons, so the hive is constructed of nothing but diagonals. Snow flakes, crystals, the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower (a spiral constructed of series of diagonals)...\n\nEven were this not the case, I’m not sure I’d buy the idea that a font is somehow more “natural” if it only has vertical and horizontal strokes.
