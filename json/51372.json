  "content": "I've actually been trying to conceptualize, for several years, a typeface to convey a particular idea (that I don't want to give away just yet) and it recently occurred to me that in order to achieve the desired connotation I'm shooting for, it would be desirable to do create a typeface combining several different aspects, one of which was the paradigm of the brush + a serif font. Once I realized this, I immediately thought of Underware's work and Dolly in particular. To be honest, I can't really think of another brushy serif that isn't compared to Dolly (Dederon often being cited as a clone). Of course I want to avoid aping someone else's work, but it almost seems that when it comes to designing a brush-informed serif typeface it is inevitable that it will be compared to the exemplar of the genre: Dolly. It doesn't seem possible that in the hundreds of years of type that Dolly was the first example of a brushy serif, but I can't think of one that pre-dates it or many other types that would fit into this category. Before I go any further, I'm curious if anyone out there is aware of other serif typefaces that that incorporate the brush-formed structure and still avoid the problem of looking too much like Dolly. Also, is it possible to create a brush serif that avoids Dolly comparisons? Will Dolly, in time, be seen as the father of the genre, much as Johnston's Underground has spawned so many humanist sans typefaces? If you're so inclined, please enlighten me!\n\n",

Some of these other brushy faces, like Rumba, distance themselves from Dolly by incorporating a more eccentric character. That's probably why I didn't think of them to begin with. Also some of this other 'Dutch school' stuff is good to be reminded of. Actually, I should have investigated this area first, because my ideas started coming together when someone referred to Grandia as being 'Reading house style' and I was thinking of what would characterize the 'KABK house style' and thought that it would be this brushy stuff. Then I thought what would happen if I reconciled the two houses and incorporated elements of both in a typeface. Looking at the Kompilat thread actually scares me a bit. I know I looked at it before I started Reading, but I never referred to it when I was Designing Grandia, it must have become engrained in my unconciousness. Yet it's interesting that Ondrej and I made quite a lot of the same design decisions, espeically in the Roman. Thank goodness the italics are more divergent! His roman has a few brush elements (as Does Grandia), but is more calligraphic in general than brush-informed. Interesting, gives me a lot to think on. Thanks for your help, folks. Of course more comments are welcome, if you desire to make any...\n\n"

This can be seen in his typeface [Versa](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319105310/http:/www.farhill.nl/01_typefaces/versa.html) which is used throughout the book Dutch Type. An even better example is the precursor to Versa, called Nardy, which he designed in the mid-nineties. Peter Verheul might be relatively unknown to most but he makes innovative and sometimes highly experimental designs and has a good hand for teaching.\n\nThe origins of this brush style can be attributed to the calligraphic exercises with the flat brush that he teaches at the MA Type & Media. I teach this technique to a group of undergraduate students at the KABK as well. The flexible brush is more difficult to control than the stiff broad-nibbed pen but it also invites playfulness and experimentation.\n\nOn a different note: I wouldn’t classify Lexicon (1992) as particularly brushy though (Trinité (1979) would suit that title better) but both of Bram de Does’ typefaces have inspired numerous (ex-)KABK students indeed.\n\n-Paul van der Laan  \n [www.type-invaders.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150319105310/http:/www.type-invaders.com/ \"www.type-invaders.com\")\n\nBTW: Paul, calling Ondrej “from the house of KABK” doesn’t do him justice, does it? He only started at the MA Type & Media two months ago. All his work shown here on Typophile was made whilst he was still an undergraduate in Bratislava.\n\n"
