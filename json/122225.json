My program has no plug ins or separate modules that I know of. It just doesn't seem to be there. THANKS!!\n\nI spent a few hours looking for it.  \nI will take anything:\n\n1) A key command to get me to the trace setting box  \n2) A pull down tool (0r)  \n3) A trace icon tool I can click.\n\nI found nothing and want to build a font off traces of a very nice hand sketched letter set.  \nI could revert to my Fontographer, but want to make an OpenType format.\n\nFolks thanks for any help.  \nemail me at  \nJoe  \n [roubideau@gmail.com](mailto:roubideau@gmail.com)\n\n",
