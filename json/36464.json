  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m brand new to the forum but in need of some help! (I posted this in the design section but was kindly referred here)\n\nI designed my own business card while I was still at university, and was pleased with it at the time, but it is beginning to show it’s age!\n\nThe card consisted of a rendered 3d letter “e” with a black background. On the right side of the card, I wrote my name and details in white with Magneto for my font. Have a look below. It’s just not doing it for me. I am a video editor/3d animator living in London. I want to convey a modern, smooth image, without being too “out-there” for the average person that I might give my card to. I am still generally happy with this background image, but I welcome any and all advice in regards to colours, layout, font (ESPECIALLY font), etc.\n\nI humbly thank you in advance for taking the time to help me!\n\n~Erven\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020061553im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BusCard_help_4232.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "First off, I'd suggest using a typeface that's a little more readable at small sizes.\n\nBecause you do 3D animation, I think that the 3D render on the card might be a good idea, especially if you're going with a CMYK card. If you're keeping it, you might want to keep at least your name set in Magneto. I don't know if the vector version is necessary, and I might put the dots above and below the 'E' in \"Erven\" instead.\n\nPlay around with it and post your progress.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

Cropping was an improvement.\n\nIf I should take it from there, i would try:\n\n01  \nScale down the 3d image approx 15%, so that (a) the uppermost edge of the 3d image not reaches the top edge of the card, and (b)the southwest corner of the card just shows a tiny bit of background (ie: you should be able to see the roundness of the 3d image down in this corner)\n\n02  \nWrite all the text in the same size, which should be fairly small (ie the size of the email address or a bit larger)\n\n03  \nLose the idea of having flush right type 'mirror' the right edge of 3d image ... make it flush left instead, and use the 15-odd % scaling of the image and the downsizing of the type to get ample space between the two elements\n\n04  \nWrite all the text without emphasizing with small caps or blank lines ... you only got three lines - no need to diffenrentiate anything, people can easily navigate through the information ... and the more minimalistic the type, the more exclusive it gets. (And the more 'boring' the type, the more interesting the 3d image. This is my main point: let the image steal the scene!\n\n05  \nJust to pursue this line of thought, you COULD try to change the colour of the type to light grey ... 15-20 % black or something\n\n06  \nNo matter if the type is grey or white - if you scale it down like I suggested, remember to give a few units of space between all letters\n\n07  \nIn the same line of thought: you COULD try to write everything with lowercase ...\n\n08  \nBTW - how is the card going to be produced? Colour printer? Or offset printing ... this may influence some of the choices you make ... eg the colouring of the type\n\n09  \nYes, I guess I am a minimalist ... ;.)\n\n"
