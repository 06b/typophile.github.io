I summarize them after each font name. First the copyright holder. Then the version info. finally other comments.\n\nAthenia.ttf  \nThomas E. Harvey 1993 [seems identical to Athenian Normal but has strange date: \"Version 1.00 April 23, 1927, initial release]\"\n\nAthenian Normal.ttf  \nThomas E. Harvey 1993 [\"1.0 Fri Apr 23 15:17:44 1993\"]\n\nEFN Mellotron.ttf  \nEuroFONT 94-2000. [\"Version 2.0; 2000] 318 regular glyphs. Codepages Eastern Europe, Turkish, Baltic, vietnamese. Includes \"gk\" logo. I wonder who \"gk\" is?\n\nEFN Melody.ttf  \nEuroFONT 2002 [2.4] 375 glyphs. Same codepages as Mellotron but \"gk\" logo gone.\n\nKarissa.ttf  \nBright Ideas, no date [Macromedia Fontographer 4.1 6/25/99]\n\nKlarissa.ttf  \nTypographer Mediengestaltung, i.e. Dieter Steffmann 2001 [\"1.2\"] Glyphs seem to match Karissa's--except for ps-\\>tt conversion variation. Minor difference in number of glyphs 245 v. 248.\n\nTitania.ttf  \nTypographer Mediengestaltung, i.e. Dieter Steffmann 2001 [\"1.3; 2001\"]\n\nTitania MF.ttf  \nRick Mueller 1993 [\"Macromedia Fontographer 4.1.3 9/15/05\"]\n\nInternal font dates suggests Thomas E. Harvey & Rick Mueller were the first to [independently?] digitize the font in 1993.\n\nThe name Titania is used for a font shown on page 44 of the Solo Catalog that looks like these fonts. According to the \"Solocat\" A \"Solofont digital version included in Dover/Solofont Art Nouveau book + CD pack.\" Info for the solo Titania font: Dan X. Solo. 1998 [Macromedia Fontographer 4.1.5 9/4/98]. The glyph data in Steffman's 2001 Titania match the Solo Titania.\n\nDon\n\n"
