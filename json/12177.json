My wish is that I could do it comprising the most countries as possible. My interest is on any kind of print issue. Magazines, flyers, newspapers.\n\nHere are some samples of what I’ve got here:\n\n[http://www.totalkrieg.com.br/sample.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150312165154/http:/www.totalkrieg.com.br/sample.jpg)\n\n========================================================  \n\"Eu bebo sim, e tô vivendo, tem gente que não bebe e tá morrendo\"\n\n"

The typefaces used in Soviet Union during WWII were, almost without exception, old Russian or German makes, developed before 1917 (for manual composition), or the imported (American and English) matrices for Linotype and Monotype machines, designed in early 20th century. National newspapers printed in Moscow and Leningrad (Pravda, Izvestia and others) used A-P-L headline slugcasters manufactured by Mergenthaler Linotype, with matrices that came with those machines from the US (in early and mid- 1930s).\n\nThe very first Soviet type designs were developed—primarily for the domestic linecasters—only after 1936. They were **Excelsior** (a knock-off of one of the Linotype ‘Legibility Group’ typefaces, by Mikhail Shchelkunov and Nikolay Kudryashov, 1936), **Obyknovennaya Novaya** (a version of Bodoni, by Nikolay Kudryashov, Galina Bannikova and Anatoly Shchukin, 1938–41), **Literaturnaya** (a version of Romana, by Anatoly Shchukin, 1939), **Akademicheskaya** (a version of Cheltenham, by Anatoly Shchukin, 1941). However, their use before and during WWII was very, very limited, and they are difficult to spot in Soviet wartime print.\n\n"

The first version of **Shkolnaya** (a Soviet version of the ATF/Linotype Century Schoolbook) was developed in 1939 by a group of designers directed by Evgeny Chernevsky. However, the design was completed only in 1949–61, by a design group headed by Elena Tsaregorodsteva, the leading member of the 1939 Chernevsky team. There were several other type designs whose development was interrupted by, or suspended during, the war.\n\nI waguely remember that **Obyknovennaya Novaya** , mentioned above, was developed for the new edition of the collected works of Lenin.\n\n"

My research is due a personal interest and the fact I’m planning the thesis. Therefore, I’ve no determinate patch to follow. My wish is that, together, we could compile that information. I’m plenty of visual material but I have no knowledge about typefaces and thus I can’t identify then.\n\nActually there’s a post in this same forum about typefaces in late 40’s and early 50’s.\n\nI’ll try to answer one by one.\n\nMAXIM:\n\nCould you please explain me the concept of lettering under this context?\n\n“Obyknovennaya novaya” is the New Standart font right?\n\nSo, if those typefaces were barely used during WWII, which typefaces were used? You said it was mostly pre-1917 German , American and English, could you tell me which one were these?\n\nGUSTAVO:\n\nThanks a lot for the link. Now I must try to figure out which font faces are those :)\n\nTIFANNY:\n\nActually I don’t have any advisor yet. As I said above I’m far from graduating, but I’m already picking things together.

As to the list of Cyrillic types that were used in the Soviet print during WWII, it could include those designs that are shown in the prewar specimens of Monotype Corporation and Mergenthaler Linotype, and in the catalogues of the Russian and German foundries of early 20th century (the most prominent ones operating in Russia were Josef Lehmann’s, Hermann Berthold’s, Benjamin Krebs’s and Ferdinand Flinsch’s; some fonts were imported from Germany).
