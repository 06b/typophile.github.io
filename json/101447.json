There are different versions of the forward slash, as well — the virgule is probably what you mean by a \"regular\" slash; there's also the solidus, which is used as a fraction bar.\n\n"

If they were, then that would be a strongish reason to make them symmetrical. But even though they're not, my inclination would be to make them symmetrical because in my experience any character with a flipped version is likely to be used as /mirrored punctuation\\ by someone out there.\n\n"
