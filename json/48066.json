      "content": "Hallo Stefan,\n\nsehr interessant, gleich zu Anfang, ich bin kein Schriftgestalter, Ausrufezeichen.  \nMein erster Eindruck ist … Origami. „Aus Papier gefaltete Schrift“, das habe ich so noch nicht gesehen. Dein Blindtext sieht für mich auf den ersten Blick sehr klassisch, sehr roman aus, gefolgt sogleich von „seltsamen perspektivischen Verschiebungen“, wie gesagt sehr interessant. Mehr als 2 Bier habe ich gerade, am Fr. abend, 22.41 Uhr, nicht intus :))\n\nGrüße Thomas\n\nFrutiger hat ja am Anfang Schrift ausgeschnitten, siehe Ondine …  \nDein g hat in der Vergrößerung einen Darstellungsfehler, nur so als Hinweis\n\n"

Schätze, das hat irgendwie seinen Weg in die Schrift gefunden. Tatsächlich finden sich Doppelungen von einigen Innen und Aussenformen an verschiedenen Stellen der Buchstaben wieder (an Stellen, wo sie nicht hingehören).  \nWenn Du willst kann ich Dir mehr Bilder dazu schicken/bzw. reinstellen.  \nDas mit dem g war mir auch aufgefallen. Keine Ahnung woran das liegt.\n\nDanke nochmal  \nStefan\n\n"

They just look a little like they're tumbling over on themselves, and so while the rest of the letters look almost like impossibly perfectly balanced wire statues of sorts, those two seem a little too impossible. (okay, on retrospect, that description might make no sense whatsoever ha). I think if you can extend the strokes a little bit more it'll balance those letters again.

Makes courage to go on in times like these where my inspiration seems a bit low. ;-)  \nThomas, what’s wrong with Jenson? He did the most inspired and perfect roman type in history of humanity!  \n(I am sorry for the Aldus folks, but his rhythm of letters is unbeaten up today! ;-)  \nYet, I believe its personal enough and specially with this character I am almost afraid of changing anything.  \nEven making it better. It came so suddenly to me and everytime I tried to modifiy something it turned out to loose something of its freshness (I hope). Matthew, you are certainly right what concerns ‘e’ and ‘c’. I tried to do so and returned to the start after all.  \nSo I have decided to make little changes. I hope you stay with it nevertheless. Thanks again for your critics and interest!  \nVery very nice from you both.\n\nWhen I return from work I look to place some pictures of its process.\n\nMatthew: You definitely have to translate the sentence that you cited in Spanish above.  \nSeems very very interesting to me! Currently I am trying to gether some thoughts for a book more about beauty and its research in general.

      "content": "<cite> if, however, your goal is a non-digital look you are on a completely wrong track. it is exactly the bumpy curves that make your typeface immediately recognizable as a digital one. </cite>\n\nHm. Interesting this thought. I never saw it this way around. Could be, too.  \nMaybe I am too digital (for I also never do drawings by hand, immediately design on the monitor with bezíérs). You gave me a very interesting point of view with this remark.\n\nFor what regards the bumpiness I think I didn’t explain me right. I am designing now for years and years with these curves and what I meant is the following:  \nEverytime I use these curves in a correct way (so that near the points there are no bumps etc. - and believe me, please, I am able to do so;-) for my eyes I cannot achieve the overall form that I wanted. The relation between the tangents in their length to each other always lead to a certain character of form (to me). If one makes them smooth without allowing them to offer points of critique in a way (from a technical point of view) they secretely make curves more elliptical - really hard to explain my feeling here: the letters become digital looking. You will agree with me that nearly all typefaces on the world by now are in a certain way very similar to each other. They will never look like lets say for example a handcut Van Krimpen face or a Jenson and so on. To me (maybe I am terribly wrong here - almost like to say: I hope so) they all have this defect of being too elliptical - in a way they look strangely stretchable, smooth but not round. Not like a beautiful handdrawn circle would. Thats why I attached those woman fotos. Look at their body forms, the way the skin moves, muscles. Those forms are different to those of digital letters.  \nIn a word I still believe that there is something wrong in a digital bezier curve. (By the way here: have you heard about Raph Levians alternative curves?) And I try under an artistic aspect to experiment with it. Making them with bumps: BUT that the overall form of letter seems to me agreeable. If you said there is something strangely beautiful (and it is far from being the result of what I wanted) in them: it is that. I refused bettering Beziers in zones where I observed that this would change the original spontaneous form.  \nFirst sketches were made in FontStudio (version 92 I think) Although I love FontLab there it is more simple to find those originary forms. Maybe because the defects of beziers show less obviously in the first steps of work.  \nMaybe I will never make it to explain my feelings about it.  \nDid you ever designed a form and then later you recognize that you are afraid of changing it?  \nWith this character I made this experience. Everytime I tried to make something better it became worse. But now this is becoming too personal I guess.. ;-)\n\n<cite> But I disagree that bezier curves changes natural forms </cite>\n\nJust believe me: THEY DO!\n\nStefan\n\n"
