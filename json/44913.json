  "content": "Hello,\n\nThis has been bugging for quite some time now, what do all these abbreviations mean? Some I can figure out but there are some that confuses me especially when its the exact same font but with different abbreviations at the end of its name. does typophile have a glossary of these abbreviations?\n\nAnd why does garamond have an ITC and Adobe version? What’s the reason behind that? And other fonts for that matter?\n\nThanks,  \nMIYU\n\n [‹ Proven Font DRM Method Announced. . .](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907055605/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44927 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font recommendation? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907055605/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45038 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

STD=Standard MM=Multiple Master (an older Adobe technology) ... not sure on the last two.\n\nKeep looking for Garamond’s, you will find at least three other cuts, Garamond 3, Simonici, and Stempel. Each foundary tends to create their own version of this revival face, with small to major differences. The two you mention have the greatest difference, with ITC having a very large x-height (ratio of lower case size to cap height). This is usual on most ITC faces. Adobe has a very small x-height.\n\n"

In fact, this us the usual case.\n\nLining figures are figures that are all the same height (sometimes the same height as caps, sometimes a bit shorter).\n\nThere are also old style (also called ranging or lowercase) figures, which have ascenders and descenders, similar to lowercase letters.\n\nTabular figures are figures that are all the same width, so that they can be used in tables of numbers and line up vertically.\n\nThere are also proportional figures, which have different widths for better spacing when used in normal non-tabular text.\n\nAny particular set of figures is (usually) one of these combinations: Tabular lining, proportional lining, tabular old style, proportional old style. There are other possible number styles.\n\n"
