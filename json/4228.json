Should be modern but still a bit conservative, quiet/clean, well readable ... I think I would fancy the whiteman/Kent Lew font ...   \n   \nAny suggestions?   \n   \nAnd than I would like to show you a logo I did a few years ago. Its a typologo for a media solutions company.   \n   \nWhat do you think?   \n   \nCu beck\n\n",
