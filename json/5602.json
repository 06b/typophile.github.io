  "content": "I'm having an issue with a family of windows postscript fonts that I've generated from Fontographer on the PC. When you go into ATM, only the regular and bold weights show up in the window.   \n   \nWhen dragging and dropping the files onto the fonts folder, it says the .PFB is invalid or damaged for each font, but it still installs and I can use the fonts in any application.   \n   \nQuestion: What encoding option should I be choosing when I generate the fonts (Windows 95, Windows 3.1, Adobe Standard?). Would that make a difference?   \n   \nThe fonts are named normally like Bold, BoldItalic, Black, BlackItalic etc. So I don't think it's a naming issue.   \n   \nAny help is appreciated.\n\n",

Windows can only have four-member font families, with only two weights plus italics in a single family. So for example, you might have the following Windows Family, Style (PostScript FontName) combos:   \n   \nVariable Light, Regular (Variable-Light)   \nVariable, Regular (Variable-Regular)   \nVariable Light, Bold (Variable-Semibold)   \nVariable, Bold (Variable-Bold)   \nVariable Black, Regular (Variable-Black)   \n   \nAlso, although this couldn't cause the problem at hand, you ought to have a hyphen between the family name and the style in the PostScript FontName.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

The base names (AfishaGrotesk) are the same, then I put the language ID, say \"C\" for Cyrillic or \"E\" for CE. If I separate such suffix with a space (AfishaGrotesk C), a weird error occurs: under MacOS X, Fontbook shows font sample with rearranged alphabet. If I eliminate the space in the name, everything is fine: the sample shows alphabet in the correct order. Seems like a definite bug either in FL, or in MacOS 10.3.4/Fontbook\n\n"
