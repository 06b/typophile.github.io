However I've had a better success rate than you have. Identifont is the one that is truly useless.\n\nSabrina looks like Palace Script.\n\n[http://www.identifont.com/find?font=palace+script&q=Go](http://web.archive.org/web/20101221093942/http:/www.identifont.com/find?font=palace+script&q=Go \"http://www.identifont.com/find?font=palace+script&q=Go\")\n\n"

What that site is missing, IMHO, is a first step that allows you to categorize the font - i.e. serif, sans, script, calligraphic, display. It is improved in that now you can enter the letter selection you have available rather than having to click 'Not Sure' on all the Q and J questions.\n\n"
