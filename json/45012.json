  "content": "If one was to use the Beaufort extended font as an exhibit font on sports banners, posters, and brochures what would be a nice font to compliment it.\n\nI have looked at FF Kievit, FF Meta and Fedra Sans, but those just do seem to fit. I have also considered Akzidenz Grotesk but wanted something with a little more pop. Are there any other possibilities I should consider?\n\n",

I think an ideal match would be warm in a slightly idiosyncratic way, not warm in a \"modern\" way like Kievit, Fedra, etc., but I'm drawing a blank on what would fit the bill. Maybe Nick Shinn, [Beaufort's](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193810/http:/shinntype.com/) designer, will chime in.\n\n"

Yes this has the \"pop\" that I am looking for.\n\nWhen I say \"pop\" I am referring to a font that would look as though it was meant to go together with Beaufort and didn't look like something that was created yesterday and would be gone tomorrow.  \nAdditionally, it shows a character you wouldn't find anywhere else.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nI know I am in my own little world, but its ok.
