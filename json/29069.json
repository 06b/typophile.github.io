  "content": "Hi,  \nI foud this beautiful hand drawn type from [www.loveworn.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140911043309/http:/www.loveworn.com/ \"www.loveworn.com\") by Mario Hugo.  \nAmazing stuff! I have seen a few typefaces with the multiple lines from the 60's & 70's  \nbut I am after some names, and ones that have been digitized. Or even more modern  \none that have been made similar. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140911043309im_/http:/typophile.com/files/loveworn_3916.gif)\n\n",
