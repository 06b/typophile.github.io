  "content": "Hi!\n\nI'm new to the forum, but look forward to participating in it. I really like the design and way it functions - very different to other boards! :)\n\nI'd like to ask about books for novices. I see it's been covered before, but some of the books I mention below (all found on Amazon.com) are relatively new. Does anyone have any advice as to which of these books (or any others) one should or shouldn't go for? I'm open to getting more than one (though obviously not too many :)).\n\nI'm interested in type as it is used today - in advertising, book/magazine/document layout, digitally (on-screen documents, websites, etc.), as an art-form on it's own. I'm also interested in the history of type, but I'm really looking for a book that offers practical advice on layout and type use. I'm very interested in design in general, so I'm also open to books that cover type as a part/chapter.\n\nI've enjoyed reading \"The Rules of Typography\" and other articles on The Font Site (www. fontsite.com), so a book would similar advice would be nice (if that's recommended).\n\nThe books I've found are:\n\nTypography  \nby Friedrich Friedl\n\nTypography Workbook: A Real-World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design  \nby Timothy Samara\n\nTypography: Macro- and Microaesthetics  \nby Willi Kunz\n\nType & Typography  \nby Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam\n\nThinking with Type : A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, and Students (Design Briefs)  \nby Ellen Lupton\n\nThe Elements of Typographic Style  \nby Robert Bringhurst\n\nThe Complete Manual of Typography  \nby James Felici\n\nStop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works, Second Edition  \nby Erik Spiekermann and E.M Ginger\n\nMaking and Breaking the Grid: A Graphic Design Layout Workshop  \nby Timothy Samara\n\nA final note: all the books look interesting, but (a) it's difficult to judge them when you can't flip through them and see what they contain, and (b) I have no idea about the credibility of the authors.\n\nAny advice would be most appreciated. I apologise for the long post - particularly seeing as it's my first! :)\n\n",

      "content": "_The Elements of Typographic Style_ by Robert Bringhurst really is one of the VERY BEST books you'll ever find on typography and design. It discusses basics, history, page layout, proper terminology, \"the rules\" of good typography and even has a meaty specimen section in the back. It should be required reading for all designers.\n\n"

      "content": "Marc  \nTwo books I can't live without - The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst (you mention this one) and Letters of Credit by Walter Tracy. Stop Stealing Sheep is very good, Type & Typography is excellent. The Lupton books are always good. For history and examples the always popular can't live without it type of book, no pun intended, is Jaspert, Berry & Johnson, Encyclopaedia of Type Faces, Blandford, 1993, I hope still in print. I also like About Face - Reviving the rules of typography by David Jury, RotoVision, 2002. Finally, not really, a great one, Language, Culture, Type edited by John Berry, published by ATYpI/Graphis, 2002, and Dutch Type by Jan Middendorp, 010 publishers, Rotterdam, 2004, pricey, but worth it. If I had to pick one from these, stranded on a desert island, it would be the Berry book. As long as I had a writing implement and a piece of parchment with me, and a tropical fruit or two.  \nHave fun  \nJordan\n\n"
