Bad type might deal with work that purposely disobeys normal typographic customs to achieve wayward ends or it may cover material created to facilitate naughty, mischievous or roguish purposes. It could also include the curious work of amateurs with no particular design talents. The theme of Bad Type may be applied to individuals, their work, the purpose behind their work or the processes used to produce it.'\n\n",
