Not sure what the connection is between the two, aside from the fact that they appear to use the same type treatment. Maybe Shoe was involved with both, although I think I read that the All City design was someone else.\n\nBTW, I checked out some of your work. Furet is rad. Your calligraphy is ill.\n\n"

To be honest, the lettering on the can looks kinda clumsy compared to the Dutch Masters logo.\n\nAnd thanks for the compliments about my work. I spot some graffiti influence in your work. My love for letters partly comes from my graffiti days. ;)\n\n"
