  "content": "Not really (not yet) a typography critique request, it's \"only\" about the font selection/pairing: Am I crazy, or do these two really look quite happy (or at least interesting, and definitely not bad) together?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185621im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whitman-fedra-1_3862.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418185621im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whitman-fedra-2_4169.gif)\n  \nTo my eye, they seem to click – in an interesting and not quite friction-less way. Maybe beyond the surface differences of their curves, they share some \"deeper\" character traits that make them work together – a certain tautness/springiness maybe, which of course is much more overt in Fedra (which is fine, since it's playing the display part here)?  \nBut does that make any sense, or am I over-brainalyzing things?  \nMy eyes say it's good, they think, but I'm not sure.  \n.  \nIn any case, of the faces FB recommends as being \"compatible\" with Whitman, I only have a couple weights of ITC Franklin, and that looks a bit lazy/plump next to Whitman (& nothing against Franklin, I'm using it in a different book currently where it works great).  \n.  \nIn any case, Kent, if I haven't said it before, congratulations, and thanks – Whitman is truly a thing of beauty, and already a joy to work with! :-) \n",

      "content": "<cite>\"aren’t the ’tonal’ characteristics of fonts (such as voice, connotation) reducible to their structural characteristics (such as a similar ductus or stress angle)?\"</cite>\n\nI'd think the example in this thread (if it does work) disproves this (maybe depending on your definition of \"structural characteristics\").  \nIt seems like a classic approach to pair faces that share a similar historical lineage, stress angle, construction principle, overall proportions, stuff like that. Seen from that angle, I actually don't think that Whitman and Fedra are _very_ much alike; but for some reason (and I can only really hint at some similar \"attitude\", or _posture_ maybe if you think of them as humans) they still seem to relate to each other here.  \nIt drives me nuts, but I really can't pinpoint _why_ – I think I've reached the point where the way I can talk about what I'm doing gets all touchy-feely-mystical. :-\\\n\nIn any case, I agree with Stephen: There are so many variables that can provide the \"link\" between two typefaces, as long as the \"tone\" is right. Of course there are still pairings that don't work well. Many. Actually, this outlook makes it harder to combine fonts, if anything, because it's less about following a given recipe. (And having fewer \"hard rules\", as safety nets, makes it harder to trust one's eyes – which is probably also why I posted this here.)\n\n\\*\n\nAnyway, yes, I felt I wanted to give Whitman some extra leading, to give its extenders some room to well, extend. :-) It feels like a generous face and I don't want to squeeze it onto the page. And also because the measure might end up being a bit long.  \nBut all that hasn't really been carefully figured out yet – please see this thing above as a raw sketch of sorts.\n\n"

      "content": "Interesting, what makes you say «unexpected»? They are rather cursive in structure, yes – minus things like the «g»; and they retain angularity/rigidity in detail, which keeps them from being overly soft. Actually Whitman overall has some slightly «oldstyle»/bookish details that I find quite charming, like a slanting hyphen! But it's not affected – it's genuine, and I enjoy how it brings together these details with an overall fresh and clean feel.  \nBTW, for the record, the large type in the headings is Whitman Display.\n\nFedra's spacing: Dunno – like I said, I don't want to make it sound worse than it is.\n\n"
