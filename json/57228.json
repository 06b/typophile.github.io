Choose ‘Schoolhouse Set A (Zaner-Bloser style)’.\n\nThere are several free fonts of similar style: [Print Clearly](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503105539/http:/www.bvfonts.com/fonts/details.php?id=45) from BlueVinyl, or [Primer Print](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503105539/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/primer-print/) from [Ray Larabie](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503105539/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ray%252BLarabie).\n\n[Don’t use this at school!]\n\nF\n\n"
