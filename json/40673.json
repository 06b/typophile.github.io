  "content": "I am looking for an very modern sans serif with sharp edges. Not the an expert by any means with typeface jargon, but I'll try to explain.\n\nI am currently using Gotham from Hoefler & Frere-Jones, however the squared tops and bottoms on some of the letters does not flow well with the mark I designed. Along with a sample of Gotham (top image), I uploaded two that have more of these sharp points on the edges of all the letters. Notice specifically on the M, N, A, etc. that the points come to a much sharper edge. It also needs to look good in a heavier weight.\n\nCan you identify these or recommend any that are similar?\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141019142655im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gotham_5047.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141019142655im_/http:/typophile.com/files/8_halvors1_5306.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141019142655im_/http:/typophile.com/files/prognozy_6027.jpg)\n\n",
