As I have used GillSans troughout it (had to choose something from Bitstream basic set of fonts ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121438im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)( ) I figured, to keep it simple, I could use it in masthead as well. However, the planned name of the mag is 'Marta', and the rt combination in Gill is as bad as it can get. So I tried to improve it. Does it look convincing?   \n   \nBefore   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121438im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27786.jpg)   \n   \nAfter   \n   \nAnd just how one gets access to start a new thread in the Design section?\n\n",

I dont think you'll want a beak on the r. It just adds to the HUGE hole. Try the quick and dirty fix = move the ta combo left until the bottom of the terminal hits the stem of the t. I bet it will look decent.   \n   \nGenerally the tight letterspacing is tough to pull off when you have a really bad combo such as rt. Might work with the above ligature.   \n   \nCan you change the name to Mata? He he.   \nOh, you could also try a unicase R.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

Purchasing any new typefaces wasn't considered at all.   \n   \nHector, I really didn't want a beak on the r, as it makes it seem more like Manta (which has a completely different meaning in our language :D ).   \n   \nI need a very clear, clean, simple masthead, as the mag is targeted to an average medium-low income woman of 25-55, city AND country (hey, we have only about 1.5 mln women in total here (including newborn babies), have to grab what we can), so I can't use anything any of them would consider 'modern' or 'extreme' or 'repelling' or whatever. But I still want it to be well done.   \n   \nAnyway, I tried to follow Hrant's directions and here is what I came up with.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121438im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27978.jpg)   \n   \nI liked the serifs of the 'a', as without them the 'a' looked too 'futura' type geometric, so I decided to leave them. Also the old 'r' is back and the 't' is slashed to match the angle of the 'r' (mh.. still haven't learned the names of all those various letter parts ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121438im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif) ).   \n   \nThank you all for advice ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121438im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

Just the outside countour is shaky: bring the top&bottom apexes to the right - flatten out the curves.   \n   \nTwo more things:   \n- The \"M\" is still too dark.   \n- There's a huge gap between the \"r\" and \"t\". In a sans there's not too much you can do, but try: making the \"r\" narrower; and giving the whole more letterspacing.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
