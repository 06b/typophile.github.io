Also, are those notches taken out of   \nthe right feet on the Bold 'M' and 'N' and bottom of   \nthe 'V' or is it just the GIF file behaving poorly?   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "Ricardo, I really like this face a lot. It's as if \"Bauhaus\" were to grow up. (At least it's a more modern take on it).   \n   \nI have to agree with Stephen a bit here, that some of the letters are filling in--the caps A and M especially. It's starting to take on an over-inked quality, somewhat like FF Blur.   \n   \nIn both regular and bold it seems like the lc j is too thick, or perhaps it's the descender that's too curved. Or, perhaps I'm just extra sensitive to Js because I have one at the start of my name.   \n   \nGood luck,   \n   \njoe\n\n"

The reson that I prefereded included the old style figures on my Focus presentation was to broked the rigid and all linning visual references. On my original set I had inclued the linning figures, like you can see on this last images to exemplify the idea. Like I said on my explication introduction, this type face derive from other my project \"Van\", which I tryed to change the felling and give a new apperence to this typography (mix the old and modern abordage). All most my type faces Have linning figures on my principal set and normaly I   \nreserved old style figures to differents version. I add the exemples on a image to show you the other figures.   \nThank's for the questions and the encourage.   \n   \nBest regards / Ricardo   \n   \n ![Text Description](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414100041im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/423.jpg)\n\n"

Your pointing is not a problem and of course that I like answer to all kind of questions which give me other vision about this and other works. The reson of the differences betten old style and linnig are because I wanted use the rigid form on linnig figure ( 1 ) without bar.   \nThe version with old style figures I prefered used a bar to make a different contrast ( simulate serif) and because this typography starts from a tipical sans-serif and during the time I had been make corrections and change some points that are convencional in this kind of family. And of course that I admired this kind of apperence (with bar) which I had been thinkig to used on future projects on the linning set. Thank's and regards / Ricardo\n\n"
