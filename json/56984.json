      "content": "Hello Robert. I´m suspect to say that but I disagree with you. Off course this is not a typeface for a mass journal, when a rapid comprehension of the headine is the key. This kind of typeface is for specific audience and when I was designing Eklipse I have this in mind.\n\nMarcox, Quincunx, James thanks for the compliments. James, as you said is really difficult to create something new in this kind of style.\n\nBest,  \nRafael\n\n"
