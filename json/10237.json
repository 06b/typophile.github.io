There is a serif (like the sample ) and a sans in a variety of weights. I don't know who designed it.   \n   \nMarc's suggestion of FF Sheriff is an excellent one since the lowercase looks nearly identical. I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same designer.   \n   \nHere are samples:   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123808im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69475.jpg)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123808im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/69476.jpg)\n\n"
