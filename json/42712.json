  "content": "So, this is my first post ever. I hope I’m not breaking any rules. I’m sleepless! (I probably shouldn’t use that as an excuse in here! haha.)\n\nI’m preparing a small publication I’ve finished producing. It’s roughly 30 pages, 8.5”x7” (half-legal). It will be printed on 90# or + matte coil bound with heavier cover but still just matte. 8.5”x7” was selected because it’s consistent with my portfolio and it’s, I find, a pleasing feel and opens up to that wonderful rectangle of harmonic subdivision.\n\nI’m an artist (paint, clay, sketch, illustrator, anything)/architecture student and this will be sent, sort of, as a portfolio for internship/jobs as more research driven supplement to the portfolio. The book consists of research I’ve done on science/philosophy/algorithmic/morphogenetics in design.\n\nThe issue i’ve run into is that I have a TON of text that I’ve written. So much that it’s going to have to be trimmed down. Does anyone have suggestions or a resource they could point me to that would help with laying out a lot of type without overwhelming the reader. I’m under the impressions that too much type = non-reading. Not to mention, I think the subjects are fascinating but if the text isn’t dealt with properly it could make for a very unwieldy product! I don’t know that this content lends itself well to full page 3 columns.\n\nI’m using Avenir Next for the Headings and not sure about the textblocks yet. Any suggestions on a nice clean Serif? I have a love affair with Futura ND that I think I have to end. I don’t know that Futura really says what I want it to and I like the hybrid aspect of Avenir Next. I’ve been trying to figure out what font this is that I’ve attached. I love it. Whatthefont says Arena or Nofret but it’s neither of those. Similar but definitely different.\n\nMy style is very clean, tech, minimal, if you hadn’t guessed!\n\nThank you so much in advance! I’m gonna take a little nap and check back later on.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080304065410/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_43.jpg) | 8.19 KB |\n\n [‹ Fonts for children's books](http://web.archive.org/web/20080304065410/http:/typophile.com/node/42632 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Functional / 'Freight' display type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080304065410/http:/typophile.com/node/42700 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
