(Note: Your sample is letterspaced, the MyFonts test drive I linked to is not.)   \n   \nThe figures have the most clues in them, and none of the other characters in Berling contradict your sample. The one character that doesn't look quite right is the T, but I think your sample has some kind of double printing/registration problem which is obscuring some of the character shapes. The double printing also leads me to think this is actually a relatively light typeface like Berling.   \n   \nEverything seems to point to Berling, so that's my answer and I'm sticking with it.   \n   \n--Mark, wasting time down at the forensics lab again\n\n"
