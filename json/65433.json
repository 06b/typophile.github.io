  "content": "I claim to have a world record in type design in speed.\n\nWhen House Industries guys went about their Font Sprint in Vancouver, I promised I would trump their attempt of producing a working font in under 4 hours. They failed miserabily; they had upper and lower case letters, and most of the numerals.\n\nI promised that if ATypI ever came to Helsinki, I would make a whole font in that time.\n\nATypI did come to Helsinki, so I had to put my money where my mouth was, and since I was one of the organizers, I could. This is the result:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015214328im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Marathon_4566.png)\n  \nIt is ugly as hell, but it's a working Open Type font with 122 kerning pairs.\n\nI made a RoboFog-file with pre-demernied x-height, ascenders and descenders beforehand, but that was it. Everything else was made on site. From start to this pdf, it took me 3 hours 4 minutes.\n\nChallenge?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Marathon Sample.indd\\_.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015214328/http:/typophile.com/files/Marathon%20Sample.indd__0.pdf) | 21.98 KB |\n\n",

And so, with help of some amount of red wine, I promised them that if ATypI ever came to Helsinki, I would try to make a whole Latin 1 font in 4 hours.\n\nAnd look what happened.\n\nAnd I quess I was showing off. Sorry about that.\n\nBut then again, I made a full font in 3 hours and 4 minutes :·)\n\n"
