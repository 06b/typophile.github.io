Here is a top list of things Fog Does Better in the LETTER DRAWING phase of type design:\n\n1. End points connect like they know they are supposed to in Fog. In FL, they need to be no farther apart than the thickness of a flea’s pubic hair in order to get the points (connected).  \n2. FL bolding adds, sometimes dozens of, unwanted points. Fog = 0.  \n3. FL interpolation is practically useless for the same reason as #2, i.e. it does not understand matching points, the cleanup is more work that manual  \nInterpolation.  \n4. Fog is smart enough to know that when you have the pen tool, and you click on a contour, it should add a point to the contour, (you can draw all day long with Fogs pen without EVER changing tools). FL = special tool for the same simple function, change tool, change tool, change tool.  \n5. Fog’s metrics window knew that the baseline was not ness., in fact it’s a distraction to good spacing. FL Lets you know exactly where the baseline is in the metrics window whether you like it or not.  \n6. type an unoccupied character in Fog, it shows up blank. FL crashes 50% of the time, and otherwise misbehaves when you type the as yet defined.  \n7. Fog = Correct path direction. FL = Reverse all contours. The former just works, the latter, I don’t even know why they bother unless you’re supposed to delete every contour that is correct, “Reverse all contours” to correct the contour(s) that are wrong.  \n8. 15% of all zooms in FL’s glyph window fly to a minuscule and uneditable 12 point. Fog = 0% of all zooms are correct.  \n9. FL is seriously deranged about the differences between “copy”, “delete”, and “merge”. Fog’s got it 100% right. (In FL, I still have not figured out how to select more than one point and merge the contour around it...)  \n10. Fog has a tiny number of icons for all the tools you need, and every single one is useful every day. FL is Totally Nuts about tools and icons.\n\nThings on the other side of the ledger:  \n1. FL is pretty. Fog is not.  \n2. FL goes on, Fog does not.  \n:-)\n\n"

Which one’s better? The depends upon which one you like use best.\n\nPersonally, I was delighted to make the wholesale switch to FontLab in 2002, and I haven’t looked back since. I have had the chance to poke around with FogX, and was amused by the anachronism: made me want to thrown on some neon legwarmers and fire up the Flashdance soundtrack.\n\nAll of which to say: If you’re a devoted FogHat, you’ll be delighted to have the application ported and tweaked for use on OS X.

You can customize your UI in FontLab Studio 5 — just pick the icons you want, place them on one toolbar and forget about the rest.\n\nNick,\n\n\\> It hasn’t been easy for the tech-minded  \n\\> FontLab to accomodate the criticisms  \n\\> of diehard Fogoholics\n\nI never believed Fontlab Ltd. is as tech-minded as some people thought. I always thought of Yuri as a pretty good designer — that was way before I started working for the company. Yuri had drawn most of FontLab’s UI icons. While some may think there are too many of them, most of you will probably agree that the ones that are there pretty well illustrate the functionality of the various features. Even David agrees that FontLab is “pretty”. In his spare time, Yuri does a fair bit of video editing and altogether, he has quite some visual taste.\n\nOf course, the FontLab team is always learning. The original development of FontLab was influenced by Russian type designers who not only wanted to draw glyphs but needed to trick around various encodings and codepages. These were the days where nobody had heard of Unicode so FontLab came up with this sheer amount of various technical parameters — very useful for non-Western type designers but daunting for Americans :)\n\nThe product evolved. I can only attest that the FontLab team was always very responsive to suggestions and “accomodating criticisms”. I bought FontLab 3.00C on March 17, 1998. I sent an e-mail “FontLab 3.0 — first impression” to Yuri Yarmola on March 27, 1998. I received a reply from him on the same day. His reply was: “Thank you for your messages. It seems that I have some work to do on the weekend... I will analyze all bug reports and suggestions you’ve made and will try to fix some of the problems in 3.00D release.” On May 6, 1998, I received a beta version of FontLab 3.00D from Yuri. Most of the problems that I had reported 5 weeks earlier were fixed, and some improvement suggestions were also implemented.\n\nSometimes it took patience, time spent on detailed descriptions of intended functionality, making mockup screenshots. But my experience was: the more time you spend as a user to provide detailed feedback regarding functionality issues, the easier it is for the developers to accomodate for. As Yuri said on several occasions when talking about FontLab Studio 5, 90% of the improvements in this version were a result of ideas brought in by users.\n\nI can admit that very early on, the FontLab team had a sense of “idea competition” against Fontographer. The developers didn’t want to just copy the UI or solutions from Fontographer 1:1 but were looking for their own — potentially better — solutions. But after the FontLab product assumed an identity of its own and the company didn’t face the danger of it being dubbed “the cheap Fontographer knock-off”, the developers could become friends with the idea of actually borrowing some solutions from FOG.\n\nThis year, we have acquired Fontographer from Macromedia. So now, we not only can “imitate the look and feel” but we can actually physically bring together both products including the programming code.\n\nFontlab Ltd. brought out the FogLamp product that converts .fog to .vfb just two months after laying the hands on the Fontographer source code. It may be a little gimmick, but technologically, it proves that the merger is possible.\n\nThe long-year Fontographer tech support lead Jim Gallagher joined the Fontlab Ltd. team in a similar capacity. We plan to continue the development of Fontographer in 2006, and we are gathering the ideas for the product. Please send your feedback at fogideas at fontlab dot com. We’re listening.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

As relatively new to FontLab, I love its power but don’t appreciate its “choose your own adventure” approach to menus, where the learner of the program has little clue to what does what. I much prefer the InDesign approach, where you can blow up menus and put them on a second screen. Then the icons are big and detailed enough that you can tell what the hell they mean, or there is text right on the button to tell you.\n\nCome to think of it, it would be excellent if the menu items had both an ’expanded’ and a ’compact’ mode. Then you could expand to get details of what does what. I see on Typophile that even very experienced users of FontLab hear about a useful feature that they didn’t know about. This means that the interface could be a great deal improved as far as being learner-friendly or learner-accessible.\n\n"

Also, all key commands can be monkeyed with using Tools/Customize Keyboard... You can even change standard commands. (David will like this too.) My personal additions are: Control-arrows to flop shapes horizontally and vertically; Control-O for the OpenType panel; Control-Shift-O for OpenType Preview panel; Control-S for Generate Font; Control-R for Reverse Contours.\n\nThe only problem with the Customize Keyboard window is that it’s not immediately clear how to use it. First, find the command you want to add a key command for. Select it. Then select the “Press new shortcut key” field. Press your desired key combo. If it is already assigned, you will be told; if it is available, it will say “Assigned to: Unassigned”. Then click the little check box. Voila!

In FontLab Studio 5, it’s easy to shape your user interface the way you want it and then export these settings into a file. We’ll be collecting these files and then — if you give permission — we’ll just bundle these presets with the next version of FontLab Studio.

The “foreground” or “outline layer is usually reserved for that which is to be made into the contours of the output font. Layers were created to keep guidelines and other junk out of the way of the drawing process. What is this red guideline on the outline layer for?\n\n2. Sometimes, I want to have one off curve point twixt two on curve points. Some people may not, but the option is technically legal. If I select and delete one of the two-off-curve points between two on curve points the other off-curve point is deleted too. Why?\n\n3. If I open a new font, where do the bitmap images of Times come from? What layer are they on? Same thing when I paste an eps. Where does it go? I see it, but I can’t move it. The initial Times bitmaps disappear when I “activate” that glyph’s cell. Where do they go?\n\n4. There is a selection option that puts a “Framework” around the contour(s) I’ve selected. This framework seems to allow the same things as regular scaling, and maybe something else but I don’t know. If I never ever want this kind of selection to occur, how do I avoid it entirely and forever?\n\n5. The points are too small. Did I mention that, or did someone else? Do these have to be original to all threads or can I repeat them cross-thread? ;)\n\n6. Fetch me a component: “select a Component Glyph” The options to finish the job of finding a component from my typed input are: “begins with”, “ends with”, “equal to”, “Less than” and “greater than”. Does “Contains” fit into the “Less Than” category? What would be an example of something you’d type that’d be “greater than” what you found? Am I in a Seinfeld episode?\n\n7. Double points on top of each other, as in a start and finish point in the same location, were passé when Ikarus did it. If my understanding of this is correct, and I’ve gotten used to one point for both start and end since 1983, the beginning/end of contour Should behave exactly the same as any other point on the contour. Possible?\n\n8. By default, objects from other layers should not be selectable. E.G the Metrics plain allows the wand tool. Select nearest contour...then what?\n\n9. Back at that pesky pen tool: when I input a point, and then “depress the shift key” while inputting another point, I expect to form the nearest straight line, or 45 degree angle from the first input point, to the current input point. This is the standard interface for all Bezier drawing programs except the one I use, FontLab 4.6 for the Mac. Why?\n\n10. Input, should always become the selection, Shouldn’t it? I.E. If I have a contour selected, and I grab the exacto blade tool, (even though it’ll be gone soon, maybe), and I insert a point on that selected contour, the point I just inserted should become the selection, and the contour that was selected should not. No?\n\n"

And it’s interesting that PCs are the creatives’ choice in Eastern Europe, topsy-turvy, ennit?\n\nBut I think FontLab has been (and continues to be) somewhat blind to the cultural reality in a large section of its marketplace — the community of Mac-based, Fontographer-using type designers.\n\nIf FontLab is to shake its reputation as a techie’s production tool, rather than a creative’s design tool, it could start by holding off on the release of new versions until the Mac developers have finished, and release both PC and Mac versions at the same time.\n\nNote that I am talking about it’s reputation.\n\nHaving said that, change is always difficult. Going from System 6 to System 7 was nasty. Going from Photoshop 5 to 6 (somewhere around there) involved a lot of mental re-programming. And so does going from Fog 1994 to Flab 2004.\n\nSorting out how which of Flab’s features can be customized so that they are like Fog’s from which Fog features Flab doesn’t have is a job of work. I note that there are both kinds on DB’s latest list. It really does drive one up the wall trying to figure out how to customize a certain feature, only to realize it’s not possible.\n\nThat’s why this thread is useful. In fact, it would be helpful to have a chart of comparable Fog vs. Flab features, showing how to achieve a Fog feature in Flab, or whether it’s possible. Sort of like Adobe’s “inDesign Conversion Guide” booklet for switching from Quark XPress.\n\nMy two biggest “wishes’ for Flab:\n\n1. Constrain paths to x/y axis with shift key (as per DB #9)  \n2. An “expand stroke” feature that works as beautifully as Fog’s.\n\nOther than that, I’m plodding along, getting a smidgeon more comfortable with Flab every day.\n\n"

      "content": "Fontographer 4.7 for OS X is not very different from 4.1 for OS 9 Classic. I have tried it in the demo form, and find two things wrong. Firstly, the guidelines are black not the grey in 4.1. or green in FL. Second, templates of scanned images placed are also black, not grey as in 4.1. In FontLab the template images are in grey, so why not in Fontographer? Why not have guides in another color in Fontographer as in FontLab? I will most likely be getting FL in the near future along with Scanfont. I’ve used, and continue to use Fontographer as well as TypeTool 2. I’d like to use Fontog in OS X but can’t see it until these problems are corrected. Also don’t like anti-aliasing turned off - can it be turned on from the menu? Type Tool and FL are at least nice to look at. Any ideas?\n\n"

The procedures used to display glyph images in Fontographer are the same developed back in the 1990s at Macromedia, and they’re entirely different from what you see in the “FontLab family” of products, that is AsiaFont Studio, FontLab Studio, FontLab 4.6 and TypeTool 2 — which are all related.\n\nAs we stated numerous times, the goal of Fontographer 4.7 was to make the existing Fontographer Mac OS X-compatible. A few crucial bugfixes were made and the user interface was slightly refereshed but largely, it is the same editor — with all its pros and contras.\n\nWe do have plans to release Fontographer 5 in future which will include functional changes and improvements, and we’re gathering feeback for that (see [http://www.fontlab.com/Fontographer/Fontographer/Fontographer-Support-an...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080719172654/http:/www.fontlab.com/Fontographer/Fontographer/Fontographer-Support-and-Future/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/Fontographer/Fontographer/Fontographer-Support-and-Future/\") ). If you want antialiasing, please suggest it there.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
