Chennai Slab is a simplified slab serif with over sixty OpenType alternates. These alternates include alternates for the ball terminals, unique simplified alternates and more traditional capital forms. Use Chennai Slab when you need a fun and versatile slab serif. The sans-serif Chennai makes a great complement. Six weights are available.\n\n[Sample .pdf, 13 Pgs.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014072621/http:/new.myfonts.com/artwork?id=32257&subdir=original)\n\n",
