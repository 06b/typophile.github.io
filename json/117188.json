Such design is characteristic for the Ukrainian style. The drawing of the font is based on the sketches of a famous Ukrainian graphic artist of early 20th century Heorhiy Narbut. His work set the whole school in the Ukrainian graphic art and is still very influential nowadays. The font is capital and also includes a set of ornaments in addition the standard set of symbols.\n\nBuy on [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/kalyna/)\n\n[![Kalyna_1440x720_03](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620im_/https:/farm3.staticflickr.com/2928/14395998542_86c28b88f5_z.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620/https:/www.flickr.com/photos/turetsky-lukyan/14395998542 \"Kalyna\\_1440x720\\_03 by Lukyan Turetsky, on Flickr\")\n\n[![Kalyna_1440x720_04](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620im_/https:/farm3.staticflickr.com/2905/14210913507_ecb1a1b41a_z.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620/https:/www.flickr.com/photos/turetsky-lukyan/14210913507 \"Kalyna\\_1440x720\\_04 by Lukyan Turetsky, on Flickr\")\n\n[![Kalyna_1440x720_05](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620im_/https:/farm6.staticflickr.com/5278/14210713899_170f14483e_z.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424032620/https:/www.flickr.com/photos/turetsky-lukyan/14210713899 \"Kalyna\\_1440x720\\_05 by Lukyan Turetsky, on Flickr\")\n\n<iframe width=\"525\" height=\"742\" src=\"/web/20150424032620if_/http://e.issuu.com/embed.html#3780365/8215105\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n",
