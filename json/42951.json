  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI’m looking for a roman capital “Q”, that would be a very light grey, and large, against a white background on a question-answer page of a website (The left part and part of the top left of the letterform would be off-screen). Black type (Helvetica Neue Cond at about 28pt) would be in the forefront as a question, with smaller supporting body copy below.\n\nAny recommendations of an attractive non-sans “Q” that you might find particularly extraordinary?\n\nThanks.\n\nAndrew\n\n [‹ Help!
