  "content": "Eben's thread on [ligatures & readability](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015013554/http:/typophile.com/node/28777) got me to thinking. It seems (correct me if I'm wrong) that there is little reliable research on the mechanics of reading and hardly anything exhaustive. My question is what is needed to provide such research (besides money)? I'm thinking a custom built suite of typefaces that allows researchers to isolate particular variables as best as possible. And of course reading environment is a factor. What environments should reading be tested in? What are the questions that need to be addressed? But before putting the cart before the horse, i guess i should go back to: what are the proposed goals of reading research? what are the pressing issues that need to be covered? why do we need research on reading? A lot of questions, hopefully we can get some answers here (and i'm sure a whole other set of questions...) In short, I guess i'm wanting to hear your proposals about the aims and methods of a reading research regimen.\n\n",

Kevin Larson said in a recent post that he thinks the longest delay in reading is the comprehension part. My question is, how do we know when saccades are duplicated or regression occurs if this is due to inability to decipher the letterforms and words (reading) or an inability to understand what the author is trying to say. I hope Kevin can clarify what he said because I may not have gotten it right.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Stuff that seems obvious to typographers and type designers it seems is difficult to test for. So what is needed are measures in addition to reading speed, which will more readily and sharply discriminate better and worse readability. I have proposed a measure of reading comfort: how fast comprehension decreases with time. Kevin says he is proposing another new measure--I guess in the new Typo article. What is it?\n\nAnother way of improving testing besides new measures is to make better use of marginal readers, such as those learning to read, and those with reading difficulties, or 'dyslexia', and compare these to expert readers. Here what is important is to have good theories of the learning-to-read process and of kinds of reading difficulties. That will help define good tests. The variations in good and bad type may be magnified for these marginal readers, though the relationships may be complex and not straightforward.\n\nAs to what to test, some factors that come to mind are:\n\n1. Type size--as defined by x height. 2. Weight--percentage of black to white 3. Serifs--presence or absence. 4. Extenders--effect of various heights. 5. Leading--amount of leading at a given x-height (and influence of serifs, extenders). 6. Letter spacing--amount, evenness. 7. Measure or line length. 8. Counter size--and ratio of counter size to spacing. 9 Word spacing 10. How these factors vary with optical size.\n\nThese all interact, so you would also have to test for combinations.\n\n"

The idea here would be to develop an understanding of the perceptual and neuro-physical mechanics of reading that is detailed enough to make plain why the things that typographers and type designers _know_ are critical or worth attending to, _are_ indeed critical and worth attending to, like spacing.\n\nCurrently the _perceptual_ mechanics of reading are massively under explored by students of reading and reading problems. And currently pivotal dimensions of processing (like, for instance, lateral interference) are not well integrated into the picture. A good deal is known about perceptual mechanics, neural behaviour in the multi-layered visual cortex, perceptual learning and object recognition that _hasn't_ been effectively applied and tested in the domain of what I call 'visual wordform resolution'. The Design / Typography School umbrella would gaurantee the data currently available is (re)viewed with eyes sensitized by typographical craft knowledge, and that the tests are designed in a way that reflects expert knowledge of the stimulus material and trenchant intuitions about their functioning in conditions of use. Eyes sensitized by typographical craft wisdom might predispose the researcher to introduce relevant but overlooked perspectives that integrate a greater range of observations and in doing this redirect the field.\n\nSo there is a benefit to the typographical community _and_ to the field of reading research.\n\n"

William, nice list!\n\nHere are some more possible variables\n\n- paper & ink combinations ( how is that for exponential factors? - actually there aught to be a way of contrasting things without going too crazy )  \n- Serif shape  \n- contrast with ground/paper  \n- Reverse color ( white on black )\n\nNick had some solid ideas about this ina thread I connot seem to dig up now. Anybody else know where it is?\n\nUltimately though I do think that there is some purpose ( efficency if nothing else) in doing tests which are designed to see what kind of meta theory might be best at describing the mechanisms at work in reading. It seems to me that david berlow said something to the effect that whatever theory is used to desribe what happens in reading latin characters had better have some way of dealing with arabic & chinese too or it was going to be sub-standard. I tend to agree. ( ...If that's an acceptable paraphrasing and my memory isn't fooling me utterly that is.) I would for instance, like it very much if some of Peter's theories could be tested.\n\nUltimately what I am personally curious about is if small subtle contextual variations in lettershape and spacing might be helpful. Erik Van Blockland made a typeface that varied randomly called Kosmik. Of course because Kosmic is psudorandom or even super-random in that it avoids the sameness that randomizing can produce. So.... it \\*is\\* contextual. But the contextual I am interested in is variation to be sure but based on attempting to get better Notan & letter relationship rather than variation for it's own sake. Sometime soon I will start a thread about this again. I am assembling lots of bits & pieces at the moment! All of this is to say I would like this idea tested one day too.\n\nBut what has intrigued me most about this thread is not the pure theory or the atomization of type factors - it's the ideas people have had about alternatives to pure speed for measuring type success. In my view, that question is probably the richest vein to be mined of all.\n\nLuca(as) where are you?\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Is there a problem with reading? Maybe there isn’t?\n\nThat is a really good question, Chris. I think the answer is that sometimes we know there is a problem.\n\nFor example a friend of mine was talking about the requirements for grant proposals for NSF. They are required to be a single column of 10 point Times New Roman, single spaced on letter sized paper. This makes the measure way too long, and my friend was saying that it really makes ploughing through piles of grant applications a chore for the reviewers.\n\nAnother example I think are screen fonts, which in that low resolution environment are fatiguing enough that most people don't want to read extended text--only read text in snippets.\n\nSo we know there is a range of more and less readable text. Now you can reasonably question is whether it is possible to improve on the best typefaces--such as Baskerville, Garamond, etc.--set at a size, measure and spacing we know are excellent. Maybe the limits are difficulties of comprehension, as you say, and not of perceptual processing.\n\nPersonally, I think there may be only small improvements in readability possible in typeface design, though I think these are possible. The main thing for text design about knowing scientifically what is better and worse is that it would give guidance so the new design would be at least as good as the best out there now. And maybe slightly better.\n\nBut the benefits could be great in other areas. For example if the scientific testing showed that long measures were bad, the NSF wouldn't specify them. Forms would not have type too small or crowded. And screen manufacturers and font designers would know what realistically to shoot for.\n\nBut the fruits of research will be more marked in other areas. first of all in lay-out, if we knew how type size, based on x height, and leading relates to ideal line length, it would help avoid blunders in in newsletters, magazines, newspapers, the internet, etc. And similarly for many other variables.\n\nIn addition, there may be benefits for teaching reading and helping dyslexics--we don't know.\n\nOver all the justification for research into perceptual processing in reading is what Benjamin Franklin said. When asked of what use were his electrical researches--which then yielded only amusing gadgets, he said: \"Of what use is a new born baby?\" Of course later he invented the lightning rod, and then our whole modern economy became based on electricity. Reading research is still in the 'newborn baby' stage, I think. But there is plenty of reason to hope for helpful results.\n\n"

But it is over the length of a book, or the inadequancy of lighting, etc. that this small amount can make or break things, or at the very least improve one's life a bit. In fact it's not really about finishing that long book an hour or two earlier, it's about quality of life. And this is the sort of thing that tends to escape formal science, often leading its practitioners to become detached from people at large, and thus being dismissed by them. To me, a good scientist is first of all a wise person.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I just wonder if we truly know what we are measuring. We know there are eye movements; we know the quantity and type of movement can vary. I have yet to see how this is extrapolated into a better or worse reading experience though and if so, how much better ot worse?\n\nLine length (based on character count) has long been known to affect reading. This is not something the type designer can control, only the typesetter/user--in William's scenario, perhaps the czar who decrees the oversized measure :-) Tinker's testing, the testing from the Royal College, and every other one I know has shown the long line length to be a killer of reader comfort. Strange that the NSF Grants Czar does not believe in research.\n\nI think we need 2 sets of variables to test. One set would be aimed at the design of type. The other set would be aimed at the configuration of type on a page or screen. The target in one case is a type designer and the other is a graphic designer.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Are you saying that such research might have oblique relevance to type design or no relevance to type design whatsoever?

So far, they have failed.  \nThe technology used by Stradaveri was knocking on wood—literally. He would carve a basic shape with simple hand tools and knock on the wood in various places, listening for that certain sound that his ears could recognize as \"correct\". He would carve and knock, carve and knock at his slab of wood until it was right. Scans and X-rays instruments reveal that no two are alike in modulation of thickness. The assumption is that each piece of wood needed its own variation in thickness to resonate sound properly. Stradaveri used his ears and knuckles in the same way that punch cutters used their eyes and smoke tests. Tinker a bit then look then tinker some more. The human mind and senses are just incredible. Sometimes we might just have to say, in this hi-tech world, that humans have abilities which are not reproducible by machine and this is \"OK\"!  \nShould scientists close up shop? Absolutely not!

This suggests a hunt for \"the one true font\". Yuck-that explains some of the designer resistince. There are a lot of other factors we all might be intersted in. Do certian existing fonts lend themselves to increased comprehension of exact data? Of overall comprehension and recall? People often visualize words to recall spellings, dates, etc. What fonts do the mind use? Are there fonts that purposely slow down reading speed and does that have a use? Is kerning simply aesthetic, or can it alternate kerning profiles predictably change the meaning of a message?\n\nDo people learn to write foreign laguages better in certain typefaces? Can they? Some faces are inappropriate for body text, while similar ones are great. Is there exact calculatable figure predicting where the change is?\n\nThen there is the idea of letterforms themselves. Would a font where each letter contextually joined to the \"starting spot\" of the next letter help? Arrowed serifs, non-baseline oriented fonts? These all sound like wacky ideas, but without numbers to confirm that we run on gut.\n\nThere are dozens more of ideas, and new ones will spawn from research.

He just \"played it by ear\", quite literally.\n\nFirst of all, I would remark that his method (according to you -- I don't really know anything about Stradivari) is used even in computer science. Some problems, particularly complex systems ( [http://typophile.com/node/28777/164470](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015013554/http:/typophile.com/node/28777/164470 \"http://typophile.com/node/28777/164470\")), have so many variables that they cannot be solved by means of equations -- or at least not without ridiculous amounts of time and processing power. Or the variables may be known, but exactly how they interact (i.e. the equations) is not known.\n\nIn such cases, solutions may be worked out by trial and error: knock, carve, knock. For instance, when the equations used by a certain encryption method are very complex and too many variables (such as the original characters) are unknown, the computer may try to crack a password by attempting different combinations sequentially.\n\nAnother approach in computer science is to use [swarms of \"intelligent\" agents](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015013554/http:/www.cs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima1e/chapter02.pdf): each agent, which in a way represents a variable in a complex system, is programmed to behave in a certain way; the agents are left to fend for themselves, and the results are recorded.\n\nThe reason, then, that almost no things human -- such as reading -- can be solved or controlled through \"pure science\" is because there are too many variables and equations, many of them unknown. What the master craftsman does is use his experience -- those missing variables and equations -- and the trial-and-error methodology to create solutions. This is a task that can probably never be accomplished through \"pure science\", simply because all the variables and equations known by all master craftsmen (and women) will probably never be recorded and codified in a usable way.\n\nHowever, the knowledge and experience of the master craftsman has limitations, in the sense that those variables and equations in his brain are specific to his culture, habits etc. While scientific research is no substitute for the master craftsman and woman, it can certainly help them make better decisions and judgements, and even try different solutions that go against their personal beliefs.\n\nIs this more or less what you were saying?\n\n"

As you insist, there are many things that can't be effectively quantified (comprehension; gestural atmospheric import; readability), but you can gauge--sometimes numerically--some of their manifestations, or some of their determinants. The manifestations have to be indicative of something, so we abstract and study possible determinants.\n\nEben, I think plain old reading speed is too crude a metric for gauging the effects of manipulating typographical micro-variables, even it over the space of a large text read in one sitting my manipulation reduces the time it takes to get through the passage. I have no way of telling whether all the other possible things that contribute to reading speed have been controlled. The types of tests I'm trying to get a bead on involve fourier transforms, gauging the advantage to speed of recognition of various kinds of 'priming', assessing the impact of various manipulations on the magnitude of the Word Superiority Effect, ideal observer modeling of neuromechanical flow-through where lateral interference is represented and slot processing is allowed or prohibited.\n\nThe best measures of typographical success are probably anecdotal.

Improved type design and paragraph layout work to improve the word recognition process, and easy word recognition is beneficial no matter what the content. If you were interested in organizational factors like providing good headings, then this is certainly more relevant to the more challenging text.\n\nIn practice it’s difficult to find appropriate content difficulty. If you use content that is too challenging (i.e. having an expert in literature read a physics textbook) then you’ll find that the time to read will increase dramatically, and reading speed differences will be determined more by the number of times a person needed to reread long passages than by any typographic differences. If content is too easy (i.e. having a professor of physics read a high school physics textbook) then the reader is likely to scan the text rather than truly read it.\n\nAnother challenge is that reading performance differs from person to person, so I prefer to have the same person read text from each of the typographic conditions being examined. This means that more than one sample of content is necessary, and it’s desirable to have them of equal difficulty so it doesn’t impact the results (though counterbalancing the passages reduced this problem).\n\nEvery study is open to criticism, so I think it’s best to do something that’s good enough and document what you did.\n\nCheers, Kevin\n\n"

Like you and William, I feel the need for collaboration between science and craft (and whatever you would call human abilities to interpret, solve, and create). I do feel there is a danger from both the arenas though. Humans interpret data; humans set up testing procedures; humans define criteria and devise theories to prove or disprove. All of these things can involve human error and provide a sense of being \"correct\" just because it was science. The other side is human hubris and self assurance that \"it is my art, therefore it must be great\". Neither art nor science should be accepted without question. We always need to be humble enough to listen to other voices even if what we hear does not fit our own theory or our own ego.\n\nPeter,  \nI much like your model! You at least seem to have included the meat of the issues. The dilemma is sorting out the interaction of effects. If I say reading is a function of all of your variables, I still have the hard job of measuring how they interact. I might look at one variable sometimes a\\nd the cumulative effect of all of them at other times. Making the quantum leap to what to extrapolate from it is the devil of it all. I still don't see how we can remove deriving meaning from the act of perception of forms and decoding signs.  \nChrisL\n\n"

I hope Kevin can clarify what he said because I may not have gotten it right.”\n\nThere is a lot of ongoing research investigating the cause of saccades, including developing models trying to predict when they are going to occur. Some regressive saccades are caused by content problems. For example, if I read “The horse raced past the barn fell”, I can guarantee a regressive saccade after reading the word fell. It’s less likely to happen if I write “The horse that was raced past the barn fell” and even less likely if I precede it with a story about two horses that were raced down different paths, one near a barn. Other regressive saccades are likely caused by word level problems. In some of our eye tracking studies looking at ClearType versus b/w rendering we have seen reductions in regressive saccades indicating that letter quality can improve the mechanics of reading.\n\nCheers, Kevin\n\n"

However, what I am thinking of is a threshold kind of effect may be operating. I had suggested that one might measure reading comfort (actually discomfort) by decline in comprehension with time. My suspicion is that what John Hudson calls 'readerability' can compensate a for a lot of less than optimal conditions by an increased investment of mental effort.\n\nThus less than optimal type design or layout would barely show up or not at all in a short test--it would be wiped out by increased mental effort of the subject. But if the person were pushed by reading relatively difficult content for a longer period, then you would see a sharp decline of comprehension--and perhaps speed as well--at markedly different times for better and worse conditions, when mental fatigue set in.\n\nDo you see what I am getting at Kevin?
