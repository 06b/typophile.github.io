Look at the ’h’ right at that point: The thin horizontal line grows into the vertical stem in a smooth curve, identical to the curves in the ’m’. But it should not be a curve, it should be a 90 degree corner, to facilitate the identification of the ’h’.\n\nAt least, \\*I\\* had this problem ... have you tested this design (ie showed it to friends and family) and asked them what they see?\n\nSome may see ’hm’  \nSome may see ’lm’  \nSome may see ’hi’  \nSome may just see Mother Penguin and her two children.\n\nMaybe you should try other fonts, other ideas as well. Stick to the ’feeling’ that the Orlando Bloom type design gave you, while you try other variations.\n\nHey - great photo of OB ... all of a sudden, he looks interesting ;-)\n\n"

It looks like two people holding hands.\n\nI’d prefer it to say HMLP but its more harmonious looking was HML. Now with some revision and collaboration with this graphic designer we’ve reduced the visual content of the form to just HM. I chose lowercase because I liked the repetition of the negative space (in the previous logo).\n\n"

The name is kind of long.\n\nNo problem, I got married a month ago and used a wedding photographer (incidentally the company name was longer than yours). It’s just that initals, to me, seem corporate and not particularly welcoming, whereas your company name is very unusual, (verging on cute) and gives a friendlier appearance and it’s a real shame not to use it. That’s my reasoning, at any rate.\n\n"

My client is already well established so I listened to their requirements and as I had guessed the requirements called for legible, slightly innovative lettering with a strong connection between letterforms. We will be exploring ligatures, unicase, etc...  \nYour work was classic looking when you started but lacked recognition of the characters. The new version is slightly more legible but is now bulky, which from what I have seen in the competitive field of wedding photography does not associate with the subject matter you specialize in.\n\nI would be a bit careful with following Henry’s advice. I don’t completely disagree but think it is a bit of a dangerous path.\n\nI think David’s second design is simple and very nice.\n\n"
