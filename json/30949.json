Way back in the day, before digital type, Dan Solo's company created custom display type to customer's specifications. They would also take off time every year to travel the world and add to their collection, which is massive. Several years ago Dover published a catalog of their specimens. It's worth the 10 or 20 bucks to get one. Thankfully they started digitizing their specimens a few years ago. They may have the exact font you are looking for. There was a link on their MyFonts page that was very close:\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/quadrille-2](http://web.archive.org/web/20141224232534/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/quadrille-2 \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/quadrille-2\")\n\nTo get that distressed/aged look, I tweak the outlines in Illustrator and then grunge it in Photoshop, sometimes using filters like Machine Wash.\n\n"
