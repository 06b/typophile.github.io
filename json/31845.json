However, one should mention that the layout of the «Suhrkamp» series, done by legendary designer Willy Fleckhaus, is one of the most famous German book designs ever. Unfortunately, since a couple of years, they have changed and distorted the original look.\n\nIf you can read German, there are plenty of articles on Fleckhaus, «Germany’s first Art Director», and «Suhrkamp»—even a whole book on the designer:\n\nMichael Koetzle, Carsten M. Wolff (Hrsg.)  \nFleckhaus. Deutschlands erster Art Director  \nVerlag Klinkhardt & Biermann, 2000\n\nAnd I am sure that someone will soon identify the font.\n\n"
