You know, like Dawn Castle/Dom Casual. I'm sure I've seen it elsewhere under some other name, but I can't remember what it was.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

That little curly foot on the cap A looks so familiar. You know when one character just jumps out? I just can't link the context.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for your help.\n\n"
