They want the sign to display their new logo but...the only artwork they provided me with is a business card, and a scan of a t-shirt. No vectors, no .ttf file/name of typeface used in the logo (big shock, right?).\n\nAnyway, I've never seen this typeface before and I've searched for hours on the web and- no luck.\n\nplease help me out here, guys! Someone here knows... :o\n\nHere are the bitmaps from the scanned t-shirt and the scanned business card:\n\n[B&W logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20130302230039/http:/i39.photobucket.com/albums/e197/omgwtfpixplz/Work/FRISCHHERTZ_scan1BW_sized.jpg)\n\n[color logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20130302230039/http:/i39.photobucket.com/albums/e197/omgwtfpixplz/Work/FRISCH_SCANcolor1.jpg)\n\nThis is their website address: [http://www.frischhertz.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130302230039/http:/www.frischhertz.com/ \"http://www.frischhertz.com/\")\n\nthanks,  \nAmanda\n\nSend suggestions/files to:  \n [cellardoor504@gmail.com](mailto:cellardoor504@gmail.com) OR [pr3ciousroy@mac.com](mailto:pr3ciousroy@mac.com)\n\n",

      "content": "If you want another opnion, I agree with Jan -- this looks like it is hand-drawn. The 's' seems too large, and the h's seem not to be exactly identical. The 'r' is an odd style, and I found very few scripts with a printed-but-connected letterform such as this. The original version of Signal had a similar 'r' (shown in the Jaspert 'Encyclopaedia of Type Faces'), but the Berthold digital version of [Signal](http://web.archive.org/web/20130302230039/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/signal-bq/) does not. In fact, the only script I could find with this sort of 'r' is [Roman Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20130302230039/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roman-script/), and it is a vertical script, with no other resemblance to this sample.\n\nThe 'F' is not like any other script F I can recall.\n\nThe two most similar fonts I found to the look of this sample, and it's just my viewpoint, are Mandate (a.k.a. [Freehand 521](http://web.archive.org/)) and [Monoline Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20130302230039/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/monoline-script/).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Mike-\n\nMy initial reaction to this 'font' was exactly the same as you described above ^^^.  \nOnly conclusion I didn't come to was that it was probably hand drawn and thus not an actual typeface at all. I think you're right. The letters just don't make sense otherwise.\n\nWell, now I know I can stop wasting time searching for a non-exsistant font, and begin the ever so tedious character tracing. My hand will be cramped up after work today, that's for sure. sigh\n\nThanks for the advice, guys!  \nvery helpful!\n\n-Amanda\n\n"
