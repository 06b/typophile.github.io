I also did more weight and contrast adjustment and changed top of f.--see pdf 7 below.  \nHere is version 6 added back a touch of contrast and fattened right bowl of g, see pdf 6 below.  \nHere is version 5 very slightly heavier serifs and some more smoothing, see pdf 5 below  \nHere is version 4 very slightly condensed and smoothed and lining figures added, see pdf 4 below  \nHere is version 3 with contrast rteduced a bit more, see pdf 3 below  \nHere is version 2 with less contrast, see PDF below.  \nHere is my first cut at the normal weight of Froggy.

      "content": "Chris, I personally don't think it's a matter of display vs text, but what your suits your design best.\n\nI just checked the print-out, and in the smaller size the higher contrast is not as noticeable. But I think this is because of the toner spread, which has percentage wise more of an effect in small size.\n\nI think you might look at the contrasts in Souvenir, and how that has been handled. Your Froggy is a crisper version of the kind of thing that Souvenir and Cooper Black do.\n\nI read in Mac McGrew's book that Benton drew only the medium weight, and Benguiat added the light and popular heavy weights. I don't find the light weight of Souvenir very satisfactory, but the medium and heavy are very good.\n\nOn the joins vs other parts, as you know from my TypeCon talk about my Caslon revival, I think that the joins have a different visual logic than other parts, and one can thin the joins more than the rest, as Unger has done in his faces.\n\nAnd yes, your o is better. But I think also the joins need to get fatter, quicker longer coming out of the stems if that makes sense. That is if you want a very thin join. Also where the thin line coming into the thick line has more space, as in the e, it needs to be more like the top of the o and e, I think. You will need to proof this actually on a high resolution image-setter to get an accurate concept of the effect in small sizes.\n\nSomehow I feel that because your design is quite wide, and the joins are relatively low, you don't really need a sharp join. The top of the mnr will still look clearly separate--particularly with your semi-serif action.\n\nAlso I suspect that a light weight just won't work, as Benguiat's light Souvenir flops, where his heavy is a big winner.\n\nBy the way, I know some people hate Souvenir, but they are wrong. My local library uses it on all signs, and it works great. It projects a friendly, welcoming image, while being very readable and disciplined. Your version is more hip and more crisp, but in the same space emotionally, with its warmth and touch of informality.\n\n"

The medium may work fine with a more uniform branch, so the branch doesn't come to a 'point' when it joins the stem. This is the way Souvenir medium is--not pointed.\n\nOh, here's the link to [The Word Express](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019223523/http:/www.wordexpress.com/), where you can get your stuff proofed for reasonable price.

But it might well hurt it as well.

I think you were right to add more contrast back. I suspect Andre is right about about the g--good catch. I can see what is really tricky here is that changing the weight changes the counters and/or the outside, and you can't preserve both.
