  "content": "hello all,  \nI am designing a logo for a local barbershop quartet organization called 13th Colony Sound. It is an organization of mainly retired gentlemen that get together and perform.\n\nWith the logo, from what I understand, they want to capture the feeling of barbershop quartet as well as their southern \"Savannah\" location. The first I feel has been not to hard to capture. But with the Savannah feeling, I've tried to be a bit more subtle, using a Clarendon for the mustache and modified Clarendon for the nose, giving it that old-timey southern feeling. I want the logo to be fun, avoid the impulse of using a barbers pole, but reference the barbershop with the slicked over hair. I think the 13 should read as a nose and mustache first, and the number 13 second.\n\nWhat are your thoughts, is it working? Is there a unified nature to it, or is this just a bunch of elements thrown together? How can I make this better? Thanks.\n\n[http://studentpages.scad.edu/~sreinh21/13thColony.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805062410/http:/studentpages.scad.edu/~sreinh21/13thColony.gif \"http://studentpages.scad.edu/~sreinh21/13thColony.gif\")\n\n",

Also Im making the eyes look a little more like eyes, and not dots.\n\n\"I’m not sure why there’s a giant sperm on the top of the face.\"  \n–In context I don't relate the slicked over/old barbershop ad look of the hair to sperm. Point taken though.\n\nI'm not trying to make this an all type logo, just the 1 and the 3. i appreciate the help\n\n"

If the organization was more design oriented then yes it would seem. My intention for the logo is for the viewer to view a well designed illustration, i suppose, of a barbershop quartet singer, then the 1 and the 3 are to pop out. Kind of an \"oh yea!\" type of thing. It was based on the name \"13th colony sound.\" I do understand that the eyes resemble apostrophes, and that might be why there's a push for an all-type based mark. I really appreciate your comments and suggestions everyone, this is very helpful.\n\n"
