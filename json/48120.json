  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI am designing a menu and don't have my type bible in front of me. Since I just moved I am sure it's packed away in a box that will take a few days to uncover. I can't remember off hand the proper way to spell out the ounce abbreviation. I know AM and PM are small caps, but would oz. be?\n\nAny clarification on this is greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks,  \nJohn\n\n",

Ergo:\n\n12 onza -\\> 12 oz.\n\nbut\n\nSaint John -\\> St John\n\n"
