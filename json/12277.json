Licenses Legendary Font Editor,  \nPlans to Continue Development\n\nFor Immediate Release  \nMonday, May 9, 2005  \nContact: Ted Harrison  \nFontlab Ltd.  \nTel: +1 (509) 272-3260  \n [contact@fontlab.com](mailto:contact@fontlab.com)\n\nPort Angeles, WA, USA, May 9, 2005: Fontlab Ltd. is pleased to announce the licensing from Macromedia Inc. of the Fontographer product line. “Fontographer is a respected name in the field of digital typography,” said Ted Harrison, president of Fontlab Ltd. “We are proud to add this legendary font editor to our lineup of products.” As of today, Fontlab will continue to sell the current version of Fontographer while beginning work on fixing bugs and preparing a new version - expected to be released early next year.\n\n“With nearly two decades of presence on the market, Fontographer has gained a reputation as an easy-to-use and reliable tool for creating digital fonts, and continues to boast a strong and dedicated user community among desktop publishers, graphic designers and typographers. We feel that Fontographer will find a secure and comfortable home at Fontlab Ltd. Our team is committed to continuing the development of a brand-new version of the product,” said Harrison.  \nHarrison continues, “With our TypeTool product we have a font editor for beginners, hobbyists and students. FontLab Studio and AsiaFont Studio are our high-end products with a certain degree of technical complexity, aimed at professional type designers. With Fontographer, we now have a tool that fills the gap between those products - a font editor for graphic designers and desktop publishers, powerful enough for real-world typography but without all the bells and whistles of our high-end products.”\n\nFontlab Ltd. will offer upgrade paths from TypeTool 2 to Fontographer 4.1 (US$249) and from Fontographer 4.1 to FontLab Studio (US$299) and to AsiaFont Studio (prices to be announced.)\n\nFontlab will assume support for Fontographer version 4.1+ from Macromedia and will retain the services of Fontographer guru Jim Gallagher, who has nurtured Fontographer for the last ten years, and who will advise the Fontlab development team in their task of updating Fontographer.\n\nAbout Fontlab Ltd.\n\nFontlab Ltd. is the world’s leading developer of digital typography solutions. Their full line of products is dedicated to solving typographic issues ranging from the simple to the most complex. These products include: AsiaFont Studio™, BitFonter™, FontLab Studio™, ScanFont™, TypeTool™, TransType™, FontFlasher™, FONmaker™, SigMaker™ CompoCompiler™ and Photofont.

But, even if I had known that an OSX, FL-friendly FOG was coming to market, I probably still would have made the switch.\n\nI can't imagine going back to FOG now. FL is different, but I like it. Especially what I've seen from Studio 5. Sigh…\n\nI imagine that Bill Troop will be beside himself. Whether he will be beside himself with joy or anger, I cannot predict.\n\nI guess that this means that FL Studio 5 will be able to open FOG databases now?\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20140813095527/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"

It means that there will be a next Fog which will combine best features of FL and Fog and will be positioned in between FontLab Studio and TypeTool.\n\n"

As soon as the Adobe/Macromedia merger happened I emailed Adobe to plea for Fog's revival - the inclusion of Jim Gallagher, 'the Fontmeister', is a superb decision, he has been generous with his genius and an inspiration to Fog lovers everywhere! I just hope they don't \\*\\*\\*\\* about too much with Fog's easy-to-use drawing tools!\n\nKeith\n\n"

In fact this application update alone may once and for all allow me to cut all ties with the Classic OS.\n\nNow, that said since you've got the source code in your hot hands, I am puzzled to what level you intend to update/enhance Fontographer. Would a completely updated FOG make FontLab obsolete or will you simply offer a 'reduced' feature set compared to the capabilities of FontLab?\n\nLike I said, I'm delighted but I don't understand the future differences of these two applications? I can do MOST of my fontmaking work still in FOG minus clean hinting and really nice font generation which I use FLAB for. So once you update those things in FOG, why would I need FLAB?\n\nStuart :D\n\n"
