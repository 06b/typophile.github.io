They can now referred to as participants _and_ subjects. Originally, people were referred to as subjects, and at some point the term participant was adopted and the term subject was reserved for animals (I’m not a historian).\n\nIt’s nice that we are “allowed” to use the term subjects again as it is consistent with the long standing acronym Ss.\n\n",
