  "content": "dear typophiles,\n\nI’m going to study at the Reading MATD in a few weeks and started my first warmup research-exercise:\n\nI stated this exercise with a quesion of mixing one-storied and two-storied g’s and a’s in one font and how this decision can affect the delivered impression. What are the reasons and arguments to decide which forms to use and what kinds of problems would you associate with this question? In which context does one form make sense and in what context the other?\n\nI know my question is quite general in the moment but nevertheless I would appreciate any hint concerning:\n\n\\> examples of typefaces which provide alternatives (both styles)  \n\\> historical background about the one- and two-storied forms  \n\\> any rules or conventions in which one style should be used  \n\\> connotations/denotations for the single characters  \n\\> ...advices which I’m not able to think of by now\n\nthanks a lot!  \nnicole\n\nPS are there any serif-fonts with one-storied a or g? Or fonts with double-storied a but one-storied g (which is more unusual than the opposite)?\n\nPPS some examples\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nr1_4646.png)\n  \nnumber one from darden studio – the font jubilat offers geometric and traditional characters (as they call it). this refers to the understanding I had: two-storied letters are more formal and typographic, one-storied letters are more modern and constructed on one hand but written on the other, which is a bit paradox ...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nr2_3884.png)\n  \nthe second example shows an attempt to include both forms of g and a into one font to offer solutions for different purposes (e.g. text versus signage). this example came with the question in the beginning.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/utility_basic_4055.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/utility_stylisticset1_3875.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173947im_/http:/typophile.com/files/utility_stylisticset2_5726.png)\n\nand these pictures of ff utility (basic forms and two stylistic sets) bring up the question: is it going to be standard to offer both/more forms in sans serif fonts ...? or is it just to use provided possibilities of layout-programms...\n\n",

      "content": "Personally, I don't think these variants are generally useful. In effect, they are mixing different styles of lettering within a single typeface, so the question should be in what circumstances is this desirable or useful. Gabriola is a hybrid typeface by design, intended to be able to support this kind of variation by providing a base design that combines elements of formal and cursive lettering, such that it can be pushed in either direction by the use of different variant sets. But single-storey letters in the context of roman types always seems weird to me, like a woman in an evening gown wearing combat boots. There's nothing wrong with combat boots: they just belong with a different style of dressing.\n\n"
