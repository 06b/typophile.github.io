I have attached a PDF of the logo and an example of the letterhead. Any help would be great. Also, if anyone has any suggesions for the logo type and/or changes that would tie it in better with a body font please let me know.\n\nThanks in adavance.\n\nJesse\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Logo\\_Master copy.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20071230035019/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo_Master%20copy.pdf) | 23.03 KB |\n| [Letterhead header.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20071230035019/http:/typophile.com/files/Letterhead%20header.pdf) | 15.42 KB |\n\n [‹ Personal Business Card Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20071230035019/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35564 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Arrow Circle ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071230035019/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35560 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
