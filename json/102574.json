  "content": "Hi all,\n\nLooking for some suggestions on a font for a title, and I'm particularly looking for a script font. The problem is, the title includes my full name, and my last name (Pocock) is, well, not rendering very well on any script fonts I have tried so far. The particular trouble comes with the \"ococ\" - it isn't that common, and I guess there are not many font designers out there that include a specific \"oc\" ligature. Anyone have any good suggestions? I absolutely love [Liana](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165157/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/liana/), and [Montague Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720165157/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/stephen-rapp/montague-script/) would be good as well, but Liana doesn't seem to have any ligatures including o's and Montague makes them look a little too close to a's for my personal taste.\n\nAny suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\n-Philip\n\n",
