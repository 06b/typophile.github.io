I saw [Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033208/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Morris%20Fuller%20Benton)'s Sterling and loved it and wanted to do a custom digitization, tweaking some things that I didn't like so much. So far all I have are the Capitals. In digitizing, I wated to try my hand at that fascinating [faceting](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033208/http:/typophile.com/wiki/M-formula) stuff. Eventually I'd like to expand this to a range of weights and optical sizes, but it's kind of slow going thus far. Anyhow, have a look. Let me know what you think so far.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033208im_/http:/typophile.com/files/howardpdh042806_4222.gif)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Howard.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033208/http:/typophile.com/files/Howard.pdf) | 18.42 KB |\n\n",

The curve of the P is smoothe but the serifs are chunked.  \nThe F, V, and T also seem a bit too wide. You might also look at the lower horizontal of the P, it seems to join too straight compared to top.\n\nI will give it a longer look later.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
