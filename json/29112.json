      "content": "If you are thinking of a font where the Latin letters mimic the Thai script, [AW Siam](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405164914/http:/www.weygandt.de/aw_siam.htm) by Andreas Weygandt is a Thai-look-alike free font I ran across by accident once. I saw a fair number of faux-Thai signs in English when I lived in Thailand, and I tend to consider them a bit kitsch, but I guess this is the most obvious solution for evoking a culture that doesn't use the Roman alphabet for its native language.\n\nAn alternative would be to take the approach of the \"Amazing Thailand\" logo used a while back. The lettering evoked the shapes occuring in Thai crafts and architecture, I think. The uppercase T for example mimicked the distinctive curves of Thai eaves. I can't seem to find it anywhere, but you can see a Cyrillic version of what I'm talking about [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405164914/http:/www.tourismthailand.ru/).\n\nI suggest you take a look at these approaches and come up with your own, more subtle solutions. I would like to see what you come up with, if possible. Good luck!\n\n"
