  "content": "Something weird's going on with my fonts: if I open a font that has been generated, and passed trough autohint, the contents of the liga feature changes, and FL5 refuses to compile (Fatal Error). This seems to be sticky, so fonts opened afterwards acquire the same problem (or I might just be going nuts). The only real change other than numberin simplified seems to be that \"script dflt;\" becomes \"script ;\"\n\nIs it another of the FL5 little surprises or does autohint simplify/edit liga?

      "content": "Mind that the AFDKO feature file syntax as used in FLS5 and FM is a higher level language and does not match binary layout tables one-to-one. There is some \"translation\" involved which shows when you re-import layout tables. With some lookup types, differences are more drastic than in your example.\n\nThe \"dflt\" (lowercase) keyword is only used in combination with \"language\". The default \"script\" is designated by \"DFLT\" (uppercase).  \nIf you want to address \"script DFLT\", you need to run FLS5-generated .otfs or .ttfs through Adam Twardoch's script [Fix DFLT Script Tag](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203094914/http:/www.silesian.com/software/FixDFLTScriptTagSL.zip).

Autohint the font with the AFDKO and then merge the decompiled GSUB-table back into the autohinted font. But somehow I doubt, that the autohint program messes up the GSUB-table. However, it is worth to try. I often correct fonts in this way, when I want to keep changes at the minimum.\n\n"
