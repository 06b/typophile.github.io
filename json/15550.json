Can someone verify that Adobe InDesignCS, the newest, brightest star leading the way toward the opentype revolution, does not have a dedicated, always-open, opentype palette? The only two ways I've found to access and enable/disable OT features is by clicking one of two small (perhaps 10x10 pixel) interface do-dads on the measurement or character palettes, which then opens a self-closing 2-level-deep hierarchical menu of features.\n\nHas anyone tried using this on a project with a requiring a lot of manual feature adjustments? **IT IS A NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!**\n\nOK I just needed to rant or hopefully, find someone to tell me to shut up, calm down as they point out where the missing OT pallette is to be found.\n\n",

The trick is to use the \"All Caps\" choice from the pop-up on the character palette. Just typing or converting to all caps doesn't do it. InDesign does it when you click on the all caps button on the character palette.\n\n"

Very likely, though, it would be too tricky to implement that way. I can imagine some ambiguous situations. For example: (Apple Computer UK) Do you use the parentheses designed for caps or lowercase? I would use the lowercase version in this case. The algorithm would have to look at more than adjacent characters.\n\n"
