[Tilikum](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126082757/http:/mmbc.bc.ca/exhibits/1-tilikum.html) is (among other things) the name of the boat in which an early mariner, Captain Voss, sailed from Victoria (on Canada�s west coast) at the turn of the 20th century, and reached London in 1903. What makes his feat amazing to me, is that Voss _found_ this 38' native dugout on the beach, rigged it for sailing himself, and sailed a distance that exceeds a world circumnavigation and touched every inhabited continent.   \n   \nNow for the type: I think it might be something like [Bookman](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126082757/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bookman/)... but I would have guessed �Bookman Bold Italic with Swash�, which is not shown. Also the apex of the �A� only seems to match the Bitstream version, not the ITC; and the counter/bowl of the �G� and �C� has an uncomfortable transition between curve and straight (along the left edge of the counter) which I don�t see (thankfully) in either Bitstream or ITC versions. Although faces like this were popular when I was at University (and the mammals were descending from the trees), I am unable to find a current digital face that matches your sample. Could it have been made from press-type (rub-down, like Letraset or Chartpak)?   \n   \ncheers,   \nDana\n\n"

The sample was probably created sometime in the '70s. It looks like someone tried to trace over it in an attempt to reproduce it.   \n   \nWe've seen this one [before](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126082757/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24826.html?1075527026).\n\n"
