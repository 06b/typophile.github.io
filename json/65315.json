  "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI've finally got some money saved up and have been looking at buying either Benton Sans or News Gothic No.2.\n\nBenton is what Frere Jones redrew after studying Morris Fuller Bentons original drawings of News Gothic. While News Gothic No.2 is a family of news gothic with additional weights created by Linotype.\n\n[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/more](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154843/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/more \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/more\")\n\nhave a look to see some comparative images. I felt that benton had some issues with the size of the counters especially in the heavier weights and some issues with the kerning. is it just me? What do you guys think? Benton was used to type set 2 Kilo's of KesselKramer and it looks good there. So am quite confused right now.\n\nWhat would you spend your money on?\n\nThanks for the time!  \n--  \nArjun\n\n",

      "content": "\\> the different weights\n\nThe width of the left vertical stem of the capital H may be used as a measurement for the different weights.\n\nsee [www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154843/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-1.jpg \"www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-1.jpg\")\n\nA peculiarity of the old News Gothic (and also of the later Trade Gothic) was that the normal weight of News Gothic was thinner than the normal weight of other fonts, but thicker than the light weight of other fonts.\n\nIf we apply a UPM of 1000 units, then the normal weight of Helvetica has a stem width of 97 units (or 9.7 % of the em), and the light weight of Helvetica has a stem width of 68 units (or 6.8 % of the em), whereas the normal weight of the old News Gothics is exactly in-between. For instance, the normal weight of News Gothic BT is 79 units (and for example the normal weight of Trade Gothic LT is 80 units).\n\nBut the normal weight of Benton Sans has 88 units and therefore is too thick.\n\nsee [www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141025154843/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-2.jpg \"www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-2.jpg\")\n\nIf you prefer the in-between weight peculiarity of the old News Gothic font, you should use old digitisations, e.g. News Gothic BT, which is a clone of the old Linotype News Gothic.\n\n"
