  "content": "I have been asked to volunteer my time to design the Tulsa AIDS Walk logo. I started off by designing a red ribbon to look like the \"T\" in \"Tulsa\". Then, I browsed through several bold/black sans serif fonts. I ended up using Myriad Pro Black Italic. In order to have the \"ulsa\" at the same angle as the \"T\", I had to sheer the type set in Myriad Pro Black Italic by about 22 degrees. I am not an advocate of sheering type, but I wasn't sure what else to do.\n\nWhat do you think about the \"ulsa\"? Now that I have sheered the type, should I adjust the shapes of the characters to compensate? Thanks for your input. Should I use a different font?\n\nTy\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [aids\\_04.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224074413/http:/typophile.com/files/aids_04.pdf) | 178.18 KB |\n| [aids\\_06.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224074413/http:/typophile.com/files/aids_06.pdf) | 424.45 KB |\n\n",

If it was all the same color, I believe It would read better for me.\n\nYou could start by righting an ital, and then matching the ribbon/T to the ital without sheering it.\n\nI think the Myriad does the job, but I do wonder about other options.\n\nHere's a quick loose look at Formata.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224074413im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tulsa_3795.gif)\n\nBut now I've started reading Pulsa.

If you can print the blend -- and it looks good -- I do like the blend as it adds depth. However, I would add it to the rest of the letters.\n\n"

I started seeing \"ulsa\" too, so I made the whole thing red. I also took your advice and started with the font rather than the ribbon. Do you see \"Pulsa\" now?\n\nTiffany, the burgandy was supposed to be red. I changed it to be more of a true red. I opted against adding depth to the rest of the letters because I thought that might confuse the ribbons with the letters. Hopefully the word reads well as a whole.\n\nThanks for your suggestions. They are much appreciated.\n\n"

I would have liked to have seen the two steams of the T not have shadows, so the loop is the only thing that comes out. My theory on that is, the steams and the \"ulsa\" would look like they're on the same plain, therefore should wowrk better, but thats my opinion.  \nWhatever you do I think it works well, and good luck with it.\n\n-ER\n\n"
