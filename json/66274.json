Was trying to work with Ale Paul from Sudtipos in Argentina, but he's about to go on vacation. That's the kind of person I am looking for (i.e. in terms of the kinds of lettering he does).\n\nAny recommendations would be greatly appreciated.\n\nWe are in San Francisco, but they/you/whoever doesn't have to be local.\n\nThanks,  \nPeter.\n\n",
