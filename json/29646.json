At the only size I can see on their site, it seems like we could pick almost any sans serif, and not know the difference. Does the ’a’ have any tail? Is the ’e’ crossbar angled? I really can’t tell even these basic things at screen resolution.\n\nI was concentrating on Orange in the square, but the other type on the page you linked seemed like what I would call ’generic sans’ (Helvetica/Arial).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
