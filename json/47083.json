  "content": "Between Orleans and Jefferson both, you would think that these people would get their stuff together when considering civil engineering and what not. It seems like they’ve been working on the same section of the I-10 for the last fifteen years at least! They widen the 6-10 split..a year later, they’re shutting it down to widen it again. I’ve got an idea...how about they make it really big, one time, and then never have to worry about it again!  \nAnother thing that makes New Orleans unique is the way they position street signs! If you’re going down a one way, the signs that tell you what street you’re on are positioned so that only the people going the opposite way can tell what street they’re on (that is, if they’re even there.)  \nI know it seems like I come down on my city all of the time, but when you’re a native you have no choice but to notice the things that are so back asswards about it. Although I have a somewhat jaded outlook, it’s these little idosyncracies that make me laugh and appriciate the character of my city.\n\nps. Why is it that no one is from Chalmette, only “the parish”? I still can’t figure that one out.\n\n",
