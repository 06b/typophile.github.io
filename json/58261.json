  "content": "I love the high contrast look of Coruña, but sadly on a lot of printers it can cause major problems with any size below 12. I'm not sure yet I want to compromise the x-heigh in an optical variant, if only because I don't have it really clear the effect that'll have on a script like Armenian, or the balance when mixed with hebrew or arabic. So for the moment, I've darkened the thin strokes and buffed up the serifs which has a noticeably nice effect. I then interpolated to grab an even thicker one, a caption sized-one if you will. Of course the difference is subtle and I might still change the x-height, and definitely will the spacing, but it looks good. I still need to do the capitals and alts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420010015im_/http:/typophile.com/files/corunna_optical_4328.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [coruna\\_optic.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420010015/http:/typophile.com/files/coruna_optic.pdf) | 39.33 KB |\n\n",
