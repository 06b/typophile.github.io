  "content": "I got my hands on a type specimen book from 1889 and liked it alot. One thing confused me though and I was hoping for some help from my dear typophiles.   \n   \nAlmost every single '4' was drawn in this fashion(excuse my sloppy modification... but something along the lines of this):   \n   \n   \n ![sloppy four](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011025415im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/3228.gif)   \n   \n   \nNotice the angular cut, I can't remember seeing this in any recent design, or any 'traditional' (besides in this very specimen book) typeface for that matter either. 'Regular' 4's are AFAIK either closed or drawn with a cut that is not angular but horizontal.   \n   \nIs this still used today, was it popular before, yaddfa yadda... please shed some light over my neophyte type knowledge. will ya? ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011025415im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Tifanny, yeah... that would be a plausible explanation if there were more characters looking like this, but it was limited only to the 4's.   \n   \nHrant, yes, some of them. Quite a few were bold in their original cuts also.   \n   \nAnyway, I'm not negative about it or anything, I was just surprised that it was so common. ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011025415im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nThanks.\n\n"
