I favor the latter theory on the grounds that successful type designs are supposed to be closely based on existing types.

Just as you might have feelings about a particular song and what it meant when you first heard it, not 20 years later after it becomes an overplayed classic you can no longer stand.\n\nWhile Helvetica may have been around since '57 it really took off later in the 60s. The best early widespread use of it involved the greatest practitioners of the day and the results were stunning. Helvetica may have been the face of choice that moment, but its usage was forever being showcased within the context of a bold new look in design in general. Had Helvetica not been there to use I'm sure they would have chosen any suitable sans.\n\nIf your experience with the face began with more recent Helvetica usage revivals you might have a different association. Usages such as that employed by American Apparel, for example, are purposeful attempts to be ironic by employing the face to represent the unbranded, un-designed and personality devoid culture they espouse.\n\nJust as any color in a painting or note of a song is neutral until it is placed next to another, Helvetica's neutrality stops the moment it is placed into a layout, set in the words it will deliver.\n\n"

Times come and go and what seems so hot, young, hip, sweet, and in today will be scorned in 30 years as establishment Lemming following.\n\nOptima was decent enough but not earthshaking. It was something neither here nor there. Helvetica was the face that launched 1000 ships while Optima christened a few lovely yachts. There were two camps back in the 60s. The pro-helvetica were then the young firebrands and the anti-helvetica were the establishment. This is all flip-flopped now--even more, Helvetica hating is expected and cheered by the current young designers.

Perhaps relevant in someway, but more a side issue.  \nYou write: \"It was the sign of the young brash designer going against the establishment arty style of the 50s.\" I agree, and this to me is the core issue that made Helvetica the monster it turned out to be, and it would suggest that it was usage and typographic/ graphic style that was really the issue and not the choice of type face. From my eyes there were better sans faces around long before Helvetica. Helvetica itself was nothing particularly new and certainly nothing creative or innovative at all in type face design as far as I can see (which may not be far). I think that Hans Mohring was far more interesting, different, innovative and creative in his sans designs during the 1920's (from memory) than Helvetica or anything produced in the 60's. The fact that Helvetica became the type face of the 60's and well into the 70's was more to do with it being a new release at the right time to suit the typographic style of the rebellious young graphic designers of the day.  \nHelvetica was used by the avant garde of the 60's because it was as far removed from the tastes of the day as they could get, not because it was a good design.\n\n"

A large majority of the earlier (Swiss) examples of the International Typographic, or Swiss, Style were set in AG, and Neue Haas Grotesk actually had a pretty slow start in Switzerland, most reactions indicating that graphic artists were very happy with AG, and weren't waiting for a \"tamed\" version of it. In fact, the power of many of those famous poster layouts relies in part on the greater tension and irregularity of the lettershapes – they would not have worked as well with Helvetica.\\* There is often a powerful but carefully balanced tension to those early layouts; many of them weren't anywhere near as bland as the Swiss Style has come to be seen (and reinterpreted) elsewhere, later.\n\n\\* Probably my favorite: [\"Weniger Lärm\" bei Josef Müller-Brockmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713203340/http:/www.plakatwp.ch/images/M%C3%BCller-Brockmann-02.jpg) (1960).\n\nSo, the avant garde of said movement, more often than not, _didn't_ use Helvetica (and consciously so); the ones who copied and followed the avant garde did (and do) invariably use it, belying some of the original essence and intentions of the Swiss Style.\n\n"

That is why I separate the earlier Swiss graphic Design from the International Style even though one grew from the other. Naming it Helvetica after Switzerland further pushed the Swiss notion. As I said before, I much prefer Univers as a typeface from that time but it lost the battle of distribution along with AG or Standard as it was known in American metal cuts. AG was really the founding father and a better display face than Helvetica. Ask Weingart what he thinks about Helvetica some day and you will have time to finish several beers before he finishes his comparison :-)  \nHelvetica won out not because it was better than Univers (or AG) but because it was quicker to phototype distribution and spread to typesetters with greater profusion. Typesetters usually did not have both Helvetica and Univers so they set what they had. Remember, purchasing a typeface in that day was a huge expense compared to the pennies they cost today.  \nI am not enamored of Helvetica, I am just explaining its prominence, indeed dominance, of usage in that era.

Of course, like you said, naming Helvetica Helvetica makes it even more confusing to realize that it actually hasn't fully pushed the \"Swiss\" aspect of the style, even if it is a Swiss design itself. As Colin Forbes is quoted in \"Helvetica – Homage to a Typeface\":  \n\"Some years ago a young intern in our New York office, when looking at an old map where Switzerland was named Helvetia, said, 'Fancy naming a country after a typeface.'\"\n\n_I am not enamored of Helvetica, I am just explaining its prominence, indeed dominance, of usage in that era._\n\nOh, absolutely. I didn't mean to disagree; and I also didn't assume you didn't already know what I wrote. But hey, you never know, there may be people reading this who didn't. In fact I wrote a design history paper back in school, setting out full of confidence to document the relationship between Helvetica and the Swiss Style, only to realize this didn't actually happen the way I [and many people around me] expected it to be, which would have been a near-symbiotic rise of Helvetica and the Swiss style as a couple made in heaven.  \nSince then, mentions of the Helvetica—Swiss connection still prompt my reflex to disambiguate their relationship. ;-)\n\n_My favorite Swiss posters were Giselle and William Tell by Armin Hofmann. This may partly be due to studying with early students of Hofmann and Ruder._\n\nI'm envious! (And as a Basler, I'm of course proud you mention Hofmann rather than Müller-Brockmann.\\*) Where, and with whom did you study if I may ask?\n\n\\* I actually absolutely adore the work of Müller-Brockmann, except maybe the very late stuff. But Baslers of course relish any assertion that they're not any worse than the Zurichers. ;-)\n\nMy favorite poster by Hofmann is \"Spitzen\" (Lace; pardon the bad reproduction). The way he works the letterforms into the illustration is just amazing.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713203340im_/http:/typophile.com/files/spitzen_4905.jpg)\n\n"
