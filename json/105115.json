You seem to have a different arch design in {h} than in {n m u}; the latter look better in my opinion. Your previous {g} seemed more in character than the new open one. The {t} is a bit timid. {C G} look like they bit into a lemon; maybe relax their apertures a bit?\n\nCheers!\n\n"

If you know of anything, I would appreciate it.\n\nThe trick is in learning to see and balance the counter spaces. If you look at the beginning of \"phonmusik\" in that last image, the /o/ captures less interior space area-wise than the /p/, and the /p/ less than the /h/. The closer those are to visually balanced, the better. No chart needed, just your eyes!\n\n"

      "content": "Really nice font :)\n\nSince the first image has sentences with Romanian diacritics (my language), may I say that while the distance between them and the letter is good (so keep it the same) the comma-accent of lowercase |ț| and |ș| are too heavy – they should be a bit smaller – around 90% or even 80%, I'd say. (And FYI, most of the time the comma-accent diacritical mark should be smaller than the \"regular\" comma anyway).\n\nAlso, the circumflex of |â| should be nudged a bit to the right, to be centered to the upper extrema point of |a|.\n\ncheers :)\n\n"

Not sure I like all of them.  \n- Thickness of serifs is inconsistent. Compare the bottom serif of u to the top ones.  \n- The bottom of g looks a bit out of tune to me, shape-wise. Too futuristic-like  \n- middle stem in m needs a serif  \n- t is really narrow.\n\n"
