He is a bright guy, an artist, and just followed the current that opportunity sailed him in. He was not a designer though. He was a painter of pages with whimsy and joy, not a communication problem solver. I wish him well and a happy life.

While there are some exceptional circumstances where anger is regarded as acceptable in some of these traditions, in all it I believe it is regarded as an extremely dangerous emotion, generally sowing personal pain and interpersonal conflict.\n\nIncidentally, my own view is that anger can be functional as a warning signal of danger. However it--like other negative emotions--is in great danger of being stuck in the 'on' position, leading to actions that are irrationally harmful to the self and others. Unnecessarily offending others is an example of such generally self-defeating actions.\n\nIn our society people can sometimes make a living out of insulting others, though.

Once you are aware of a danger or need, you can be concerned and take action without being constantly angry.\n\nAs I said above, I acknowledge that anger is functional as a warning signal; also as motivation that something needs doing. That is a merit, but not in itself. It is also functional in blocking compassion and giving you energy when it's a kill or be killed situation, such as in battle.\n\nAnger in itself, without serving one of these functions is dangerous and destructive. And anger is in fact very often dysfunctional. Anger easily becomes a habit and leads to the distorted, self-defeating thinking that has been documented by cognitive psychologists: thinking in black and white, us-and-them, limiting the scope of searched options, over personalizing, 'catastrophizing', oscilating between grandiosity and self abasement, etc., etc.\n\nAnd insult creates lasting resentments and stokes the fires of conflict.\n\n"

He pissed off everyone. He was the epitome of 90’s culture. And like it or not, his influence still lives on.\"\n\nYour later explanation that he didn't let the demands of design interfere with his art may be accurate, but I think your first comment better captures why so many students admire him. It is not just his ability as an artist, but his attitude of contempt which you and others are excited by. And I actually have come around to see that you are indeed right: he is characteristic of a period, just recently ended.\n\nThe admiration of 'attitude' is what I pointed out indeed has been popular, though I think it is misguided. Rappers have ridden anger and contempt for women to riches, and Don Imus had a successful show for years regularly insulting everybody as 'humor'. The 'hate radio' of Rush Limbaugh has also been hugely successful.\n\nDavid Carson is not a cultural critic but someone riding a wave of popularity of a contemptuous attitude as 'hip' and 'cool'.\n\nI am the one being a counter-cultural--art school culture--critic, and here you are being the culture police and ruling me out of order. But I am now in fact seconding what you said, that Carson is important. --I just think the popularity was for the wrong reasons.\n\nSpecifically, it is not 'advanced' and a breakthrough to push forward your own art to the detriment of a design purpose. It is self-indulgent and contemptuous of the client and reader. --and by the way Hrant and I I think agree about this. And as you can see, we don't agree about a lot!\n\nAs a contrary example, I would cite the recent wonderful work of [Marian Bantjes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020184851/http:/www.bantjes.com/). Her recent work would fall in the category of 'graphic art', as you have put Carson's. However, she is respectful of the client and the audience. Her art has a freedom, adventurousness and joy that reminds me of the Beatles in their prime. And not coincidentally, she knows the difference between art and design--as Patty above explained.\n\nAt a talk at the TDC in New York, she told the story of how she decided she was fed up with design, and quit and devoted herself to the graphic art that her conservative clients didn't want. After a very lean year she started her first sales of her graphic art. Now, widely admired in only a few years, only accepts projects where she has \"carte blanche\". \"And that's not really design,\" she said. She gets it.\n\nMaybe the worm has turned and the recently fashionable contempt has turned back to a spirit of freedom, adventure and joy. By me, that would be great.\n\n"

So much of the bitterness that has spread into our culture comes from the political fallout of the 1990s Clinton vs. the Republican Revolution mess. When our leaders decided it was fine to spew bile and vitriol at one another the mordant slime trickled down into every aspect of American culture. I am hopeful that things are starting to swing the other way; the implosion of McCain on the right and the rise of Obama on the left, coupled with growing friendly trends in music and design (I can’t figure out where “fine art” is going so I won’t touch that one) lead me to believe that Americans are sick of the bitterness and are ready to start getting along again.\n\nBut it sure would be easy for it all to get even worse if things go the wrong way and the us VS them mindset continues.\n\n"
