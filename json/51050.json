      "content": "Back in 2000 when first discovered the internet, signing up for email accounts etc was a nightmare as every iteration of “chris” was taken. I stumbled upon “onemore” then, I use it for most things. Also “more” was my first word so it seemed fitting.\n\nMy current portfolio is a little impersonal and cold right now (onemorechris.co.uk) . Since I made it, I’ve had a fair bit of feed back from employees and clients about it, some know everything, others understand/appreciate very little. So I’m taking a different route, making a more personal and warmer.\n\nI watched the film about helvetica and got fired up about type again, although I know very little. The straight forwardness of the words made me want to focus on font and colour and nothing more. So im looking for input from some people who know more about type than I do.\n\nDo you mean “loosening” as space between letters and thickness?  \nThanks for the comment\n\n"
