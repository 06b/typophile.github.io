  "content": "Hello, I just joined this forum. :) I hope this is the proper place for my post.\n\nI'm wondering if there is a good, efficient and pretty way to print (or export to PDF) font test/sample pages. I basically need two lines of information per font: 1) name of font; 2) a specific line of copy in a given size. My Suitcase Fusion does this, in a dirtier way, using the \"Print Sample Pages\" feature. I've typed out the line of copy in the \"preview\" box, but it's just so much clutter, and I'm unable to get rid of things like file location. Plus, it takes up an entire page per font.\n\nI've made my own manually in InDesign in the past, but it's incredibly tedious and there must be a better way.\n\nI appreciate any input! Please let me know if my post needs clarifications, and apologies if this belongs elsewhere.\n\nThank you!  \nN\n\n",

Below is a snippet that fills-in a text frame with info about the first 5 fonts available to InDesign. The result for me looks like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130227052416im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IDScript_fontsample_6646.png)\n\n`\nvar myTextFrame = app.documents[0].textFrames[0];\nvar myInsertPoint = myTextFrame.insertionPoints[-1];`\n\nfor (x=0; x\\<5; x++) {  \n myInsertPoint.appliedFont = 'Myriad Pro';  \n myInsertPoint.fontStyle = 'Regular';  \n myInsertPoint.pointSize = 8;  \n myInsertPoint.contents = app.fonts.item(x).fullName + '\\n';  \n myInsertPoint.appliedFont = app.fonts.item(x);  \n myInsertPoint.pointSize = 16;  \n myInsertPoint.contents = 'The quick brown fox\\n\\n';  \n}\n\n"

I'm not sure if I can make the appropriate modifications to make it do what I want (i.e., the fonts I want to display are not in sequence, etc.), but I can see that it \\*would\\* be possible.\n\nI really appreciate your response and welcome. Thank you!\n\n"
