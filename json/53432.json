The I thought about using their typeface instead.\n\nThe face is Casablanca Antique and it is a Corel font from 1992. I have no idea where I got it from but it appears to be distributed widely for free (I know I did not buy it).\n\nI have not done web in a long time and am not sure of the pros/cons of using @font-face.\n\nCan anyone please advise?\n\nThanks,  \nJay\n\n",
