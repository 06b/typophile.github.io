  "content": "I am new at font creation, as will be apparent by this post, and was wondering how to go about making bitmap fonts. Allow me to give you a bit of context... I am working with php dynamic imaging, specifically the GD Library. I want to create custom bitmap fonts in order to load with the imageloadfont() function. It may help you answer my question if you take a look at the following page:\n\n[http://www.widgnet.com/gdf\\_fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103232206/http:/www.widgnet.com/gdf_fonts/ \"http://www.widgnet.com/gdf\\_fonts/\")\n\nFor a small library of these fonts to play with or at least take a look at in order to help answer my questiong, please take a look at the following page:\n\n[http://www.widgnet.com/gdf\\_fonts/fonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141103232206/http:/www.widgnet.com/gdf_fonts/fonts.html \"http://www.widgnet.com/gdf\\_fonts/fonts.html\")\n\nApparently the creator of this site was able to convert TTF fonts into GDF fonts fairly simply, but he does not explain how, or perhaps I am overlooking a key part of the site.\n\nEssentially, I want to be able to create a small bitmap (maybe 8 by 13 px or something similar, that's not the important part...) for each letter/symbol and compile these bitmaps into a font file. This font file then has the following information:\n\nbyte 0-3 (int) number of characters in the font  \nbyte 4-7 (int) value of first character in the font (often 32 for space)  \nbyte 8-11 (int) pixel width of each character  \nbyte 12-15 (int) pixel height of each character  \nbyte 16-EOF (char) array with character data, one byte per pixel in each character, for a total of (nchars\\*width\\*height) bytes.\n\nAnd while I may understand what this information is saying, I'm not sure how to go about using it. Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you =)\n\n-Trevor\n\n",
