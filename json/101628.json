  "content": "Hello Typophile,\n\nI am looking for a little help. I have just started in a new job leading the interface design for a digital publishers. They have asked me to take a look at the brand collateral with a view of updating it all in the near future.\n\nCurrently their logo is lowercase bold Trebuchet, which I find ungainly and a bit ugly.\n\nI was hoping that I could get some suggestions for typefaces that are sans or humanist, so some character, not too formal, but also not too quirky.\n\nAny suggestions gratefully received!\n\nFrank.\n\n",

They are in some ways opposites—minimalist vs. oldstyle, geometric vs. humanist, formal vs. quirky, if you will.\n\n"
