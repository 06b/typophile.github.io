I said Coolvetica is the closest solution I've found which could do the job as it (meaning without any modification) but it's far from a perfect match. Actually, I don't understand the purpose behind trying to know which exact font it could be. Almost all logos are custom, in this case rather say \"customization of a commercial type\". To me, this one is a customization based on [Helvetica Neue](http://web.archive.org/web/20140125042816/http:/myfonts.us/td-IwWLux) Medium (or Chalet), started with \"gbs\" as backbone mainly removing /g counter and adding an ascender and a rounded dot. And FYI, Coolvetica stands for Cool(Hel)vetica :)  \nAnd if you need an exact match to recreate this logo and work with it, better go with the vector logo I've pointed to...\n\n"
