  "content": "Hi.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to expand the letterspacing in a typeface i'm working on. Currently the color of the font is pretty good, but it needs to be a bit wider spaced for legibility. I thought this would be a fairly simple procedure, but so far books, manuals and googling have not come up with anything.\n\nThanks,  \nS.\n\n",
