For a while I was into rerversing words in order to find new ones, to see what happened. One day I reversed milk and out popped klim. this is the true beginning of the name Klim. It took me a while to get used to the idea that it is completely valid to make a word up and start to use it (Hrant does it all the time). This was confirmed by a spread in 'the art of looking sideways' that had the word ZAUM across it, zaum being the trans-rational poetic language that the Russian avant-garde 'invented', they dealt with words by their sound and their visual presence, not really by their meaning. I was comforted by this, thus Klim was borne. I initially used it in (unoficially) some school projects and thought of dropping later on. My friends balked at this and said 'no, klim is you, you have to keep it.' So I did.   \n   \nAhh, the mystery has been revealed.\n\n"
