  "content": "Ok, this should be easy:\n\nI'm trying to get fonts to work with the \"save as PDF\" in FileMaker 8.\n\nAll the Type One's and Opentype fonts I've tried drop extended characters when a PDF is made with FileMaker's PDF generator, although the same page printed to the Acrobat 7 printer works. (This in spite of the fact that FileMaker licensed the Acrobat engine from Adobe.)\n\nAnyway, I find that Truetype fonts work, so I think, weird, but, okay, I'll regenerate my Adobe Caslon as a Truetype for use in Filemaker.\n\nBUT I can't get the encoding to work: é becomes É, that kind of thing. If I generate an OpenType or Type 1 with what I think are the same encodings, the accents work, but the PDF doesn't.\n\nI know I'm missing something simple: I never make Truetype, because I figure OT is the way to go, but not this time.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
