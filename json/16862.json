      "content": "That’s bizarre. Especially since Christmas is all over the place. It’s like this debate over the ’War’ has gotten everyone to think that this is a bigger issue than it is.\n\nOn a related note, the House of Representatives [passed a bill to “protect” Christmas](http://web.archive.org/web/20071221093101/http:/blogs.washingtonpost.com/thedebate/2005/12/war_on_christma.html). The ensuing debate is pretty funny and pretty indicative of how ludicrous it is for the U.S. government to pass bills to protect a specific religion.\n\nWish people a Merry Christmas! Who cares!? Focus on something that _matters_, like any of the laundry list of problems in this country, let alone the world. Christmas isn’t suffering because of “secular” activities, it’s suffering because its practitioners are missing the point. Heck, even [megachurches](http://web.archive.org/web/20071221093101/http:/www.cnn.com/2005/US/12/06/churches.closed.christmas.ap/index.html) are closing on Christmas because of anticipated low turnout due to Christmas falling on Sunday. Who would have guessed that churches themselves would be fighting the war against “the reason behind the season”? Even Fox had ’Happy Holidays’ ornaments for sale on its site before this B.S. crusade started.\n\nAs was pointed out by Rep. Gary Ackerman: “Is this another war we fight for reasons that do not exist?” This is not a war against Christmas, it’s the plurality of the United States expressing itself through the democracy of the governing institutions. Welcome to freedom, people. It’s not that you can’t celebrate Christmas, it’s that there are other celebrations going on and people want to acknowledge them. Christians are the overwhelming majority in the U.S. Self-centered individuals are trying to set up the majority as the minority to curry support and money from them. It’s a con, and an old one.\n\n"

It is just a major smoke screen to keep people from looking at the real problems the Administration has created. They would love to get everyone all up in arms about “saving Christmas” so that they forget about the war and the torture chambers and the unrepresented prisoners in Guantanamo. Religion is supposed to be a matter of personal choice in the “Land of the Free”, not smoke screen to hide the evils that we pursue in its name.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

And that programs involving singing should include multiple religions (hannukkah for example) and/or have secular songs in the mix (jingle bells).\n\nGiven the lawsuits about the pledge this year and over prayer in schools in past years it’s no wonder public officials at local levels are scared and may not understand their rights.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOh, that’s a swoosh, but I’m waiting for a cease and desist letter before I take it off. =P\n\n"

[This, at least in theory, is good for everybody. Now how far apart from the true meaning of Christmas is that _really_ ;-)]\n\nI will also be celebrating “Christmas” this year (well, _Weihnachten_, actually…), but my Christmas cards say “happy holidays” on them, too. I may believe in my beliefs, but I certainly don’t want to offend anyone with them. That’s my beef with the Christian Right, I guess… and probably most other _“listen to us, we are ’right’s’,” too!_ How are you ever going to convince someone that you are right when you starting right off by offending them?

Being a republican and being conservative are two different things. I know quite a few Republicans the hate religion as much as the next guy, and share in very few of my beliefs. Politicians ( Dubya ) playing to the right doesn’t help anyone.\n\nBecause it’s about two different things. People that hold signs out that say ’God hates \\*\\*\\*\\*’ is not conservative, nor Christian, they are likely a republican that doesn’t know the distinction between the two, who grew up going to church, but doesn’t mean much to them, or hey, I’m white, I must be Christian. That is real bigotry.\n\nThere are many things about Republicanism that make me sick. Unfortunately there is more about liberal democracy that make me more ill.\n\nI mean, I see American culture. I see the seperation of church and state distorted out of it’s meaning. This thing called founders intent clarifies the first amendment\n\n” ...Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...”\n\nwas intended to prevent the formation of a ’state church.’\n\nIf it was simply about preventing the formation of a ’state church’ and not eliminating Christianity from the public square, why is there such a fight now? The people of this country are having there ability to even see two different sides taken away.\n\nIn attending a public university, I witness the hostility towards Christianity nearly every day, in one form or another. The humanists OWN public education. What a convenient way of eliminating competition, than distorting an amendment to your own use? Take a look at the founding of public education in America. Educational Founding father John Dewey wrote lengthy texts on social engineering. The system in place is deviously brilliant.\n\n"
