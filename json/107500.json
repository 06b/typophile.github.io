  "content": "Hi guys, I would like to use this font for an important personal project.  \nIt has got a good amount of glyphs, around 700. I like it because of its  \nroughness, but I’m not completely sure.\n\nCould you guys express your opinion about it?  \nHave you any alternative for it?\n\nThank you,  \nAny doubts or strong opinion about it, will be well-accepted.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414022939im_/http:/typophile.com/files/C_ITAO-10005000_3736.GIF)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [C\\_ITAO-10005000.GIF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414022939/http:/typophile.com/files/C_ITAO-10005000.GIF) | 34.75 KB |\n\n",
