  "content": "Quick question: I have Snow Leopard now, so [some of] the system fonts are TTCs. Since I'm very much a type design learner I like to open fonts and study the outlines up close; but now FontLab says it can't handle TTCs. :-( Is there any way to make Fontlab accept these files? Or do I need to revert to typing the glyphs in question in Illustrator and converting to outlines to see them up close?  \nThanks for input.\n\n",

      "content": "A TTC is a regular TTF and then some more: it contains the usual tables for one single TTF, _plus_ any number of additional font sections that share some of its tables with the 'base' font and have some private tables.\n\n(And I am surprised FontLab didn't know that. Perhaps they _do_, but it's too hard to switch from a one-file-one-font-outline paradigm. (They could do something like, on opening a TTC, ask \"What section do ya want?\"))\n\nI'm fairly familiar with the TTC tables; perhaps it's not too difficult to write a 'converter' that creates at least a single file of the 'base font' (and perhaps (oh my!) of the other fonts as well).\n\n... No promises, though.\n\n...... Besides, I bet this is one of those forbidden things you sometimes hear about.\n\n"

There is another product from Fontlab to do this: [http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140309064915/http:/www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/ \"http://www.fontlab.com/fontlab-products/compare/\")  \n2. New TTC fonts introduced in Snow Leopard are a little bit different from those on Windows. Apple took font data from the data fork, compressed it and put in the 'cmpf' resource in the resource fork of the file. So new ttc fonts are now resource-based files.\n\n<cite>Does anyone know if FontLab 6 will have TTC support?</cite>\n\nNobody knows. ;)\n\nRegards,  \nJohnych\n\n"

But from my limited experience FF seems strictly professional in treating the basics, for example it lets the user see which tables are associated with which font. Font Forge installs with one click on any Linux operating system and runs smoothly in its native habitat. I tried it from a Ubuntu OS installed temporarily from a USB key on a homeless PC laptop that does not even have a hard disc - and it is all open source. See [http://www.linuxliveusb.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140309064915/http:/www.linuxliveusb.com/ \"http://www.linuxliveusb.com/\") . FF is downloaded as a package from within Ubuntu.\n\n"
