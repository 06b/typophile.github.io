He was an Art Nouveau artist and designer, one of a group who frequented the Chat Noir or Black Cat Cafe in the Montmartre district of Paris. He came to Paris in 1883 to be a writer and some of his essays were published in Chat Noir. Eugéne Grasset introduced him to typography and book design which led to his designing _Les Trente-six Vues de la Tour Eiffel_ in 1902. He worked as an illustrator, writer, and printmaker as well as a type designer. He is best known for his Auriol face designed for [Deberny Peignot](http://web.archive.org/web/20120314042748/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Deberny%20Peignot). The letter forms are stencil like and have very organic shapes which can be seen as flowers, plants, or bones.\n\n",
