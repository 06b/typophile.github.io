  "content": "A couple of months ago I started work on a mark for a furniture designer that specializes in custom cabinet designs. He suggested the concept of two whales in a circle, which fits a sort of yin-yang aesthetic. The client lives in Northern California, not too far from where there is whalewatching, and whales also suggest sustainability, which is an important part of the client's work.\n\nI took a first stab at the design [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104012959/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44613). Upon visiting the Pacific Northwest, and going whale watching myself, I was inspired by the Native American woodworking designs of the orca whale. These designs are used in Native American woodcraft, including totem poles. I think that the orca works well, since it is one of the species that passes along the California coast up to Canada. I think that the Native American inspiration works well along the lines of sustainability. Also, I think the designs are wicked cool.\n\nHere's my interpretation made into a logo for the client.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104012959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whelan_orca_5323.png)\n\nI want some feedback on how to refine, and I would also invite suggestions for a selection of type. I'm looking for a humanist serif that has the two middle strokes of the 'W' overlapping, like in Garamond, but not as stiff and mechanical.\n\n",

With the revision, I am pleased that the shape of the two whales suggests and ovoid and not a perfect circles.\n\nAlso, the modern face suggested by vintagesignman does not fit the direction I envisioned. Right now, I'm liking Sabon as a type selection, although I am open to other suggestions. Here is a revision, with a rough sample of Sabon (no kerning, ripped from a website).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104012959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whelansabon_5089.png)\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

Kerning capital LA is going to be a real bitch!\n\nI still think you have a problem with it looking too abstract and not, well, immediately whalish. (That's my new word.) Have you considered a big whale with a little whale? Momma whale with a baby may be help make it more instantly recognizable as whales. But, then again, a color version would solve the abstraction, too.\n\n"

A. Watkins, missionaries from England. Edmund Peck promoted the use of the syllabary across the Canadian Arctic, and also translated the bible into Inuktitut, and wrote an Eskimo Grammar and an Eskimo-English Dictionary.\n\nIn 1976 the Language Commission of the Inuit Cultural Institute approved approved two standardized writing systems for Inuktitut in Canada: one using the syllabary and the other using the Latin alphabet.\n\n[http://www.fontco.com/info02/arjowigginsinuit.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104012959/http:/www.fontco.com/info02/arjowigginsinuit.php \"http://www.fontco.com/info02/arjowigginsinuit.php\") is based on The Inuktitut syllabary, cree.

He also said that the shapes in the design are the shapes he would like to pursue in his work.\n\nAdditional edits in this version: I cleaned up the forms of the teeth, and made the outside tail fin come to a point.

Since his shop is as much about selling himself as selling his work, I think that there needs to be some representation of who he is.\n\n(2) He showed me some letter forms that he has carved into wood, and while they are more mechanical, they have aspects that Sabon matches, such as the crossed middle strokes of the 'W'. Carving these letters into wood, in fact, is part of a traditional cabinetmaker's apprenticeship training. While no typophile himself (he keeps asking me why we can't use Times New Roman), he at least has experience with interacting with letterforms in wood.\n\nAnother reason I think a humanist serif is a good idea is that humanist faces speak of the earlier days of typeface crafting, just as cabinetmaking draws from deep and long-lasting traditions of crafting furniture. So both express a parallel sense of Western heritage in the practical arts.\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

As I did more research into the different ways orcas have been rendered in Native American art, I found myself less satisfied with the execution of the original piece. Also, the kerning issue is still before me. Any suggestions or pointers to help out with this L-A dilemma? (Too bad his name isn't spelled, \"WHELEN\"!) Also, any suggestions on your part for a titling font? I'm pretty set on Sabon, but could be coaxed...\n\nAlso, regarding those people who think that Native American art may be a bad starting point of inspiration, I pose this question: are the art forms of particular people groups privileged with regard to their usage? What would be wrong with a Native American person drawing on Western European art for a logo? What would limit Western Europeans from getting inspiration from Native American art?\n\nThe concepts that the client wanted expressed were: natural, sustainable, traditional craft, handmade, custom designed, etc. Plus, the client personally appreciates both whales and Native American art. Therefore, I stand by my design as a reasonable expression of these concepts. I am most willing to engage in more dialogue to understand if I may be missing something, of course.\n\n--  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
