  "content": "Hello,  \nI'm currently attempting to hand letter a logo based off of some faint visual memories of some mid-century modern lettering I've seen through my travels. I'm hoping someone out there can look at what I have so far and point me to some existing typefaces or lettering that evoke this \"style\" so I may reference them to perfect the whole thing!  \nI would also love some general feedback and guidance if people are willing to share it!  \nThanks!  \nJames\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322044519im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fiftyfifty_6028.png)\n\n",
