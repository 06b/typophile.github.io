Separately, I've been quietly following the conversation about Gill Sans Arabic ( [http://typophile.com/node/92658](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317061951/http:/typophile.com/node/92658 \"http://typophile.com/node/92658\")), as well as other threads here, which touch upon the tendency by some designers to Latinise non-Latin scripts. Chris Lozos posted the following comment in a thread about the correct way to draw the Greek letter /Mu/:\n\n> My opinion is that Greek text should dance more than say Times Roman Latin. Many Latin faces have glyphs which appear as a single gestalt on the page and group together as words with a single gestalt. I feel Greek text swings together as a flowing, undulating tango rather than marching lockstep in very even time.\n\nEverything I'd read made me wonder if it was possible to develop a worthy Greek character set for my new font, notwithstanding it's more jitterbug than tango. This is the first draft; it includes only lower case characters at this stage and I'd welcome any feedback (please ignore the accented characters for now).\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/f949b115fe.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317061951/http:/freepdfhosting.com/f949b115fe.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/f949b115fe.pdf\")\n\nFor a comparison with the current Latin characters set, please view [http://freepdfhosting.com/0ff63ba208.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317061951/http:/freepdfhosting.com/0ff63ba208.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/0ff63ba208.pdf\")\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\n",

Ancient greek inscriptional letters had very simple forms, similar to modern sans serif typefaces, before the roman alphabet even existed. Thus, I think it is a misconception that simple, rationalized forms are in any way unsuitable for a greek typeface.\n\nI really like your greek characters, and they match the roman characters nicely. However, I would remove the little top-right loops on zeta and xi, I think they are too much. I would also try less curved kappa and lambda forms.\n\n<cite>Most of these caps are copies of the Latin characters set - is this correct for Greek</cite>  \nYes.\n\n"

The loops on the zeta and xi seem to me to be a very typical feature of both Greek handwriting and Greek fonts. These loops also tie in well with the loops I have on the beta, gamma, epsilon and omega. And, on the xi in particular, I can't help thinking the removal of the top loop will leave the middle loop looking a bit out of place.\n\nAs for the lambda, if anything, I was concerned mine wasn't curved enough.\n\nNone of this is to say I'm opposed to change, and I'd welcome your further thoughts on this.\n\n"

Is it appropriate for these two letters to share the same structure?\n\nAlso, the /lambda/ has been made more upright (with a general shape also in keeping with the /gamma/ and /nu/), but the top more curved. This seems to me to be very much in keeping with Greek handwriting styles.\n\nFinally, for now, I've experimented with a new form of /phi/. I saw this looped transition in a calligraphic font and thought something along those lines might complement the loops in some of my existing characters. Is it an acceptable form?\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/76846b4628.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317061951/http:/freepdfhosting.com/76846b4628.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/76846b4628.pdf\")\n\n"
