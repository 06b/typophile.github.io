Things can be taken too far and perfected to please the in-crowd, but I think readability is mostly subliminal.   \n   \nJust for example, a magazine I've seen for years did a slight redesign a few months back. There was just a little more leading in the body copy, same font, same point size. I noticed it because they had also changed the headline font and some rules along the sides of the body copy. I showed it to my wife and she said she had particularly enjoyed that issue and read it more thoroughly than usual, and felt it was easier reading somehow but couldn't put her finger on it. So small things can make a difference without being highly noticeable.   \n   \nHere's a short answer: obviously no one cares as evidenced by the amount of comic sans being used anywhere and everywhere.\n\n"

Thoughts?_    \n   \nThe essence of discrimination lies in education. Although a couple of years ago straight quotes wouldn't have bothered you, you would probably find them distracting today. Similarly, a copy editor soon becomes put off by previously unnoticed \"mistakes\" in using \"which\" and \"that.\" To Westerners Chinese painting at first all looks alike, but one comes to recognize and appreciate Northern Song landscapes. Possible examples are endless.   \n   \nWith the scandalous decline in education in this country (the U.S.) any sort of discrimination on any subject (with the possible exception of pro wrestling) is less and less likely.

It comes to him as a surprise that these signs should be a matter of concern to any one of the crafts of men.   \n   \n But to be concerned with the shapes of letters is to work in an ancient and fundamental material. The qualities of letter forms at their best are the qualities of a classic time: order, simplicity, grace. To try to learn and repeat their excellence is to put oneself under training in the most severe school of design.\"   \n   \n� W.A.

The person who reads printing should not be conscious that the page he reads is made up of letters. If any single character presents itself to his attention _as_ a single character, the process of reading is disturbed.   \n   \n\"The kind of letter to which a reader is accustomed is the best kind of letter for the reader. But this fact must not be allowed to limit the effort of the designer toward better design. If the reader is used to bad design, he must be led to accustom himself to better design. It is at this point that the printer enters the equation.[\\*] However little attention the reader needs to pay to the design of letters, it is obviously most necessary that the person who makes printing should be able to criticise and assess the qualities of letter forms.\"   \n   \n\\* Keep in mind that when this was written (1919), there wasn't yet a clearly distinct profession of \"graphic designer\" separate from the printer/compositor.

In the superficial, conscious meaning of \"expressive\" I might actually agree, but I can't be so dismissive of the receptiveness of the subconscious to visual stimuli. For example, I believe the shapes of the serifs in Charter versus Times make a difference in the mood they convey, but certainly Warde and company would consider both text faces. In truth, to me Times is actually less of a text face! But Warde (and maybe even Morison) could never see that.   \n   \nThen there's the issue of whether a human being can totally avoid expressing himself - in whatever small way. Sure, formalizing the expression and making it explicit leads away from Craft and towards Art, but when the creator and the consumer of something are both human, how can expression not be an ingredient?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I think people do notice the type and think about its pleasantness etc, but they tend to equate it with the graphic theme and use it as a prep for entering into the film's world.
