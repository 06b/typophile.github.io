  "content": "This past semester I had a graduate student taking my Digital Lettering class. Normally I have Sophmores and Juniors, but this guy was older and a lot more mature. After the first class we talked and I found out that he was a captain in the Marine Corps and he had been deployed to Iraq and was in Fallujah. I also found out that he was working on both a Masters in Design Technology, and an MBA at the same time. A very impressive guy.\n\nAnyway he spent the semester designing a typeface that he wanted to use on a website he was creating. Not a bad first font. But it is the content and perspective that really recommends the site\n\n[http://2dinar.com/issues/pages/brief.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201164943/http:/2dinar.com/issues/pages/brief.php \"http://2dinar.com/issues/pages/brief.php\")\n\nJames\n\n [‹ Favorite Geometric Sans like Futura/Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201164943/http:/typophile.com/node/36062 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New to Typophile.com?
