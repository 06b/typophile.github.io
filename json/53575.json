For someone who has been addicted to Sans for so long (and frankly afraid of Serif typefaces as there seems so much more subtlety in their choosing) this one is drawing me to it like a magnet...\n\nIt's a no sh\\*t kinda serif, and I love it!\n\nFor now I'll have to experiement with Renault, as I still think it's the closest overall.\n\n"
