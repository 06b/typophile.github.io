It’s good for clear ad legible headings which need a gentle and unobtrusive period touch, and is the latest is Greater Albion’s line of faces to explore the ‘small capitals’ idea.\n\nIn its regular weight, Chipperly’s glyphs are semi-shaded within an outer outline giving a distinctive look, while the Heavy weight maintains the separate outline but is completely filled. The Light form is an outline alone. All forms unite period elegance with the modern need for clear readability.\n\nLight:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Chipperly_l_5140.png)\n\nRegular:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Chipperl_R_4733.png)\n\nHeavy:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043219im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Chipperly_h_5778.png)\n\nSee some examples of Chipperly in action at Greater Albion's [announcements blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043219/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\nTry is out for yourself on [MyFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043219/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/chipperly/).\n\n",
