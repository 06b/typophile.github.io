      "content": "I've always liked Penumbra, although it's probably the font that's suffered most from Adobe's dumping of MM, since its whole point was to smoothly vary the serif design. Good thing you have the pre-castrated version.   \n   \nFor a matching text font, it would help to know how much serifness you'll be using Penumbra with.   \n   \n--   \n   \nBTW, as much as I don't enjoy recommending Berthold fonts these days, you should look at their new (actually pretty old) Nero as an alternative to Penumbra:   \n [http://www.bertholdtypes.com/home.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043831/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/home.html)   \nI know you like/love Mantinia - Nero has some cool ligs too.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I do have the font folios 8&9 (8 being where I had the MM faces).   \n   \nIdeas still?   \n   \nI was considering about a 600 setting for serif.   \nWhich is a little more than half way. I guess a little more the direction of serif, than wedge.   \n   \nhildebrant.\n\n"

Or Egyptian 505.   \nDo you have Warnock?   \n   \nOr if you want something really close to Penumbra, check out good ol' Albertus.   \n   \nWait, I got it! Kinesis.
