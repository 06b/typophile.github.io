  "content": "Downturn was most directly inspired by letters painted on the wall of an old medical warehouse in Washington, D.C.. Other inspirations include lettering on manhole covers, metal signs and machinery in New York and DC.\n\nIts quirky letterforms and deliberately uneven color reflect the typographic naiveté of signpainters and engineers more interested in impact than consistency. (That’s not a general dig at signpainters, just the typographically naive ones).\n\nChunky, in-your-face letters make Downturn appropriate for posters, packaging, headlines and other places you need a big impact.\n\n[Downturn is available for licensing at MyFonts—$25 per weight, $90 for the family.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015024650/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/dunwich/downturn/) Web embedding licenses will be available at a later date.\n\n[Click here to download a PDF specimen.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015024650/http:/dunwichtype.com/pdfs/Downturn_Specimen.pdf)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015024650im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Downturn_PosterTP_6412.jpg)\n\n",

That’s because Downturn is spaced _very_ tightly on the assumption that it will primarily be used at larger sizes. The tight spacing made the small caps clash with the caps in too many places, so they had to come down a little.\n\n"
