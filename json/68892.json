  "content": "I am currently running the beta version of MS Office 2010 on a Windows 7 system.\n\nI've just used FontLab (version 5.04 for Windows) to add a GSUB table containing an alternative stylistic set (ss01) to one of my existing TrueType fonts - the first time I've dabbled with an OpenType feature.\n\nWhen I tested the font in MS Publisher 2010 everything worked perfectly. But when I tested it in MS Word 2010, although the preview panel displayed the alternative glyphs correctly, it had no effect on the text itself.\n\nThis might just be a bug in the beta version of MS Word 2010, but the stylistic sets in Gabriola and other OpenType fonts all seem to work with it. On the other hand, if there is a problem with my font why does it work in MS Publisher 2010?\n\nI wonder if anyone else has experienced this problem with MS Word 2010?\n\n",
