I mean, I know someone who goes to a design school, and they literally worship Garamond. I just look at it and go, \"Great. That's a nice font.\" Personally, there are so many others I would prefer to use. I didn't go to design school so I didn't study all the history of the typeface and the intricacies of the typeface's bowl, stem, and whatever. I've read books about the typeface but nothing as interesting as they make it out to be.\n\n",

But if you are interested in design read on...\n\nI suggest that you start by looking at the range of them ( just what I haven't done yet ) and realize that there are many many Garamondes and other related faces that happen not to be named Garamond, and that there are plenty of differences. It might take your eye a while to find & feell them ( let your mind wander while you do this it might not help at first - too imapatient ) but when you do find them - it will may be a delicious moment for you. And Typomania may sset in quickly after that. HAHAHAHAHA!\n\nA side note: I have to admit that I don't love to read Garamonds. They seem spindly to me alot of the time. And fussy. But I have not compared them all and looked at them in a serious way. I have a feeling I would like Slimbach's version on account of it feeling a bit more robust...\n\n"

Since the mature Garamond's intention in his romans was, I think, to produce neutralised, better cut and multi-size versions of the De Aetna type - even inheriting over-dark caps from a book for which Griffo had only finished his new design's lowercase - that characterisation goes right back to the originals. Garamond Premier Pro, at least in the roman, therefore seems inherently odd to me - it aims for the authentic character of a body of work that was meant to be unsurprising except in the competence of its production. In a sense, Sabon Next, with its almost masochistic neutrality, is the digital type truest to Garamond's intentions.\n\nBut then I could be entirely wrong about this.\n\n"

I assume that Garamond Premier, as it does optical sizes, solves this problem. I don't have it, so I can't say.\n\n"

Baskerville is even more bookish, being most comfortable at around 13 point.\n\n\\> ITC increased the x-height, but not by any great leaps.\n\n?!  \nIt's so much larger that many people refuse to call  \nit a Garamond.

At the time this would be a major feat since every punch was hand-cut. Since we have infinite control over outlines now, this doesn't impress us, and we have literally thousands more types to choose from, so the presence of even a very true Garamond among them also doesn't impress us. There are so many types to choose from, many of them variations on Garamond, that Garamond has become a genre itself. The times are very different now. And our idea of what is beautiful and even-textured has evolved. For instance, in Garamond's time there weren't a slew of humanist sans designs to choose from, or even any sans designs to select from.\n\nReally, Garamond (the genre) is a very sturdy and readable kind of type, so it's had longevity. That long life is one reason it's admired.\n\n"

Many of them will suit better than Garamond on a given project because of their character, texture, rythm, features, etc...\n\nI like Dante for books and would love a chance to work with Collis as well, there you have to excellent book faces.\n\nHéctor\n\n"

I think would rather read a novel set in Beorcana than any Garamond I know of. Partly this is because the gramonds I know are digital and probably 'lesser' in a variety of ways. Partly this is because Beorcana has optical weights available which is no small advantage. And also it's true that the relationships of ascender & x height are more to my liking and probably more fashionable too. But finally, at least to me, it's just a better and more humane face. Put another way; when I am reading Garamonds I find my eye is just less accomodated than it is with Beorcana. Beorcana feel natural in a way that Garamonds can't match. And I don't think it's merely fondness etc. I think it's a case of being less visible as 'type' and thus doing the job better.\n\nJust in case anyone wants a gander ( Carl doesn't need to look I would bet... ) :\n\n[http://www.beorcana.com/specs3.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150202154409/http:/www.beorcana.com/specs3.html \"http://www.beorcana.com/specs3.html\")\n\nObviously there are more reasons than sheer utility to consider.
