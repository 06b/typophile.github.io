I wanted to do something which wold challenge me more than the norm, and I had the idea of separating text and image in an architectural magazine. This would allow articles to perhaps become bigger, without taking any importance away from the images which are separated.\n\nArchitecture, with art follows movements and styles, from Bauhaus to Deconstructivism, as does typography. So reflecting the nature of the article and thus images in the typographical layout for each spread, but then we have no images - so more white space to contend with. And then - maybe - the lack of continuity throughout.\n\nThis is a brief from two tutors, one of which I speak to alot, and he’s happy for me to be as experimental as i want as he believes i will learn more.\n\nI just wanted to hear your thoughts.\n\nI understand there could be alot of problems, and I think i maybe ’screwing’ myself over by doing this as the following is bothering me even though ive yet to start;\n\ntoo much white space  \nnot enough continuity\n\nTrying to figure out how I could navigate to and from these separations is interesting me - i also thought of using thumbnails or maybe just a portion of the image in each layout.\n\nattempt, or stay away?\n\n [‹ Font Identifying](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120154446/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39217 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo font / body text ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120154446/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39276 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
