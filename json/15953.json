I had mine for more than 20 years and sometimes used it to pull proofs of large lino cuts. The large 17x22 size is really nice.\n\nAt one time I had condsidered removing the feeder at the back of the press to make stream hand-feeding easier.\n\nAlso the 10x15 C&P is a nice gift.\n\nAnd the man offers free loading. what more could a person ask?\n\nJim\n\n"
