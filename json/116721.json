      "content": "Mike, not really a Clarendon, more like an emaciated version of the slab serif that we now label as Egyptian but was labelled as Antique in the 19th century.  \nStinkyfoot, Marder developed this font but others would have copied it by a process known as electrotyping and sold it as their own. A physical process similar to the electronic ones now used for stealing digital fonts and selling the clones. Font forgery was thriving then as now.  \nAs for the variation in the g, as I mentioned in my post this is most likely due to the fact that Marder almost certainly still cut the different font sizes by hand in 1887.  \nIdentity between different font sizes became possible with invention of the font pantograph by Linn Boyd Benton [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn\\_Boyd\\_Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317081616/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn_Boyd_Benton \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linn\\_Boyd\\_Benton\") which gave his company, which went on to be part of the core of ATF an edge over competitors like Marder which did not adopt the machine until a few years later.  \nBTW this is not to say that Marder felt at some stage that the g was sufficiently off that it should be recut. Or someone tinkered with their stolen version.  \nDon\n\n"

Note the respect the digital font shows to the differences of details between sizes in the original. For example, note the changes in the ear of the \\_g\\_.
