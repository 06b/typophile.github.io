  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nThis was from an ID question I was stumped on. The typeface is a serif that reminds me of ITC Usherwood, but is different in a number of ways. It resembles some of Les Usherwood’s other fonts too, but it isn’t anything I think I have seen before. It is used for navigation and titling on the site for [15 Central Park West](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181543/http:/www.15cpw.com/). It shows up on the covers of their Brochures, and inside some of them as well. It was from a brochure that I took the attached screenshot.\n\nAnyone recognize it?\n\nThanks,  \n- Mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181543im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Park15CPW_3933.gif)\n\n [‹ (x) Someecards website light sans - Gill Sans {Jan E}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181543/http:/typophile.com/node/37723 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Diesel Fall/Winter 2007 logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071017181543/http:/typophile.com/node/37730 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It resembles old 19th century typefaces, but I’ve been through all of Jaspert’s book, and McGrew’s, and the Rookledge Typefinder. I even looked through all Goudy’s works. The only thing remotely close to the A is Administer/Minister, and that’s about the only part that resembles this sample.\n\nThe only thing that I can find about ’Opera’ on the web is that it’s a Norwegian Browser that Microsoft was trying to buy.\n\nI’m going to try to go back to sleep. I hope someone can ID this thing, because I can’t believe this Real Estate developer would have a custom font designed.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

My first try at dbox didn’t get me to any menu I could read — just nice photographic panoramas, a la the Park views at the 15 CPW site.
