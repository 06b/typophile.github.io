There have not been many, which surprised me. One font called [Imperfect](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224091509/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/imperfect/) from T-26 was promising as a potential source of key words or similar fonts, but the results were not close. I also checked the Distressed/Strange Script fonts in my Guide, but not much was similar besides [Farmhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224091509/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-farmhaus/).\n\nIf I were trying to describe it I would say \"irregular sans\", but searches along these lines were not helpful.\n\nIt seems likely to be a freebie, but I don't know where to look.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
