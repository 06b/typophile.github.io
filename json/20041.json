At smaller sizes, I think it could use some wider tracking than in the specimen book.\n\nHere is what Erik Spiekermann says in the Introduction to the specimen book: \"What purpose was Dolly designed for? In small sizes--the ones we read--it looks like a warm, comfortable Garamondish, Minion-like Roman. Close up, we notice dozens of subtle curves and unusual shapes. The designers have managed to walk the fine line between their vanity (wanting to show off how good they are) and their purpose (to design other people will enjoy.)\"\n\nHe goes on to say other nice things about Dolly, which I think are very deserved, as I think it is one of the best recent text faces--which is why I bought the specimen book at TypeCon. Count me a fan of Dolly.\n\nMy printer--1200 dpi Xante tuned to 'light'--does thicken a bit more than offset, but I think that is not the difference. I have just looked at a few characters large (on the fontshop site and the PDF from Suitcase) and Dederon is both thicker and with less contrast in the normal weight. To me it just goes a little too far in that direction.\n\nAlso the design of Dederon to me is just flat-footed compared to the lively Dolly. Again, I don't have a printed sample, so there may be charms to Dederon that I don't see.\n\n"

The medium weight is far too heavy. Fair enough. The light, however, looks better suited for Display than anything else. It looks anemic. This is all at around 10 pts. The situation doesn't really improve at smaller sizes. In any case the letterspacing seems a little too wide and the x-height a little too small. All in all it looks like a cross between Mrs. Eaves and a slab serif.\n\nAnyone else notice this?\n\n"

Moreover, while there are a few stylistic similarities across some of the typefaces designed at Reading, I wouldn't say that Slab Serifs are a big theme, tackled by a majority of students there. Other directions seem much more prominent in my memory. FF Tisa stands out as a pretty unique typeface, I think.\n\n"

In my opinion, trapezoidal serifs aren't slab serifs, for example. But if you browse all of the typefaces on the Reading typefaces website ( [http://www.typefacedesign.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123135431/http:/www.typefacedesign.org/)), I think your see several different kinds of investigations.\n\n"
