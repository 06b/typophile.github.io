  "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIt's my first time posting and I don't have too much experience creating logos. I need some help in improving this logo. I am stuck at the moment. So any criticism would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe company name is called Bolling Steel. The client name is Bolling and they own a steel company, so that's the background to the logo.\n\nThank you!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [BollingSteel Logo.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233301/http:/typophile.com/files/BollingSteel%20Logo.pdf) | 84.18 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You're not off to a bad start. Here are some of my thoughts though with what you've shown here:  \n-Steer away from outlined type. It feels too weak for the strength you want to communicate.  \n-Make sure all your elements are perfectly aligned. Use guides, grids, rules, etc. Be as precise as you can, because with today's software, it's easy to be.  \n-You've already done this, but don't worry about color until you come up with a solid mark.  \n-Stay away from 3-D effects like embossing and drop-shadow.  \n-Do research.  \nGoogle \"steel\" and flip through the photographs  \nGo to [www.istockphoto.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233301/http:/www.istockphoto.com/ \"www.istockphoto.com\") and do the same thing (stay away from the vector art there though, it may be too cartoony for what you're after)  \nGo to Wikipedia and read up\n\nHope some of this helps. Good luck.\n\npenn\n\n"

Second versions in 2nd and 3rd lines resemble a computer input field with an I looking like a cursor.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the first row has the most potential, but it probably needs to have more weight and presence.\n\n"

Rebar is going to be easy to see and it won't be as decorated and fancy compared to how it is now. Then pair it with a larger bolder type (perhaps set it in two lines) and that's it, you got a winner.\n\nPS. Oh, and if you feel like keeping rivets, consider moving them into the whitespace between I's vertical strokes.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree that it needs to be one color because splitting it up compromises legibility. I can see a roman numeral two and a 3, or Il3. Stick to one color, or keep each letter completely one color.\n\nI think the rivets could work well, but they're not quite right yet. Maybe use them on the outer corners to rivet the whole logo to the background? Play around.\n\nI'd also try Bolling Steel on two lines because right now, it's too small compared to the mark, and it risks being read as \"Boiling Steel\" which is, well, just weird. Setting it in all caps might be the problem? Small caps may help, or perhaps all lowercase? It's one of those words that needs precise kerning, too, so once you settle on a layout and/or font, kerning could make you crazy.\n\nOnce you're crazy, you'll officially be an experienced designer. :)\n\n"

Have you tried exploring shapes that are not based on a letter?\n\n"
