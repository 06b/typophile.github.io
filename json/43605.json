      "content": "I may be wrong, but the way the letters in Beau-soir look reminds me of what happens when you start playing with outline points in Illustrator. I would guess at least part of it started out as a square sans like [Europa Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205304/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/europa-grotesque-rr/extra-bold/) that has been flattened. Maybe something squarer, but you get the idea.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
