There's a lot of visceral, unconscious reaction to a candidate that has an effect, and their approving a weak looking logo to me was symptomatic. I am still upset with Kerry's miserable performance.\n\nI saw two reporters interviewed about their very interesting book on Clinton and the current president Bush. Surprisingly, they said the two shared some things that were key to their electoral victories. First, they didn't get rattled when they had a reverse, but continued strongly on their campaigns. Second, they both knew what they wanted to do as President, and could say so coherently and forcefully, in 30 seconds, 3 minutes and 30 minutes. Of course Clinton knew infinitely more about policy, but that is another issue.\n\nMy main concern about Obama is that he may represent a beautiful spirit but not clear policy. Aside from opposing the war, which is of course very important, we don't know what he wants or how he would govern.\n\n"

For at least the last 8 years the Republicans have. Even the logo W ( and it was a logo) was brilliant. It was brilliant because it falsely but effectively suggested a pal-like intimacy with W.

I think these things count.\n\n\\* If you can call it that when referring to Kerry, or Gore or Clinton\n\nOn that note, I hope Obama goes with a slightly heavier weight in future. The weight he has now is hopeful but not resolute.\n\nI am not vainy imagining that a logo can make a party succesful. But it is one of the tools to get the job done!

In the 1990s this might have worked in his favor, as he would have been able to travel the nation speaking and actually provide worthwhile answers in the debates. In this election it's a liability, as the numerous early primaries limit his ability to do a lot of speaking, and the crowded field will either limit debate responses to minuscule amounts of time or drag the debates on so long that only journalists will be watching.\n\n<cite>I heard a black woman on the Colbert Report complaining that Obama wasn’t black enough...<cite></cite></cite>\n\nRace, as a topic of conversation, is always at its ugliest in the political arena. It's almost scary how crass, stupid, or downright nutty politicos appear when discussing race. Joe Biden is a perfect example; by bringing up race his run became what will be remembered as the shortest presidential campaign in history.\n\n"

No one goes to the voting booth because so-and-so's logo was cool. Who moved you? That's what people vote on. If anything, sometimes overly slick design can shoot you in the foot...people don't think you're real then. Personally, I'd rather eat at the greasy spoon joint where they spend more money on butter, than that tré chic place down the street with the swan folded napkins and the cool logo. And I'm a designer!\n\nThat being said, George W's materials...as Eben pointed out— were brilliant. But they could have been done with Arial and been effective. Its about concept...not the look. You can really focus on design and still lose a campaign, case in point: [Jim Esch for Congress](http://web.archive.org/web/20130115122423/http:/www.jimesch.org/).\n\nLobbying, grassroots efforts, fundraising...there are TONS of other factors in play here.

This logo stuff is too much 'marketing'--a calculated feel-good message.\n\nThe speech has something very good, and something disquieting about it. The very good thing is that Obama sees that a central problem is that our politics is broken in partisan wrangling instead of solving problems.\n\nWhat is disquieting, to me anyway, is that he seems to be relying on the force of his personality to change this. He says that good policies are not lacking--which I really questiion by the way. But more than that he does not lay out which policies he could make a reality, and why he could do it when others can't.\n\nDukakis, Gore and Kerry all had the same problem. As I mentioned above, the two journalist pointed out that neither Clinton nor Bush had that problem. I will be looking with great interest to see whether Obama can pass that test of self-definition in a politically successful way.\n\nMarketing ain't going to do it. And certainly a logo or lack of one isn't going to do it. But they are revealing signals of what is going on, and not going on. Not as persuaders, but as indicators.\n\n"

This will consume most of his time and effort for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile presidential campaigns do not hinge on their visual design, in my opinion, I think that it is OK that they have designs.
