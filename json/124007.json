Looks like some kind of Futura Display or a Gotham / Gothic Display, but not sure so listing under Sans. I think G, R, A, M, Y, S are the most unique out of these letters that will help to identify.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [lHmzsWF.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423013642/http:/typophile.com/files/lHmzsWF_0.png) | 85.02 KB |\n\n",

The link posted by Riccardo reminded me of this.  \nAs for the letters in the image this could be lettering rather than a font as such. It would not be out of place as a US WPA poster from the 1930s. Also note from the Chank Diesel interview that this style was popular among signmakers because it was so easy to execute. I recall seeing many such signs in my rambles across North America years ago that had these general features. Most of these are now gone, replaced by chain brands of little artistic character.  \nIMO Liquorstore is a good choice for a substitute.  \nDon\n\n"

I've asked Aaron on Instagram, so hoping to hear back from him since he's uses this lettering pretty often and I do believe it's a font, though it looks like it could be a combo of these two WPA fonts. I'll keep you posted!\n\n"

Outage, Onramp, and Refrigerator are really good. A few of the ones you mentioned have a wider selection of glyphs with the rounded A and non-slabbed? S. Thanks, Don! Not just the weight, but the kerning looks better on Industry, which would save a ton of time. If I can't find the exact font, I'll probably end up needing to use two different ones to achieve the look I want. Still looking, but this helps a lot for Plan B! Still hoping to hear back from Aaron, but think he would've responded by now.\n\n"
