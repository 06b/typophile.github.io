This typeface does not appear on the Allegro Coffee Roasters site as far as I can tell. It seems to be specific branding for Allegro inside Whole Foods Market. I've only seen it at the Whole Foods on 3rd and Third. I've tried Identifont and What the Font to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Trade Gothic \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072216/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

Can't be Franklin Gothic to me, mainly because of /G and /O external (left) outline which looks like a straight line on your sample and curved on FG. To me, that's either [Trade Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072216/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic) (Condensed) Bold or [Alternate Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072216/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt) #3.\n\n"
