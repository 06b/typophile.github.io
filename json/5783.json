The closest match so far is Craig Kroeger's (miniml.com): Standard 09\\_56, which has a similar l/c 'a', not quite the same height though.   \n   \nIf anyone had any leads, it would be much appreciated.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100309133923im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41477.jpg)\n\n",
