I’m starting a small web design business to earn extra money for school.\n\nThe logo will accompany a new design for [my website](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919172621/http:/www.gurrydesign.com/ \"Gurry Design\") which I want to have a gardening theme. The idea is that I can help people “grow” their business with a well-designed website (sounds korny, I know, but it should be good when it all comes together).\n\nSo here are my two variations of the logo. Your thoughts and comments are much appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [leaf-logos.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919172621/http:/typophile.com/files/leaf-logos.gif) | 8.48 KB |\n\n [‹ serif font to go with FF DIN](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919172621/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12785 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) type on Begian highway signs - VSS ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080919172621/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12930 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I can think of plenty (a blossoming branch, a root system, a tree trunk, a leaf, fruit, etc.); my problem is connecting that to business. What are some things that show business? All I can think of are those generic photos of people in business suits climbing stairs.\n\nEben, I like your tendril idea, but I’m not sure people would know what it was. They might mistake it for a vine or even a coil and then the metaphor is lost.\n\n"

      "content": "I think that you may be treating the logo a little to litteral a manner here. You probably shouldn’t be creating some frankenstein hybrid of a kind of platonic ideas/icons of ’business’ & of ’growth’. Like a tendril making a dollar sign... god forbid. That might be okay for a spot illustration in some ham handed business journal- but not a logo.\n\nThe purpose of your logo aught to be to:\n\n1. **Be Different** I know I sound like an advert but it’s true all the same. I1f your doesn’t do this - especially as a designer - a basic tentpole is missing. Who are you competing with? Look at them & be different. Being yourself may well be enough.\n\n2. **Be memorable.** This is different than being Different. Really. This is the graphic equivalent of a catchy song hook. You want something that you look at & you find yourself looking again. It’s not a trick - it’s a behaivior of the eye you want & then of the brain.\n\n3. **Be yourself.** This is tricky & very subjective. You want to have a logo that you don’t feel is false, a fake or feels like a sham. For instance, if you were a small neiborhood florist you might not want a chilly multinational corprate style logo. You would want something warmer, friendlier, and maybe more classic classy or fun.\n\n4. **Be fast.** A logo that takes too long to communicate or be understood is a deadly logo. This is one of the reasons that a hybrid is out. It takes too long to understand & an impatient eye moves on. If the logo doesn’t do it’s basic job in the short time it takes to glance at it- it’s not that great. I’m not saying it should be a pleasure too look at for longer - just that it needs communicate it’s basic message **very** quickly.\n\nIt isn’t key that an idea as such is imbeded in a logo. Especially for a service industry. Look at the most successful logos - Mercedes, Apple, DKNY - pick your own. You won’t find an idea in almost any really successful logo. You will find they evoke a feeling in you. That feeling is enough. And a treatment of Type is often enough to create that feeling.\n\nIn terms of process I would make a list of words or phrases that describe the kind of assumptions that you want your logo to create in a viewer. Take stock of your target.  \nMake sure it’s the target you really want.\n\n"

      "content": "Peter, asking a web design business to grow business might be a little of an over promise, unless you are tied into marketing people and writers. I think the best you can do is offer website design as a tool to help grow a business. Even then you’d need statistics showing growth and percentages vs other kinds of sales promotion and marketing. I think I’d approach your web design business differently, something along the lines of “personal touch” or “one on one” design. Imply your designs aren’t cookie cutters but solve a businesses particular problem. Just some thoughts\n\n"

Although, I do offer eBay template design which really can contribute directly to more sales. That service is one I want to feature much more prominently with my new design. In any case, I really do want to set myself apart from other web design businesses by being personable. Being a one man show gives me some advantages over the competition, particularly that I can give more attention to my clients. That’s something I do want to highlight on my new site and even in my logo. Perhaps it would be best to go for a wordmark rather than using some kind of symbol. What do you guys think?\n\n"

You could also work on a job & use some of the funds from that for the font later.... Having a logo in no way guarantees work.
