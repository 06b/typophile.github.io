  "content": "I am seeking advice for a font to be used for a corporate identity package, for a food hall based in London, UK.  \nThe customer would like to portray high perceived value, and should have mass market appeal.\n\nThe project is based upon an underlying narrative of, new life being breathed into a \"tired, archaic \" building. It really tells a story of the juxtaposition of New and Old....a repurposing with a new concept.\n\nThe project is a redevelopment of a 500,000 sqft building, built circa 1862. The repurposing of the space will include a 45,000 sqft food hall, that will provide Artisan quality foods offered by business operators with an operational history, generations deep.\n\nI know that Goudy Old Style has its fair share of opinions, but there are certain elements that I do like about this font set  \nPrimarily, it's soft rounded serifs . I'd really like to hear your opinions and advice, for alternative fonts that I might try to illustrate the points mentioned above.\n\nThanks for your time,  \nJeremy\n\n",

      "content": "As far as i recall Goudy Old Style is already taken by some big British warehouse (or defintely was, though i do not exactly remember which one it was), therefore i would not recommend using this typeface. There are lots of other Antique styled typefaces with soft rounded serifs. Look at all the different Garamonds, for example.  \nBetween old & new maybe something in the direction of a [typeface without serifs](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416055334/http:/typematters.de/tmt_MS.html) would do the job also pretty well. The roundness can be found in its italic.\n\n"
