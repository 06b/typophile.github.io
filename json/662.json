(This will be my first ATypI since 1994 in San Francisco - I still recall being momentarily stunned after absent-mindedly wandering through a billowing plume of Neville Brody's cigarette smoke...)   \n   \nHowever, I do believe that [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524235950/http:/www.veer.com/) will be sending at least of couple of our designer-types to the annual AIGA square-dance.\n\n"
