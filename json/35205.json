I would appreciate suggestions.\n\n“poco” is a musical term (italian) meaning “little”\n\nI emphasized this trait because I am small, and also the aspect of the spiritual. I design a lot of small websites, nonprofit, blogs, and church sites.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200728im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pococreative_3911.png)\n\nMany thanks.\n\n [‹ Personal Letterform Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200728/http:/typophile.com/node/36713 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Thoughts about logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200728/http:/typophile.com/node/36535 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I think you might trying to communicate a lot in your mark. Do you think Poco might have a negative meaning for your company name? Little Creative...hmmm. In a second thought it also is quite interesting. Kinda like the david and goliath idea. Small, but powerful. The angel, I just don’t think I like. Maybe instead of an actual angel you have wings incorporated somehow or a halo. Typography, I like the feel of ’poco’, ’creative’ doesn’t seem to connect with the feel of ’poco’. Anyway, just some thoughts.\n\nmg\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your thoughts and tips. I guess I am trying to say a lot, and I don’t necessarily want to emphasize the angel/spiritual, but I thought it was a neat idea. I had a bird/dove at first with just a ’lady’ (not angel), but it kind of seemed to resemble a towel (ha), and I can’t seem to find the perfect font for ’creative.’ These were mockups along those lines that I made last month but dismissed (just rough screenshots).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200728im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture3_5083.jpg)\n\nCertainly the david / goliath is what I’m implying with the name and any mark ideas... Before the ’angel’ idea, here is what was going through my head concerning the little/big concept...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200728im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture2_5326.jpg)\n\nSo you can see I’m still quite in the brainstorming phase. IMHO I am more gifted at coding than graphic design, but I think surely I can come up with something I am pleased with to represent myself to clients. I can be patient and work at it, but at the same time I want to get it up on my main site in the near future, so I will have something substantial for my business.\n\n"

The combination of script and geometric type styles I find jarring, the proportion and composition is not helping, I would look at a less geometric sans or all script.\n\nIn brainstorming mode, maybe you could use ‘the best things come in small packages’ as another option.\n\nTim\n\n"
