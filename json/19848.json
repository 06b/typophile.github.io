I know Calibri, Candara, and Corbel (3 of the new fonts in Windows Vista) promise to bring sans oldstyle figures to the masses next year... but is there any font that’s common in today’s Windows systems that also includes OSF?

Even of the defaults that ship with Adobe for Windows, most of the sans-serifs (all of them?) don’t have oldstyle figures, and as far as I know, none have real small caps. Hopefully with Vista MS will be escaping from typography based on the capabilities of a typewriter.\n\n"

Perhaps Microsoft may be getter more serious about typography than Apple.\n\nAnd about OSF in the default set XP... probably not... check in character map for all the text san serif faces. With advent of OpenType the bar has been raised higher so ligatures, small caps, and other typographic niceties are automatic (or at least in reach) for the lay person. But its not something that completely ’there’ yet.\n\n;-)\n\nMikey\n\n"

I was hoping to choose Candara or Calibri but have a reasonably close backup for XP, 2000, and Mac users...\n\nLooks like I’ll go with “Lucida Sans” variants - no OSF, but a nice feel on both platforms and installed by default.\n\nMy company’s site, BTW, is [videoaidedinstruction.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821140513/http:/www.videoaidedinstruction.com/). Any constructive criticism (besides its not being true CSS-XTML)?\n\nThanks again,  \n—Michael.\n\n———————————————————————————  \n// love what you do or do something else. //  \nMichael Ebert — graphic designer, jazz saxophonist, horror movie devotee  \n [http://homepage.mac.com/mwebert](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821140513/http:/homepage.mac.com/mwebert \"http://homepage.mac.com/mwebert\")  \n [mwebert@mac.com](mailto:mwebert@mac.com)  \n———————\n\n"

      "content": "Michael\\> I checked out your site. It looks like you have already went with Candara. I had to install it to check out your site. Then I uninstalled it to see how it would look in Lucida.\n\nWith Candara it looks great! The formatting is excellent and the welcome letter looks good as well as the contact section at the bottom.\n\nBut when I uninstalled it. Lucida kicked in and it looks acceptable. The line spacing changes and looks a little too loose. Not bad but not perfect. Probably nothing to worry about. The only thing that does not look good is the parts where you see the caption for the dvds “New Calculus Series” and others. The text is formated with the dvd image and depending on how people have text settings or what default fonts they have installed the words wrap in unpleasing ways. It did for me. I think you should convert these parts to png or gif images.\n\nAlso I looked at the site with Candara installed and not, with Safari and Firefox. Firefox renders better.\n\nBut Micheal, I generally think its premature to install Candara now. Not even other Windows users have it. I got it because I had to look for it (probably something I’m not even supposed to have). When Vista comes around the whole world will then have these new fonts.\n\nI checked Skia... it does not have a bold, so that’s not gonna work. Lucida is your best bet on the mac. Verdana is ugly. Georgia is lovely... have you thought about that?\n\nHope I helped,\n\nMikey\n\nPS... your site could use some color to make it more inviting... but not a big deal.\n\n"

My client (that is, day gig boss) doesn’t want any punchy color so as not to compete with the packaging of the products. He’s a bit of an Apple-phile, as am I.\n\nRegarding the type, I thought about switching to Georgia for the headlines and a sans for the specs, but I think it’s cleaner this way. And, yes, I do need to address those line breaks. Perhaps you’re right about making these headlines into images. Hmmm...\n\nI guess Candara is premature for now, but it’ll be an added bonus for any Windows Vista beta testers until next year. No harm, no foul, right?\n\nAnyway, thanks again.
