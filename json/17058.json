Even worse things get, if someone new is smart enough to download some of the “10 000 free fonts” collections available on filesharing servers (most of which are illegal and useless anyway) and install them to proudly demonstrate their abilities. I believe in the ’less is more’ philosophy and for many reasons try to remove as many of them as I dare.\n\nSo can anyone provide me a list with the essential fonts that Windows and web pages commonly use, so I would be sure as to what I can throw out without much harm done :)?\n\n",

Windows is common among small DTP businesses here (eastern europe) because of the (local) cost advantages - Apple retailers are still expensive. But then again - recently the performance gap between apple/pc has become a lot less noticeable given that we use Adobe CS for all we do.\n\n"

Although we have finaly managed to go fully legal, the costs still hurt, as the sofware prices are western, but our income - post-soviet :D, which means about 4-5 times less. But I have included several copies of Suitcase in our 2006 shopping list. :))\n\n"

FontExplorer is just a tool to view and search for Linotype fonts.\n\n“FontExplorer X” is the a font management tool from Linotype, which will additionally let customers easily purchase and install fonts from Linotype and other foundries on their computers. Currently, it is only available as a beta-program for Mac OS X. But the full version for Mac, and a public beta version for Windows, will be available soon.\n\nSo, unfortunately, PC users aren’t able to manage their fonts with FontExplorer X just yet. Sorry for the confusion.\n\n"

When installing, use a custom installation - choosing only to install BitStream Font Navigator (it is in the Utilities section).\n\nIt is free, easy to use, quick, and has pretty much all the necessary features.\n\n"
