Looks about right.\n\nToo bad LettError doesn't provide a better sample at their site, the lc t is slightly different/changed, was wondering if there where more inconsistencies. Could just be an older version though...\n\nAlways love to find new and obscure fonts, this one looks great. Not too happy about the kerning in that PDF though, but could be bad design.\n\nAnyway, thanks!\n\n"
