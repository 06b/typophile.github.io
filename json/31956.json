      "content": "It might sound like the designer’s disease\\*, but Scala may actually appear ‘too big’ at 10pt…\n\nWilliam’s right in that the line length and leading determine readability; Ellen Lupton’s book is not stationery-sized, and therefore her typography (including the choice of font and the measure) reflect this. In fact one could take any of Jeff’s four font choices at 10pt and make them all completely _unreadable_ with bad-enough decisions on line length and leading.\n\nGenerally the software gives 1/5th or 20% the point size as ‘auto leading’ which is too close – particularly for sans serifs. The other thing, as William says, is that a single column on letter or A4 is too wide. For 10pt Scala I’d be looking at a line length of around 106mm (assuming everyday English, rather than technical English or a text with lots of long words) which implies margins of around 55mm either side on a letter-sized document.\n\n\\*generally the client wants the text set bigger, the designer wants it set smaller…\n\n"
