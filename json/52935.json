      "content": "Thanks, Aziz!  \nThe overall layout looks beautiful, to my (still) ignorant eyes the type looks stronger than the Hakim Ghazali, but some of the finishing looks unwillingly irregular, like it was partly autotraced (some letters seems also to join irregularly).  \nThis brings up an issue about digitizing while mantaining irregular and rough finishes with better quality, an issue I have been constantly dealing with since 1993… :=)\n\nI'm sorry I can't understand anything of those graphics4arab pages you are linking… :=(\n\n"
