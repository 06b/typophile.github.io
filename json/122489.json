  "content": "Hi,\n\nthis is my first post in the forum. Let me first introduce myself. My name ist Karsten (alias PoohBear) and I have lately found this new interesting software fontforge. And it amazes me what one can do with the software, I am not into fontdesign professionally, but I am playing with the idea of creating my own stuff. I love to play with all kinds of things.\n\nAnyway, I am not getting fontforge to kern those few letters that I have designed. I am testing those few letters \"ABCDEaoge\" in browsers by inserting  \n@font-face {  \n font-family: \"myFont\";  \n src: url(\"myFont.ttf\") format('truetype');  \n}  \nI have read that a font is no good without kerning, so I want do get it right from the start. Sorry if this post sounds newbie to you. But that is what I actually am. I've tried the options button before generating the font, checked \"windows-compatible kern\" and tried the oder checkboxes too. It simply doesn't work for \"Tage\"\n\nI'd appreciate your help.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [kern.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317130514/http:/typophile.com/files/kern.png) | 99.61 KB |\n| [Tage.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317130514/http:/typophile.com/files/Tage.png) | 4.57 KB |\n\n",
