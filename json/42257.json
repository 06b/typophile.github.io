I'm doing the logotype for a church, and I need an organic script font to use for the word \"Genesis.\" Ideally something very readable, something that feels very natural and looks current and clean. Any help is hugely appreciated!\n\nMatt\n\n",

Cut off the trailing tail on the ending 's' for instance. Some fonts, like Ambiance, have contextual alternates for this purpose, but there aren't many in this genre.\n\n"
