  "content": " **Veer Announces: New Umbrella Typefaces for May 2004**   \n   \nVeer is pleased to announce the availability of several new and exclusive typefaces this month - all part of our growing [Umbrella](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/umbrella/) collection. These typefaces can be found in the May edition of the [Veer Visual Elements Catalog](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/ideas/catalogs/) and on our web site.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Umbrella Ayumi](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35636.gif)   \n [Ayumi](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000026) by Neil Summerour **{ Umbrella }** Ayumi (pronounced, 'ah-yoo-me') comes from the Japanese word 'to walk', representative of this face's walking the fine line of quirkiness and utility. Ayumi is as much an unserif as it is a san serif. Distinct characters like the rigid 'g', the quirky 'y', and the slight curl of the true italics provide subtly unique features without calling too much attention. The Ayumi family includes eight weights: Light, Normal, Medium, Bold, plus italics and is available is three different packages.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Umbrella Headcold](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35637.gif)   \n [Headcold](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000028) by Neil Summerour **{ Umbrella }** Got a fever? Head pounding? Headcold takes two aspirin and asks that you call it in the morning when you need a display face. This heavy display font adds even more personality with dingbats showing off how they feel. Headcold comes in two variations: Regular and Shadow   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Umbrella Brisa](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35638.gif)   \n [Brisa](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000027) by by Alejandro Paul & Angel Koziupa **{ Umbrella }** Another fine example of the casual script by the Argentine team of Paul and Koziupa. Quicker than lightning and just as poignant, Brisa shows unprecedented determination, presence of spirit, and confidence. Brisa comes with two weights: Regular and Alternates   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Umbrella Pill Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35639.gif)   \n [Pill Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000043) by by Christian Robertson **{ Umbrella }** The long awaited first release by Betatype's Christian Robertson, Pill Gothic is a geometrically constructed font designed plainly enough for traditional text settings, but funky enough to have a cool edge. The family offers a complete set of tools for expert typesetting, with OpenType features including small caps, old style numerals, small cap numerals, fractions and alternate characters. These features are also available to OS X native applications (Cocoa) as AAT (Apple Advanced Typography) features in the TrueType version. The complete Pill Gothic family includes normal and condensed varieties and a full range of weights making it a superbly flexible text family. [Several packages](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?producttype=typ&keyword=%22Pill%20Gothic%22) are available exclusively from Veer.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Umbrella Mince](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35640.gif)   \n [Mince](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000036) by Corey Holms **{ Umbrella }** Stretching the human mind and its capacity to grasp order and establish meaning, Mince amuses itself by inflating font forms to the limits of comprehension, implying a palpable roundness as though suffering from over-inking. Singularly, each character is abstracted to the furthest point of legibility, but when viewed as a word, the pattern emerges and the viewers' brain completes the circuit. The Mince family includes two weights: Regular and Shadow   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \n ![Umbrella Kautiva](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/35641.gif)   \n [Kautiva](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=UMT0000035) by Alejandro Paul **{ Umbrella }** Kautiva is a comprehensive modern sans serif family that includes true italics, small caps, and unicase variations. Kautiva was developed to be efficient in both text and display environments and serves as a refreshing middle ground between serious geometric and overly humanistic design. The OpenType format Kautiva Pro family is available for those who want to take advantage of the numerous features of the format: from true small caps to a variety of ligatures and stylistic alternates, through proportional and tabular figures and complete support for a multitude of Latin-based languages, as well as Cyrillic and Greek scripts. [Several packages](http://web.archive.org/web/20141120101637/http:/www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?producttype=typ&keyword=kautiva) are available exclusively from Veer.   \n   \n............................................................................................................................................   \n   \nFor more information regarding these new type products, contact:   \n   \nJacqueline Wallace   \n403 313 4942   \n [media@veer.com](mailto:media@veer.com)\n\n",
