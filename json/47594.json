  "content": "So, I have about 5 years experience as a designer. 3 years in publishing with some promotions experience, and a little over a year and a half at a small agency (5 people) specializing in animal health/medical advertising.\n\nMy goal since getting out of publishing, has been to go work at an agency where my skills fit in- it’s not where I work now.\n\nSo, taking a job at an internal design department for a company NOT involved in something I am really interested in (more medical stuff) is probably a step in the WRONG direction, yeah?\n\nMy goal had been to keep building my portfolio in this job and on my own, for at least another 6 months, and really focus on the places where I live that would be a more diverse set of clients and hopefully it would be somewhere I could stay for awhile.\n\nI am 28, so I am kind of ready for something closer to a dream job.\n\nSo tell me, anything other than an agency, knowing my goals, is a bad move, no matter how much I dislike this position I am in, right?\n\n [‹ URGENT!
