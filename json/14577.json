  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am seeking for some insight on the id I am working on at the moment. It’s almost a pro bono job, but I want to be able to show it off later. The guys produce a variety of TV shows and films (not a broadcasting company, just direction and filming). They work from UK (this is why Gill Sans looks so well for them) :)  \nI was trying to play with “alliance” and stumbled over the Nebulae typeface. I’ve modified it a bit to achieve a less detailed pattern. I’ve also tried a more abstract “circle” instead of a “B”.  \nAnyway.\n\nI would appreciate any comments from the board.\n\nCheers,  \nAlexey\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [phile\\_baltid\\_4.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081004234815/http:/typophile.com/files/phile_baltid_4.gif) | 10.66 KB |\n| [phile\\_baltid\\_5.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081004234815/http:/typophile.com/files/phile_baltid_5.gif) | 8.92 KB |\n\n [‹ hidef web design logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081004234815/http:/typophile.com/node/14466 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Splash Design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081004234815/http:/typophile.com/node/14046 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The B’s in the first two options look distorted due to how they are made up, this gives a slight unfinished impression (maybe a very (very) light blue plain background B behind the ahem wiggly bits may help?). Fontwise Gill Sans looks far better.. it’s also pretty timeless, the other font option would date quite fast I would think.\n\n"

I did try to see some examples, but the only reference I have at the moment is “The Shock of The New” which is quite a good reading, but has nothing to do with graphic design. Paul Rand’s “Designer’s Art” inspired me a bit.\n\nAnd here is what I’ve done so far. I’ve started with form 1. And am actually tweeking it for the last three days without any success I could be proud of. I need some more insights and your comments, if you please.\n\nGone catching on with the sleep.\n\n[http://www.xtati.com/\\_misc/baltid/baltv\\_id\\_6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081004234815/http:/www.xtati.com/_misc/baltid/baltv_id_6.jpg \"http://www.xtati.com/\\_misc/baltid/baltv\\_id\\_6.jpg\")\n\n"

I saw a logo made with leaves that I thought was pretty strong in eye magazine once.\n\nAbout the abstract stuff - clearly you have the main idea about this formal style - but I don’t see what idea is being driven at. What are these marks saying? The best of these marks have a message that they are attempting to distill I think. Adopting the style is not enough.\n\nIt doesn’t sound like this client has told you much about what they want other than they want something simple. If you can’t get more out of them then I think you have to suggest what you think they should have - you have to invent a meaning for the logo. Am I right about this client or reading into the thread too far?\n\nIf you are totally stuck you could just suggest a ’word mark’. What could be wrong with that?\n\n"

Which is so much abstract that it doesn’t read it, but probably hints on the idea of some kind of [distant] alliance. Which it apparently does not either, as I see from your comment.\n\nA wordmark could also be a variant, though I do tend to have some kind of icon to be able to use separately as well.\n\nNo, the client haven’t left a lot of comments to base my research on. :/\n\n"

But I think it’s too hard to see.\n\nAlso, Why ’Ba’ as opposed to bal or balt or just b?\n\nJust ’b’ seems the simplest and the most in keeping with reductionist modernism. You could have a tall ascender rectangle & a circle. Done.\n\nYou could also play with it ... & have a ball maybe with a silly highlight & shadow & then ’tic’. Get it?\n\nI would like to know why they chose that name. It seems odd. On the other hand isn’t there a food store in England called Iceland? Actually that almost makes more sense. Iceland could refer to frozen food.\n\nIf you knew why they chose baltic that might be a route to a good fit in the design.\n\nI just checked out your site\n\n[http://www.xtati.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081004234815/http:/www.xtati.com/ \"http://www.xtati.com/\")\n\nNice stuff!\n\n"
