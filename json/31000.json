  "content": "I'm working on a lovely job to design a brochure for an architectural practice who have designed a buiding for an eye hospital. The brochure will act as a showcase for the project and is aimed at their clients and the wider architectural community. The finish size will be 210 x 210mm and very image-led.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has any ideas for a typeface that might be appropriate. I was thinking that one designed with good legibility in mind might be a place to start – or is that too much of a cliche given the subject of the brochure?\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n",

Its more a question of composition, proportion and Spacing to make it look spectacular ... Just try with Helvetica on a photographic background until it looks like a Architecture Book, should work out just fine.\n\n"

They do some lovely work and seem particularly good at working with – and considering – the end users of the buildings they design. I wanted the choice of typeface to reflect that in some way.\n\n"
