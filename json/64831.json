  "content": "Hi,\n\nFrom 1887—1897 a chap called Robert Coupland Harding wrote, composed & distributed a periodical called 'Typo'. I've seen them in the flesh, they're utterly fascinating. Amongst other things, he was receiving type specimens from all the important international foundries, which was seemingly unusual for the time. What's even more interesting is that he reviewed the new typefaces with honesty & wit. The good news is that the whole lot has been digitised & is available online.\n\nThis is the [introduction by Sydney Shep](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416043040/http:/www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-SheTypo.html), this is the table of contents for all [11 volumes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416043040/http:/www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-corpus-typo.html).\n\nHave a poke around. There's bound to be something in there of interest.\n\nFrom the intro:\n\n\"Typo. A Monthly Newspaper and Literary Review [1887-1897] is a landmark in New Zealand printing and publishing, famous in its time, then forgotten, and now re-discovered. In addition to a wealth of information ranging from the latest domestic and international news about printing and the allied book trades, Typo includes book reviews such as Julius Vogel’s Anno Domini or Women’s Destiny , tipped in specimens featuring a full-colour cover design for Edward Tregear’s Potona, or Unknown New Zealand , and articles about the latest developments in phonography, stenography, universal language, and “Kaliografi.” This periodical is an example of a worldwide phenomenon of the nineteenth century, the typographical journal. What sets it apart, however, is the attention paid to its visual display. The series of articles entitled « Design in Typography » are both singularly important and astute contributions to the international dialogue about aesthetics and offer clear and concise instructions to the practical printer.\"\n\nAbout Robert:\n\n\"Robert Coupland Harding. has often been portrayed as New Zealand’s most accomplished typographer and printer, but today he remains virtually unknown. Historically resting in the shadow of William Colenso (1811-1899) who is famous for printing the Bible in Maori and the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand’s founding document, Harding’s story is a compelling example of technical virtuosity overlaid with pointed critical acumen, quiet self-possession punctuated by determined professionalism. From 1887-1897, he singled-handedly wrote, composed, printed and internationally distributed Typo. A Monthly Newspaper and Literary Review. This journal represents the pinnacle of a career devoted to the world of visible language.\"\n\n",
