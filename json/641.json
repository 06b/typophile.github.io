  "content": "The ATypI Vancouver team has launched the first phase of an extensive city guide for attendees at this year's conference. The site includes general information about the Vancouver area, photos, a transportation guide, and suggested activities for those who are planning a vacation around the conference or bringing their families. Information from the ATypI team is supplemented with a hand-picked selection of links.   \n   \n [http://www.atypi.org/40\\_conferences/28\\_Vancouver/10\\_venue](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020030156/http:/www.atypi.org/40_conferences/28_Vancouver/10_venue)   \n   \nIn late-July, the guide will be updated with information about the two conference venues: the Westin Bayshore Resort & Marina (where the pre-conference technology workshop, the Thursday night reception and keynote address, and the Friday morning plenary session will take place), and Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design (where the remainder of the conference will happen).   \n   \nIn mid-August, the guide will be updated again, with restaurant, bar and nightclub suggestions and maps.   \n   \nJohn Hudson   \nATypI 2003 programme planning committee   \n [www.atypi.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020030156/http:/www.atypi.org/)\n\n",
