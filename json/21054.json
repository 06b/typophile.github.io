  "content": "Hello. This is my first post here, pardon for my bad english.\n\nI am working on a logotype for \"the darth vader heritage foundation\" (student project).  \nThe brief talks about vader as a \"tragic hero\". This is most important guideline to build the logotype.\n\nI have built 2 versions of the word \"anakin\" (both were once garamond regular) - one for the more \"formal\" side of the institution and the other for the dark process vader had gone through to become the dark lord and become my tragic hero.\n\nThank you for your comments.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Untitled-1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019055310/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1_4.gif) | 33.46 KB |\n\n",
