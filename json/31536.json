However, the position of the first c is distracting, and the tapered rule doesn’t go with the type, and the shadowed star doesn’t go with either.\n\nThe star and tapered rule say ’tough military’ but the overall look somewhat confused and contradictory. Another bad omen for a candidate?\n\n"

Mantinia comes to mind, as I can imagine the two c’s on McCain fit snuggly within each other in the font’s double c glyph.\n\nHas any candidate taken the DIN route, btw? Most of them went either the heavy-weight grotesques route, or the low ascender/descender serifs route.\n\nAnd a second thought, I wonder if we’ll start to see Gotham in these kind of design soon, since the font’s usage is quite universal, at least in the US.\n\n"
