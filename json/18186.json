The ascenders on Classic are most like the sample; the Initials of Copper are somewhat closer, although the Bernhard Script suggestion has better matching initials (but a non-connected script).\n\nI would not be surprised if this was a custom font done by this foundry for the bridal magazine, because the weight and style is so similar, and unlike almost any other fonts I saw. I went through all MyFonts and Veer scripts, plus my own Script Guide.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I appreciate the research you went through Mike; I had already done the same. I’m still looking for this; as I really want to use it for my own invite.\n\nThanks  \nGlenda\n\n"

See [OttumHmk](http://web.archive.org/web/20091126044457/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script01Pg5.html) from the Hallmark font set. This font’s lower case and even its ’?’ match most of these letters (note the ’z’ also). The ’b’ , ’r’ and ’s’ are different, but I noticed a strong resemblance between Ottum and Snell Roundhand. There’s the same (or very similar) ’b’ to this script.\n\nSo where does this leave us? The Hallmark artist (Rob Leuschke?) who did Ottum might be the one who designed this font for the bride magazine (and Visa ad Patty saw). Not to be too critical, but the number of aspects that seem ’borrowed’ (Bernhard & Snell to name two), takes away from the originality, except that this combination is new.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
