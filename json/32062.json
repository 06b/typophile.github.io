  "content": "I have a new client that needs a logo with a 'M' as the logo sign. He wants the M to later stand alone, or be used in combination with different keywords that describe his company. His business is as an event company on a very high level so the logo needs to be elegant and have class.  \nI have made these rough sketches for him and he likes it a lot. The only problem he has with the logo is that the M is not legible enough. I didn't want to use a font, tweak the M and make a logo out of it. So I hand lettered it to give it that exclusive touch.\n\nI'd like to make some more complete logos for him, but I'm looking for some inspiration. Do you know of a logo that has a really really nice M as a sign? Some keywords that the logo should match up to are: serious, professional, masculine, elegant and powerfull.\n\nWould be nice to see what you come up with...\n\nRegards,  \n®ené\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [M.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141230010916/http:/typophile.com/files/M.jpg) | 40.87 KB |\n\n",
