Medical stuff packed in special packs.  \nI did not develop nothing yet and decide to post for help not in develop something but to find pictures, photos, logos that have incorporated some \"pack\" style in the logo.  \nDid not found many in my google search...but to get you an ideia [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020200608/http:/calpack.calpoly.edu/labequipement.html) is a sample (not a good but what I found.)  \nI also searched in brands of the world and didn´t get many good results...\n\nThanks  \nAntónio Fonseca\n\n",
