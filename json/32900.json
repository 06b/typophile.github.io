Custom drawn.\n\nFrom the FAQ: For example if you’re looking for the Gucci logo or the typeface used for the Björk “Volumen” DVD release, do a search by keyword for “Gucci” or “Bjork”, make sure you look in text of messages and limit your search to the Type Identification Board. (BTW they’re both custom drawn so that’s tough noogies.)\n\n"
