Somewhat reminding me of the Marx Brothers (don’t ask why...).\n\nThe 2 face illustration is working nicely too (great color choices), but i would detach it from the type as i gets a little hectic. Maybe try placing it on top or to the left of the type.  \nAnyway, well done!\n\nSeb\n\n"

Make him a solid color. Also, the black is a bit over-powering, perhaps a dark gray or darker orange, or even a complimentary blue?\n\nAll in all, very well done.\n\n"

I think if he was solid yellow, it owuld be better. When I mean yellow, i mean the colour that’s projecting onto big guy. I liek it tho and the type with the grey shadow works better for me. Up to you though.\n\n"

I’d like to see the first logo in black with the & in another color. If you do go with the second, I think that the others are right and the second face should be a solid to keep things simple.\n\n"
