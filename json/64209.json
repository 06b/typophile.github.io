  "content": "Hello Typophiles!\n\nThis is my first blog post - how exciting!\n\n'Poppet' is a typeface that I created a couple of months ago. I wanted to transform each letter into 'characters'.\n\nEach letter is doing an individual activity, that you would associate with children, i.e. hop-scotch, hula-hoop.\n\nThe letters, at the moment, are black, but I think that adding a bit of colour would bring each personality to life even more!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [poppet.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023164403/http:/typophile.com/files/poppet.jpg) | 332.08 KB |\n\n",
