  "content": "Erik Spiekermann alerted me to _Computer Arts'_ latest feature [\"Type of our times\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123062735/http:/www.computerarts.co.uk/in_depth/features/type_of_our_times), which makes some major misstatements. Perhaps there is no byline for a reason?\n\n_\"In 1956, the Haas Type Foundry commissioned Max Meidinger to redesign Akzidenz-Grotesk, to make it more legible to modern applications. The result was Haas Neue Grotesk, which the foundry’s owner renamed Helvetica in 1960. This was followed shortly thereafter by Meidinger’s Univers. Helvetica went on to become the most in-demand font for near 20 years.\"_\n\nOops. Spiekermann's letter to the editor:\n\n1. The man was called Miedinger; he may only have been a foreigner, but we also like our names spelled properly\n2. Neue Haas Grotesk was a redesign of (surprise!) Haas Grotesk, which in turn was partly based on Scheltersche Grotesk from Schelter & Giesecke -- in those days, type was also quickly assimilated, copied, emulated, ripped-off; the success of Akzidenz Grotesk had alerted Haas to the fact that they were missing sales because all the Swiss designers were specifying AG from Germany.\n3. The name Helvetica was coined by a salesman -- Heinz Eul -- at D. Stempel AG, a foundry in Frankfurt who didn't want to market a typeface with a name like Neue Haasche Grotesk. Credit for the invention of the name later went to Eul's boss, Schultz-Anker, the MD of Stempel (in case you wondered: i have the original correspondence about the name)\n4. Univers was designed in 1957 by Adrian Frutiger, while working for Deberny & Peignot in Paris.\n\nI post this not just to poke a bit of fun, but because the details of typographic history are known to so few, it's important that a major design publication gets them right, or they can quickly get lost. _Computer Arts_ quoted me later in the article, but failed to get the name of my blog right.\n\n",

On the one hand it shows a history of avant garde examples of modernist typography, but on the other, it dutifully shows the major type designs, many of which are historicist, as alphabetic specimens -- but few are shown in use.\n\n"
