I am not sure if it’s a font per se, because some repeated letters just don’t match.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n [‹ Need help with logofont](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906190522/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45817 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font ID – Contemporary sans with sloped A and W?!! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906190522/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45773 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Rob Leuschke’s [Kolker Brush](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906190522/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/kolker-brush/) shows a lot of similarities to your lettering. Leuschke used to do Hallmark card lettering and he continues doing custom lettering. I’m not saying I think he did the book titles, but someone with a similar brush style did.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
