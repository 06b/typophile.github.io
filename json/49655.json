  "content": "Hello,\n\nI did a search for \"Swfte\" on the forums and did not find any hits.\n\nOne of my art directors wants to use Swfte International's \"Circus\" font.\n\n1. Does anyone know if the outlines still exist for this font and who has the rights to it? I'd like to get it licensed.\n\n2. Can you suggest a similar font that we can buy instead?\n\n3. Anyone know the story behind Swifte? I remember them from way back but haven't heard of them in ages.\n\nThanks,\n\nKristin\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140406133321im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Circus_5967.gif)\n\n",

Strangely enough, the Bitstream font forging company (and other font outfits, e.g. Adobe) sued the SWFTE font forging company (see the court file: Bitstream, Inc., et al., v. SWFTE International Ltd., Case No. 93-11068H, District of Mass.), i.e. „forger v. forger“, so to speak, but the claims of the font forging plaintiffs were dismissed by the Massachusetts court.\n\n"
