The kind of cursive writing taught in Germany around the time that my mother's mother was a schoolgirl in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (just before the turn of the twentieth century) has several character shapes which are radically different (hence, pretty unreadable) from English or American takes on the same letters. This fact probably explains why, in the past, I have found a number of otherwise beautifully lettered old German posters almost impossible to read when the lettering was cursive or Italic. However, I did notice the rather unusual -- and, in terms of economy of design, rather clever -- double-s, and that's why it ended up in my swipe file.\n\n"

These forms are rather peculiar to Berlin street signage and are still used in that context, but I'd be cautious in designing the glyphs as default in the situation.\n\nA.\n\n"
