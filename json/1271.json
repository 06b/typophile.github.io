      "content": "Dear Marconi,   \n   \nThis is a nice project. Even with so many other typefaces with this same principles, It has somenthing that sparks from the rest.   \n   \nHere are some comments/suggestions wich I guess you should consider...   \n   \n1. The uppercase S seems to be falling to the right.   \n2. The lowercase r has a spacing problem on the right margin.   \n3. There are some weight problens on your figures. Clearly the 3 is much heavier than 1 or 2, and so are 4, 5, 6 and 8.   \n4. You uppercase M seems too wide, comparing to the entire font   \n5. I guess your descender must go down a little bit more... thinking in a text oriented typeface.   \n   \nJust think about it.   \nKeep up this good work! It would be a nice family.   \nGo on!!   \n   \nFabio Luiz Haag\n\n"

      "content": "Although your vertical proportions are well balanced, the huge x-height means that:   \n- The font will work best for small sizes (I'd say ~8pt in this case).   \n- You need to pull some tricks to make more room for the descenders, specifically by making the bowls of the \"g\", \"p\" and \"q\" rise [slightly] above the baseline.   \n   \nAnd a question: Could you explain the vertical distribution of the numerals?   \n   \nBTW, it's best to use GIF (not JPEG) for type samples.   \nYou can see all the artefacts especially around the white-on-orange text.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Nice work, Marconi, it's getting much better.   \nGood points, Fabio.   \nI'd add that your caps are too dark, and: U and S are wide, P is narrow and Y is too light.   \nThere are some little weight inconsistencies over the alphabet, and finally, I think your non-alphabetical glyphs need some work.   \nKeep it up!   \nAbra\n\n"

I don't want to repeat some sujestions but I leave you some comments.   \n-Your lowercase (k) is strange, probably you must work this letter.   \n- Your figure (7) have a wrong position, alighn this figure like (5), exemple.   \n-Your\n\n"
