However, the design ideas are there, and in the hands of a skilled typographer could produce some interesting results, as the family is pretty complete.\n\nI'm mostly interested in hearing any feedback/feature requests anyone might have.\n\nNote: These beta cuts probably won't be up for long, as I take them down before the official release.\n\n",
