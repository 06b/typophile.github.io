It seems like I found a great forum to talk to others who also enjoy this as well as meet some designers who are using new and different fonts in their projects, as well as meet some designers who are actually **making** new fonts themselves!\n\nOne question... is this forum part of [Tapatalk](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802224857/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fitunes.apple.com/us/app/tapatalk-hd-for-ipad/id481579541%3Fmt%3D8), the iPad app? I usually use my iPad for forums, so it'd be awesome if you guys were on there.\n\nWell at any rate, I just wanted to say hi. Looking forward to discovering some fun new fonts with you all :)\n\n",
