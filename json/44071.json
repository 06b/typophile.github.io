It's rather expensive, but those four letters on your resumé can get you in the door anywhere. I believe they only accept 6-8 per year.\n\nSorry, not much info on SVA. I think Sagmeister teaches there still. Bring your band-aids.\n\n(my co-worker ended up going to NC State, which has a much more theory-based approach. After one achieves state resident status, it's under 3,000 a year!)\n\n"

On the other hand, if I were just going to grad school for the sake of going—which is by no means a bad reason—I would choose RISD just to avoid the distractions that New York offers. I’d never get any homework done in a city with so many bookstores, theaters, museums, and a such a great opera company.\n\n"

First, it draws faculty from the best professionals in the New York area, which is a great center of graphic design. Second, if you are in New York, I would think you have more of a chance for direct contact with that culture, both though your teachers and directly. It seems to me like more of an opportunity rather than a distraction, but whether Manhattan fits with your personality is a serious question. Some don't want to be anywhere else, for some it's a punishment. Since they are both fine schools, I think Manhattan vs Providence is a serious factor to consider.\n\n"

New York might offer more options for internships and such because the design industry is so much more established here; on the other hand there is a lot more competition for such jobs.\n\n"

Sometimes grad school is a good choice after you have worked in the field a few years and are looking for a break that has redeeming values beyond just a vacation from work-a-day life.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

In other words, if I want to teach (and practice on the side) should I plan on getting my MFA from a program that is highly-selective and full-time (SVA, RISD, Tyler, MICA, etc.)? Or is an MFA from schools like [Marywood University](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115065814/http:/www.marywoodmfa.com/index.html), [VCU](http://web.archive.org/web/20150115065814/http:/www.pubinfo.vcu.edu/artweb/CDE/mfa_home.html) or NC State just as good?

To be studying closely under some of my idols has been an amazing experience, let alone all the other amazing people they have introduced us to. I currently have a few grad students in some of my classes doing a three year plan. The program is focused on designer as author, pushing students to create some sort of product/ thesis. I have no idea what RISD's grad program is like, but I can't really imagine leaving new york anymore, ever. The MFA studios here are pretty nice, much better than undergrad, and they're open 24/7.\n\n"
