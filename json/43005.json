      "content": "Amerigroup looks quite similar to a font called [’LHF Charlotte’](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706084326/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_c/charlotte_lhf_full.gif) by Denise Bayers. The serifs are quite small and don’t show up well in this image from my [Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706084326/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php). I cannot find this font at Letterhead Fonts anymore, but I had the design date for this as 2002. One of Bayers’ fonts is still sold there and she may know more about this font. It’s possible the Amerigroup lettering was a custom version of the same lettering, because the U appears narrower in the logo, and it’s possible the serifs were also modified for the logo. The letter shapes still seem quite similar, including the open P.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
