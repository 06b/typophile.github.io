They were impressed by our type specimen books, but wanted lots of $$ to produce it digitally.  \nobviously akzidenz is a son of the reform by stempel, but the s in bold never ceases to impress, and i’ve not seen it elsewhere. erber grotesk, which was released with lux, is produced by linotype and more appropriately translated by hoefler in the form of verlag.\n\n"

Not sure if they ever made a cut of Lux, might be worth checking.\n\nI’m not sure if Verlag is a translation of Erbar - they are similar - but that’s about all. Do you mean inspiration for Verlag?\n\n"
