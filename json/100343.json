  "content": "If there are any comic fonts experts, can someone prompt me what is this interesting sharp comic font, used in the comic book named Cairo (a graphic novel by G.Willow Wilson, 2009)? It resembles both sans-serif and horror fonts but I've never seen a similar one in comic fonts weblists. If it cannot be identified, then maybe someone knows any similar comic or non-comic font with such the sharp features?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013115705im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Speech%20sample_6388.jpg)\n\n",
