I know calligraphy is not in style like it was years ago, but I think there is still a solid place for it in the design world. There are a number of lettering artist and calligraphers who do beautiful work that is still contemporary.\n\nWhere I work I have to do both refined lettering/calligraphy and also very naive looking letters as in your sample. These days I do a lot more of the naive styles because the \"regular Joe\" style of handlettering is popular, but visually I like both ends of the spectrum when done in an appropriate context.\n\nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "I think calligraphy can be beautiful and compelling. But faux type simply  \nturns me on much more. That's just a personal preference - nothing more.\n\nBut also, practically speaking in this piece at least calligraphy  \nwould have made it just-another-pretty-face, while faux type makes  \nit much more novel and perhaps arguably more appropriate as well.\n\nI'd suggest asking them for a copy of that mailer - it's a very nice piece.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I had a look at the way they used in on the website. The flash portion on the left was handled very gracefully and had a more striking contrast. The heading on the top of the paragraph on the right side was not. I thought it looked a bit too bulky and tight for the space.  \nOne of the things that I do find compelling about these faux type settings is when the designer uses it like as if it were fine type. The contrast it sets up is compelling. Some of the hand rendered faux type and scripts that Chris Sickels of Red Nose Studio does are wonderful. He does 3d illustration and his lettering compliments it well.\n\n[http://rednosestudio.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823200551/http:/rednosestudio.com/ \"http://rednosestudio.com/\")\n\n"

It also feels quite interesting and appropriate in the context.\n\nActually, I think this approach could well carry more of the design; it would be exciting to see them play with the concept some more. Like introducing an element of imperfect sketching to the photography, maybe. And I wish they'd set those beautiful letters bigger!\\*\n\n\\* On the web site, I mean.\n\n"

Whether it is based on a font or not, hand lettering is supposed to have variations and imperfections just like our everyday handwriting. That's what makes it interesting and compelling.\n\nMy taste is for appropriate and beautiful communication. If that means using \"dumbed down forms\" then so be it.
