  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am in the process of redesigning my online portfolio. The old version (still online) just doesn't do it for me. I have tried to make it as mathematical as I can, all in keeping it ergonomically simple and aiming for intuitive navigation. It will be coded in HTML and will have the project menu at the bottom in flash technology. It is but a screen shot, but your opinions, your comments and crits are welcome.\n\n[\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013180031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/previedsin_4953.png)\n](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013180031/http:/www.dache.ch/dsin.png)  \n [Link to new design](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013180031/http:/www.dache.ch/dsin.png)\n\nThanks.\n\nRegards,  \nDavid Pache\n\n",

I am going for homogenous type, giving no one element of information more importance than another.  \nSpeaking of Verdana, I do wish to change it to Corbel when released. I found it to go better with the Helvetica of the logo but that is still to be tested.\n\n"

And having the ability to show things on black in your portfolio is a good kind of flexibility to retain. You could also dispense with a heavy obvious stucture made apparent by color. Or not. Your logo may be getting too small...\n\n"

A concern would be that the simplicity may come off as a little dry. The up side to that would be that it focuses attention on the pieces, but the downside may be that the site lacks character or personality.\n\nJust a thought,\n\nDuncan\n\n"

      "content": "I am not keen on flash in portfolio sites, especially when the menu contains thumbnails of pieces of work; how do you see the print/webdesign sections working with the scrolling menu? I do like the simplicity of the design, but with simple/dry design the composition has to be spot on, for example the image area should have an equal space top and bottom (I understand the thinking behind it – the menu of extra pages) and should be aligned to the right, the scrolling flash menu takes up a rather large portion of the screen.  \nTim\n\n"

I completely agree, I dont like flash that much either for navigation; which is why it has been replaced. :^)  \nI have been working on this new version which I prefer. Something about the about page bugs me but I cant put my finger on it unfortunately. Perhaps the members of typophile have some insight.\n\nLink : [http://www.dache.ch/realine.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013180031/http:/www.dache.ch/realine.png \"http://www.dache.ch/realine.png\")\n\nKindest regards,  \nDavid\n\n"

      "content": "You mentioned wanting to specify Corbel. I'd avoid that, as 1) Vista won't be immediately adopted by everyone once released and 2) most viewers will then see plain-ol' Verdana anyway. I'd stick to what are now regarded as the standard web fonts for maximum compatibility among systems old and new (and Mac or PC).\n\nI also commend you for jettisoning Flash. While a great tool, it makes navigation really difficult and doesn't allow deep linking to specific projects in your portfolio. (\"Hey, Steve, check out what this guy David did. Uh, just go to his site, then click on this, then scroll to this, then...\")\n\nI like how clean the site looks. But, I'd still advocate including a different size, or a different font for headlines/subheads. It will make text-heavy pages (like \"about\") easier to read.\n\n"
