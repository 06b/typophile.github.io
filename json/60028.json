I had just written a magazine feature about the company and was excited at the prospect of choosing from what seemed at the time like an extensive catalog of type. The idea that I could go beyond what came on the Mac or with software packages seemed pretty wild.\n\nThree that I remember being on those hotly anticipated floppies were:\n\n**Groschen** (a quirky, wide sans serif that I can’t seem to find on reputable commercial font sites, only as a free TTF download from a site theat seems sketchy — won’t name it here);\n\n**Caslon Antique** (Did I mention I was living in Alberta? The rustic aesthetic must have rubbed off on me); and\n\n**Liberty** (again, I don’t see it available at reputable commercial font sites, but it looks like [Goudy Handtooled](http://web.archive.org/web/20090722105742/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/goudy-handtooled/))\n\n"

I cleaned out the mouse poop, re-sorted all the foul distribution, and then . . . never used any of it, for I had no press. I sold it, for less than I paid, to the pressroom supervisor where I worked.\n\nThe first day FontShop SF was in business I ordered a font (on floppy). Since it was their first-ever order they threw in a floppy with another font on it. I never used that one, either. The floppy rotted away in my nasty basement after we moved.\n\npowers\n\n"

You needed black as well as white type for that (the layouts were reversed) and white type was a bitch to work with — it would crack when you just looked at it. I must have tried every available rubdowntool available at the time. Had quite a collection of scalpels and x-acto’s too.\n\nBefore rubdown I would hop over to the art school 400 yards from my high school during lunch break, set type and make prints on baryte, to use in the high school magazine I designed, edited and illustrated almost singlehandedly.
