  "content": "Hello Folks,  \nI was just handed a pretty amazing job. I can't really go into detail, but I basically will need to define how my client is going to market their HD DVD's. Part of this exercise will include advice on cutting edge printing techniques. Think liquid foils, spot UV's, clear foil spot varnishes...the sky is the limit and so is their budget.\n\nI would be grateful for any ideas/applications you've come across lately. They could be types of inks, printing processes, maybe even amazing papers you've seen or used. If I can get a sample somehow please pass that info along as well (i.e. paper mill, magazine, or printer info).\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBest,  \nPeter.\n\n",

      "content": "soy based inks and washable papers, blind embossing, fluorescent boosters for bright colors, satin finish instead of gloss or matte, metallic touch-plates, higher than normal line screen, transparent spot colors, split fountains...\n\nA few of these things I have no experience with. I have seen transparent spot colors, the ink chemists that I work with at the shop I am usually at make us these, I'm not sure how. We had one job in which we had to smoothly blend a series of 8 transparent spot colors into one another. It may have not looked nice the way they had designed it, but it could be something really cool if done in an elegant way. Blind embossing is snazzy, I think, and it isn't something done very often. Consider maybe a intricate pattern to give the paper a unique texture. Split fountains are neat, you always get amazing color combinations with this technique. You probably already know about adding a fluorescent booster to achieve spectacularly bright colors. I once worked with a project printed at a 600 line screen, that could be interesting.\n\n"

      "content": "Someone mentioned Agfa Crystal Raster screening. Adobe almost had a product based on the same stochastic, frequency-modulated screening technique years ago. I happened on a local print shop here in SF (Clubcard) that uses the stochastic screening for 4- and 6-color work that really gives stellar results in layouts with mixed photos/type/art. Type at any size, reversed, or odd colors, comes out crisp and fine, and photos look like you're looking at the object in the photo. Veer has been printing some of their catalogs using the new screening, but I think it looks less impressive (less sharp) on the soft papers they specify. None of this gives a particularly snazzy impression, but it does significantly improve the overall quality of offset impressions, especially using 6 colors. Add some iridescent foil and blind embossing and that will \"make it pop\", as they say.\n\n"

They once told me the name of the screening product.\n\nOnline you wouldn't be able to see the quality; it's so fine most people wouldn't notice the difference between high-linescreen conventional halftones and this other stuff, even if they held it in their hand.\n\n"

      "content": "I got some samples of some inks here a while back that actually change color due to environmental conditions, typically heat. One of the samples has a image printed on it, and then it was covered with a black ink, obscuring everything. When you touched it, the image would slowly be revealed as the black would go from opaque to completely transparent. Another one of the examples was a coffee cup that was printed with a similar ink, red perhaps, and it would indicate the level of the liquid in the container through another heat reaction. So, as you drank the coffee, obviously the reaction on the outside of the beverage would slowly move down the side of the cup, until it was empty.\n\nThis will take a bit of research on the internet, but I am sure you can find it.\n\nThe thermographic suggestion is a good one. I have seen so many magazine covers lately that have started to use this technique. Interesting how it's the new fad. Basically, they just take an intricate pattern, and use a clear gloss (laminate type overlay) and print over the entire cover. Think of those cheap business cards that you get at Office Max, that have the raised type, that doesn't really feel like ink; this is the same process.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Peter\n\nWhat an insanely great project! Many terrific suggestions here, including the unusual substrate-and-ink combos, and the Crystal Raster/FM screening plus Hexachrome high-end stuff.\n\nMy suggestion would be to use holographic foils as the substrate for some or all of the design; you could use an opaque white ink (possibly silkscreened) in combination with the transparent spot/cmyk inks to produce some fairly nice eye-candy...\n\n\"The thermographic suggestion is a good one. I have seen so many magazine covers lately that have started to use this technique.\"\n\nI think you'll find that is just a double-hit spot varnish going on the magazine covers... and the whole cover is processed on a single 6 colour press. Sometimes for a really thick one we might silkscreen an ultraviolet-curing varnish.\n\nReal thermography is a little-used labour-intensive process whereby enamel crystals are sprinkled by hand over the still-wet ink and then passed under a heat source to melt them and raise the surface/volume of the ink with a super gloss. The difference is that real thermography will crack when flexed, whereas a spot varnish won't, which makes it more suitable for the magazine covers.\n\nThermography used to be _de rigeur_ for society cards and stationery, but like deckle edges, chromo-lithography and gravure printing, it's increasingly rare. I last saw it done commercially in the early 90s.\n\nLove the idea of sending the whole lot to the monastery, Bert.\n\n"
