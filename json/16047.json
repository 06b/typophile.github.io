There are 60 pages of pre-printed six different grids for sketching and designing type, including a classic Duerer’s model of renaissance capitals construction. The other 120 pages are plain weekly overviews, leaving plenty of space for personal notes and organizing. Major graphic design and typography events are noted in the agenda (AtypI, AIGA, TypoBerlin, TypoTechnica, TypeCon, etc.)\n\n[http://www.typotheque.com/books/typotheque\\_diary\\_2006](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140025/http:/www.typotheque.com/books/typotheque_diary_2006 \"http://www.typotheque.com/books/typotheque\\_diary\\_2006\")\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\\> The Stroke, theory of writing\n\nThis is the first English-language edition of the theory of writing by the teacher and type designer Gerrit Noordzij who directed the course at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague from 1970 to 1990.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nGerrit Noordzij’s powerful and analytical text, illustrated with his own diagrams and examples, presents a genuine theory of writing done with any tool and clarifies the relationship between the written and typographic letters\n\n[http://www.typotheque.com/books/the\\_stroke/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140025/http:/www.typotheque.com/books/the_stroke/ \"http://www.typotheque.com/books/the\\_stroke/\")\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n\\> upcoming release Fedra Serif Pro\n\nFedra Serif Pro is in its final stage of testing, and will be published in November 2005.
