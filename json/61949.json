Check out [Josef Müller-Brockmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021518/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_M%C3%BCller-Brockmann) and [David Carson](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021518/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Carson). In my opinion, there’s far too many people simply emulating styles from ffffound without even knowing who they are referencing.\n\n"
