I think that if you look at a cross section of Australian graphic design it would be clear that this design is not as out of place as it might seem. That’s my impression anyway - having been through a few Australian design annuals. Personally it doesn’t conect too well with me. It seems a bit cheesy & disco to me too. But then I am hardly the audience. And it would be good at getting attention - which is the point. Anyway. That’s my 35 cents.\n\n"
