For our first product logo, we used a tall, thin sloping initial letter inside a square box, but I soon realized that the best way to get name recognition would be to make the name as legible and simple as possible, so we moved to the more traditional and simple capital letters that remain today. The name itself is the logo.\"   \n   \n\"On our thirty-fifth anniversary, we thought we should consider revising our trademark. Styles and fashions were changing in clothing, in product design, and in virtually everything, so we thought that perhaps we should consider changing the style of the letters of our name. We held an international competition, and we received hundreds of suggestions, along with hundreds of pleas from our dealers not to change. After reviewing all the suggestions, we decided not to make any changes. S O N Y still looked very good to us, and we decided, as they say today, that there was no point in fixing something that was far from broken.\"   \n   \n(From Made in Japan by Akio Morita)_\n\n"

Mind you, those were the pre-Mac times and getting to the stage of comps that were good enough to send to Tokyo, involved a lot of hard work with rotring pens, compasses, repro camera's, colorproofs, etcetera.   \nImage the consternation Sony caused among the participants when they decided to retain the old logo. I have never done a contest ever since...\n\n"
