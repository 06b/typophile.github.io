We'll call this line a  \n\\* in order to construct the Thales circle which will intersect with the original circle at the tangent-point we need the length of a  \n\\* create a rectangle with X and B as corners. note the height and width of this rectangle. We'll call those b and c  \n\\* In the example picture, applying Pythagoras to find a = sqrt(b^2 + c^2) = 228.89 pt gives the diameter of the Thales-circle  \n\\* Create a circle with a for its height and width and drag its center on the center of the rectangle you constructed on X/B  \n\\* The points where this circle intersects with the original circle are the suitable tangent points.\n\n"
