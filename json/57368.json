Copy the code and paste it in the registration of the Copyright Office? How do you subtract the code from the font?</cite>\n\nFirst, you have copyright simply by virtue of authoring it. However, in the USA \\*registering\\* your copyright allows you the possibility of collecting triple the actual damages, as well as fixed awards for each infringement. Without that, you're limited to \"actual damages.\"\n\nTo register the copyright, you'd need a meaningful text representation of the font code. For a Type 1 font, I'd go with a decrypted version of an ASCII Type 1 font (also called a \".pfa\" or Unix Type 1 font). For TTF or OTF you could dump it with TTX or something like that.\n\n<cite>Is it worth the time to copyright the code if it doesn’t protect the design (the most important part of a font)?</cite>\n\nThe code isn't the most important thing, but it's the most commonly and most easily pirated. My personal opinion is that as an independent type designer I'll certainly register the copyrights for my designs. It's really cheap (like $35 using the online registration).\n\nDesign patent is trickier because although it's clearly valuable (in the US, anyway), it's extremely expensive. Even with the discount for being a \"small entity\" it looks like it's something like $660 up front and another $3800 or so divided into installments at 3.5, 7.5 and 11.5 years (though mostly rear-end loaded, so you could let it lapse if the font wasn't doing well). That's per font, so if your type family consists of, say, a whole series of fonts... dang, that could really chew up a big chunk (or all) of your profits. I don't know that it makes sense for most type designers and foundries.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

That way it was dated by the post office. This is called \"interstate commerce\", and activates the copyright.\n\nThomas said that the mere act of authoring or creating it is \"unregistered\" copyright. I believe that \"interstate commerce\" is also necessary, but I may be wrong. As Thomas warned, I'm not an attorney either.\n\nLinotype I know applies for a design patent for many of their fonts, but most type foundries don't bother.\n\n"

Many choose to register their works because they wish to have the facts of their copyright on the public record and have a certificate of registration. Registered works may be eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees in successful litigation. Finally, if registration occurs within 5 years of publication, it is considered prima facie evidence in a court of law. See Circular 1, Copyright Basics, section “Copyright Registration” and Circular 38b, Highlights of Copyright Amendments Contained in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA), on non-U.S. works. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131017223715/http:/www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#cr\" title=\"http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#cr\">http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ1.html#cr</a> http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38b.pdf</cite>\n\n<cite><strong>I’ve heard about a “poor man’s copyright.” What is it?</strong></cite>\n\n<cite>The practice of sending a copy of your own work to yourself is sometimes called a “poor man’s copyright.” There is no provision in the copyright law regarding any such type of protection, and it is not a substitute for registration.</cite>\n\n(I'm understanding that to mean that it creates no extra protections under the law; of course you already had copyright at the time of authoring.)\n\n"
