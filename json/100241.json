      "content": "Mike, thanks for the effort. But I hope you realize that Aleksandr got his ID, hence the font, and hasn't looked back... He _might_ look back at this thread the next time he comes around here to ask for an ID, but I would expect him to keep quiet, so people keep helping him... Barring an explicit admission of piracy (and sadly for some IDers not even then) some people are too eager to relish the act of IDing to consider the consequences.\n\nCase in point:  \n [http://typophile.com/user/64412](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712053805/http:/typophile.com/user/64412 \"http://typophile.com/user/64412\")  \nHe's been getting IDs here for over three years, and based on the most recent thread\\* chances are he didn't end up paying for all -perhaps any- of those fonts. But of course it's not good to live a paranoid lifestyle, so the answer might not be going cold turkey, but at a minimum it _is_ what I've been saying: using caution.\n\n\\* [http://typophile.com/node/100306](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712053805/http:/typophile.com/node/100306 \"http://typophile.com/node/100306\")\n\nAlso, there should be a way for people who ID fonts to be able to keep track of users who flaunt their acts of piracy, and even ones like Aleksandr and FM\\_Treezy who might not have admitted it explicitly, but are way too suspect.\n\nhhp\n\n"
