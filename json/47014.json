ITC Uptight Neon is similar, except that the ends of the strokes are all rounded, like neon lights. It also didn't have as many character variations.\n\nAn aside: An illustrator I used to know told me that the guy who designed Uptight Regular and Uptight Neon shared studio space with him in Minneapolis in the early Seventies. I don't remember what his name was, though.\n\n"
