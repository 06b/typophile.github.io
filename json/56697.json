I think it's excellent, but all I'm doing with it is uploading some files and checking images others post, but I seems like a pretty complete project management package. From what I've seen of it, I'd recommend it.\n\nI also use Google groups, which has everything I would normally need to collaborate with others on line.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

      "content": "I've used it extensively for international clients, remote designers, and as a course convenor.\n\nI've found it to be great for pulling together groups because it is very easy to use and orientation/learning happens through actual use, which helps speed up the start up stage.\n\nEvery group I've shared it with ends up using it in their own way. I usually make some suggestions at the start and then it beds in as the project rolls on.\n\n"
