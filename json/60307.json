The target was to make a useful font while investing nothing more than the absolutely indispensable. The component-based glyph construction scheme of another font has been utilized, further detailing work has been strictly limited. Due to those restrictions some letters have rather unusual shapes.  \nHowever, because of the production limitations Crisis will be offered at an unbeatable rate. It is equipped with 320 glyphs and comes with all accented letters needed for any European language. Crisis has compact proportions, it is very legible even when set in small sizes. In printing you get more text on one page and thus save up to 30% of paper.  \n– Coming soon at Myfonts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150323001714im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Crs_alphabet_5684.jpg)\n\n",
