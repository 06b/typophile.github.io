  "content": "This has nothing to do with making glyphs, but it might make making glyphs easier.\n\nMake simple sugar for your ice tea/coffee and lemonade. One cup of sugar in a bowl add one cup of boiling water and stir with a spoon. The sugar desolves making simple surup. Simple surup desolves in your ice tea/coffee and lemonade, unlike raw sugar which goes to the bottom of your glass like a lump.\n\nLemons and Limes can be a pain to juice. Microwave them for 15 to 20 seconds then cut then into wedges, not across, you get more juice.\n\n…summertime and the glyphs are easy…\n\n",

I've noticed they have trouble with \"What kind of tea do you have?\" One time I had to repeat that question so many times, the guy in line behind me broke down and yelled out the question for me.\n\nKyle, I miss Arizona - haven't been in over 10 years.\n\nhhp\n\n"
