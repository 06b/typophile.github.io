It crossed my mind while I was implementing the Greek.  \nActually it would be very interesting and challenging to add a right-to-left script to [adhesiontext](http://web.archive.org/wiki/adhesiontext).\n\nI believe that the way [adhesiontext](http://web.archive.org/wiki/adhesiontext) is setup allows me to add any Latin language, like German or Italian for example (and maybe even a central-European, like Czech), within a couple of hours.  \nA non-Latin LTR script would need a bit more time, but surely not more than a day’s work.  \nA RTL script is a bit more tricky, but still doable. I can’t predict how long that would take.\n\nNevertheless, if you can provide me two Arabic word-lists (one in Unicode and the other in Arabic-Windows-1256) and a string of the characters (in Unicode) to be included in the “Insert characters” palette, I can try to prepare an Arabic version of [adhesiontext](http://web.archive.org/wiki/adhesiontext) for you to test.\n\nAs for the Fontlab window, I think that Brook was trying to do something like that with Python.\n\n"

      "content": "mike, great work, one thing though: on firefox (1.03, windows 2000), the layout is kinda messed up. I get a “insert characters” box directly over the “get text” “basic punctuation” and “capitalize words” fields, which makes it pretty much unusable.  \nOn IE, those boxes render at the very bottom of the page. I kind of suspect they should be to the right but without overlapping anything. I’d be happy to póst screenshots if needed.\n\n"
