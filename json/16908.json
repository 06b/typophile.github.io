      "content": "Interesting hand-illustrated cover originally designed for 1973 release of _Birds of Fire_.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423060622im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mahavish_logo.gif)\n  \nThe whole cover seems to have the look of a transparent watercolor with Primacolor pencil added. If you look closely at the letters, they seemed to have been traced and colored from a source typeface but modified. A model for MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA could have been Hobo with lumpy serifs added on the fly.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423060622im_/http:/typophile.com/files/maha_hobo.png)\n\n\"Birds of Fire\" is also part of the cover painting and has the same feeling of a typeface that was used as a model for loosely copying or tracing.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423060622im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Maha_cover.gif)\n  \nRemember, this was designed in 1973 or earlier, so the faces may have been loosely traced from press-type or phototypesetting. Both ITC Bookman and Cooper Black had very similar swash characters to the \"f\" and \"r\" available in photo headliners. \n"

But the similarities to type designs that were prominently available during the early 70s can't be denied.\n\nBut if you are asking if the lettering was hand drawn, my assessment would be yes, but copied and modified from existing type designs.\n\n"

      "content": "Hey there all,\n\nWell, you're gonna get it straight from the horses mouth, I'm just flattered that after all these years there seems to be more interest in my work than way back when. I guess that's just the way it goes.\n\nThere are some very astute observations about how I designed this font, Hobo, Windsor and Bookman were some of the influences. Although, I really tried to put some subtle changes into it. Norbert, yes, Hobo was a strong influence, and the \"lumpy serifs\" were my principle contribution! Funny, since I always then and now hated Hobo.\n\nThis was designed in late 1972 as I recall, I was in the same spiritual movement as John, and actually lived in his home as a renter for about 3 years.\n\nI was a very young designer at the time, about 22, and I was most concerned with designing something that the Mashavishnu brand could own, so that was why I designed it.\n\nUnfortunately, I never finished the whole alphabet, much to my regret, and still would like to finish it today. Although I still have no idea how to use any of the font creation programs, so feel free to chime in.\n\nCoincidentally, this past year I was approached over the internet by Walter Kowlosky, a Boston writer who is putting together a great book on the MO, and I was privilidged to do the cover design for it.\n\nSo anyway, if any of you want to discuss this or see what I'm doing now, I can be reached at [poissonsaz@qwest.net](mailto:poissonsaz@qwest.net).\n\n"

I applied the \"noise\" filter 40 times, and as it's random (or more random than most Photoshop filters, IYKWIM), the results are all different, and these comprise the frames, cycled. Being a McLaughlin fan from way back, I spent a lot of time looking at the album covers and listening to the music in vartious mental states, so Chris' atomism may be responsible for this.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423060622im_/http:/typophile.com/files/STf.gif)\n\n"

My younger brother played a couple of gigs with John McLaughlin around the time Carlos Santana jammed with John... incredible stuff.\n\nJust goes to show the rest of us that something done well (or with love) is ALWAYS worth remembering.\n\n(Gee, I hope nobody uncovers the oil company logo I developed using a very distressed Stymie Bold.)\n\nGood luck landing the MO book project. Stay in touch, let us know if it happens, or just hang around and reminisce with us older coots.\n\n"

That's it. I took me about a month and a half to draw.\n\nFunny story, CBS printed several hundred thousand on them on glossy stock and it looked horrible, John and I went down to their office and told John Berg, the executive art director they were not acceptable, So they did a re-print on a textured matte stock, which looked great. John Berg had a hissy fit when we regected the first batch, he actually kicked the wall!\n\n"
