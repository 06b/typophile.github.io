It's more generic, constructed than the nice \"Handsome\". But the \"e\" ... . French Letters looks good to me in the lower letters. Poppl-College and Signal (a little bit to edgy) are cool, Tarantula is supercool,except of some too postmodern features like the \"V\".   \n   \nI'm thinking of making a logoish monoline script font. Perhaps it could also look a little bit painted. Something like a bold template handwriting. It's gonna be used for a serious of logos in an art project.   \nI just want to check: Whats in this field of \"template handwriting\"? Do you know more contemporary logos based on (custom) handwriting?\n\n"
