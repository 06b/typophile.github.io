At Typecon01, Don from [SynFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015060038/http:/www.synfonts.com/) demoed a Flash-based built to order package that I believe P22 used for their [IHOF site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015060038/http:/p22.com/ihof/typecaster/caster.html). Perhaps it's still available and would probably be the cheapest solution, though not the most elegant because it uses Flash (which wrecks havoc on character shapes, particularly curves).\n\n2. Letterror built the [LetterSetter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015060038/http:/houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=531&subpage=lettersetter) for House Industries (and someone else?).\n\n3. [Village's mudTyper](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015060038/http:/vllg.com/Kontour/Odile/mudTyper+Weights/) was developed by Takashi Okamoto of [MudCorp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015060038/http:/www.mudcorporation.com/projects/programming/). It's the best of these three, in my opinion, as it sticks to PNGs and still renders instantly.\n\n"
