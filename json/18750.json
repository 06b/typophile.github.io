  "content": "Hi!\n\nI’m trying to track down an elegant, bold and edgy capital M. Any insight into this would be appreciated. I’ve looked at Insignia and Penumbra but feel like some strength is missing from these characters. Something bold, strong, sophisticated/classy. I have attached a pdf with some tests. The search continues.. Thanks for any help you can provide!\n\nJosh\n\n [‹ Five Volume Set](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615181129/http:/typophile.com/node/18867 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Recommend Me Three Typeface Families ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080615181129/http:/typophile.com/node/18782 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks so much for your input guys. I’m very impressed with your recommendations and especially like Mantinia and Serif Gothic. To answer your question Stephen, I am looking for something elegant but with a bit of attitude (edgy). The “M” will need to be able to stand alone after it is modified as part of the company’s mark. The PDF did not upload for some reason and I don’t have it with me on this computer but I think I may be headed in the right direction thanks to your help. What a great resource this website and you are!\n\nJosh\n\n"
