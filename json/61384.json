  "content": "Hi there,\n\nSome help please. I have just bought a copy of DIN and DIN ALTERNATE, the font bureau that I bought them from tell me that both fonts are included in the same font if that makes sense.\n\nNow I have bought opentype fonts before and usually they have come as seperate files. This hoever is confusing me a little. I have bought the fonts as I am updating a magazine and ALTERNATE is used within the paragraph styles.\n\nI can of course select opentype option in the character menu but that is not the problem. When I open the file in indesign it of course states that there is a missing font, ALTERNATE, but i obviously cant select it in the font menu.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\nMatt\n\n",
