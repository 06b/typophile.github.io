      "content": "The font is based on the _Avant Garde_ magazine (hence the name) logotype designed by Herb Lubalin, hence its inferiority to Futura (in my unsolicited opinion).   \n   \nSo, it's technically on the cover of _Avant Garde_, in that its inspiration is there, but they aren't all the same letterforms. For example, the Vs in the logotype have a vertical left extender, rather than an angled one. This would be a fun/ relevant example, at least, if not a strict example.\n\n"

I seem to recall that there was an entire series of cool display ligatures - even for the rub-down letters. But probably not for any digital release.   \n   \nLubalin's _Family Circle_ logotype comes to mind - although it's not Avant Garde, no doubt, but once again in the same vein.   \n   \nAnd surely to god U&lc used Avant Garde back in the day. If there are any issues of that around.\n\n"

The ligatures certainly add a dimension that I wasn't aware of.   \n   \nAvant Garde was held up critically next to Futura by one of my professors back in school, with great disdain. She said she'd give us a 'retro-active F' if she caught us using it. In retrospect, she was probably just violently steering us away from using it as a text face...   \n   \n...now that I look at it, was that the typeface for the movie _Alien_? Not the one used on the poster, but the one used in the title sequence. Or am I confusing it with _Altered States_ now?   \n   \nMy cursory web research reveals that it may be a similar condensed face for [Alien 3](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142010/http:/www.fox.co.uk/home_ent/i/packshots/alien_boxset_repromo.jpg), but Avant Garde for [Altered States](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142010/http:/www.movieactors.com/photos-sf/altered.jpeg).\n\n"
