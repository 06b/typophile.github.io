He also published an excellent specimen for HTF Didot which provides a good deal of historical information about the neoclassical style. You might try contacting Jonathan at [Hoefler Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013152239/http:/www.typography.com/) and see if he still has any copies of his _Muse no. 1_ Didot specimen available.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"
