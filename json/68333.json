  "content": "Hey there!\n\nQuick question. I've searched the web (and this forum) for hours now but I just can't find what I'm looking for.  \nI need the basic formgroups blackletter type consists of (the more variations the better).\n\nNow that I think about it, is there a guide out there that breaks up blackletter forms to it's very basic elements, does anybody know of some kind of guide?\n\nI'd be happy if someone points at the right keyword to search for. my typographic english is basic/intermediate so I wouldn't be surprised if I missed something on google.\n\nByeBye  \nDösi\n\n",
