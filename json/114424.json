  "content": "I've been working on a digitization of Michel, an old Letraset font designed by Michel Waxman. I am surprised this has not previously been digitized. It was dropped from Letraset catalogues some time in the 1980's I believe (though I don't have an old catalogue to confirm this against). In fact, it's only recently that his other font \"Optex\" has come to light (as \"Olympik\" by Jonathan Hill). I am wondering if there isn't some legal/licensing minefield story behind this. Biographical information on Michel Waxman is also scarce.\n\nDoes anyone know anything of Mr. Waxman, and who might currently own any/all rights to his work? Does Mr. Waxman read this forum? I'd love for him to get in touch.\n\nInterestingly, Luc Devroye also credits him with the design of \"Oxford\", but that was actually the work of Christine Lord.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421012210im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Michel_sample_6423.png)\n\n",
