  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nCan you recommend any good text fonts to a student on a budget?   \n   \nI'm currently writing a dissertation (not on graphic design, alas), which I will have to typeset and make camera-ready myself. And I would really, _really_ like to escape the Times New Roman purgatory of standard science dissertations.   \n   \nMy only problem is that it would have to be a free or cheap TrueType font - say, under $20. Alas, I can't afford anything from FontFont, no matter how much I like them. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409151907im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)  \n   \nSo what do you think? Any recommendations?\n\n",

Unfortunately, the school requires a 12pt font and double-spaced lines (!!!).

It's got low x-height, though, which makes the long, double-spaced lines look funny. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409151907im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nBy the way, thanks for the Lido link - I'll definitely give it a try! ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409151907im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
