      "content": "Hi Maurice,   \n   \nIt feels like Meta meets DIN. Not bad, but I have some little comments:   \n- first of all you need to balance the thickness of the complete alphabet. On this pdf it seems that some parts are thicker than the other.   \n- the 'a c e' seem to be too wide   \n- try making the arm of the 'r' longer and/or stronger   \n- I would also try making the leg of the 't' longer   \n- the 's' needs work. Try lifting the end of the lower curve, make it more round   \n- take the curves of the 'n' and put them on the 'm'. That seems to be too round compared to the 'n'   \n- I would take the curvy edge of the left leg of the 'u' out   \n- You make diagonal ends of the upper legs of the 'x', why not also at the bottom?   \n- try making the tail of the 'y' more daring. It needs a bit of a sparkle. The 'y' is also a bit too open at the top.   \n   \nPhoei, that's it for now. I'm curious about an update.   \n   \nDe groeten,   \nRen\n\n"
