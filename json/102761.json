  "content": "I've been tasked with redrawing this logo in vector format, so unfortunately this is the best image I have. The flat-bottomed 'M' is throwing me for a loop. I've compared against the usual suspects - Bodoni, Torino, Didot, their variants, and less common didones - and nearly all are wider and have pointy 'M's with a wider flair on the left leg serif. As far as I can tell, this hasn't been mechanically condensed. The closest I've found is Ambroise, but the proportions don't quite match up.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620194712/http:/typophile.com/files/font_335.jpg) | 16.47 KB |\n\n",
