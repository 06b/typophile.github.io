  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI have bought this nice single sort you can see in the attached picture and now I am trying to identify to what typeface/fount it belongs to. It was sold as a capital J but I reckon it may be a lowercase r instead, but so far I have not found it on MyFonts.\n\nThank you in advance,\n\nTamas\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [singler.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820152647/http:/typophile.com/files/singler.jpg) | 10.42 KB |\n\n",
