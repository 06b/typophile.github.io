So no script or handwritten, will be in lowercase.\n\nThis font is for a logo (black type on white bg) for a high-end wedding and event photographer if that helps, which it probably doesn't.\n\nThanks for any help...and I'll be sure to link you to the finished article so you can see what it looks like.\n\nAl\n\n",

The high contrast on the 96 point master may make the delicate serifs disappear.\n\nI am conflicted about using H&FJ Didot for luxury brands. It is an exceedingly beautiful face, but risks overuse and is often oddly paired with Helvetica--see Harper's Bazaar or luxurycollection.com for examples.\n\nIn my eye,luxury brands typically choose serif families with small caps and oldstyle figures, because your average MS Word user doesn't have easy access to those characters and so see those as unique and exclusive.\n\nI would look at Joanna (there is a hard-to-find Postscript version with SC and OsF), Proforma, Whitman Display, Charter, Miller, Mercury, Farnham, Absara, Scala.\n\nDavid\n\n"
