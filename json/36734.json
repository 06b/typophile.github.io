I thought it was Century Gothic, but the “M” and “u” don’t look right. I need to know the font and when it was first introduced. This is my first attempt at this, so if I did something wrong, just let me know how to correct it. Thanks.\n\n [‹ Gourmet Magazine nameplate connected script](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705150132/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36747 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Technical sans for Cartagena power plant - Alstom Sans {Adriano (self)} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705150132/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36753 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
