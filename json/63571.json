      "content": "Love the second set. I think the left one reads better as initials, since the letters are upright, but the right hand one makes sense tilted in a heart shape. I think it is OK that the initials are more subtle when tilted to make a normal heart shape.\n\nI can totally see this repeated as a faint pattern in the wedding stationery, napkins, etc.\n\nVery appropriate that it makes a heart, and the letters are intertwined / woven together. Great concept.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [www.coroflot.com/kate\\_dawson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020035703/http:/www.coroflot.com/kate_dawson \"www.coroflot.com/kate\\_dawson\")\n\n"
