  "content": "Hi there,\n\nLong story short, i would like to know if there is a perfect match for the chunky sans serif used on this cover\n\nfirst I thought about a Berthold BE bold extended, but the lowercase is clearly different\n\nthen I thought about Aurora grotesk and went with Annonce by Canada type, an almost perfect match ... apart from the lowercase \"r\" whose ear is way longer.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119054144/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/annonce/\")\n\nIs there any other viable option apart from choping off the ear (ouch) of Annonce \"r\"?\n\nmany many thanks,\n\nL.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141119054144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cawthra_chp4_12j_4195.jpg)\n\n",
