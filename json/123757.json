It looks like it was on Ten Dollar Fonts at some point, but the links to purchase seem to have been removed. I've really been looking for a set of numerals with a 3 like contained in Condact, but also love the rest of the Condact design. I found it on Behance. Here's the link:  \n [https://www.behance.net/gallery/3702706/Condact-Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317161324/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.behance.net/gallery/3702706/Condact-Typeface)\n\n",
