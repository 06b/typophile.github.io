  "content": "Hey 'Philers. I could use any information you have on the type used for this building sign. The building was put up around 1965. The Brevoort was also a hotel on that site dating back to the late 1800s, so the typeface could have come from that. I'm hoping to place it in some historical timeframe.\n\n",

I'm more looking for a historical timeframe to place it in so I can pair some other faces with it. My gut is telling me it's from the 30s and some futura might work nicely, but just not sure.\n\n"
