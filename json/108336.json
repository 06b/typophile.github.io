  "content": "I have been experiencing a really weird font issue; I have no idea how it started, but it was not present before. Basically, a bunch of Mac fonts are showing up in the font list in some Office programs, but the fonts are not actually installed, and I never installed them myself. They don't actually work (using Arial/Times New Roman/Courier New as placeholders), and the icon next to the font is not the TrueType/OpenType icon. I attached a picture of the issue. Again, I have no idea how they got there, but I have no way of deleting them since they don't show up anywhere in the Windows fonts folder and restarting the computer doesn't do anything. The fonts also only seem to show up in Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Publisher, but not OneNote... They don't show up in any other application such as WordPad. Has anyone experienced this before? I'm pretty confused and am wondering if there's a solution to this.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011012343im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font%20bug_4193.png)\n\n",
