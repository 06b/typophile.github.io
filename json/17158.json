We wish you happiness and success in 2006.\n\nAs 2005 drew to a close, the good folks at Typographica released their “Favorite Fonts of 2005 - Part 1”, with 5 Village exclusives on the list. They are:  \n/ Arrival by Keith Chi-hang Tam from Type Initiative  \n/ Crank 8 by Greg Lindy & Henk Elenga from Lux Typographics  \n/ Flama by Mario Feliciano from Feliciano Type Foundry  \n/ Garda by Mario Feliciano from Feliciano Type Foundry  \n/ Litteratra by Karsten Luecke from KLTF\n\nThe designers have gotten together and put together a special deal for this package of five notable type families. You can purchase the set for US$575.00, a savings of one-third off the combined price of US$865.00. (That’s a savings of US$190.00.)\n\n[http://vllg.com/offers.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811065127/http:/vllg.com/offers.php \"http://vllg.com/offers.php\")\n\nThis offer will be available through March 31, 2006.\n\nWith best regards from the Village people.\n\nVillage  \n168 Second Avenue #253  \nNew York NY 10003  \nUSA\n\ntelephone ++1 646 654 1506  \nfax ++1 646 429 8597\n\n[http://vllg.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811065127/http:/vllg.com/ \"http://vllg.com\")\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\n",
