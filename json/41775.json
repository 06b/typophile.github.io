  "content": "I am working with numerous small text frames on a modular grid in Indesign CS3, Now that all of the text has been flowed into the frames I want to disable the break threading—without altering what is currently in the frames—so I can work with my hierarchy and not need to keep tweaking frame heights. Is there a way to do this?\n\nAnd I want to do it _without_ copy-pasting everything in reverse order.\n\n",
