Also, not all websites worked with Safari.  \nI’ve been told that Safari is faster with things like browsing for pictures in picture banks, but I don’t think there’s much in it. On the negative point with the Firefox, occasionally I can’t see letters ä and ö on some websites. And since they are in Finnish, it’s rather annoying.  \nFirefox remembers, when allowed, passwords etc, which I find quite useful in an one-person office.\n\n"
