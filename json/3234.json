Definitly usable.   \nIn general I think the uppercase should follow the lowercase more when it is possible.   \nI would make the bottom of the \"E\" like in \"C\", to get it more fluent.   \nI would find another solution for the \"S\", it looks a bit affected...   \nTry connecting the \"K\".   \nYou could try something like in \"Z\" on the \"Y\".   \nAnd maybe make the whole thing a bit bolder...   \n   \nCheers!\n\n"
