There's [Helvetica Extended](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802053753/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/neue-helvetica/helvetica-53-extended/) or [Berthold Akzidenz-](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802053753/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=BQ900380X1P1&start=1)   \n [Grotesk Extended](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802053753/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=BQ900380X1P1&start=1), but no Arial Extended. I once suggested   \nit to David Saunders way back in 1993 who was then with   \nthe Monotype Drawing Office (before the merger with Agfa).   \nI literally told him \"Why not make an extended version of   \nArial? The world can use some more extended faces.\"   \nThat was shortly after I had found out there were only very   \nfew \"wide\" faces in the FontBook.   \n   \nThey didn't follow the advice of a one-year-in novice at   \nFontShop Belgium, can you imagine that?! ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140802053753im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif)   \n   \nNonono, I'm not pulling yer leg, this is a true story, I kid you   \nnot. This is _SO_ funny you bring this up after all those years.\n\n"
