Photography was sternly discouraged, but an understanding security guard allowed me a couple furtive shots of the typography. Any help identifying this lovely font?

Swash Romans are pretty rare too, and none that I know of match this.\n\nThe closest I can think of is Thierry Puyfoulhoux’s large and varied [Classica](http://web.archive.org/web/20080609231630/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/presencetypo/classica/) family which includes a Gallic version with the Venetian style e, and the Prestige subfamily that has all kinds of swashes and ligatures. There is a swash W like the one shown, only it is reversed.\n\nThis might be another time when writing to the Museum might get an answer.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

There were not enough upper case letters in the other samples posted so far to get a good set for the Guide. You would also have a clearer look at the lower case letters, and maybe I picked the wrong shapes for my searches.\n\nThe Museum query may or may not ever get an answer. The last one took three days.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
