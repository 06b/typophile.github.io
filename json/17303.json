Some type designers thought it something you could teach yourself, and others thought it highly worthwhile. Now my question isn’t with regards to the virtues of this particular course, but as to how many of you now practising received any kind of formal training. I myself have been plodding along now for a couple of years, improving in babysteps, following a type apprenticeship with dalton maag. I have no other formal training in the arts whatsoever.\n\n [‹ Looking for an older article on type classification](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706165733/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17412 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [KABK [continued] ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706165733/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17488 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

However, typography, for some, is a conservative artform supposed to have rules and conditions. So, why are they not formalised that much. Why are there few schools to teach you this discipline? I don’t know. it’s a craft, it’s a skill, you can teach yourself, you can learn it from others. Why bothering. Learning is a big time process.  \nIs there a uni for poetry?  \nare there poets with Nobel prices coming from big poetry courses?  \nHowever, I have no answer but a similar questions.\n\n"

You really had to know your type in those days, because mistakes were very expensive to correct. Also the number of fonts to choose from was far far fewer. I was also lucky to have a boss when I started out who took a real interest in making sure I understood type. But, I’m a graphic designer, not a type designer.\n\nI have always thought that a graphic design degree is basically a waste of money.\n\n"

It certainly wasn’t a waste of money.\n\nAlso, unless one devotes years to teaching type design to oneself—and even here, one needs input, feedback, and interaction with one’s peers and mentors (conferences and the internet are the best ways now to accomplish this)—several academic courses are necessary. A single, one semester class isn’t going to cut it, and I doubt that it ever has.\n\nA one-year master’s degree isn’t the only way, but it is one of the fastest. The most positive things that one might learn at Reading or the Hague are quick production methods. And how to use Python. People hiring young type designers are often looking for this skill more than any other. You can teach this to yourself as well, but it’ll take more time that way.\n\nA degree—like it or not—also acts as a badge of authority (depending on where one got it, of course).\n\n"

I think the principle value of such a course is that it packages the information that one needs and compresses the experience of designing a typeface family in a structured timeframe, while at the same time allowing for much more freedom of exploration than working to a commercial deadline. I’m very much aware, as someone who is largely self-taught and who learned on the job, that it has taken a long time to fill various holes in my knowledge, and some still exist: learning on the job, you learn only what you need to get the particular job done. In a programme with a structured curriculum, you are more likely to learn more things in a short period of time.\n\n"

I am living proof that it’s not impossible to miss out on a piece of paper and to learn your craft so my opinion is biased.

There were no classes in type design at RIT (Rochester NY) during those years, but there were many type-related events like the Goudy Awards, and classes in type design taught by Julian Waters (the same class that had been taught by H. Zapf earlier).\n\nBook arts, typography, fine printing and printing history were all elements of the curriculum, but I had to engineer the type design experiences on my own. Internships and self-motivation were the places I learned some of the craft of type design, and now, after 4.5 years as a type designer, I find each new project challenges me and I learn new things. So really my education/experience isn’t finished. But I have been consistently active in letter arts since my childhood.\n\nI do duspect that if there was a program focused on type design I would have progressed faster, and made fewer mistakes, but then too, I’ve been fortunate to have guidance all along the way, simply by asking, sharing and talking. I guess I would say that if someone wants to boost their development they should certainly consider Reading, but in the end I agree that one’s success will depend heavily on determination and sustained interest.\n\nI think I released my first successful typeface at age 29. However, It was preceded by several very labored and unworthy efforts which I am quite glad have never been seen. I am an advocate of discarding one’s first typeface design. Also, that first “successful” design had a very modest brief and was not an ambitious project, and succeeds in its narrow intended application only.\n\nHowever, Jonathan was certainly not the only 15-year-old with a subscription to U&lc.\n\n"

Nick is right that schools all have their norms.\n\nWhat I think generates originality is that each person brings his or her own goals and problems—I mean design or intellectual problems—that motivated the education in the first place. The problem is when the education is overbearing or the student weak, and that spark of interest is squashed.\n\nBut if the school is good at nurturing the individual spark, or the individual is strong, it will not squelch the originality. In this case all learning, whether it is of craft, relevant information, or norms is to the good.\n\nThe important thing if you are a teacher is to nurture the spark while teaching ideas and skills and knowledge. The important thing if you are a student is to keep your individual interests alive and active while you are a student, and spending more time acquiring information and skills, rather than producing.\n\n"

We saw NONE of the bull-headed insistence on “’freedom of exploration’ ...absurdly impractical designs...6 colors plus die cuts plus 3 different kinds of paper.” that Patty refers to. I would be interested to know if all the people Patty has encountered with those problems were from the same school.  \nIf I were 40 years younger and not supporting my family, I would love to attend a one year stint at Reading or The Hague. Type design is a solitary venture and having a brief (one year is quite short) saturated experience with a group of type minded colleagues and first rate teachers sounds like heaven to me. You will have a lifetime to be self-taught, why not take one year to attend a good school. I cannot imagine it doing you harm to be in a community of scholars for that small decimal of time.\n\n“How long has it taken the self-taught to produce the first face that they look back on as fully successful?”  \nI can’t imagine ever feeling anything I have done of any sort to be so fully successful that I could not go back and tinker with it yet again. I will just say that I have produced 4 original type families in the past 2 years. I am far too perfectionistic to pronounce any of them “fully Successful” now and perhaps never will. I don’t think going to a type design school would have any affect on that feeling either. It is just my nature.\n\nMy advice as self-taught old geezer:  \n1. Go take the 1 year program and immerse yourself in it fully.  \n2. Don’t expect to come out of either the school or any other kind of single experience (including self-taught) as being “prepared to be fully successful” by virtue of it.

Some may still work in printshops, newspaper/periodicals, in marketing communications depts., etc. Business, business, business... and, oh yeh... marketing BS.\n\nThe “designer/director/creative” slightly higher in the pecking order will spend more time on proposal writing, meetings and presentations than deeply intrenched in guiding the production.\n\nThe lettering artist used to work in semi-studios or busy production areas, but nowadays since it’s a much rarer skill, can work as an individual at home or in small office... alone.\n\nThe sign painter/maker generally works in a workshop-like area, garage, small industrial space and gets to drink beer with the truckers.\n\nSomething happens to you after formal education. You work!  \nThe skills required (manual, not thinking ones) are generally taught on the job, on the fly, or as you can.\n\nWhen I was teaching second year graphic designers about typography, the only ones (two actually) that progressed the fastest in terms of type sensitivity, were the ones who were already trying some kind of design work as a source of income. Those students during the course of 15 weeks never lost a chance to stay and ask for an opinion or critique of the pieces they designed at work (one of them designed flyers at a small print shop). They asked questions less during class, but more one-on-one after class.\n\nOf the regular day students, many did well, some did not, but only the working students were passionate about learning more!\n\nWhen I was in my senior year at college I was a “brilliant artiste” and it wasn’t until I worked nine-to-five that I realized how much I had to learn.\n\nThere is another aspect to design education that I hope to share (I’m writing notes on type ed) and that has more to do with the height, depth and breadth of learning and understanding one NEEDS to incorporate into their life’s education. Because graphic design is now being taught with fewer academic subjects in the humanities and sciences, graduates are gradually falling lower in the corporate food chain. The devaluation of design and designers by corporations (as well as other creative contributors) is making this world an uglier place.\n\n"

Going straight into the world of work I’ve had time to decide exactly what I want to do, I’ve gained some perspective, and now if I were to study, I would enter it fully committed. I hate to say it but too many students enter a course without this, and it’s no surprise they end up as they do.\n\n"

If the Reading MA in Type Design had existed, and I had known of it back then, I would have gone there instead, and gotten a lot more out of it in terms of my type design abilities. That being said, a lot of the stuff I learned at RIT that I would not have gotten at Reading has been very helpful - I got a much broader education in printing and workflows.\n\nMy experience has been the opposite of Nick’s in one respect - I started out doing extremely derivative stuff, and am now doing things which are at once more original and better executed.\n\nA lot depends on how one learns best, and how one feels about formal education, too. I think the Reading environment would have been good for me, but that doesn’t mean it would be good for everybody.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

So many levels of understanding is essesntial if not critical to approaching design solutions. Design is not just a visual excercise, as evidenced by the depth of dialogue contained throughout Typophile (at least while Chris L and I are not punning you to death).\n\nI’ve made little of my education in this particular thread, but it was extremely intensive from primary school up, and as much training went into the mind as into the hand. By the time I reached college, I was saturated with academic studies, and it was time for my professors to break the shell and let things flow.\n\nAfter college, it was into the workforce, where problems could be reassimilitate and solutions refreshed... with the help and further lessons by seasoned professionals. It ain’t fun if you’re not being challenged, and if you’re not being challenged, you ain’t learning.\n\n"

This may be more due to the feeling that design is about learning software these days rather than learning communication and design problem solving (so brains are not needed). Just look at the crap that passes as logo design these days!  \nI also blame the Marketing “BSers” for emphasizing the focus testing but using poor excuses for design to test. I guess the thinking is you can sell anything to a client if you have “data” even if it is lame data so why pay higher design fees when you can hire a kid who just learned Illustrator in a box! The sad part is that real honest testing and marketing could help improve quality but it would of course cost the marketing firm more to do it.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

A board game for two players, each beginning with 16 pieces of six kinds that are moved according to individual rules, with the objective of checkmating the opposing king._— However, no one not even a computer can guess more then 25 moves ahead (or was it less?), beyond that point it’s pure subjectivity. Although it is crucial to know the rules of chess to play it, these won’t turn you into a good player. Even if it’s hard to hear the rules alone don’t tell you how to win, it is in addition to your talent and hard work that you will checkmate everytime.\n\nI have the firm intention to apply to TypeMedia this year and if I get in I will use this as my moto:\n\n_Getting an education is NOT the same as getting an injection. You should not go to a school or apprentice situation and assume you will be infused with knowledge and skill. You can go to the Doctor and get an injection of antibiotic to cure an infection with little participation other than offering our arm. Schools should not be seen as a large hypodermic device injecting students with a profession. The lion’s share of responsibility lies with the student both during the school experience and after graduation. School plants a seed which the student must nurture fully before he/she can harvest the fruits of their labors._\n\nIn other words, You Get What You Work For.\n\n—ChrisL\n\nThanks Chris for these wise words, they give me goose bumps.\n\n"

They just kept pushing us to push the envelop, to stop being rote thinkers and step through doors that previously _seemed locked_.\n\nSo I guess the core questions is this:  \n- Do I want to learn a craft then do that for the rest of my life, or do I want to learn something that affects the way I do things for the rest of my life?\n\n"
