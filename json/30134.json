Multiple faces with slight differences, or a built-in randomizer ala Kosmik?).\n\nCan anyone shed light? They seem to be simply some nicely-drawn faces based on animation lettering, but are certainly not \"animated\" by any stretch of the imagination, at least not given any definition I've ever heard. Does that industry call their lettering \"animated fonts\" even when the lettering is not actually animated?\n\nHere's the actual press release:\n\nHOUSE INDUSTRIES INTRODUCES \"BURBANK\" COLLECTION OF ANIMATED FONTS\n\n(YORKLYN, DE) December 18, 2006 — In a tribute to the golden age of animation, House Industries is introducing Burbank, a versatile new collection of 20 animated fonts. The collection will be available January 1, 2007.\n\nThe collection features Burbank Big, in three widths and four weights, and Burbank Small, in four weights of both Roman and italic. Designed for mixing and matching, Burbank offers a nearly endless array of combinations.\n\n“Until now, animated typefaces were drawn as single, stand-alone display fonts. They rarely had relatives or a supporting cast,” says Burbank designer Tal Leming, who was inspired by the versatility of his favorite cartoon characters and the hand-lettered titles of classic animation.\n\nOften stymied by the lack of typographic options for his own graphic design projects that called for animated fonts in display and text weights, Leming set to work nearly a decade ago to create the Burbank “super family” of typefaces. The collection features hand hewn fonts from big to small, wide to condensed, light to black and nearly everything in between.\n\n“Designers need a coordinated, animated font family like this. I know that I sure did,” Leming says.\n\nHouse Industries is offering the entire Burbank collection of 20 fonts for $299, including a free T-shirt. Or you can purchase the display and text sets separately, for $199 each. Burbank Big features the 12 display fonts (condensed, regular and wide in light, medium, bold and black weights). Burbank Small includes eight fonts total, four Roman and four italic, for use in text sizes.\n\nOrder online at [www.houseindustries.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348/http:/www.houseindustries.com/ \"www.houseindustries.com\") or call 1-800-888-4390.\n\n",

The display fonts do have two versions of almost every alphanumeric character and some OpenType code that inserts them as needed to prevent similar forms from occurring in a specified range. But, most of the bounce is controlled by the structure of the letterforms themselves. The baselines are systematically shifted to ensure proper bounce. The OpenType feature is insurance so to speak.\"\n"

      "content": "Sorry for being so late to respond to this thread. I've been kerning...\n\n<cite><strong>It’s simply an error in the PR copywriter’s judgement.</strong></cite>\n\nThe error is mine. House has been using the \"animated\" term for years to describe bouncy typefaces. And, the term has historical precedent. For example, pages 38-40 of the Photo Lettering Inc. <cite>Alphabet Thesaurus Volume I</cite> (1960) are referred to as the \"Animated Gothics\" section. Thus, I thought I'd be safe with the term. The confusion probably comes from the fact that we're not hiding that my love for classic [character animation](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_animation) was a huge source of inspiration for this family. Animated fonts. Animated movies. _Animatedly animated animation._ I simply ran out of terms to describe it all. Oh well. Hopefully people will like the fonts.\n\nAs for the questions about the OpenType features and bounce, here's what is going on in the fonts:\n\nBurbank has been meticulously drawn to ensure that all settings have an evenly distributed bounce without resorting to any fancy OpenType features. This works 97% of the time, but occasionally it needs a helping hand. For example, here's a setting showing only the base (non-alternate) letterforms:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/burbank_alt_off_5806.png)\n\nI think it looks pretty good, but the duplicate T letterforms bother me. Being the perfectionist that I am, I had to do something about this. So I drew subtly different alternates for (nearly) the whole range of alphanumeric characters for every member of Burbank Big. The fonts contain OpenType code that inserts these alternates only when needed to alleviate Repetitive Structure Syndrome. The result looks like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/burbank_alt_on_4644.png)\n\nOverlaying the examples shows this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/burbank_alt_overlay_5586.png)\n\nThe alternate **E** is inserted because the **L** has a similar structure to the **E** , the alternate **T** is inserted to eliminate the duplicate form and the rest of the letterforms are the base forms. The OpenType code is used _only_ as a fallback for times when the base forms don't do enough work on their own. This isn't as flashy as [Ed-Interlock](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348/http:/talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/edInterlock/index.html), [Local Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348/http:/talleming.com/pages/work/programming/openType/randomization/index.html) or [Luxury Text-Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015135348/http:/houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=536&subpage=lux_features), but it gets the job done.\n\n"
