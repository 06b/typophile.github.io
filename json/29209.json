The result is FF Call, a package of over 70 fonts from a dozen brands of cellular phones. Each design comes in three versions: Regular, Italic and Negative, plus Expert Sets.\n\nCompatibility list:\n\nFF Call One - Alcatel  \nFF Call Two - Bosch  \nFF Call Three - Ericsson  \nFF Call Four - Motorola  \nFF Call Five - Nokia  \nFF Call Six - Panasonic  \nFF Call Seven - Philips  \nFF Call Eight - Siemens  \nFF Call Nine - Sony\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Call at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121343/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11200.0.0)\n\n",
