And they have even [more specific instructions](http://web.archive.org/web/20111231071139/http:/www.signature-fonts.com/logo_font_instructions.asp):\n\n\"Multi-Color Logo Font Usage:\n\n1. Once the font has been installed, open the program you intend to use the logo font in, such as a word processer or graphics program.  \n2. When you have come to the place in the document or image in which you wish to place the logo, select ANY font other than your logo font and type in the numbers 1 thru 7 (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 -- do NOT include spaces). Assign a point size of \"120 points\" for your first test. There are 7 different color elements in this particular color-logo-font, and we need assign a different color to element (number) that you typed.  \n**3. Highlight each character one at a time and assign a different color to each one. Once all 7 numbers have been assigned a color, hightlight all 7 numbers by dragging your curson across them.**  \n4. Once the 7 numbers are highlighted, open the font selection tool and scroll down through the list of fonts until you find \"YourLogo\", and then select.  \n5. Your multi-color logo will now appear in your document.\"\n\n"
