You see it all the time on '70s graphics, apparently because idiot designers decided that it somehow evoked the '20s and '30s, and stuck it all over things like album covers for old music. Of course, it looked \\*nothing\\* like any font you'd actually see from the '20s and '30s - typesetters had far better taste then...fortunately it's decreased in popularity in recent years.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with Jay on the Modernism/Post-Modernism issue. One problem I think you have with this discussion is the deffinition of those two movements. They are so broad, and so contemporary that it is hard to define one or the other, and therefor difficult to talk about them being very different. I might argue that Post-Modernism is really just that, something tacked on to modernism. The philosophy is based on the same theory, in PM it has been taken to the next logical, or illogical step as the artist dictates in PM. Modersim is alive and well. Much of the theory and ideas that grew out of early modernism has yet to be explored fully, and so much of post-modernism is merely an exploration of the original Modernist theory.   \n   \nWhat I am really trying to say is that they are two sides of the same coin. Now if you disagree you may be talking about something completely different than what I am referring to. Becuse, like I said before, the two names are so encomassing that without a clear deffinition it is impossible to understand what we are talking about.\n\n"
