Casual, airy counters and friendly terminals give it an advantage as a packaging font for exotic coffees and teas. It also serves quite well on posters and book jackets where relaying the famous sense of eastern hospitality and playfulness is a must.\n\n**[Uplink](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111728/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/118)** is decorative upright lettering with heavy calligraphic influences and clear friendly forms. Alternate forms with artificial \"tail\" connections, swashing their way from one letter across the vertical stroke of the next, add an unusual yet distinctly human detail to the forms that shape the words. Uplink's reserved humor can be a little tolerant of mechanical abuses like shearing or stretching, which makes it ideal for food product packaging design.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111728im_/http:/typophile.com/files/amazonian_6480.jpg)\n  \n **[Amazonian Pack](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204111728/http:/new.myfonts.com/package/316829/)** is an incredible set of exotic sources; Makiritare is inspired by the craftsmanship of an ethnic baskets. Tepuy is a round font created to compose a new form and as the Makiritare comes in two weights Light and Regular. Palaima is a fonts with unusual architectural round strokes. To complete the set you found a pictorial font, Precolumbino, that contains an interesting collection of pre-Columbian petroglyphs from the jungle in the Amazon. \n",
