Great mammoths overthrown  \nComposedly have made their long sojourns,  \nLike palaces of patience, in the gray  \nAnd changeless lands of ice. And at Pompeii\n\nThe little dog lay curled and did not rise  \nBut slept the deeper as the ashes rose  \nAnd found the people incomplete, and froze  \nThe random hands, the loose unready eyes  \nOf men expecting yet another sun  \nTo do the shapely thing they had not done.\n\nThese sudden ends of time must give us pause.  \nWe fray into the future, rarely wrought  \nSave in the tapestries of afterthought.  \nMore time, more time. Barrages of applause  \nCome muffled from a buried radio.  \nThe New-year bells are wrangling with the snow.\n\n"
