  "content": "I have been recently hired to create the layout for a couple of websites for a high profile university research group (don’t ask why, I really don’t have much experience in webdesign). The programmer is giving me a hard time because the only person he listens to is Mr. Jacob Nielsen. My main concern is to make the reading experience as comfortable as possible ON SCREEN so that the user doesn’t even dream about printing the page and wasting paper.\n\nA part from considerations about the right typeface etc. do you have any information about column width? For big chunks of text, how long should the text column be? I don’t like the idea of wide chunks of text as I don’t find particularly comfortable moving my eyes (and neck) from left to right all the time when I read. The programmer wants to keep the text line very wide because he assumes people will want to print. I’m sorry if I’m not explaining it very well but I would be grateful if you could point me to interesting links on this issue, or websites that encourage people to read on screen rather than print and how to make things more comfortable for the reader.\n\nWe are designing one site with EZ Publish and another one with Moodle, anyone has an opinion on these?  \nI know there are tons of stuff on the web but I’m not sure which one is the most reliable and I dislike that J. Nielsen. In fact I know there’s been a discussion on him back in 2002 on Typophile but it was mainly about Flash. Thank you so much as usual.\n\n",

You might encourage him by pointing out that some of us (including yours truly) are actually programmers [too].\n\n\\> The programmer wants to keep the text line very  \n\\> wide because he assumes people will want to print.\n\nOne should also assume that people will <cite>read</cite> the printout... Long line lengths are in fact more damaging in print than onscreen, because reading in print has a much better chance of getting more immersive. Try explaining that the gap between lines has to be larger the longer the lines, to ensure good \"line returns\", and that ends up wasting just as much space. And if you're not going to use CSS to increase leading you're sort of naturally channeled into a maximum line-length value.\n\nFont: Georgia.  \nIf you're ambitious, try two columns.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "First of all, the great thing about the web is you can design the page to look different on paper than it does on screen. Use a print style sheet for that.\n\nIf the text is inevitably long, just assume folks will print it. The screen is great for scanning long texts, not so great for reading long texts.\n\nYes, line length is important. About the only way to control that on screen is to layout your columns of text using ems as measurements. That way, if the type increases/decreases in size, so will the column, thereby preserving the line lenght. Of course, if a person happens to need large time, but still wants a narrow browser, then things get hard for them.\n\nSo...I'd set a width for your column using ems, and then set a max-width in pixels (to something like 700 pixels or so) to accomodate those that need big type but don't want to deal with horizontal scrolling.\n\n"

Again, screen resolution is not the key issue. The size of the browser viewport is the key stat, and one that is very often not tracked at all. Yes, a lot of people will have their browser maximized, but there are a number of exceptions: those with side panels open, those with huge monitors that browser with multiple windows side-by-side, mac users, and power users who actually take advantage of modern multi-windowed OSes by having multiple windows open.\n\nAs for CMS, it depends entirely on the template engine they decide to implement. Most are really crappy. Few support true CSS layout and few support basic concepts like valid HTML. The best bet is to find a CMS that does not even try to implement a template engine allowing you and your developers to make your own templates from scratch.\n\n"
