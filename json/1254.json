I have run it through What The Font and the MyFonts.com forum (no-one picked it) and I have looked in every catalogue such as T-26 and House Industries that I can lay hands on. The font is unusual and for some reason I really like it. I want to use it on a logo if I find it.\n\n"

I have done more research and the logo appears on this website [http://www.latitudetower.com.au](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524125503/http:/www.latitudetower.com.au/) and their corporate font is Digital Sans. I therefore think the \"Latitude\" logo is an altered version of Digital Sans. Anyone agree there?\n\n"
