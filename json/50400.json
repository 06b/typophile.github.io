Julian Rice, published by the University of New Mexico Press, available at\n\n[http://www.amazon.com/Ella-Delorias-Buffalo-People-Deloria/dp/0826315070](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012040740/http:/www.amazon.com/Ella-Delorias-Buffalo-People-Deloria/dp/0826315070 \"http://www.amazon.com/Ella-Delorias-Buffalo-People-Deloria/dp/0826315070\")\n\nTypographically speaking, I remember setting this book. It was set before PostScript fonts, using a Linotron 202. What is significant here is that I was limited by characters available for the 202, and movement of characters limited by the 202 — not TeX, but the L-202, then called an “output device.”\n\nWe could do a much better job today — at least, if we used a font where the EULA permitted modifications to create custom diacriticals.\n\nTypography aside, at the end of the book is an appendix showing two different orthographies for rendering Lakota in written form using the Latin alphabet.\n\n"
