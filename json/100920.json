At a later date, the combining diacriticals are made up. If the eacute (U+00E9) is now turned into components per above, the U+00E9 character somehow remembers that the \"right\" component for the acute as U+00B4 rather than U+0301 (the latter being the combining diacritic).\n\nAnyway on FontLab to get the correct accent components in these characters, aside from making them again, by hand?\n\n",
