  "content": "I want to use a bold sans serif. I've been working with Franklin Gothic in heavy and book, because it has a really friendly personality. I just want something with radius corners instead of sharp corners. I've been searching pretty carefully but everything is either too stylized or retro or playful. I'm just looking for something simple and sophisticated that looks wholesome and good-natured.\n\nThanks in advance for any input!\n\n",
