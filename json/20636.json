If someone would be interested in assisting on the project please drop an email to\n\nrat\\_baggy [-at-] hotmail.com\n\nAll character art will exist, it seems that at this stage it will simply (or perhaps not) be a matter of placing the characters and producing the font file (cross platform etc) to international standards etc.\n\nPlease provide rough timeline, costing and or if you require additional information.\n\nCheers,\n\nPaul\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks to those who replied. Unfortunately it seems the client probably didn't realise the costs involved in a custom design & production of a font. I will keep your details on file should a similar project arise.\n\nFor others, feel free to drop me an email. I will keep them on file should the need arise again.\n\nThanks,\n\n----------  \n**Paul Ducco**  \nSolid Creative  \n [Communication Design, Melbourne](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015063602/http:/www.solid-creative.com/)\n\n"
