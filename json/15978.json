Then it has had a fancy engraved drop shadow added to it.\n\nIf it’s only a piece of one-off display setting you’re doing, it occurs to me that you could fake this digitally by setting the line in the MT Old English Text (even Linotext would do at a pinch) at 100% black, duplicating the type with an offset to the right and down a bit, sending the offset to the back, tinting it with a 50% screen of black and setting a custom line halftone (around 60 degrees and 60 l.p.i.) on it. If you’re working in either Illustrator or Freehand you can also use the outline stroke feature to fatten up the drop shadow so it goes right around the foreground type.\n\n"

I should have specified that the line shading isn’t part of the typeface, but yes, you’re right, an added feature.\n\n"
