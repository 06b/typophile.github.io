To me it looks like misaligned connections (like when you're drawing and the lines don't quite meet up all the way), but I think you're right that it will look better to include some serifs.   \n   \nThey do want an edgy look. They are mainly a cover band, with a VERY strong emphasis on rock (70's to current).\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with Paul about the serifs - it gives the design more character. Also the original has more contrast between the thick and thin strokes (ie: the underline and the top of the s). The newer versions lose that contrast and feel monotone. The connection between the G and o on the middle sketch causes me to read Too Many Grods.   \n   \nPersonally, I'm not getting an \"edgy\" feel from this. Don't interprut that to mean I don't like it, because I do. It's just it makes me think more of the chrome lettering off a 50's Ford Fairlane or someting rather than a rock-n-roll band. And it may just be a matter of semantics, but when I hear the word \"edgy\" in relation to music I think more of punk or grunge. From your loose description I sense they cover more of Led Zep and the like. Is that correct? Obviously since one of the band members drew the initial sketch it is something they like and you should continue on that path. However, just as an additional option, you may want to look at the logos of the bands they cover the most it may give you additional inspiration as to how to better relate the music they perform with their logo.\n\n"

I agree that it might not be the best solution for their needs, but felt I should include a solid version of it since they obviously liked it. I might post the other concepts I have as I continue to refine them.   \n   \nThanks again for all the help!\n\n"

The G also looks like it could benefit from some modulation. i keep hopin you'll get some criticism from someone with more expertise than me! maybe they'll start bitin tonite...\n\n"

Does not say anything to me about what TMG is or does.   \nSince the name has obvious religious connotations, how about the \"T\" shaped being like a cross. maybe astaggered formation of 3 lines with type/elements interacting. Or perhaps sacred geometry. If this is not your flavor going grunge may be a way to go. Although grunge is dead there may be a use for it once in a while. If this band is punk or very hard rock consider attached image as a starting point.   \n ![tmg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525174544im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/38583.jpg)   \nbtw. formating the size for inten ded usage should be an important consideration. A logo like you had could look great on a wide banner but would lack visibility on standard sized printed materials (4x6, postcard, 2x3.5 business card, posters,etc.\n\n"
