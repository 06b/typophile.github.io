I find it interesting but ultimately kind of a novelty.   \n   \nDid you know Scott Kim designed the original Adobe logo? Not only that, some of the illustrations in his book were done using a predecessor of PostScript called JaM. The book was published in 1981 by Byte magazine and has a \"backword\" by Jef Raskin, the guy who started the Macintosh project at Apple.   \n   \nKim's stuff is more interesting intellectually, but Langdon's stuff is more aesthetically pleasing.\n\n"
