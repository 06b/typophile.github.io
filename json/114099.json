Are you looking for a text font that would work with Goudy Old Style headers, or are you picking type for other kinds of headers, captions, tables, lists, etc.?  \n90 of Frederic Goudy’s typefaces were issued, and many have been digitized. You might start by looking at other Goudy faces.\n\n"

I was looking for another font to head the sub categories, right now I am going with Antonio. I perused the myriad of other Goudy fonts but didn't fall in love with any for the look I am going for. Thank you for the good advice though.\n\n"
