In other words is small caps an optically adjusted set of caps?\n\n"

On the other hand, the default parentheses in this face are really long, so would perhaps overpower All Small Caps.

If so were they lining or old-style?  \nI know a few fonts nowadays offer small caps numerals which is definitely a great feature, But in a typeface like the one Nina used here the small caps are at x-height and small caps punctuation is designed that way too. So the old-style numerals look really nice in those parentheses the problem is when the small caps are bigger than x-height. ’Petite’ caps are another great feature. It’s amazing how type designers keep making everyone else’s life easier.\n\n"

The apostrophe should be as in the second example or just a bit lower than that”\n\nWhen setting the apostrophe aligend to the x-height, I’m thinking about some very specific typographic setting; in particular, a title, or a display text, set in all small caps with very tight leading. Like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103022653im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pilgrim_cover_3422.jpg)\n\nThe matter here is avoiding the SC apostrophe, commas, etc, to clash with the above or bottom text line. I wouldn’t use an apostrophe set that way in a default line of current text (say, in a book page). The thing can be adjust manually, of course, but I was suggesting that having some alternate SC glyphs, with aligned height, would be useful.\n\n"

But it’s not a typical small caps setting, for which small caps should be optimized; and in a more typical small caps setting – i.e. embedded in running (mixed-case) text – the consensus seems to be that the apostrophe should not be completely lining with the small cap height. So maybe what you show could be a .titl alternate or something.\n\n"

I think the third example is otherwise an error that is comfortable because it is congruent with the compromise that is the quote alignments for uppercase. Multicase alignment of quotes works easier the bigger the x-ht, and less so the smaller the x-ht (apos. shows first and worst with a small x-ht, I think because the back end of ’ before s, e.g. is so open. With small caps floating between the cases, quotes and small caps should just work with the multicase alignment if x-ht is otherwise.\n\n\\>It used to be standard practice for lettering artists to raise the apostrophe and quote marks in all caps settings.\n\nI like that, but am assuming one line of text. I don’t think even OpenType can detect this, so a special set of high quotes, as much as I’d love to make them sometimes, would require decidedly manual employment I think, (as perhaps small cap aligned for all small caps all the time, quotes would need to be employed?).\n\nCheers!\n\n"
