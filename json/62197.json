Ronald Arnholm's _Legacy_ and _Legacy Sans_ are based on the work of the Venice-based punchcutter Nicolas Jenson (as is Bruce Roger's _Centaur_). You might even use those two faces for the body and marginalia, respectively, and use _Centaur_ for headings or as a display face. Robert Slimbach's _Adobe Jenson_ also has much to recommend it, and like _Legacy_ was designed on a computer (whereas _Centaur_ is a digitization of a Monotype revival of a roman cut in 1469).\n\n"
