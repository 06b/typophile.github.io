  "content": "Pistilli Roman was digitalised by Castcraft in their OPTI font range as OPTI Pirogi Roman which is now difficult to find. More recently, I have found a moderately good example of this font in the GST (GreenStreet) 500 Elegant Fonts range hiding under the name Galeere. It's not perfect and it doesn't have the alt flowery ampersand. Shame.\n\n",

I know of at least one other designer who has also created a digital version of the font (custom for a particular client). I've tried, years ago, to contact Pistilli but to no avail. I wonder if he is still alive.\n\n"

      "content": "In 1969, Phil Martin (Alphabet Innovations) did a Pistilli Roman look-alike with tons of swash and alternate characters called Didoni. [Didoni is available from Red Rooster](http://web.archive.org/web/20130423060640/http:/www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=3192&issingle=yes), but, unfortunately, when it was digitized, the extra characters (including the fancy ampersand) were left out.\n\n"
