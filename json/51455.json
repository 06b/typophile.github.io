  "content": "Hi,  \nThe PANOSE System?  \nIs Panose a necessity?  \nWhat implications are there for using it well and not using it properly?  \nA lot of the various selectable terms seem pretty general.  \nI'd love to hear from anyone here on this topic.  \nI've searched here but got generalized usage of the word.  \nHave been to [www.panose.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013014603/http:/www.panose.com/ \"www.panose.com\") and understand what it is, but is it a necessity?  \nIs it up to me to select whether a font is one thing and not another, when some of the terminology break-ups are close in meaning to another word in the list. (I know some are distinct but some seem not that different)  \nDoes getting PANOSE right matter? Does using it?\n\nAny thoughts?  \nCheers In Advance  \nDrj\n\n",
