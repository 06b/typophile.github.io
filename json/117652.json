      "content": "As I said in my previous post the original name is unknown but the Solo version was Titania. I discussed who might have done original digitizations and who were the copycats. The problem is that the likely original digital fonts are very difficult to obtain legitimately. For commercial use I recommend the Solofont digital version included in Dover/Solofont Art Nouveau book + CD pack. The Steffmann version is a pirated copy.  \nDon\n\n"
