Even Font Book and Linotype FontExplorer can’t open the ex-FFIL files, which are about 50% of the fonts I have!\n\nI think this might be an problem of my computer, but since I’m the only one who works on Leopard in my office, so I decide to ask people here for an advice.  \nDoes anyone know what’s going on with my new working equipment?  \nPlease please help me!\n\n [‹ Kerning changes from a software to another](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012144626/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47065 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [10.4 or 10.5? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012144626/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47044 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "What Mark is alluding to, is a situation where the old hidden “resource fork” data has been stripped away from your font file by storing the file on a file system that doesn’t support it. On your old system, make a .zip or .sit archive of the fonts and then move them over. At this point in history, font suitcases are just about the only type of file in common use that keeps critical data in the resource fork. In the old days most common document formats used resource fork data to identify the filetype, but you could still often get it to work by adding a file extension. Not so with font suitcases.\n\nNote: You can verify this by getting info on the file. If it’s 0K in size, this is what is happening.\n\nThis can be very confusing for people who recently switched to Mac because no analogous situation exists with other operating systems. Basically, Apple is providing backward compatibility with a 20yr old file format.\n\n"
