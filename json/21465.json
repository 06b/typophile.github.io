Of course MyFonts doesn't carry everything, but that would be countered by the old stuff they add as other designers join their ranks - so I'd guess that the yearly total would be pretty accurate.\n\nAnother idea might be to ping the ATypI country delegates - but being one myself I don't have a number for the country I represent.\n\n"

On my self iniated work, I'm prone to let time work out the problems, maybe let a font simmer on the back burner for awhile. I can only paraphrase, but about 5 years ago Eye magazine featured a Gerard Unger interview in which he mentioned having to build in time for reflection as a way to counteract the sometimes speedy process of drawing glyphs.\n\n"

Sometimes its hinting, sometimes its changing font formats, sometimes its adding extra glyphs, sometimes its designing new weights, and sometimes its designing new fonts. The work could take several minutes to several weeks. I have on occasion drawn a complete Type1 character set over the weekend, and kerned it on Monday, but I agree with Eric, that it is important for reflection. So you do wind up saving the reflection for your own work. Your custom clients are not paying you to reflect.\n\nJames\n\n"
