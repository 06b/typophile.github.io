He launched [Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043147/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typophile) on his birthday in April 2000 in hopes of creating a venue where designers could get together to share knowledge and critique one another's work. Jared originally vetted the idea for Typophile with [Jonathan Hoefler](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043147/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jonathan%20Hoefler) while interning at [The Hoefler Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043147/http:/typophile.com/wiki/The%20Hoefler%20Type%20Foundry) in summer of 1999, and later launched it as a component of his BFA thesis.\n\nWhen he's not spending every waking moment working on Typophile, he's acting as Executive Creative Director at San Francisco interface design firm [Punchcut](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043147/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Punchcut). From 2004-2010, he served as a member of the [FontFont TypeBoard](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043147/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont%20TypeBoard).\n\nJared has designed a number of typefaces, however none have yet made their way to the retail market. His bitmap fonts can be found scattered throughout the Typophile Critique boards.\n\nHis bitmap font, QC Sans, is bundled with the Qualcomm developer SDK and is becoming a popular choice on many mobile carrier's handsets. QC Sans was developed in collaboration with [Christian Robertson](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809043147/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christian%20Robertson).\n\nJared has a BFA in Graphic Design from Brigham Young University.\n\n",
