Could have been done by a Victorian typemaker with little imagination or a similarly changed modern designer.  \nCompare it with the somewhat similar, but much better designed Algerian [http://www.myfonts.com/search/algerian/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011012350/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/algerian/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/algerian/fonts/\")  \nDon\n\n"
