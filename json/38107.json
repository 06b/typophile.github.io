  "content": "Can you help me identify the fonts used here? These cover letters are from the U.S., so I believe they’re American fonts. I haven’t been able to find or identify them anywhere yet. Maybe they haven’t been digitalized yet at all. We have two different fonts here, by the way, though pretty similar: the one with “Gerald R. Ford”, the other is from “Venrock Associates”. Thank you so far, and excuse the bad quality.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [3105\\_bild\\_1\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/files/3105_bild_1_1.jpg) | 13.18 KB |\n| [3105\\_bild\\_2\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/files/3105_bild_2_1.jpg) | 9.36 KB |\n| [3105\\_bild\\_3\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/files/3105_bild_3_1.jpg) | 8.1 KB |\n| [3105\\_bild\\_4\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/files/3105_bild_4_1.jpg) | 22.42 KB |\n| [3105\\_bild\\_5\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/files/3105_bild_5_1.jpg) | 16.96 KB |\n\n [‹ Religious, churchy type serif face, similar to Mason](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/node/38162 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Carol Brand logo slab serif ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203209/http:/typophile.com/node/38158 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Ford isn’t that old either — I’ll try to find out when he was active (government), because the date is missing on this paper.\n\nI have already noticed the Engravers packages from Monotype Imaging, which include the Sackers in package no. 2 — a font often used by the government, White House etc. Unfortunately, these really seem to be the only ones digitalized yet.\n\nBy the way, I don’t think it is any of the above mentioned fonts though. Of course, one of them is pretty similar, but still they’re different.\n\nDoes anyone else have an idea? Also, I’m pretty sure that the pictured examples include two different fonts. They are not the same either.\n\n"

I’m not convinced at all that it’s one of the Engravers from Monotype. It still seems to be another font to me. Especially the middle serif of the “G” is not that wide in the original, the little gap of the “R” is missing in the original, and the middle bar of the “E” is set a little higher in the original.
