My AD and I had sort of a falling out over the site and he has not shared the information about what font this is. I think the other one - CONTACT - is Century Gothic but I might be wrong.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080411063001im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/BFB%20714_6438.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080411063001im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/font_6288.gif)\n\n [‹ (x) Frank Zappa/Grandmaster Flash record covers - custom designed/Quicksilver {Dav/Tim D}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080411063001/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20222 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) The Film Consortium logo grotesque - Akzidenz-Grotesk {Manlio, Sebastian} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080411063001/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33898 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
