I’m really excited about working here and just as excited about posting to the Typophile blog. I’m looking forward to sharing with everyone interesting typography, graphic imagery, and stories I’ll come across on the internet or around San Francisco. There’s plenty of great work and ideas to be shared, and I think the Typophile community is a great place to do it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121100049im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/hello_blog_3999.gif)\n\n",
