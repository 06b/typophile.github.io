He was vacationing at a family cabin in Canada with his wife when he unexpectedly had a massive heart attack.<cite></cite></cite>\n\nWill went by the user name \\*Powers\\* on Typophile. Before becoming a designer, he was a printer. Not a monitor-watcher, but an old-fashion printer. I will miss Will and his ironical sense of humor.\n\n",

That is very unexpected and tragic.\n\nI've known Will for about ten years, running into him now an then through various professional and typographic concerns.\n\nI first heard of him when he wrote a column about typography for Advertising Techniques\\* magazine back in the early '80s. At the time he worked at a typesetting house in Minneapolis.\n\nLast time I saw him was at TypeCon in Buffalo. I participated in the Ludlow workshop he gave there. He couldn't make it to Atlanta this year, but was hoping to do more Ludlow workshops in the future.\n\nWow. So sad. He will be missed.\n\n(\\*Sister publication to Art Direction magazine.)\n\n"

As kind and generous in the handful of times I got to meet with him in the past few years as he was in posts here.\n\nEarly last October, Will wrote me an email with two items. First was that he had decided the beautiful two-volume Deberny & Peignot 1927 specimen he had dug out of his treasure trove and loaned to me for my Face the Nation exhibition needn't be returned; he was offering it to my university's library as a gift.\n\nThe second item was that somehow he had arranged to commandeer the 6:30 am slot at a small local radio station the following Monday, and he invited me to listen is as he would be playing Ray Charles's early jazz recordings. I listened; it was fantastic.\n\nAnother memory that makes me smile is Kent Lew at Buffalo TypeCon announcing to convention-goers that Will had left but wanted everyone to hear his advice to place the lead Ludlow slugs he'd given out as souvenirs of his workshop/presentation in an easily accessible location within luggage lest they raise the eyebrows of airport security.\n\nWe've lost a knowledgeable resource and a generous friend.\n\n"

Like John, I always had a good feeling about and around him.\n\n_New Types for New Books_ is well written and so insightful. Every typographer, and especially every type designer, could learn something from it. It's great evidence of his enthusiasm and expertise.\n\n"

Since then he has become a good friend as well as an esteemed colleague. I remember sitting down to that first beer together and the invigorating, wide-ranging conversation, discovering all our many shared interests.\n\nIn addition to our love of type and typography, the history and the craft, Will and I shared an interest in birds and wildlife. We would periodically send reports to each other of the local changes of season -- Will: the flights of snow geese and pelicans up the central flyway or the first kinglet in April; or me: a fallout of spring warblers or a bittern \"singing\" from a nearby swamp.\n\nLast year he invited me to be on the jury to select book interiors for the AAUP's annual competition. We had a wonderful time talking about books and hanging out in NYC, where the judging took place. Later, in July, at the AAUP annual conference in Montreal, I fondly recall skipping out on the Saturday morning sessions together to spend 4 hours tramping around the Parc du Mont Royal instead, investigating the local birds and enjoying the trails.\n\nI was looking forward to hearing tales of this last month's grand tour around the Rockies and back across the Canadian plains to the cabin in Ontario. Will had confided in me that after his return, he was planning to ease into retirement from the press. He was looking forward to time for personal projects.\n\nThis sudden and permanent retirement is not what any of us had in mind. He will be sorely missed.\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"

Will's common sense and reasonableness made everything he wrote, here and elsewhere, seem like a refreshing breeze that swept out the nonsense.\n\nHe was one of that small number of practitioners who care intensely about the details of book typography. Like so many of those, he came out of the craft of book production, so his design was grounded in the realities of typesetting, printing -- and reading. I will very much miss his side of this ongoing conversation.\n\nWill was looking forward to coming to this year's ATypI conference in Mexico City, a favorite place of his.
