      "content": "It seems there are two potential issues from the above discussion if I read the comments correctly: vertical metrics and perhaps, kerning problems. The second one I haven't seen as much commentary on but I view it as much more troubling: why would the OS not correctly read a plain kern table that appears in every T1 font? That one needs to get resolved.\n\nFor the former, a likely explanation is that the T1 fonts have always used a different calculation for ascender/descender total dimensions in determining vertical metrics, compared to TT fonts and now, OTF. In fact, FontLab has a screen for that exact thing, and an easy check if this is the explanation would be the following:\n\nOpen one of the T1 fonts causing a problem in Snow Leopard in FontLab. Go to the vertical metrics page under font info, and observe the ascender/descender dimensions as-shown. Hit the recalculate button. If new numbers appear--and those WOULD be the vertical metrics used were it a TT or OTF font--then that is surely the explanation for the leading problem in SL. When you use default leading options like \"single-spaced\" in software such as Word, TextEdit et al., the OS uses these global vertical metrics in determining line spacing. In the SL code rewrite, they are pulling that info from the OTF-method and not the former T1-method.\n\nThis could be confirmed one other way as well--for one of your T1 fonts in SL with a reflow problem, use an exact-point size leading option in your software (e.g., exactly 14 points) instead of a leading option based on the global vertical metrics (e.g., single-spaced, or 0.8 times single-spaced). If my reasoning is the explanation, then the former will not have the vertical padding problem and the source of this glitch will be identified.\n\nUnfortunately, unless Apple is willing to patch the OS code to pull the metrics data using the old approach for T1 fonts, there would seem to be no workaround short of reformatting your old documents, or converting the T1 fonts to OTF. And if you did the latter, and you \"fixed\" the discrepancy between the T1 and TT/OTF methods for calculating vertical metrics, you'd STILL need to reformat your legacy document anyway. So either way, it involves needless work for the T1 font user--but at least you don't NEED to repurchase your T1 fonts just because they are not in OTF format.\n\nI welcome all comments on my faulty logic, I'm just brainstorming in this lengthy post.........and I DO want SL because it really jazzes up my Apple TV :-)\n\n"

Mac PostScript Type 1 fonts are comprised of two files, one containing the PS outline data and basic metrics (the sidebearings) and the other, a Mac \"suitcase\" file containing the kerning, style linking and other metrics data. Could it be that Snow Leopard is getting all its info from the outline file and ignoring the suitcase file? That would explain the lack of kerning and possibly the line spacing discrepancy for some fonts. Perhaps Snow Leopard needs the .afm file as well (which was needed for programs that couldn't get the metrics from the font suitcase)? Like I said, just speculating.\n\n"
