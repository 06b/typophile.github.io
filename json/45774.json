The client is a sort of web based \"job agency\" for companies.\n\n_Invenio_ is Latin for \"I find\".\n\nAll comments and suggestions are welcome.\n\nYours,  \nMåns\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019155414im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sketch1_invenio_5238.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi. I think the 2nd example in caps works the best. Maybe as a suggestion you could make a version with a less bold font, to see how that works out. Also in the 2nd version, is the V point the actual V of the font? Maybe if it is you could look at making the compass something less like the V and more like a compass point. I think as long as the point looks something 'like' a V then you would get away with it not matching the font as such. Did that make sense? Like the idea though.\n\nJH\n\n"

      "content": "Agreed... the second one. Perhaps there is a way to make the box stand out more if that's what you're going for. Maybe use the color for the box not the star shape. My eyes see the star more than the box. Or if the box was black and the color was on the rest of the text? I don't care for the two colors you've used so far. Not on screen at least.\n\nI do like the bold more than I think I'd like something lighter in weight.\n\n"

I agree the compass tend to take over the whole thing; below I am trying a lighter approach. The box is meaningless, though I rather liked the star-shape in the negative space. I have got rid of both in the versions below.\n\n@iffy: are the new colors better, you think?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019155414im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sketch2_invenio_6255.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "definite improvement all round I'd say. Glad that most people went with the caps version. My favourite is the first one, as the compass points are a little more stylised. You've probably tried it already, but does it work making the four points slightly bigger? It doesn't matter in the first version, although if you were to go with the other versions, making the points a bit bigger might work to harmonise the lettering to the point.\n\nGood work.\n\nJH\n\n"
