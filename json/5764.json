  "content": "hi there,   \n   \ni'm currently working on a project for TV.   \ntask is to design a form full of text information.   \nI'm wondering what are the most-suitable typefaces for broadcast. I tried Univers, Helvetica, but its not very good in terms of legebility. Those font that work best on screen dont work on TV. I'm thinking if i should go for FF meta, FF info? whatelse should i try?   \nplease name a few...   \n   \nappreciate your help\n\n",

      "content": "I made fonts for MS WEB-TV in 1998.   \n   \nFonts should have 2 pixel wide features, stems, counters or serifs and spaces between letters. If they are one pixel they will be lost in most cases due to the line scans and blur.   \n   \nBigger size and bold is better.   \nColours: No pure Black on pure White... causes visable movemnet and noise.   \n   \nUse Anti-aliasing or anti-flicker filters to smooth out the colours so the gun doesn't cause noise or spikes. ie... going from full OFF to FULL on is bad that's why pure black and pure white are bad.   \n   \nOur fonts were manually tuned and use Windows CE and Windows anti-aliasing, plus an additional filter for antiflicker.\n\n"
