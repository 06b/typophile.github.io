  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nI am happy to report that I have a Lettering class starting up soon. We did this last year and it was _fun_!\n\n**GRPH 151 Lettering and Type**  \nWednesdays: 1:00–5:00pm  \nCCSF Ocean Campus: 50 Phelan Ave., Health Center 207  \n8-week course: August 16–October 4  \nCRN 76937\n\nHere is a [gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171422/http:/www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Graphic_Communications/Gallery/Student/Lettering_Type/Lettering_Type.htm) of last year's student work, and here is the [catalog entry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171422/http:/www.ccsf.edu/Catalog/Art/grphcors.html#GRPH%20151) for a formal description (ignore the pre-requisite).\n\nAll that entry requires is enrolling at [City College](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171422/http:/www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Matriculation/step1.htm). Everything else we can take care of on the first day of class.\n\nBTW, it's a one-unit class, making it a whopping **$26**!\n\nFeel free to email me with questions,\n\nAmy Conger  \n [aconger@ccsf.edu](mailto:aconger@ccsf.edu)  \n [ccsf.edu](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171422/http:/fog.ccsf.cc.ca.us/~aconger/): my academic web site  \n [abecedarienne.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171422/http:/www.abecedarienne.com/): my fonts and art web site\n\n",
