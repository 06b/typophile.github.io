There was also an update in InDesign which i run. Nothing else have I done, except from exporting the fonts in the same way I always do.  \nThe glyphs show themselves in FontLab, but not anymore in applications.\n\nAnyone experience this problem? It’s driving me crazy.\n\n [‹ FL5 component position](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225327/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33052 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Kerning in OTF and InDesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225327/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32929 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
