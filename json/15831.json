  "content": "Hi. I’m sure someone has already asked about this, but the search function is not working for me.\n\nI need to know the typefaces used in Wallpaper\\* mag for a university project I have. The inital assumption was that it is Meta of some variety, but I’ve noticed the lowercase gs in Wallpaper have a closed loop but in Meta they are open.\n\nI am stuck, WhatTheFont was no help either. Any help would be appreciated! If anyone knows the serif face used as well, that would be awesome.\n\nThanks\n\nNicole\n\n",
