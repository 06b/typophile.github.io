      "content": "Machine that printed the receipt [dot matrix?] may have its own hardwired font. Looks like it could be the equivalent of a 1980s Apple bit-map font. As for the design for the bit-map, the source could be anything. Note reduction of capital A to fit an umlaut into the line space. This was an occasional practice in designing metal fonts in Germany, and probably elsewhere where capital letters filled the line height. So if you want this effect, its probably found in a German squared Gothic that matches the rest of the letters. Unfortunately one has been digitized in this way does not come to mind immediately. Anyone?  \nDon\n\n"
