      "content": "Well Fernando, all I can say at this stage is that you have a real collector's item. Unfortunately somebody \"broke the sort\" on this font and got rid of the letters piecemeal. The design is attractive and would make a good digital font, but it would be a great help if there were some more letters.  \nSame applies to the thick capitals in the middle row, which have some similarity to Binner [http://www.myfonts.com/search/binner/fonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140717202840/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/binner/fonts/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/search/binner/fonts/\")  \nI take it you purchased the letters in South America. So they could be designs originating in the US, England or continental Europe, or even in South America for that matter.  \nIf you find any more letters that seem to match either font It would be wonderful if you could share them with us.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Fernando, good news! I found the g with the open lower bottom bowl -- and the rest of the font too. It's a woodtype from Tubbs & Co. cira 1900, that Dan X. Solo purchased in one of his type collecting expeditions and later digitized as Valjean [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/valjean/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140717202840/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/valjean/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/valjean/\").  \nPossibly the other type in the drawer is also from Tubbs & Co.? I wonder if there is a Tubbs & Co. specimen book anywhere?  \nDon\n\n"
