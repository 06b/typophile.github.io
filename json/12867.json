  "content": "Anyone here actually USED Apple’s Font Book v2.0 (Tiger) with more than a few dozen fonts?  \nIf so, how’s it working?  \nI’ve been gun shy ever since Font Book v1.0 ate a bunch of my system fonts, so I dare not try it myself!\n\nAnyone care to render an opinion? Can Font Book v2.0 handle (say) upwards of 1,000 fonts total? If so, will it work WELL?\n\nThanks for you input(s),\n\nChris\n\n [‹ FontLab and mapping](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908085947/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13128 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Anchors in Fontlab? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908085947/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13042 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Trashed.\n\nI’m trying FontAgentPro (idea from: [http://typographi.com/000992.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908085947/http:/typographi.com/000992.php \"http://typographi.com/000992.php\")).  \nYesterday it worked quite well, then today I activated Helvetica and HelveticaNeue: it seems in causes problem with the system-wide helvetica, that now renders as cirillic caracters in Mail.app (it happened before with Panther, but a “verify privileges” cycle used to resolve the problem): so I’m unable to activate other Helveticas on my machine.  \nAnd now, every font I import into FontAgentPro, is misteriously listed as minion...  \nAuto Activation doesn’t work for Photoshop...  \nFontAgent Pro could be a killer app, but (the demo) seems to be filled with bugs that render the app nearly inusable...  \n (PS: found this: [http://www.typomancy.org/2005/05/03/a-tally-of-type-management-bugs-font...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908085947/http:/www.typomancy.org/2005/05/03/a-tally-of-type-management-bugs-fontagent-pro-needs-help/ \"http://www.typomancy.org/2005/05/03/a-tally-of-type-management-bugs-fontagent-pro-needs-help/\"))\n\nI’m going to try Font Book... but I don’t think it will help in any way.\n\nPlease HELP ;)  \nNeed a decent Font Manager...  \nForum Search not working in this Beta version... I’ll manually check old posts ;)\n\n"

      "content": "Apple’s Font Book is an incredible application for font management. Simple, well integrated through out the system, and contains all the basic tools needed to manage fonts on the mac.\n\nI find the other offerings — mainly Suitcase and Font Reserve — to be bloated programs that do so much, but nothing well.\n\nFont Book manages Fonts. Thats it. And it does a great job.\n\nThe only downside to Font Book is no auto-activation, but there are ways around it. Plus I am sure there are Apple Scripts out there that take care of that problem.\n\nGive Font Book a try. It is a very good Application. The main reason I want from 10.2 - 10.3.\n\n— Jer\n\n"

A question, though: have you used font book with more than, say, a couple hundred fonts?\n\nI personally have had poor experiences w Suitcase and Font Reserve. FontAgent Pro is much better, but i’m seriously wondering if i can use ONLY Apple’s Font Book app. I’ve got 850 fonts right now.\n\nWhat say?\n\nThanks,  \nChris\n\n"

It will work just fine.\n\nI only use Font Book and have now for sometime. It works extremely well at what it does — a basic Font Management application that is great at one thing, font management.\n\nI would wish you luck, but I don’t think you will need it.\n\n— Jer\n\n"

      "content": "One difference I’ve noticed is that the new font book copies active fonts to the user library, leaving the original copies wherever you had them stored before. I think before it would obnoxiously remove the fonts from their original location when you installed them.\n\nAlso it distinguishes between the user font library and the system font library, which is nice if you want to keep the faces you’ve installed seperate from system and web-browser fonts.\n\nI’m not one to try activating 2000 fonts at a time, but I’ve found that the new Font Book is easier to work with if you want to maintain your font collection externally, and use Font Book to manage the fonts you use on a regular basis or happen to be using at the time.\n\nCameron\n\n"
