David Axelrod seems to have commissioned it.\n\nThe 'presidential seal' thing was so close to parody that I wonder why they thought it was a good idea. I'm curious as to whether the different designers did the original O (great qualities, but a bit too cartoonish, IMHO), the superb \"Change we can rely on\" in Gotham, and then this misfire.\n\n",

But Atlantic.com reported that the candidate himself felt the image had been a \"silly mistake.\"\n\nAn Obama spokesman could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe seal was greeted with universal derision by US media, and the campaign of Republican candidate John McCain called it \"laughable, ridiculous, preposterous and revealing all at the same time.\"\n\n"

It is a pretty common design element in the genre, though not usually used on the lectern.\n\nObama's seal may have been an awkward parody, but at least he had good enough taste not to have presumptively used the real thing.\n\n"

I would guess that the same person did this and the original O, as it has a similar feel. It would be interesting to find out the history of this blunder. I wonder if it is a product of collaboration--someone, or some committee, got the \"bright idea\", and then had the designer execute it.\n\n"

It's a breath of fresh air in the political picture. But I suppose, if opponents find a way to criticize it in a way that can be distracting and disruptive, it's probably best to pull it off the shelf and move on. I think the critics (opponents) are scrambling for ways to make him look bad. The opponent's marketing flat out sucks by comparison.\n\n\"Change\" and \"Hope\" are kind of weak campaign themes, I think. Too ambiguous. But that's beside the point.\n\n"

Add to that, the darn thing is placed crooked.\n\nI also think that those patriotic Dems who were flush with a fresh choice in Obama realise his branding of America - then Lou Dobbs just gained a few more fellow Independent registrants.\n\nOn a graphic forum that talks specifically with the POWER of marketing I wrote a piece about how people in times of struggle look for a reason to believe. Obama created a graphic heavy campaign specifically to target those votes (and continues to do so). If Obama doesn't check his ego - and stop subjugating America's patriotic symbols to his own greed/desires - he will surely push Independents over to McCain.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621151925im_/http:/typophile.com/files/obama_seal_3885.jpg)\n\n"
