      "content": "Christian - pretty cool. As something to shoot for, Cabarga Cursiva is a masterwork. You can unlock a lot of script secrets by looking at that face. This is wholly different and very appealing. You got the thicks/thins down. The face has got great upside. Uppercase would seem to have more improvisational opportunities and this is where the face could really fly.   \n   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "I love this face... I see the comparison to Epaulet but find that this face has less   \nsense of humor, I really like that about the face, it is hard to stick into any particular category. It is commercial enough to get used in real work but esoteric enough to be passed off as \"too weird\" by most main stream/agency designers. As for Display scripts this is sterile for something that at first sight seem to fit into the stylized fun category, as compared to, for instance, Phil Grimshaws' designs that are full of life expressed by calligraphic movements and nuances that usually ended up in the ITC collection. This restain and sterility, is exactly what I look for when selecting type.A really nice piece of work. I would encourage you to open dialogue with Peter Bruhn/Fountain to discuss distribution when you finish it.\n\n"

My wish would be to have control of the contrast.   \n   \nThe comparisons to Cabarga and Epaulet -- I understand, and maybe there are some things similar, but perhaps it is like comparing apples and oranges. Or for you music lovers a better analogy might be the trumpet playing Miles Davis to that of Chet Baker. While Chet's execution and technique are flawless, Miles' phrasing and direction is always more interesting.\n\n"
