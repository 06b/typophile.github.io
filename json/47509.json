What may I ask you is even remotely Artsy, Fartsy or Fancy about Lineto typefaces?_\n\nNot the typefaces themselves, but the context they are used in. We witness successive fashion waves here on the Type ID Board, and this is one of them. Lineto designs are usually very forward-thinking, but the context they are used in is _so_ very safe and boring these days, which effectively diminishes their worth in my opinion. It's the 'white tiger' syndrome -- instead of being creative and trying to break the mould, many designers think that using the cool typeface all the other cool designers use is sufficient to make their work interesting. Not.\n\n"

It’s creating your own style.\n\nThere just have been so many ID-requests that turned out to be Lineto fonts lately.  \n”Wanna be cool? - Look over at Lineto!“ seems to have become automatic.

Regardless of how often they have been used, the 2 faces' I mentioned Helvetica and Avant Garde, are undeniably brilliant typefaces and if the circumstances suit there's no reason why these faces can't still be used to create outstanding design. The same applies to Lineto faces.\n\nDesigners should be allowed to make there own decisions instead of consigning certain typefaces to the 'do not touch bin'.\n\n"

I think one of the best examples of how _and_ how not to use Avant Garde is Grafik. I personally love the Grafik logo, but using Avant Garde as your body text is just painful, I really feel it takes away from the magazine.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100916224342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/avant_garde_logo_5185.jpg)\n\nAs for Helvetica, I rarely like to bad mouth one of my favourite typefaces, Although you wouldn't find it in much of my work. This is probably due to the stigma that surrounds the typeface. As for a use of one particular typeface It's more important to examine the design and see if there was an appropriate choice made in regards to the content.\n\nLike all other design disciplines in the end the choice of a design element can often come down to a fashion trend. Which may in this case be Helvetica, Avant Garde or a lineto typeface. But soon enough what was once fashionable to the highend designers will overtime make its way down to the lay person designing a flyer to a small gig!\n\nThere are many designers using both Helvetica and Avant Garde and I personally feel using them well.

So to make everything clear and avoid any more misunderstandings:\n\nI _was_ serious about avoiding Helvetica and ITC Avant Garde Gothic. This is a personal statement, and I am _not_ telling anyone else what to do or not do. Usually it's designers suffering from tunnel vision like Massimo Vignelli and his followers that go about trying to convince everyone to do it their way (re: his (in)famous five typefaces credo).\n\nSo on a personal level, all I can say is that I will _never_ use Helvetica or ITC Avant Garde Gothic _unless I have a very very good reason to do so._ That is because, yes, I _am_ a Typophile, Naoise. I think I know enough about type to not be starstruck by the perennial \"classic\" fonts and make well-informed choices about which typefaces to choose for specific jobs. When you say they are \"undeniably brilliant typefaces\" and \"the alternatives rarely live up to the original\", that is your _personal_ opinion, _not_ a scientific fact. I personally find that Helvetica often falls short due to the problems in its design and structure, which is why since its rise in popularity many talented type designers have designed alternatives which deal with these shortcomings.\n\nNever _ever_ again assume that I am \"a so-called Typophile\" just because I have a different opinion than yours.
