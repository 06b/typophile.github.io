No idea what the top left is.\n\nI certainly don’t understand how the creativity/composition concept is visually represented.\n\nI’ve done so many jobs for this type of client - its so much more difficult than you initially think. You need to do some competitor analysis - look at what others are doing in this sector. I suspect you’ll find Its dull variations of sameness. That could be a basis for communicating creativity - stand out. Is there likely to be a marketing budget/strategy?\n\nAlso - ’Creativity’ is not a comfortable word for the software services industry, they find it messy - You need to be looking at ’innovation’ (but it MUST have tangible results).\n\n"

      "content": "Only the bottom right design connotes programming but it’s almost the first solution comes to someone’s mind so I’m sure there are many similar out there. Why not just write “Scribendum.com”? No need for two lines. Better to write “Scribendum” on its own.\n\nBeware of so called “competitor exploration”. Many books and people recommend it for inspiration which leads to look-alike solutions everywhere. Try to do this in reversed order. Explore your subject well, write down some concepts and then explore competitors. Throw away the concepts already realized and focus on the rest. Programming is a relatively new profession and I’m sure you can find unique ideas.\n\n"

It looks a bit chaotic.  \nI would concentrate on one of them.\n\nBut again, it looks like a publishing company.\n\nI could be because of the used font.  \nPerhaps a sans like the one in your first example would fit the profile better.  \nThe serif you used is a very nice font though. But not sure if it fits here.\n\n"
