      "content": "That site has been discussed here a bunch of times. Essentially, IIRC, it seems that those fonts are (a) pirated and (b) not the ones that Peter Saville actually used. Plus, that site is not Saville's own, but a fan site.\n\nCheck this thread, for example: [http://typophile.com/node/32322](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016114444/http:/typophile.com/node/32322 \"http://typophile.com/node/32322\")  \nThere was more. I wish search was working.\n\n"
