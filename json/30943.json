  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am a graphic design student from Arnhem, The Netherlands, I was  \nwondering if anybody has a pdf file of an original American newspaper,  \nthat was ment for printing, photo's and ads included.  \nit does'nt matter from which date the paper comes.  \nIt is part of a case study for turning a book into a paper, and in reverse.  \nAlso the thematics play a large role.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
