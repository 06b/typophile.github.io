  "content": "I have a large-format, 2-volume, limited edition book entitled, _Autograph Poetry in the English Language_. It has facsimiles of poems in the handwriting of the poet, from John Skelton to Dylan Thomas. I gaze on it every once in a while, half in admiration, half enviously, because the handwriting displayed therein is so gorgeous. The handrwriting isn’t beautiful in a calligraphic/formal sort of way (at least not usually), but more that it’s distinctly individualized while being, at the same time, very legible.\n\nMy handwriting comes in two varieties: my “real” handwriting, which is absolutely unlegible; or, when I try for legibility (my hand moving painfully slow), it has absolutely no distinction, something like a second graders tortured cursive.\n\nSo, I imagine many of you on this forum have nice handwriting, or at least might know how to improve it? Does anyone know of any resources I might consult? Books? Websites? Thanks & Cheers!\n\n [‹ RB Interviews DB on CT](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905133809/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31124 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [pornofitti alfa ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905133809/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31139 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
