      "content": "I think Nina is right to put Hrant down there, but honestly I tend to agree with Hrant's premise—since earlier today, actually. I've always been impressed with the work coming from the KABK media course and in fact I'm planning on getting my degree there when I've finished my BA in graphic design.\n\nHowever, today I saw something which gave me the exact feeling Hrant expressed rather clumsily here. I'm actually hesitant to point you to this designer's work though; I'm not sure if it's justified for me to state this person's name, so I will be diplomatic for now and just tell you what I observed.\n\nA friend of mine pointed me to one of his typefaces, presumably because he admires it. I however couldn't admire it at all as there were simply too many problems, such as characters that are either too condensed or too wide, an S falling backwards and an Y of which the the join was way too low so it was noticeable that the Y was forced into V's metrics, where he just cut off the bottom part of V and attached a stem to it. All of this just told me he has a lot to learn still.  \nHe had another 3 typefaces with similar problems, one illustrative typeface which was admittedly awesome and then there was a typeface which was still under revision but made during his type course (not at KABK though) and it features no problems at all. Now, you would obviously expect his teachers and classmates to give him the feedback to make his typeface perfect, but what surprised me is the clear difference in quality between his typefaces. The typeface he made during his course was perfect, while his other typefaces excluding the illustrative one are not up to the same standard. This shouldn't be the case. You ought to apply what you learned at school. So perhaps Hrant has a point here. The course seems way too short for some to actually become versed in type design, rather than be guided to one good product and not be able achieve the same quality again.\n\nThis doesn't apply to people like Nina, I think. I've over 4 years experience with type design now and I have a lot to learn still, but for me this short course would be ideal I think because I have the experience to fully grasp what I will learn there and I will be in the perfect environment to get feedback and learn and breathe type with like-minded people. Probably this environment will aid in polishing up your designs, which Hrant apparently has clear concerns about. I feel it's not a problem at all as long as you can apply what you learned during the course. What I observed on the aforementioned designer's portfolio does concern me a bit though, but as I said I have no worries of this happening to me.\n\nNina, I assumed you already had a degree in typography. It's a bit unfortunate you just graduated. I don't know you, but it would be fun to do a course with people I'm already familiar with on Typophile and whose work I admire. However, having seen the typefaces coming from the KABK course in recent years, I'm sure the appreciation part is going to manifest either way. What did you think of the course?\n\n"

It is not unusual for students to unintentionally emulate the work of their professors for a brief time. Let us leave them now to their own personal struggle with their own work to emerge as individual designers. This is the most exciting time for them, the time to totally steer the ship without their trusted pilot looking over their shoulder. Give them a chance.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with that sentiment. I'm greatly looking forward to it myself.\n\nBesides, I don't know how the hierarchy between type designers manifest in other countries, but I feel that in the Netherlands we have a long tradition of emulating the masters or working with their theories, for a while, anyway. For example, Gerrit Noordzij's theories are prevalent even if few directly follow his theories and emulate his style.\n\n\"The method of teaching type design at the Royal Academy is still largely based on Noordzij's theoretical model today, as several of his former students are now the professors at the department.\"\n\nSo it seems to some extent at least the sentiment Hrant is concerned about has always been prevalent, in the Netherlands and quite possibly in other countries as well, though I wouldn't really know. Now I think about it, I want to emerge myself into their world. I've dabbled with type myself for years now and I got some insight from one of Noordzij's students but he never became a type designer, unlike some of the other students. I want to know how to masters see and work with type and in fact I want to perpetuate some of their traditions and values which they learned from their masters. Certainly I will make their theories my own — like I have been doing — but it might even be essential to let them influence you and your work in that one year course.\n\nI don't usually care for traditions, but in this case I value being able to pass on their wisdom, or at least become very familiar with their philosophy, their work method, their knowledge and their style — if only to do the exact opposite.\n\n"
