The \"font\" is internal to the printer and does not necessarily match a font that you could use on your website.  \nThat having been said, you might be happy with a web-font semi-bold version of [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023041725/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/%3Cbr%20/%3E) by Mark Simonson, which has essentially the same letter forms and numbers. The only obvious difference is the lack of a serif at the base of 1. If you are really observant you will find that the upper tip of 6 dips slightly more an the printer font.  \nDon\n\n"
