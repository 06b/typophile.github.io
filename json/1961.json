And there are a few standouts.   \n   \nTo answer the question, yes, I have sumbitted a few, and I'm working an a few more. So I'm putting myself out there for criticism as well. (Actually I was working on an anagram-based idea yesterday, but it looks like that avenue is being covered...)   \n   \nBTW, Hrant, it is not illegal to use Emigre fonts in Flash. I actually spoke with a woman at the company before we started using Mrs. Eaves on our site and obtained their permission. It's more PDF and Flash _applications_ that they are concerned with. I'm told they are working on a Flash-specific licensing agreement to be released in a few months. FYI.   \n   \n:-)\n\n"

And seeing as Flash uses its own renderer for embedded fonts, I highly doubt that the information in the flash file, even if all characters were encoded, was useful. As for Designers using the zoom function to get high res copies, that's possible, but Flash doesn't kern the fonts as a professional program would. So any sentences in a really nice font would doubtless look ugly.   \n   \nHmm... getting my submission ready. Viewers comments helped shaped my tee. There seems to be a surprising \"I wouldn't wear \\*that\\* because it is too girly\". To me, that runs contrary to the aim of this competition - to highlight good design, and to encourage others to showcase that designers work. I am comfortable enough in my sexuality that I could wear pretty much anything besides a dress, if I thought it made a positive impact (I realize here I may be slightly eccentric, as I have never shied away from brightly coloured shirts etc.)   \n   \nMatthew\n\n"

I am a graphic artist for a screen printer and I recently took several classes that focused on the versitility of design whether in print or web and how a good design is designed with the largest targeted audience as a priority and still makes the statement that was intended. Many of the clients I have worked with worry about colour combinations and that the're not gender specific. I liked the design Typop but intended to suggest more neutral colors. I like yellow and would wear it and I liked the design.   \nI also agree with Alex's statement that a shirt design needs to grabs someones attention within a few seconds to be affective.   \n   \nDiane\n\n"
