  "content": "I have a licensed, PS-flavored, OpenType font family that is showing up in menus and in Linotype Font Explorer as 6 separate families, one family for each variant ( roman, italic, bold, bold italic, &c. ) . The files underwent no modification or processing after purchase. This is most undesirable.\n\nI've tried using TransType Pro to combine the fonts into one family, but to no avail. I changed the family name and the Opentype name to match, but when I converted, it ended up exactly the same as before. Perhaps there's some setting I'm overlooking? Is there a common way to do this?\n\n",
