Klitschko has punched 26 letters to create a font, which is now available for free on Linotype.com. Monotype has optimized the fist-painted font to ensure clarity and quality.\n\nAll proceeds from the voluntary monetary contributions will go to the Klitschko Brothers Foundation in partnership with German charity organization BILD’s “A Heart for Children” charity [http://www.ein-herz-fuer-kinder.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322112559/http:/www.ein-herz-fuer-kinder.de/ \"http://www.ein-herz-fuer-kinder.de\") to combat illiteracy internationally.\n\nView and download the font for free: [http://bit.ly/1dA1Cot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322112559/http:/bit.ly/1dA1Cot \"http://bit.ly/1dA1Cot\")  \nView video here: [http://vimeo.com/87276571](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322112559/http:/vimeo.com/87276571 \"http://vimeo.com/87276571\")  \nFor more information about the initiative, visit: [http://www.klitschko-vs-illiteracy.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322112559/http:/www.klitschko-vs-illiteracy.com/ \"http://www.klitschko-vs-illiteracy.com/\")\n\n",
