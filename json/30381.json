Yes, I did name that TV show after my affliction (which, by the way, is incurable, but not lethal), but I did not come up with \"Kern up the volume\". My name for that roadshow was \"Spinal Type\", but then my colleagues at the ISTD got scared in case some big movie company came after us. I didn't share that fear (having survived numerous attacks by Harvey Hunt, Hollywood laywers don't frighten me), but was persuaded to drop it. ISTD council came up with the Kern title – not sure whether Freda Sack, Jonathan Dorney or any of the other members want to take personal credit.\n\n"
