I want to use a serf font for the body text with Helvetica Bold for the project titles.\n\nAny suggestion for a very light weight serif font? I tried rockwell but felt it was too heavy.\n\nThanks in advance for the advice!\n\n",

If you do a search on this site for \"slab serifs\" you will find many a discussion that mention some good ones. the other thing to consider is that you may want it to match with a neo grotesque, which is what Helvetica is.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n"
