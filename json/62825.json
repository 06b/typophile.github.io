  "content": "I was hoping some of you might be able to make a few font suggestions for me. We are working on a project at our firm and need to find a typeface that resembles handwriting, but neat and nice handwriting. We are hoping for a more technical look and feel possibly nice handwriting of an engineer or draftsman. I have looked a few fonts that resemble drafting, but they are just a little too modular and contrived. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\nAlso one more thing, this font will be used sparingly throughout the report so we are hoping to not spend too much money or any at all on the font, if possible.\n\n",
