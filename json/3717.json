  "content": "Hello everyone.   \n   \nI'm trying to add a component, in Font Lab 4.6, to every glyph in my font. I tried the Generate Glyphs command, but it ended up renaming every glyph... which I don't really need to have happen. I tried to figure out how to program a macro but I can't seem to wrap my brain around Python. I checked out the FontLab/Mapping folder and my computer kept crashing. Hitting Opt-F9 every single time is very exciting, but I have to do this to 15 more fonts and I'd like to have some time to eat this week.   \n   \nIf any one has any clues or hints to share I'd appreciate it.   \n   \nThanks,   \nClueless Newbie.\n\n",

      "content": "Dyanna -   \nAs an alternate, you can crack open one of your old FOG   \ngenerated PS T1 files and use the components. Sounds strange,   \nbut try this:   \n   \n1.) Open the old font in FL and also have open   \nyour new font (without the accents) but with proper accents   \nin their slots - acute, diereses etc.   \n2.) Select the accented characters in the old font   \nand paste them into the new font.   \n3.) Magically, if all goes well, your new font will sub   \nthe accents and proper letters into these slots.   \nInstant accented characters.   \n   \nDisclaimer - I figured this one out by accident and   \npure desperation. It requires your old font to   \nhave all of the components present. Old FOG files   \nwill often decompose the accented cap characters   \nonce opened in FL. You can of course manually insert   \neach component via Glyph \\> Add component.   \n   \nYou can then apply this to your other 15 fonts   \nonce you've got a decent file working.   \n   \nHope this helps.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, Eric for your help.   \n   \nAlthough, I'm not dealing with accented characters - I'm trying to paste one component into every glyph - from the thorn to the fi ligatures. So that if I need to modify it later I won't have to go back and copy, paste, copy, paste...   \n   \nHowever you brought up an excellent point, and that is, to use an old program. RoboFog should give me no trouble. In time, hopefully, I'll figure out the macro.   \n   \nThanks again, both of you, for your help.   \n   \nDyana\n\n"
