Anyone remember the thread? I've done about a dozen searches.  \nThanks!\n\n",

Also, you might be able to use the pattern brush to create a border as well. It'll just take some experimenting to get the desired effect. Also, remember lines in a blend can be manipulated (either adding points, curves or even changing the position.)\n\nHope that helps.\n\n"
