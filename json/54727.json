This way, it's kind of sad how the end of the game seems to only be defined by the negative (losing all five \"ligature\" bonuses); it would be nice to introduce a positive incentive to keep playing (apart from learning about spacing!).\n\nAlso, a big wish for version 2 would be not being limited to Helvetica. ;-)\n\n"

Tracking the scores to a national database is something we would like to add, as well as more variety for the typefaces. Thanks for giving it a try!\n\n"

Also the time one has to wait for the word to fall near enough for gauging is sometimes a little too long.\n\nAnyway, great stuff!\n\n"
