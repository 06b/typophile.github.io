  "content": "Recently I came upon a typeface class called, Realist(you guys have probably heard about it). Is it the same as Grostesque, because I saw it used for typefaces such as Akzidenz and Franklin Gothic. If not, can you please tell me about some of its characteristics.\n\nI basically know(I think) all the general classes but can someone list them and their defining characteristics.\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "Perhaps the most widely used system is the Vox-ATypI classification. For listing and defining characteristics there is a wiki at:  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI\\_classification](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713231352/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI\\_classification\")  \nNote two different uses of \"realist\" from the wiki:  \n1. \"'Realist sans-serif' is a commonly encountered synonym for neo-grotesque.\"  \n2. \"The transitional, realist or réales are the typical typefaces of the traditional period, particularly embodying the rational spirit of the Enlightenment\"\n\n---start extended quote--  \nNeo-grotesque typefaces are derived from the earlier grotesque faces, but generally have less stroke contrast and a more regular design. Unlike the grotesque, they generally do not have a spurred \"G\", and the terminals of curves are usually slanted. Many neo-grotesque faces have a large degree of subtlety and variation of widths and weights to accommodate different means of production (Hot type, foundry type, phototypesetting, see History of typography, 20th century). \"Realist sans-serif\" is a commonly encountered synonym for neo-grotesque. Examples of neo-grotesque lineal typeface include Helvetica and Univers.  \n---end extended quote---\n\nDon\n\n"
