What was the reason for saying it was pre-digital?\n\nI have hunted through three volumes of Photo-Lettering catalogs, and the Solotype Catalog and the Phil’s Photo book without seeing anything particularly close. (If you didn’t start out with the pre-digital information, I would have guessed a freeware tech style font.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
