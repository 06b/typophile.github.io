Done that a zillion times, for special accents and the odd math :-(\n\nYou can store most settings in Character styles; also (always mention your CS version!), in CS3 you can replace anything by the Clipboard contents. That's proven to be quite useful when there's lots of the same stuff in your doc.\n\n"

However this Clipboard contents may help, this is a large doc with a lot of occurences. Dang typeface with limited palette! Would love to change for utility purposes however . . . beauty/originality v. utility--the debate continues.\n\nThank you for your prompt answer.\n\n"
