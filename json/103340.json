  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am trying to identify all the typefaces used in John Carpenter’s \"They Live\" from 1988.\n\nMost of them is Futura, but I am struggling with one particular shot: The money which says \"This is your god\" …  \nThe G doesn’t match any Futura I can find.\n\nI am pretty sure, it has to be some version of Futura, since most of the other typefaces are as well (I also found Franklin Gothic, a wodden letterpress typeface and a lot of hand-drawn versions of Futura and Century Gothic).\n\nDoes anybody has any idea what version this might be?\n\nThank you very much for your help, any suggestions is highly appreciated!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [TheyLive\\_31.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011040857/http:/typophile.com/files/TheyLive_31.jpg) | 414.23 KB |\n\n",
