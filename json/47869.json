  "content": "Hi all,\n\nCan anyone share their tips on sourcing fonts, I have a specific shape I need for two letters (c and f), I may have to create them in illustrator, but wanted to check if whats out there, so, can anyone give advice on how to find fonts, is it a case of just putting the time in on font sites, I find that I can spend days doing this, there are so many, the categories help to a certain degree.\n\nAppreciate any help.\n\nThanks\n\n",
