For example, Japanese cosmetic maker Shiseido has a corporate font originated in Taisho era, which has been used for its branding items. It seemed that the form of this font came from Socho （宋朝体）style, but I feel it has the similar feeling of Blackletters as the end of the strokes are very sharp and horizontal strokes are bended like Blackletter's stems. The skeleton is very unique but I think it is very beautiful and elegant.  \n(Quoted from Japanese design magazine \"Design Note\".)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106041832im_/http:/typophile.com/files/shiseido_6139.jpg)\n\nJapanese typeface and Latin typeface are completely different constitution.  \nI would like to know what isokon focus on when he looks for Japanese Blackletter.\n\n"

You can find some examples of his designs in _Applied Typography 7_ and _Applied Typography 8_ from the Japan Typography Association, published in 1997 and 1998, respectively. There may be more examples in previous or later editions, but those books are very expensive and very hard to track down.\n\nHe designs both Japanese and Latin type. Much of his Latin work reminds me of the work of Margot Chase or Jonathan Barnbrook.\n\n"
