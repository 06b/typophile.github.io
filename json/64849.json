Not Myriad Pro, but the copyright information font on the bottom.\n\nI’ve attached a link to a screenshot of what i’m talking about. Area in question is highlighted.\n\n[FlashSplash.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091201203611/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/27977526@N07/4147490630/sizes/o/)  \nThanks for the help typophiles!\n\n",
