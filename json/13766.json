  "content": "Hello\n\nI am in the process of developing a font with FontLab (I am a newbie to it) and I want to know if I can get some aid from you.\n\nFontLab will freeze when trying to export the characters to OpenType. It will be OK when generating TrueType, though. When trying to generate either format, an error message pops up stating that some characters contain open contours.\n\nSo, question 1:\n\nAny idea of why FontLab will freeze through the export dialog when generating the OT font? The TT Font weighs 406 Kbs so far and contains around 500 characters.\n\nQuestion 2:  \nDo you know of any FontLab forum that can be accessed through a) Outlook and/or b) web?\n\nQuestion 3 (a bit off the main theme):  \nHow can I turn the colour red off the glyph cells that are supposed to have open contours once I've made sure that the contours are closed? (No more nodes marked with an X). When I re-open the font the cells are still marked red.\n\nThanks,  \nMosh\n\n",
