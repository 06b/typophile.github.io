  "content": "Welcome to the third CheapProFonts newsletter of 2009 - not a regular newsletter with various reworked fonts, but a presentation of the first part of a large project of NEW fonts I'm working on. :)\n\nThe \"Geometry Pro\" family has been designed to be the final word in purely geometric fonts, and this rounded \"Soft\" sub-family is the ultimate web 2.0 style font collection. ;)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CheapProFonts-NEWS-09-03_5074.gif)\n\nEven though it is strictly geometric (as drawn with a compass and a ruler fixed to 90 and 45 degree angles) it is not slavishly modular: letters have differing widths, and the sidebearings, spacing and kerning has been finely adjusted to create smooth text.  \nThe Soft family contains 3 weights each with 6 variants = 18 fonts + an additional FREE variant for you to enjoy!\n\nALL fonts of course have our usual large multilingual character set.  \nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting \"foreign\" languages (languages requiring more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.  \nCheck our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\n\nRoger S. Nelsson  \n--  \n [http://www.CheapProFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084826/http:/www.cheapprofonts.com/ \"http://www.CheapProFonts.com\")  \nHigh quality multilingual fonts at a low price - for professional (non-english) designers with a small budget!\n\n",
