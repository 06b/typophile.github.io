      "content": "This reminds me of an idea I started to work out on paper a while ago, though I was considering the effect when tracing the same path of the **e** with a slanted pen. The result wasn't that attractive when extended to the rest of the alphabet so I dropped it. I'm glad to see it works much better in a lineal design.   \n   \nI'd suggest extending the shape of the lower **e** to as many characters as you can. The results should be more distinctive and give your idea good mileage.   \n   \n ![Example Modifications](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414110714im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7640.gif)   \n   \nBesides this, there are lots of problems in the shapes of your characters. The **a** is too wide. Assuming the **e** is your mothership character, the bowl characters **bpdq** are too narrow. The arm of the **f** extends too far to the right. The dot on the **j** is too high or the dot on the **i** is too low. They should be the same height. The **v** is too narrow. The **w** needs to be redrawn to bring the slopes into agreement.   \n   \nThe **t** needs attention. The crossbar is too high, it should be at the same height as the crossbar on the **f**. The top of the stem on **t** is also much higher than is conventional. Additionaly, the shape of the foot is not advisable; I've tried this shape before and it never sits well on the baseline. Perhaps you could make this foot the same shape as the bottom half of the **e**.   \n   \nI like your idea for the distinctive bend in **e**. If applied with care to the rest of the alphabet, it could give you a distinct feel. But I'd be careful about getting too carried away with exprimentation; it'd be best to first nail the conventional san serif shapes and then work from there to inject your ideas.\n\n"
