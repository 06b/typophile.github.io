Now that the handcuffs are off, David has taken the typeface on a little journey and added seven weights for us. The idea of using what was once a “computer font” for anything else is now being questioned and I personally look forward to how people will use it.\n\n—  \n**Minah** is a friendly, elegant, and feminine calligraphic sans with a small body and long limbs. While it is available in 4 weights, the details that make is so original are maintained throughout.\n\n",
