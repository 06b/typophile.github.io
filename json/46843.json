I know the answer is yes, but I would like to hear what some broad categories would be labeled as (“Brush”, “Calligraphic”, etc.) as, clearly, there are worlds in between something like Mistral and Snell Roundhand.\n\nMaybe a classification already exists?\n\n [‹ 4/4 Envelope Printing](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119073025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46643 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Any suggestions for 60's Soul label fonts? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119073025/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46786 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

For example, the casual sign scripts of the 1950s are now being ironically used in ways that probably are not casual, and one-formal spencerian/copperplate/etc. scripts have become popular with various aspects of the music industry, which tends to be quite casual. Typeface classification systems should be above such subjectivity, so I feel that classification based on letterform construction is a better idea.\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t think of casual vs. formal as being so much a matter of how its used. Formal scripts are typically designed more uniformly and casual scripts tend more towards natural writing styles. No doubt you can use them in various casual or formal settings, but to me there is a distinction although that distinction can be vague in some cases.\n\nIt is harder to classify scripts, I think, because there is such broader range of possibilities to deal with.\n\n"

Sometimes it’s possible to add a certain (regional/temporal) style for good measure. For example, [this recent Type ID request](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119073025/http:/typophile.com/node/46800) is clearly an ‘American Cursive’, with its characteristic letterforms for ‘A’, ‘M’, ‘S’, ‘r’, ‘p’, ‘1’ …  \nF\n\n"
