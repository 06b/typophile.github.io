(am using illustrator v10).\n\nAny advice would be great!!!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062956im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/poulets_4155.gif)\n\n [‹ typeface tango: how to decide who can/should dance with whom](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062956/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32007 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [experience with Baskerville Book? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062956/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44878 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I did the 2 above by using free transform to give it a bit of perspective-but when i did them all they looked dis-proportional. I dont think there is a 3d tool in the version of illustraor im using? Any hints?\n\n"
