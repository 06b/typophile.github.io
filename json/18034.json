Worse still is when the revivalist chooses to tinker with the original and make \"improvements\", which is like pissing on the original designer's grave.\n\nI wasn't impressed by the Stones at the Superbowl either. Sure, Mick's in great shape, but who needs Satisfaction Next -- it ain't 1965 no more.\n\nHowever, the exception is if there is something special or unusual in an old face that has been forgotten by history, then I'm all for bringing it back to life, and that seems to be the case with the 1909 face.\n\nAnd of course, use old designs as inspiration, but please come up with the big idea, don't just fiddle with details.\n\n"

We should ban anyone from playing Beethoven, or writing music in the classical style? Or you would have banned Glenn Gould from playing Bach on a piano rather than a klavicord?\n\nWhile a great new typeface like Goudy Old Style, Electra or Palatino are more impressive achievements than a great revival like the Monotype Bembo, they are not necessarily more desirable for every project.\n\nI am very happy that we have classical music and classic jazz on the radio, and classic typefaces to use. And if someone can do a better version of a classic in digital form, such as Slimbach's wonderful Adobe Garamond, more power to them.\n\nI would certainly concede that it is a greater achievement to create a great new typeface, but there is imagination and knowledge and skill needed for revivals too. We can see this in the fact that some are much better than others. And the best are rightly welcomed by graphic designers.\n\nAvant garde is passé, and I don't mean just the typeface.\n\n"

But not at the expense of present day artists and designers.\n\nOn the subject of classical music, there was a time when American composers got no respect. Aaron Copland, a great organizer and activist, was a key figure in changing that. As Oscar Levant wrote (A Smattering of Ignorance, 1940) \"...a performance of _Andromache_ in Wurttemberg had received more space in that day's New York papers than the domestic Yaddo festival. “Frankly,\" he [Copland] said \"under such circumstances I consider daily newspaper criticism a menace, and we would be better off without it.\"\n\nAkzidenz Grotesk, Bembo, Avant Garde, Garamond, etc., -- they're a menace, the heavy hand of the past stifling the present.\n\nBut as I said, if you're gonna exhume something by Erbar, Feder Grotesk would be cool.\n\n"

It was comissioned as a Century kinda thing by Tony Sutton, for the newspaper World Woman. News text is a notoriously conservative genre. I prefer to get commissions to do original designs (eg Richler), but I'm not going to turn down revivals, and I'm certainly going to add them to my retail collection.\n\nHowever, when you look at my body of work as a whole, you will see that the designs I've produced for the retail market are all original, far outnumbering the commissioned newspaper revivals such as Walburn (from Walbaum) or Goodchild/Nicholas (from Jenson). When I've done something retail derived from a classic, such as Bodoni Egyptian or Beaufort (based on Times' proportions), I've mixed it up with another idea and moved it a considerable distance from the reference.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick, what's your problem?  \nWhy do you feel it necessary to imply that I am a hypocrite, by pointing out similarities between some of my original designs and older types? That's a cheap trick -- any typeface is always going to look a bit like some other face. Sure, I was aware that Radiant has some of the same formal properties as Eunoia, but I didn't look at it while I was working on Eunoia, because that wasn't where I was coming from -- my main concern during the design was orchestrating the \"mix and match\" between the Regular, Round, and Unicase versions, not back-checking some old face.\n\nAnd calling me a point pirate (for Worldwide) is pretty low.\n\nI said that doing revivals is unimaginative -- perhaps that smarts, but you can't deny it.\n\nPlease note that I mentioned the exception: where the face revived is unusual and forgotten -- surely that would would apply to the bulk of your work?\n\nI took particular aim at genres that have been well mined, and Erbar Grotesk is in that category, which is why I suggested to Gabriel that if he is going to revive something by Erbar, then Feder would be more worthwhile. I will always encourage young designers to develop their own ideas, rather than plod clumsily (as the novice always does) along some well-worn path.\n\nIf one wants to do a revival, the benefit of taking a crack at Feder Grotesk would be that nobody else has done it, so one's work would be somewhat fresh.\n\n_the flaws which affect the vast majority of even the best digital types can never be repaired_\n\nGeorge, your perception of the \"flaws\" is subjective. Those types is what they is. You change one thing, you throw everything out of whack. They're type designs, not chronometers which can be made increasingly accurate.\n\nActually, I don't see why it shouldn't be legal to sell a set of kern pairs for a font -- for use in Quark XPress, to be imported into \"Kern pair edit\".\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks everyone for the comments and support. I didn't think this would lead to such a big discussion.\n\nNick, Feder Grotesk is indeed interesting, but I have the feeling that it would turn into a \"funny\" face - as in \"curious but without much practical use\". However I suppose in better hands the concept behind it could be used to produce a working text face.\n\nMaybe I'm seeing too much in Erbar-Grotesk: my favorite version is from the 1922 drawing shown in Tracy's book. In this one, among other things, the uc _U_ is \"cursive\" and the bars on _t_ and _f_ are also \"broad nibbish\"; to my eyes it's a lot less Futura-like, putting it somewhere between a 19th century and a true geometric sans, with a touch of calligraphy.\n\nI could always create a new typeface using that last sentence as a starting brief, but the idea isn't mine, it's Erbar's, so it seems more honest to admit the source. Who knows, in the process I may wander and turn it into a completely different face.\n\nI could scan the page from [Letters of Credit](http://web.archive.org/web/20141128190929/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Letters%20of%20Credit) but... doesn't everyone here own the [triumvirate](http://web.archive.org/web/20141128190929/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/triumvirate)?\n\nOn a side note, I was very surprised to find out from that Klingspor-Museum document that Erbar designed Candida. There's an Anthropology journal from Rio de Janeiro that uses it as their body face ( [PDFs here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141128190929/http:/www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_issuetoc&pid=0104-931320050001&lng=en&nrm=iso)) on a cream-colored paper and it looks very good, though certainly too light for some typographer's tastes. I first saw one a few years ago, and since then I always wanted to use Candida but never had a good chance.  \nIt may not be the best typographic design around, but compared to most scientific periodicals it's very good. I don't know about your countries but here many use combinations of Arial for headings and Times for body, and I've seen at least one with Avant-Garde(!?) for headings and Arial for text. Ugh.\n\n"

Porchez's EULA would even disallow what you propose: \"The fonts must not be disassembled or altered in any manner whatsoever.... Alteration includes manipulation of... the position of the characters (in all caseevents,\" [sic] \"including spacing and kerning which leave the original font intact)\"\n\nImagine agreeing to that!\n\n"

      "content": "Nick,\n\nFirst, let me clarify one misconception you have: when I said \"interpolation,\" I did not intend to imply a purely mechanical process (point piracy), but merely to suggest that elements from the two examples could be cross-bred (maybe \"pollination\" would have been a less pejorative term?) to achieve a result similar to the one you obtained.\n\nMy problem is that you seem compelled, from time to time, to make provocative pronouncements about revivalists—which I will not let go unchallenged—as well as patently absurd claims to operational superiority (hence my equally absurd claim of working by the Braille method). Anyone who designs type uses his or her eyes; simply because you choose not to use scanned images as templates doesn't make your method better. It's just different.\n\nAnd, despite your insistence that revivalist work is irrefutably unimaginative, I must once again point out that a revivalist NEVER has a complete character set from which to work. The percentage sign, cent sign, commercial at, brace, bracket, florin, dagger, double dagger, pound sign, yen sign and mu were traditionally treated as pi characters, so there are no design-sensitive examples to go by; likewise, German double-s, eth and thorn are not present. And only in very rare cases are there design-sensitive examples of section marks and pilcrows. Applying the design \"rules\" of the letters and numbers to these neglected orphans requires insight, discipline and...dare I say...at least some modicum of _imagination_.\n\nI have said before, and will gladly repeat, that I have a great deal of respect for your work. Yes, I took a few cheap shots, but I was only returning fire...\n\n"
