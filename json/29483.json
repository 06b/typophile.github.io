      "content": "Rui, is there a better way to view it than other than the tester at T-26? Overall it is nice. It reminds me of a few different typefaces, but some of the subtle nuances in the italic separate it. There are a few shapes which I would be tempted to correct, but overall it is a really nice sans.\n\n"
