It's something I haven't seen in many screen fonts and I find it quite appealing.   \n   \nAgain, I aplogize about the double post. It was around midnight last night (for me) and I had been staring at my screen all day. Just took me a couple tries to get it right.\n\n"

But some things make me happy I'm not in your shoes on this one! :-) Also, I'd make the smallcaps one pixel taller.   \n   \nBTW, your text setting I find pretty encouraging.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
