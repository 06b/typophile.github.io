One is a typographic design competition (good use of type) and the other is type design competition (the design of the font itself).\n\nTDC members are invited to the clubs' presentations, which feature leading professionals in all areas of typography and design, and receive a complementary copy of the forthcoming edition of Typography, the annual of the Type Directors Club, published since 1980.\n\nAll members will also receive copies of TDC [Letterspace](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125347/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Letterspace), the club newsletter, and will benefit from reduced hanging fees in the annual TDC Competition. Other benefits include reduced member registration fees for TDC [conferences](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125347/http:/typophile.com/wiki/conferences) as well as valuable discounts on many typeface font products, design [magazines](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125347/http:/typophile.com/wiki/magazines), and [books](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125347/http:/typophile.com/wiki/books).\n\n[http://www.tdc.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011125347/http:/www.tdc.org/ \"http://www.tdc.org/\")\n\n",
