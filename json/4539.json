  "content": "so i finally got InDesign for my home computer and have been having fun checking out the features on some of the different fonts on my machine. I thought it was really nice of Microsoft to include FB Californian with all the software that came on my laptop (Microsoft Office). It's a great face but i was saddened that the version i own has no OT features. So i figgered i'd try to add em on my own. I became confused a bit about naming conventions for punctuation that is used along with small caps and oldstyle figures. which sorts should be labeled \"sort.sc\" and which should be \"sort.oldstyle\"? Is there any kind of standard for this? Is there some resource that outlines such standards?   \nA secondary question\n\n [‹ Opentype: standard names for alternates?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830001521/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3536 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Currency Slot ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830001521/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4465 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
