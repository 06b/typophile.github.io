One composes in a stick; I have yet to hear of anyone printing from it!\n\nUpside down letters — tis’ obvious... the classic is the ’s’, followed by ’u’ abd ’n’...  \nand of course the expression ’mind your p’s and q’s’ may well derive from the ease with  \nwhich lackadaisical comps muddled the typecase next-door neighbours... we are talking about letters that are cast backwards... I could go on all day but I don’t think it would be necessary (try separating a figure 1 from a lower case l and from the upper case I... when they have been wrongly put back in the type case!)  \nThen there are small cap figures too....  \nThe rising spaces occurred because the line was set too strong or too loose or if the forme was badly locked up... these spaces would be boxes if they were square em quad indents opening paragraphs or indeed the em spaces that used to follow full points in prose texts...\n\nVoilà some light on the subject after the tarpaulin...\n\n"
