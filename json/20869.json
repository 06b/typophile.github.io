  "content": "Recently graduating, I absolutely had to have business cards to hand out, and I noticed this unfortunate mistake. I double-checked my digital file, and it is not reflected there, nor did I encounter it in my proofs. I have no idea what happened, and this really is one of the first times I have had this type of issue in all my printing experience. Being affiliated with commercial print shops and presses for the past three years, employed in two different pre-press departments. this is one of the worst shifts or mistakes I have ever seen.\n\nNotice how far away the \"@\" is away from the email address. How BAD is this REALLY. Some argue that its like a natural stop before the server info, I say its a typographical nightmare. I have 1000 of these puppies, and I just can't seem to to get over this. Maybe the sagely advice of some other typophiles will calm my nerves.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bcard.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020193055/http:/typophile.com/files/bcard.jpg) | 18.22 KB |\n\n",

Most printers will reprint without question.\n\n"

I would reprint and hopefully your buddy will do it for free - or halve the cost with you.\n\nIf you do reprint, how about losing the dash between the bracketed area code and the first three numbers in your telephone number? (602) 738-\n\nJust a suggestion. : )\n\n"

It's your right to be picky when your work/card represents you and your quality.\n\n"

      "content": "With respect to your original design intentions, in all honesty I think it looks great with the space before the @.\n\nThink about the psychology of a user reading your card:\n\n1.  \nuser thinks: \"right, what is the first user part of the e-mail address?\"  \n---card facilitates legibility of this, by appropriately and easily indentifying and emphasising mdg2184 (which is a mouthful)--\n\n2.  \nuser thinks: \"right got it, what is the end part after the @ symbol?\"  \n--card facilitates legibiligy of @, with the extra preceeding space--\n\nThe e-mail address still looks like the same chunk of information, thanks to the bracket of your area code.\n\nAgain with respect, I think all designers are guilty of getting caught up in TOO much detail, at times unnecessarily. You sound pretty tense, and I think it's best to accept it and look at the bright side this time.\n\n"

This isn't a reason to not have them reprinted, but, I really do hate wasting. Recycling is great, but in the end, if you do a little research, the amount of resources it actually takes to run the recycling plants barely breaks even with the recycled product that is produced.\n\nB) It was a friend that printed them, and even though are relationship is good, people don't always take criticism well, and often times may not offer to do favors and such for you in the future. This job was small, and certainly was not a \"favor\", but, in the end I still appreciate it more.\n\nC) Sometimes, we all get caught up in our own designs, and nitpick them beyond belief. I asked many people before coming here about what they thought of this dilemma. This thread proves that \"good things do come from bad things\" as Andi had a great idea. That is exactly why I posted this thread.\n\nFurthermore, if you doubt or have questions about my credentials in terms of my \"experience\", i would be happy to provide you a copy of my résumé.\n\n"

The whole thing was done in a very elegant understated manner - it looked good, was informative and showed off his knowledge.\n\n"

Since trees are the largest consumers of the carbon dioxide that industrualized societies are producing in ever-larger quantities, **anything** that we can do to reduce demand makes the world a better place.\n\nRecycle the cards: the lack of separation between the street address and city and the use of parentheses **and** a hyphen in the telephone number are mistakes which **you** made.
