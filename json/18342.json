The list of books that I want to buy is growing every day but i actually didn’t have the money to buy them.\n\nI have read a few books that might be standard but I don’t really know. Maybe the people who recommended them to me didn’t know better books!?!?\n\nFor example some of the english books which I liked was:  \n• The logo font and lettering bible by Leslie Cabarga  \n• The Stroke. The Theory of Writing by Gerrit Noordzij (still reading)\n\nMost of the books I have read were german books and I didn’t find the english names of it.  \nSome books from Frutiger, Tschichold, Spiekerman, Willberg, Friedl etc.\n\nWhich books could you also suggest me?\n\nThanks for your help.\n\nGreetings: Steven\n\n"

Don’t forget to question them, or at least notice when they start to question each other (Willberg vs. Otl Aicher, for instance, in _Typolemik/Typophil_).\n\nWe have a collection of three “must reads” here that we call the [Triumvirate](http://web.archive.org/web/20090822160547/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Triumvirate). All of them are good, and Paul just mentioned one (_The Elements of Typographic Style_). The Triumvirate is more a recommendation for how to make type and/or use it well, not necessarily on how to mix it.\n\nA good basic primer on type styles and how to mix them is a book by Erik Spiekermann, which you can read either in English (_Stop Stealing Sheep and find out how type works_) or in German (_ÜberSchrift_).\n\n"

But I’ve received several books as gifts since. I have no idea what the next book I buy will be, but I’m already looking forward to it, whatever it is ;-)\n\n"

Instead of relying on one author’s suggestions for good type combinations you could (should?) explore the books all around the bookstore. What strikes you as working? Find books that you perceive to have good type combinations. Using you own instinct, even if at first you rely upon what you think others are doing well, will give you much more interesting results than what you will find in one or two books which will probably only show a small percentage of the type which is actually available for use.\n\n"

Switching types is now a simple menu option on Macs/PCs and not an expensive experiment like buying type output from the old typeshops of yore.\n\nIf you do not have the typeface you are interested in using, try to find a pdf sample of text from one of the type vendor sites. Print it out and literally cut & paste the (1200 dpi+) output next to other blocks of faces you are considering. Like cooking... add an ingredient or spice sparingly at first... sample it, then season to taste.\n\nA good meal is a good meal — but creating a great meal is something we all would love experiencing. (Gee, I’ve been on Weight-Watchers for two months now... I wonder if it has affected my thinking?)\n\nBTW — Type mixing could be one of several topics to explore during TypeCon’s Type Education sessions.\n\n"
