      "content": "Hello David\n\nI think it looks extremely nice. And you got the 'ø' perfectly right in the true spirit of danish designers such as Thorvald Bindesbøll, Knud V. Engelhardt & Gunnar Biilmann Petersen. (You need an Æ though)  \nA suggestion would be for you to draw some nice uncommon ligatures such as 'AV', 'MV', 'ME', 'ND' and so on. That would really hit the spot when designing titles or posters. And it would fit the tradition well.\n\nConcerning the 'm', have you considered bringing in the right leg a little bit. Not much... just a little so that optically the whitespace within the 'm' looks even? This is a thing a danish typeface designer ( [Poul Søgren](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123044050/http:/www.sogren.dk/))once told me look out for when drawing the lowercase 'm'. :)  \nOther than that, I think the 'm' looks fine.\n\nBy the way did you know that [Codan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123044050/http:/www.codan.dk/) is a danish ensurance company. (You probably did)\n\nGood luck\n\nMagnus\n\n"

(Yes, it actually seems that there is a distinct danish way of drawing letterforms.) And I still think you have a lot of Knud V Engelhardt's and Gunnar Biilmann Petersen's trademarks in your typeface. The way the A is drawn with the big flat top and the way the Ø is drawn as well. And that goes for most of your letters but the C and G doesn't seem to follow the tradition. The terminals should end vertically and not horizontally like now. And the G would not have the horizontal crossbar as it does now but only the vertical. I hope this weird babling makes any sense to you. Of course my words are just guidelines to the way of drawing like the classic danish typedesigners and you should not necessary listen to me but just go ahead and do it your own way.\n\nI think the lowercase s is too thin on the middle where it should probably be the thickest. But it is tilting nicely now as is the lc a.\n\nThe first one of your two lowercase y's is the best in my opinion. :)\n\nI think it is looking nice.\n\n--\n\nHere's a link to a pdf about ligatures (it's in Danish). And I think you can find--on the first page--an example of the kind of G I was trying to sketch out for you. (In the lower right corner are some logotypes by knud v engelhardt and gunnar biilmann pertersen)\n\n[www.grafisk-litteratur.dk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123044050/http:/www.grafisk-litteratur.dk/ \"www.grafisk-litteratur.dk/\") download/btm/10%20Ligatur/btm10b.pdf\n\nRegards\n\nMagnus\n\n"
