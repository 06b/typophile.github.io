  "content": "This is a hailing port of my dad's friend. He wants it burned into a cutting board. I, being the artist in the family, am the go to guy for doing this. Usually its easy stuff, Times Roman, Palatino, Trajan, but this...would have to be totally recreated. I am not getting paid for this. Any help figuring out what typestyle this is would be vastly appreciated! I'd rather not tweak 2 or 3 hours worth of bezier handles if I can avoid it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015024959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%20(2)_5523.JPG)\n\n",
