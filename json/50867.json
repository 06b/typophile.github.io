  "content": "This is a typeface I have been working on for some time now. The design is done, but I need some help with the non-English glyphs:\n\n1. I have gone through the websites of Gunnlaugur SE Briem, Adam Twardoch, Diacritics Project, and many pages on Typophile, and they all were extremely helpful. I don't know if I interpreted all the information correctly and would like people to comment on the accuracy their native language glyphs.\n\n2. The PDF shows the character set I have settled on, but I would like to know if I missed anything.\n\n3. What are the common ligatures of non-English languages.\n\n[http://typefetish.com/works/rm\\_it\\_cs.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/typefetish.com/works/rm_it_cs.pdf \"http://typefetish.com/works/rm\\_it\\_cs.pdf\")\n\nmuch thanks  \nMichael\n\n",

Without Ł and ł (uc and lc slashed L) you cannot typeset texts in Polish language. There's also historical and rare ligature combining to lc \"łs\" [link to example of ligature łł](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/typografia.ogme.pl/images/stories/podstawy/rys_roz_2/Ligatury_stadardowe3.gif).

It is mostly about varying levels of language support, which isn't exactly what you're looking for, but it might keep you from working harder than you have to. You have probably already seen it referenced in another Typophile thread though.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for all the comments everyone.\n\nBen, I am still doing some fine tuning of the curves and I haven't decomposed all the characters yet so a few of them do get knocked out when they overlap.\n\nAntoni, I do have a Ł and ł. I don't know if you saw them or not. They are up near the top of the file in a section called \"derivatives\". From what I read I didn't think they were diacritics and I didn't know exactly how to define them, so they got group with other slash or bar characters. If you did see them but thought they were designed incorrectly, I would appreciate some specifics.\n\nJason, it has been awhile since I have seen that page. I kind of forgot about it. Thanks.\n\n"

      "content": "The typeface looks quite interesting. The important omitted glyphs are as follows:  \nIdotaccent (uni0130) and dotlessi (uni0131) (Turkish, discussed [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/typophile.com/node/13570))  \nTcommaaccent and tcommaaccent (without Unicode reference, needed for Romanian)  \nEng (uni014A) and eng (uni014B) (needed for rare languages like Sami and some African languages)\n\nIf becoming punctual, there are also 4 optional glyphs you should add, although in many typefaces they are not present - **[Aringacute/aringacute](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/typophile.com/node/35221)** and **Oslashacute/oslashacute** (although I'm too lazy to check the Unicode points for them).\n\nAlso from WGL4 maybe you should add kgreenlandic (uni0131) and napostrophe (uni0149), although I haven't seen them in real use.\n\nThe matter of adding CE charset is discussed in more detail [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2764).\n\nNow about the quirks: I have some doubts regarding the ogonek placement in iogonek (Roman). Otherwise the diacritics placement looks ok to me.\n\n"

      "content": "Aringacute and Oslashacute are almost obsolete, although still are used in some Danish grammars, dictionaries and other linguistic texts, perhaps also in some poetry (quoting John Hudson from **[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/typophile.com/node/35221)**). kgreenlandic (aka **kra** )and napostrophe is almost extinct, but I still see them often implemented in many typefaces. They are described in this **[PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/www.evertype.com/alphabets/greenlandic.pdf)** by Michael Everson. Implementing it possibly would require to add also a specific Greenlandic uppercase K, as described **[here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/typophile.com/node/35971)**.\n\nAbout the lack of Unicode reference of Tcommaaccent the mistake is mine (in my old FontLab codepages I found only the glyph name, not Unicode values). Should have checked more thoroughly.\n\nNone of these glyphs are in heavy use; I mention them only because they still exist in [WGL4 specifications](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420101453/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/WGL4.htm) (i.e. Microsoft cosider them still not totally extinct).\n\n"
