  "content": "Hi Typophiles,\n\nI’m looking for a dingbats font that has a gear/cog in it. I know I used it once before but it has been years since I have seen it. If anyone has any ideas I would love to hear them. The image shows the cog after I converted to 3D.\n\nThanks a lot!  \nChris\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090810201820im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/COG3D_3894.jpg)\n\n",

It’s in the Symbols category.\n\nIt’s easy to create a gear in a drawing program with oblongs, circles and path operations such as Illustrator’s Pathfinder filters.\n\nDraw an oblong, duplicate, select all and combine to form a cross.  \nDuplicate the cross, revolve by 45°, select all and combine. This creates an 8-pointed star.  \nDraw a circle, place on top of the ‘star’ shape, select all and subtract.\n\n"
