  "content": "Typophiles of the world: Have you seen this Sans Serif before? Do you know its name?\n\nHave a look at the lower case \"L\" and the lower case \"A\". Does that ring a bell?\n\nThe (poor) scan is from a Phaidon Press book. Published in 1998, the book design was done by Stephen Wolstenholme.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803214549im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_1b_6247.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance for giving me information on the font!\n\n",
