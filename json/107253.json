(Not sure about the era classification on this one, the combo of chunky top serifs and variable stress is confusing. None of the more common transitionals, at least, unless it's an unusual cut of one of them.)\n\nDoes anyone have an idea what it could be? Digitised, I assume not? Anything close?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DSC\\_0534.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070402/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0534.JPG) | 345.11 KB |\n\n",
