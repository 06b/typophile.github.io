  "content": "I'm looking for advice on how to handle dropcaps in an instance where a single-line paragraph kicks off a chapter. InDesign gives the new paragraph an extra indent on the dropcap's baseline, which I actually thought was a pretty fair fix, but the folks I'm doing it for aren't entirely sure about it. One suggestion was to basically make the dropcap a raised one in this instance, but I really don't like that shift in continuity. Was wondering if there's any preferred rule on this or any precedent from pre-desktop publishing days anyone knows off hand?\n\nThanks and best,  \nAaron\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Dropcap Example.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201040426/http:/typophile.com/files/Dropcap%20Example.jpg) | 202.45 KB |\n\n",

If there are enough instances of this in your text then you are going down the wrong design road. Hell, if I had to design a book with even one such instance I'd ditch the drop cap and come up with a better idea.\n\npowers\n\n"
