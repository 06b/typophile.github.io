      "content": "Lars,   \n   \nMaybe you should forget about no.1 This :// has really been done for too many times. No.2 might not be \"breathing\" enough. Beside that it could become quite unlegible in B&W. I would recommend no. 3's further development anyway (altrough its a client's idea), but probably you should choose a font (or develop the d,o,b letters yourself) which actually is symmetric, so that b is a mirrored d. Including all the necessary optical corrections of course.   \n   \nDaniel's opinion about dividing the importance of the words is also interesting, but I think that Online and Berater share the same level (there is many of other consultants and many of other on-line services). I think the only word which could be at lower importance level is the \"der\" article.\n\n"
