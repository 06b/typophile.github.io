  "content": "Hi there all.\n\nI have found this blackletter typeface which looks great, but it has been styled with distressed edges which I don't like. Please can someone help identify a similar blackletter font that has similar characteristics, specifically the extra stroke that follow the black filled parts of the letters. In an ideal world I would like the same font but with hard, computerised edges as oppose to the hand rendered look.\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Blackletter with double stroke.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100528/http:/typophile.com/files/Blackletter%20with%20double%20stroke.png) | 173.32 KB |\n\n",
