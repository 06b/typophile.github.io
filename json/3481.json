  "content": "How big should the \"-mark\" symbols be in a font?   \n   \nMany fonts have the trademark and copyright mark at full cap height. Others have the Registered mark as a superior.   \n   \nBut surely this is a mistake, because while it makes sense in the main text, if a typographer then has to set the character in an accompanying footnote, it becomes the size of a fly dropping, and too small to decipher without a magnifying glass.   \n   \nWhat's your experience?\n\n",

      "content": "\\>the intended average point size of usage   \n   \nBut in practice that will vary:   \n   \nIn my experience designing ads, flyers, and marketing newsletters, the Registered symbol is used in body text (size 8 - 14 pt) as a superscript to a brand name.   \n   \nThen it is repeated in a footnote (with the name of the owner of the brand) as small as possible, (4 - 6 pt).   \n   \nI always prefer it when fonts have a cap-height Registered symbol, because it is easy to \"superscript\" the symbol in the body copy, but very difficult to increase the size of a pre-shrunk symbol in the footnote and not have it look too bold and misaligned vertically. If you just set it straight, it's but a speck.   \n   \nThat's why I make cap height Reg symbols in the fonts I design, unless they are outright display faces.   \n   \nHowever, I seem to be going against the flow here, so I would like to confirm with typographers:   \nDo you prefer a pre-shrunk Registered symbol in your text fonts?\n\n"

Perhaps if you choose to go with the full-size method, you can increase the weight a bit? I don't know what other consequences you might run into if you choose that option.   \n   \nHere at Gigantacorp, we often redraw fonts for the circulars for superior numbers and special characters. By the time we get to the redrawing stage, we already know what size range we will be needing and therefore can make the \"right\" choice in adjusting \"r-balls\" and \"tms\" in size, weight and positioning.   \n   \nDigression: Does anyone else call them \"r-balls\"?

      "content": "_How far should the mark match the style of the typeface -- in particular, why do most italic fonts have roman marks?_  \n   \nThe answer, as always, is: it depends.   \n   \nI have strongly suspected that some sloppy font producers throw in a generic humanist \"r-ball\" or \"tm\" on any font they create. To me, it's an obvious error if the R in the registration mark doesn't bear a strong resemblance to the R in the typeface it \"modifies.\"   \n   \nThe \"depends\" part deals with condensing and/or obliqueing the circle along with the R inside the circle. That's just wrong! Keep the circle round. Then condense or oblique (if you have to, but you really should re-draw) the R within the circle.   \n   \nOf course, after I've gone through the process of doing all that, the effect can be so distracting that I throw the end product out and default to the roman registration mark. Italic Rs within a circle sometimes look silly. Italic TMs sometimes look silly. **Avoid silly.**   \n   \nThomas, I agree with Gerald -- providing alternate versions is a great solution -- I'd be tempted to provide a version set at x-height as well.\n\n"
