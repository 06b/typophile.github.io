Nowadays, all you get is the button.   \n   \nThe awkwardness of the typography is charming -- the ridiculously narrow measure, and the different ways of justifying the text. What a lot of typography there is, caps, small caps and roman of Cheltenham, paragraph indents and leading, centred rules. The colon in the heading is quite unecessary, but elaboration is the name of the game. Beautifully written too, \"Press button firmly for a moment\".\n\n",
