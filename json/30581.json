  "content": "Which typeface do you think suits the whole idea of an agriculture show? The agriculture show has been going on since the 1770’s in the Northwest of England. It is usually attended by the elder generation and people into the farming industries/husbandry skills etc. Although it has started to become into a family day out for all, i still want to target and inform the original target audience in the poster i am going to be using this type for. So what do you think? Which one should I go for?  \nPS the patron for the agriculture show is the Queen Elizabeth of UK.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [agriculture show.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103921/http:/typophile.com/files/agriculture%20show_0.jpg) | 158.95 KB |\n\n [‹ justfied text in illustrator](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30926 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [en & em dash usage ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30946 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Somehow the northwest of England feels as if it would be pretty similar in its values and traditions.\n\nAll of the samples you posted feel to me like things that my neighbors would not relate to. They feel elegant, stylish, and “downtown” or “High Street.”\n\nSeems to me you might try for something with these qualities — earthy, practical, straightforward, strong, not geometric, not modern — as a way to relate to the fairgoers, rather than thinking about the Queen and going for elegance. But that’s only my Yank interpretation of what your event is all about.\n\n"
