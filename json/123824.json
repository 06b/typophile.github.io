A version of her lettering from 1916 is the basis for a font by Fleisch & Apostrophic called Colwell\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416032247im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ColwellAsCycle_3950.jpg)\n  [http://www.dafont.com/colwell.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416032247/http:/www.dafont.com/colwell.font \"http://www.dafont.com/colwell.font\")\n\nA toned down interpretation was published as a font by American Type Founders before 1923.
