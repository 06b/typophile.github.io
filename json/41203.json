  "content": "Hi,\n\nI know I'm asking much, but here it goes:\n\nI've chosen House's Paperback for the scheduled set of broschures. It should cover body text and, likely, heads (titles) and subheads.\n\nI contacted House Ind. to obtain a specimen and got a 1 page pdf containing a mix of the Paperback samples, which unfortunately hasn't got more then one line of text per style. I can't properly judge a book typeface after one line sentence, so asked for a more text sample. I got answer to request a catalog, which I did in November. After a month I asked why catalog hasn't arrived yet and got an answer they sent catalogs to Europe in packages, after certain number of requests in this direction had lined up. This unfortunately seems not to had happened yet...\n\nNow, the deadlines are coming and I'd like to stick to the Paperback idea, so I ask you fellow typophiles for help.\n\nMaybe some of you have a Paperback specimen with considerable amount of text set (to judge the color of the text) in the Paperback 9pt and title set in the Paperback 96pt?\n\nOr maybe some lucky license owner could prepare an \"Lorem ipsum\" pdf for me (9pt Paperback text, 30p0 column width and some 96pt title)?\n\nOr at least please say, if you are satisfied after you've seen the Paperback offset printed and tell me what kind of publication you used it for an what kind of paper has it been printed?\n\nBIG BIG BIG thanks in advance,\n\nAntoni\n\n",

Mainly text, half of it editorial stuff ragarding subject, other half case studies. I want the text page to be reach in color.

Could be interesting to use it in that way as long as you are using the correct optical sizes. Many designers might have the urge to use incorrect optical sizes just to exaggerate the letter shapes, but for your uses too much style might not be in order.\n\n"

      "content": "Antoni â€“ I have used Paperback in books. I first used it in a pastiche of an old mass-market paperback, so of course the typeface was perfect, but I've just put it to use again, in a larger book of fiction. It ought to work quite well for your purposes, I think, judging from the samples you've shown.\n\nThere's one thing to keep in mind, though, about Paperback: it's quite wide, so you may want to use a smaller size than you would expect, especially in narrow columns. It's not an \"economical\" typeface, in that sense.\n\n"
