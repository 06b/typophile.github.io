Also, the new drawing api in MX makes 3d rendering much easier, as you can now draw surfaces. As an example, check out [http://www.become.co.uk/3d2.swf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071655/http:/www.become.co.uk/3d2.swf).   \nThis can have applications in simple 3d text extrusion.   \nMX rocks! (at least, in terms of what you can do with it, not in terms of the layout which I personally feel stinks)   \n   \nMatthew\n\n"
