Open to any suggestions though.\n\n",

      "content": "Music is such a broad topic. Are you talking about Open Air rock concerts or small neighborhood Jazz clubs? Arias in operas or chamber concerts in old church attics? Punk, trash, industrial or alternative Rock? Electronica? I haven't even touched the surface of the iceberg here. All these different music styles involve all kinds of typographic interpretations.\n\nHave a look at the new (current) David Bowie album, _The Next Day_. Would you characterize a dry sans serif as typical for his rock?\n\nDesign using typefaces is really what you make of it, rather than a specific font associated with a broad type of expression like _music_. In other words: every font can work, if you make it work.\n\n"

I mentioned the app theme only for context. If anything.. I am thinking something that might reference the vernacular of america theater and concert hall marquees. The app with be featuring only american venues and at that on a city by city basis.\n\nIf I had to answer my own request in generic terms.. I would say I am looking for a condensed sans or possibly slab and a complementary text face suitable for information copy in small text sizes.\n\nHopefully that helps define my request a bit more. Are there any specific typeface suggestions that would satisfy the generic terms I outline above?\n\n"

I sent an email asking about this but have received no response.\n\nAnyone know of a comparable (or near comparable) pairing to Tungsten and Gotham that WOULD be available to embed in an iOS app?\n\n"
