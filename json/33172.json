  "content": "Hi all.\n\nWas wondering if all you typophiles out there could help me:\n\nA client has approved this font for their logo i.e Emigre's 'Ottomat' font ( [http://redesign.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=113](http://web.archive.org/web/20111113132026/http:/redesign.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=113 \"http://redesign.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=113\"))  \nfor their logo....however for some other sub brands we find that the font is not working.\n\nWould any of you out there know of fonts similar or close to this font? regardless of whether it is free or a proffesional foundry.\n\nMain thing is the font is a a pretty plain san serif...but with the whimsical expception of the rounded and odd edges point is some of the alphabets ascenders and ends. It is slightly playful but just right to be considered 'edgy'\n\nThe other crux: The standalone 'P' of the font..which looks nice is enclosed within a shape for a logotype for the same company..so it is important that the font have a unique and characteristic p...with something a bit playful like this one.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nRobby  \nINDIA\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Pepperminf Font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111113132026/http:/typophile.com/files/Pepperminf%20Font.jpg) | 14.64 KB |\n\n",
