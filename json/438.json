The Ten Commandments begins with the word 'I', and the Hebrew in the Torah is 'anochi' instead of the usual word for 'I', and the Rabbis speculate that this was in the people's dialect, not yet the Hebrew of the Bible.   \n   \nBut wait, it gets better. The Jewish mystics, the kabbalists, thought that each (Hebrew, = Aramaic) letter had a mystical significance. Here is a contemporary book on it, available also in delux edition. [http://www.jewishlights.com/books/001.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007002424/http:/www.jewishlights.com/books/001.html)   \n   \nBut wait, it gets still better. The mystics thought that you could study a passage of holy text until the words became meaningless and the letters formed into new messages, and the adept would soar in mystical ecstacy.   \n   \nOf course there was also 'practical Kabala' in which with the right Hebrew incantations you could do magic, such as bringing the dead to life. For example the english 'abracedabera' means in aramic 'I create as I spoke'. So with the right combination of names of God you could do the miraculous. Apparently you would practice on something like a dove.   \n   \nIt occurred to me that you guys who are always working designing letters are doing something like the mystics did to reach the higher realm. Of course, this is all nonsense. But if I read later in the Inquirer that dead parokeets were mysteriously brought back to life near to the ATypi conference, I will know, I will know.\n\n"
