      "content": "Ideally you'll like to have a look at the London Underground Station Design Audits, which are held in the London Transport Museum Library. They are a guide to \"_elements on the station[s] worth conserving as well as a pointer to possible future restoration of deteriorated or missing architectural details...London Underground wishes to conserve all those features which are representative of the station's history where they are still relevant._\"\n\nUnfortunately the museum itself is being 'transformed', so I don't know how accessible the collection is. The website can be found here - [http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20100510011222/http:/www.ltmuseum.co.uk/).\n\nNo idea if this book lists stations with original fittings, but it's worth a look - [Johnston's Underground Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20100510011222/http:/www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1854142313/qid=1140384229/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_0_4/026-6296368-4802057).\n\nAldgate's audit mentions \"_platform canopy at North end probably 19th Century originals. They incorporate 1920s brass trimmed free standing signs._\" Not sure if they are 'original' or not, a quick search on flickr found [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20100510011222/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ickoonite/23312491/) (I seem to have misplaced all my photographs of the station). It also found this, at [Aldgate East](http://web.archive.org/web/20100510011222/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/iantindale/38978031/), just down the road.\n\nI presume the latter is what you're looking for, and I know there are a lot of the older signs at many of the stations - including tiles - but offhand I couldn't say which. Some of the more central stations ring a bell - Tottenham Court Road and Leicester Square - but I haven't been on a tube for quite some time; south east London doesn't have many tube stations.\n\n"

I would not be surprised at all to learn that some of Johnston's original work was being preserved there, in storage or in the exhibits. Give it a try--and like I said, it's a great musuem anyway.\n\n"
