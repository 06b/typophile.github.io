As many of this kind of job, it is deeply rooted in [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/futura). This one looks mainly like a redrawn/roughen/hand-shaped version of it (see printscreen below).  \nAs you're mainly after this kind of /A (which could easily be done starting from /A, removing middle crossbar and \"closing\" the resulting triangle): [Diamonds](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/diamonds/), [Evolette A](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157/http:/26plus-zeichen.de/en/fonts/tj-evolette-a/), [Lightyears](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/matchandkerosene/lightyears), many ones at [TenDollarFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157/http:/www.tendollarfonts.com/) (TWOFACED, Echelon, Rathe, Parqa, Fonecian, Finding 57, Harf 77, Labieno, Positano, Marina, Alumia...)  \nMore inspiration: [I Am So Tired With Your Experimental Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157/http:/experimentalsans.tumblr.com/)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109141157im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-3_4169.png)\n\n"
