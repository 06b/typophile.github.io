We have been using voice over for everything and supporting that with text on screen.\n\nWe have three point sizes for three age ranges:  \nprep/foundation: 30pt sasoon sans  \ngrade 1-2: 26pt sasoon sans  \ngrade 3-4: 22pt sasoon sans  \ngrade 4-5: 18pt sasoon sans\n\nThese also had various kerning and leading setting.\n\nWe tried out some stuff and instinctively went for quite a bit of leading, up to 6pts for the younger kids.\n\nThere was a fair amount of discussion about ambiguity of letters in various fonts: a preference for a straight tail on the nine(sorry about the terminoloy...), as opposed to the upside down 6 was a good example of this. We looked at heaps of fun fonts, but for the younger kids, didn't have enough differntiation between characters like 9.  \nA capital I with ligatures was also necessary.\n\nmrfussy, yes, totally agree with your comment, \"letter identification first\" I guess even if you're not setting out to teach reading or writing, then it will still probably go a long way if what you're doing can do that as well.\n\nI think also that what is said on \"kidstype.com\" is a really important, in terms of what we were doing:  \n# Teacher opinion, generally, favours sans serif typefaces because of the simplicity of the letter shapes  \n# But children encounter a wide range of letterforms in their day-to-day environment  \n# Publishers tend to listen to teachers because they influence the book-buying policy in schools  \n# Children are seldom asked what they think about the typefaces in the books they read\n\nI may have answered my own question here, but wanted other peoples feedback.\n\n"
