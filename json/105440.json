If I have to recreate it and even if it sounds \"crazy\", I'd probably start from [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724120357/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile) (mainly beacause of this /s) redrawing almost all letters from /o. An effortless solution would be to start from [Age](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724120357/http:/fontfabric.com/age-free-font) and borrow /s from Eurostile.\n\n"
