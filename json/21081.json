  "content": "hello,\n\ni am looking for a typeface that is very impactful. a typeface that says 'boom' that is bold and heavy. i do not care if it is serif or sans serif... perhaps something similar to the kinds of 'branding' stamps that cows get. perhaps something close to Impact but a bit more interesting. i would appreciate it if someone can give me some suggestions. thanks in adavance :)\n\n(if possible, the family should have small caps)\n\n",
