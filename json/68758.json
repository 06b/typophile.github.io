How does it fare in comparison with the various other printings that have been published over the years?\n\nIt would be nice to have both volumes consolidated in a singular tome, but I'm fearful that the image fidelity is sub-par due to the reproduction processes they might have used. I read through [this past thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419100013/http:/typophile.com/node/2365) on the topic, but there isn't any definitive report on the 2001 version there. Or did I miss it?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",
