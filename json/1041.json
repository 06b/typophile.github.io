But I didn't want to go the 'stencil' route.   \n   \nI will do some more 'notching' and repost, but does the W seem awkward in terms of balance to you (or anyone else)?

I think that's one of the reasons it looks so much darker. I also think the reason the W seems unbalanced is the difference between the two apertures at the top - and the counter space. The left counter is much smaller and has a smaller aperture. Maybe it'd help to widen it some.\n\n"

Hence Tiffany's suggestion of a geometric. Well, I think - I certainly don't want to misrepresent anyone.   \n   \nOne thing about the letters in MARK ZARNOW: the \"R\" is still too heavy to my eyes. Is it possible to widen it slightly - or make the tail thinner (more like \"K\") - in order to create more counterspace?\n\n"
