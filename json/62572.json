I think of it as analogous to knowing when to use capitals vs. lowercase.\n\nIn your example, however, you are being inconsistent, without any semantic logic.\n\nAlso, in most style guides the use of the ordinals in \"21st\" would be incorrect. Even if one would read it as \"21st,\" in formal writing the date should be set as simply \"September 21, 1794.\"\n\n"

After all, if the rationale for OS numbers is provide smooth typographic color within the text stream, then why should they be used outside the textstream, in the running heads (particularly if the heads were in full caps).\n\nI could never get an editor to agree with me, and gradually realized that they might be right. Having two different sets of numbers \\_may\\_ inadvertently confuse a reader, and that is a cardinal sin in good typography, in my opinion.\n\n"

In a scholarly text I would have used footnote references lining, even if the text elsewhere on the page is OS. This was because with 10pt text, footnotes were set at 7 point, baseline shifted, and the light weight of the reduced OS numbers would make them too weak.\n\nI'd have to do a lot of testing (well some) first if I was still doing books, because many fonts have true superior figures that could be used without the weaking of using a reduced font. OS footnote refs might be acceptable in that case.\n\n"

      "content": "I'd agree with Kent, your example has no rationale. Consider the following:\n\n\"In 1933, Whosis developed the equation (put equation here).\"\n\nI have set texts where dates & non-mathematical number usage used old-style figures, but equations used lining figures.\n\nAs to confusing a reader, one should always have some sense of who a reader might be. I once set a book where the designer specified the chapter opening epigraphs to be set in italic. The run-in source had the author's name also in italic, with the title in roman. Usual practice in such a situation. An editor objected; it might comfuse the reader. You know, they might think of that wonderful novel <cite>Ernest Hemingway</cite> by The Old Man and the Sea. I'd add that most anyone without at least a high school education wouldn't have understood the text of the book, filled as it was with academic jargon . . .\n\n"
