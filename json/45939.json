Both open (black numbers in a black outlined circle) and closed (white numbers in a black circle) versions are included.\n\nIt should be pretty easy to find the number you need, as everything is laid out very systematically. Use the Shift and Option keys to access all the numbers.\n\nYou can get it here:  \n [http://www.archive.org/details/Zandvoort](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012170122/http:/www.archive.org/details/Zandvoort \"http://www.archive.org/details/Zandvoort\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [zandvoort-promo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012170122/http:/typophile.com/files/zandvoort-promo.jpg) | 43.49 KB |\n\n",

I know there are some existing font like this, but I didn't like how they were setup, so I wanted a solution that was very systematic.\n\nKatharina -- I'd love to see how you use it.\n\n"
