      "content": "U2 through their design agency [Four5One](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.four5one.ie/) have been using Clarendon for pretty much all their print and web graphics since 2004. It might be interesting and useful for you to have a look at how they have handled the typeface.\n\nThe way they seem to make it work is by always juxtaposing it with with something very modern looking, [Eurostile](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/) in this [case](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.u2wanderer.org/disco/view.shtml?images/alb021-01.jpg). They also make nice use of [Aachen](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/aachen/) in the booklet of the same album. You can sort of see it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.u2wanderer.org/disco/view.shtml?images/alb021-08.jpg) but it looks better on the inside pages. Also worth checking out is the book U2byU2 were they have used [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=garamond) in conjunction with Clarendon, but don’t know how successful this is really. The original use of Clarendon in U2 material is the 2004 [How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.u2wanderer.org/disco/alb019.html) album, which is entirely set in Clarendon.\n\nOn looking through the U2 stuff I get the impression Clarendon is a difficult face to work with. I have also found this myself from experience. My own suggestion here would be [Helvetica Condensed Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20091213031829/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/helvetica-neue/cond-thin/). It think that could make the right contrast. I also feel like I can never use anything other than another classic face with Clarendon. I don’t know why that is.  \nAnyway I hope this has been of some assistance to you!\n\n"
