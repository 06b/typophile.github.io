  "content": "There’s a used bookstore I drop by at least once a week. I assume that many of the books come from estates of the many elderly women in the neighborhood who spend their final years in a decrepit old mansion before dying, leaving behind a house full of junk that smells of mold, mothballs, and cat urine. Their books are rarely anything special, so they tend to get unceremoniously dumped on the discount tables outside. I can walk up to these tables and learn about the latest deaths in my neighborhood.\n\nLast week it was apparently an old German woman with a thing for painters and the modernism that sprung from the Vienna secessionists.\n\n",
