I started a Meetup group and everything. :)\n\nThinking of having a small get-together next week!\n\n[http://www.meetup.com/Type-Victoria-Fonts-Typography-meetup/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414035922/http:/www.meetup.com/Type-Victoria-Fonts-Typography-meetup/ \"http://www.meetup.com/Type-Victoria-Fonts-Typography-meetup/\")\n\n",

You can also ask Working Format. Lastly, it's not a crazy drive up from Seattle, and there's a bunch of font-heads there, so...\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Many well-known typographers and type designers live on the gulf islands, so much that they have been nicknamed the “Typographic Archipelago.” John Hudson is on Gabriola Island, Ross Mills and Shelley Gruendler on Galliano Island, Marian Bantjes on Bowen Island, and Robert Bringhurst on Quadra Island.\n\nVancouver is quite a ways from Victoria, btw. What with needing to wait for the ferry, it is nearly a three hour trip all told, although only half of that is ferry transit time per se. Seattle with its faster catamaran service, right from downtown, combined with minimal wait times, is effectively nearly as close.\n\n"
