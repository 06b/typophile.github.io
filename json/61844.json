  "content": "Hello Everybody,  \ni need to open, edit and save font file formats with the suffix “ **.c** ”.  \nThey seem to have been generated with **FontConverter** on PC.  \nThe Apps _FontFlasher, TransType_ and even _BitFonter_ DEMOs couldn’t open this file format in OSX. Is there any chance/program i can work with these font files under OSX at all, or do i need to get a PC?  \nThanks for any hint in advance,  \nJum\n\n",

I've found sometimes that changing the format suffix can make the file workable (or at least when it comes to .tif, .jpg, .pdf, etc). Try duplicating the file, and renaming the suffix to a common format, and it may magically work. I've never heard of a single character format suffix.\n\n"
