  "content": "Hello, my name is Richard, I'm a second year Graphic Communication student in the UK. I've been making typefaces since college and have recently learnt how to put them together in Fontlabs, and this is my first completed typeface.\n\nI started by looking at Futura and Universal, and I liked the simple geometric shapes that built up the letter-forms. I tried to keep aspects of circles in the forms when possible.\n\nPlease excuse the arrogant title, I wasn't in a creative mood when I named it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416051701im_/http:/typophile.com/files/preview1_3494.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416051701im_/http:/typophile.com/files/preview2_3754.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Well I think perhaps there isn't enough refinement in it. For instance, Futura really isn't so geometrically formed as it looks at first. The o's are actually somewhat condensed, and the horizontals are about 70 or 80 percent the thickness of the verticals. The rounded areas in many fonts tend to be somewhat thicker too.\n\nSome of the forms are a bit wobbly aside from that. I think the A is also definitely too condensed. The widths might also need refining.\n\nAnyway, I'm a beginner with this stuff, someone else probably knows better than I. Like the lowercase g, though. This would be interesting in a bolder weight.\n\nBriän\n\n"

      "content": "good start. although many of your curves need refinement and the letter thickness is not consistent. for instance, the d and o in dog feel thicker than the g, and the z in lazy feels thicker than the la and y. one problem is that you are using a varied line thickness on some letters and not on others. so, if you're going to make your lowercase g vary in thickness, you need to also give the round part of your d and o a similar variation - that's where the discrepancy in visual weight is coming from. you should knock out the letters arq&s and get them ABSOLUTELY PERFECT before moving on to the rest of the letters, otherwise you waste a lot of time going back and adjusting each letter. once you get those letters nailed, you can use those forms to create the majority of the rest of the letterforms.\n\n"

      "content": "There are good things but IMVHO, it needs a bit more love before anyone can really comment constructively. Decide which glyphs/characters you are happiest with and try to emulate the thickness of the strokes on that one. Say you think h is the benchmark because you want a stressed font: perfect the h (here the junction is too thick at the top for the glyph to be homogenous); then go through the letters you think are closest to that h benchmark, put them side by side (e.g. hah) and work on the a until you match the strokes visually; then move on letter by letters. Work with a pen next to you, just so you see what the ductus is and where there would be variations in the stroke.\n\n"
