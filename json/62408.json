Any suggestions on supportive type I could use for the menu, I was using Futura but now not really liking it\n\nI am also on a very small budget for this project, it being a re-do for school project. for portfolio.\n\nThanks\n\n",

Some of the stuff might be too spacey, but it's from the right time period, so you might find some stuff that provides inspiration.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie\\_architecture](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516110019/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie_architecture \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googie\\_architecture\")\n\nClarendon would definitely be a good choice, but it's seen a big resurgence lately, so you might want to go in another direction to avoid looking like Ruby Tuesday or something like that.\n\n"
