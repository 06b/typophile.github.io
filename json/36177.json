The sign will say something  \nlike “shop this way”.\n\nAny suggestions for a beautiful arrow to complement the typeface  \nwould be appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ \"Best\" digital version of Futura?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511103318/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18710 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Trasher Skateboarding Magazine logo tagline - Eurostile Extd {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511103318/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36024 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
