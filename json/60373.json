Crewekerne (nicknamed in house the font with the four e's) explores further the idea of 'Arts and Crafts' movement inspired faces that also inspired our recent Gildersleeve family.\n\nWe've also just posted details of a special introductory offer on the Gildersleeve family on the [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015101118/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\nThe other release we currently have in the pipeline is something a little more formal-Bonnington.
