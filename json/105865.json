Then I see the same phone number on another post offering to buy all these software programs. What's his deal? Why would he want to buy all this software? Am I missing an opportunity for more cash? Is he bootlegging it? Anyone have an idea?\n\n[http://sfbay.craigslist.org/scz/wan/4008031709.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714181928/http:/sfbay.craigslist.org/scz/wan/4008031709.html \"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/scz/wan/4008031709.html\")\n\n",
