(Either method would have worked, so this could be overkill, but the point was to show how a heavier weight could be achieved with a font. I apologize to the purists.) The cedilla is still wrong, but if metal type was used that part might have been added. ![Sackers Engravers Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051850im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20656.gif)\n\n"

However, not being French myself or even knowing French beyond the phrases I'm familiar with -- \"esprit d'escalier\" is a favorite of mine, not to mention a frequent affliction -- the search has been quite instructive indeed.\n\n"
