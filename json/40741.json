  "content": "I've been searching font libraries for what seems like years, trying to find a 'perfect' font for a magazine redesign. I thought I'd finally settled with Chronice and Verlag but now not sure. My company is buying the fonts in and I don't want to get them in, and then find out that they are no good!\n\nI'm looking for a contempory serif font for body text and sans for the headline/captions etc. The mag is very stylish, b&w photography mag\n\nMy shortlist includes: freight, proxima nova, paperback, thorndale, alfon, breuer text, camingo, klavika...\n\nI'm so confused!!! Not asking you to do my job for me, but any suggestions/guidence would be great!\n\n",

The newer fonts are not available via FB's retail site just yet, but they are available for license through the Font Bureau. You'll need to contact them directly if you're interested. I could also send you some PDF samples, if you want to contact me directly via my Typophile contact.\n\nSome examples can be seen at [www.kentlew.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140412135815/http:/www.kentlew.com/ \"www.kentlew.com\"), but many of the <cite>Fortune</cite> commissions aren't shown yet.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "When you find a candidate, be sure to go to the foundry's web site (or write them) and make sure the license allows you do use the fonts as you need. Some foundries, for example, won't let you embed the fonts in a PDF file to send to the printer (rare, but it happens). Some won't let you embed the fonts in a PDF file that will appear on line (quite common). Some foundries have different pricing depending on how the fonts will be used (e.g. on line, print only, etc. etc.).\n\nIn passing I can't imagine using Paperback for an \"stylish, arty photography magazine\"; maybe that's just my lack of imagination.\n\n"
