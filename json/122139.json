Fonts were tested in BabelPad and FireFox 32.0.3 (winXP sp3). See FireFox:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317212002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Font_5578.jpg)\n  \nI don't care the file is smaller, important is that errors are clearly visible (I marked some with red circles). I belive font will be better when \"diet-proof\" or \"diet-ready\". \n",
