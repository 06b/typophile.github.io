      "content": "Well, from a no-more-faux-small-caps perspective, yours is certainly better. I want the shield/crest to be bigger, as it is in the original. I just prefer the balance, particularly in light of the added weight. Also, the 'W' could stand to snuggle up to the 'N' just a bit. Perhaps you could to a little custom work on the join where the serifs will overlap?\n\nOverall, I think it's a subtle improvement, unless the client doesn't like the heavier feel of the type. I admit I prefer the weight of the bottom version, other issues aside. But that's a matter of personal taste.\n\n"
