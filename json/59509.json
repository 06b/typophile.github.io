  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI generated a .ttf file of a font that was created in FontLab 5.0. When I tried it out in Illustrator CS3, I found out that while my ligatures are working, for some reasons some parts of it drops out (image attached).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203093308im_/http:/typophile.com/files/a_3425.jpg)\n\nI really have no clue what's causing this, so I was wondering if someone could point out what might be going on and how to fix it. Also, this only happens with the ligatures starting with lowercase a â€” so I wonder if there's a possibility that there's some problems with the glyph that I probably overlooked?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nCheers,  \nChrista\n\n",
