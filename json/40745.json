  "content": "I’m currently working on a 15” MacBook Pro with an external 23” Apple Cinema Display. I’m planning to upgrade to a new Mac Pro and I’m trying to figure out the ideal display set up. Anyone use 2 - 30” displays, or 2 to 3 - 23” displays? With my setup now, I’m constantly juggling windows between the 15” and the 23”. Most of my work is in CS3, with mail, iTunes and web open. I’m just curious if anyone has found the dream display setup for this kind of work.\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Newsletter Examples/Ideas - NEWBIE](http://web.archive.org/web/20080116135321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40877 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [iBook G4 Batteries? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080116135321/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40863 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I’ve been using dual displays for the most part since the Mac II days. Two displays around 20” or so works pretty well for type design. I use the main screen for the glyph and font windows with previews and other windows on the secondary screen. When I’m working in most other programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, web, etc.), I usually just use the main screen. I keep my email, calendar, and to-do list on the secondary screen.\n\nI think larger screens would be even better, but I have noticed that if I am spending a lot of time doing something on the secondary screen, my neck starts to get sore, and I think larger screens would make this worse. Moving the keyboard, mouse and chair helps, but I don’t usually remember to do it. Sometimes I just move the window I’m working in to the main screen temporarily. I also sometimes think a single, very large screen (a 30-incher) would be better.\n\nMy main screen is a 21” Wacom Cintiq, which I’ve had for a couple of years. This is one of those tablet/screen hybrids with which you can draw directly on the surface with a stylus. I thought this would be the ultimate, best display for working on type and doing lettering, but my experience has been mixed. It works great for Photoshop and drawing in general, but not so great for editing fonts. It can’t match the precision of the mouse for making small movements. What I mean by this is that the on-screen cursor has a tendency to jiggle around, as if it can’t decide precisely which coordinate it’s on, even when you hold the stylus rock steady. This never happens with a mouse. Because of its size, figuring out where to put the keyboard when you’re using it to draw is a real puzzle, and you always need to be able to use the keyboard, even while drawing. There is a limit to how upright the display can go, so even in it’s most upright position, it’s fairly tilted back, and this causes a glare problem when you have overhead lighting. So, great idea, really fun to use, but problematic.\n\n"

A “normal” (non widescreen) monitor is a 4:3 aspect ratio. But 1280x1024 is 5:4 aspect ratio. Only your software doesn’t know you’re running a non-standard aspect ratio, and all your work is subtly distorted compared to WYSIWYG.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

(i hope this doesn’t degenerate into the ppi debates of yore).\n\n1) is there really any such thing as a “normal monitor” ?  \n2) most good monitors come with some adjustments for horizontal and vertical sizing.  \n3) i work on one machine that is set to 1280 x 1024 (its maximum resolution),  \nbut the first thing i do on any monitor is draw a perfect square and circle, print them out, and measure the image on both screen and paper, and adjust accordingly. no problem.\n\nthat aside, my perfect set-up is no computer at all, pencil and paper.\n\nbut seriously, i do try and look at my work in progress on several different monitors for color and distortion. i’m mostly producing motion graphics, but for print i frequently print and compare same at various print settings.\n\nalso, i’m utterly dependent on the largest available tablet and pen for ergonomics and dexterity. i prefer an older wacom, without the new on-tablet side controls, which i find are too easily activated accidently. at a client’s office where i often work they gave me one of those and i had to disable those controls.\n\nand while we’re on the topic, i’m discouraged that the new imacs and macbooks ship with glossy screens only. when low gloss flat screens came out it was such a relief to be free of unwanted reflections, and now in some bizarre act of consumer fetish manufacturing apple has decided that people want them. why would i want my screen display modulated by anything other than the image i’m working on ?  \ni urge anyone who feels the same way to submit a complaint to apple’s consumer feedback forum. perhaps if enough professionals complain they’ll get the message: non-gloss now !\n\n"
