I would gladly buy it somewhere (don't know where to find it as a purchase font, but even then, I don't know if it will embed.)  \nCould there be something I'm doing that prevents if from embedding?  \nThank you.\n\nKR Floral Color Me 2 : This font could not be embedded due to licensing restrictioins in the font. A substitute font will be used if it supports the glyphs unsed in the restricted font. The PDF will not be created if the glyphs cannot be represented. Will not produce a PDF/X compliant file.\n\n",
