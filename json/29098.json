If you want to make a Photochop look elegant, tossing Trajan on top is a logical (note I said logical, not good) way to go and doesn’t require any real effort.\n\nIt might also be because Spielberg keeps using Trajan, and a lot of people in Hollywood will try anything to be cool like Spielberg, and since they can’t make a movie like him...\n\n"
