  "content": "Hi -\n\nI am working on a CD package and I am interested  \nin making this John Cage album cover bi-lingual.  \nI have chosen to use both english and japonese  \ncharacters for obvious reasons. But here is my  \nquestion.\n\nWorking in AdobeIndesign, how do you set alternative  \nlanguages that are not native to your computer or  \nsoftware. I am experimenting as a novice design  \nstudent and I'm composing this as a portfolio piece.\n\nAlso, anyone who has this kind of knowledge of type-  \nsetting in multiple languages would you have any  \nsuggestions on what japonese typefaces pair well  \nwith Frutiger's Univers?\n\nBest regards,  \n`j e a n\n\n",
