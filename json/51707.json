  "content": "I'm in the process of design my school year book. I've got several parameters that need following and I am looking for some advice/ guidance. The document is normally around 200 pages. A4 portrait. 3 column. Around 800 images, full colour. The school font is Times New Roman... I know, I know but dont have to use it throughout doc. Last year I used verdana main body with a fair degree of success. Just because its for web and commercial print. I'm looking some help choicing some fonts that work well together. Either a serif title with a san for body text. or the other way around. I'd also like your thoughts on the navigating bar which will be colour coded (the year book has around 25 sections) and footer (the school and yearbook title)\n\ngreatly appreciated\n\nGareth\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824184938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pages-from-shamal2009-2_3455.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130824184938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pages-from-shamal2009-5_3525.jpg)\n\n",
