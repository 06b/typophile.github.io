  "content": "Celebrating Mardi Gras with a poster I did for a music show in college. I cut the lettering by hand on a silkscreen stencil, possibly freehand but more likely traced from a pencil sketch.  \nI did a lot of these in college. I had no formal training in typography at the time, and was experimenting with letterforms.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317172748im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MardiGras1970small_4192.jpg)\n\n",
