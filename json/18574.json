I started to look at contempoary manifestations of typography as form but started to ask myself where the hell I am going with this. Do I cut it down to exploring when 'words become images?'. My intrest lyes with the borderline when words 'as written functional form' cross over to becoming form/ images which represent the word with so much more meaning and emotion. Does this have any intrest or am i travelling the road of no return?\n\n",

In this sense, words written with the roman alphabet (or any other alphabet) are no different from Chinese, which is purely ideographic. Virtually all conscious activity relies on **pattern recognition** , and words, taken individually, are discrete patterns (with discrete bouma, I am told).\n\nHowever, alphabetic languages have an advantage over ideographic languages when one encounters **unfamiliar** words; in these instances--depending on how regular the rules of pronunciation are in the language in question--you at least have some idea of what the word **sounds** like, even if you can't determine what it means. That is, unless the language is English, e.g., bough, cough, dough, through, tough.\n\nIn Arabic calligraphy, words become design (not images, which are forbidden); in a good deal of logotype design, words become pictures (brands); somewhere on this website, there's a link to Bembo's zoo, where letters become critters. Pictograms become letters, letters form words, words form ideograms, ideograms become pictograms -- it's a marvelous circular process.\n\n"

      "content": "There are so many interesting directions you could take. Many of the above suggestions are worth exploring, but I guess for a project topic you need to pick just one main direction and go with it.\n\nAs a conceptual matter, there is no necessary distinction between \"text\" and \"image.\" Text, as has been pointed out above with some great examples, IS image, in the sense that text is visual (well, unless read aloud?). If that seems like a trivial point, consider that there is no \\*visual\\* criterion by which we could distinguish \"writing\" from \"not writing\" whenever we encounter any highly decorative use of an unfamiliar script-- decorative inscriptions in Arabic are a perfect example. We might see it and NOT KNOW it's any kind of \"writing\" at all. Same for a lot of graffiti-- it often takes a while to see that within the dynamic and playful clusters of strokes, there may be something as simple as a tagger's name and/or some identifying information.\n\nI think this point at which a differece in \\*degree\\* (extreme but comprehensible stylization) becomes a difference in \\*kind\\* (we actually CANNOT TELL until it's explained to us) is a very interesting point, b/c it's both a cultural and a cognitive matter of whether we \"get\" what we're seeing or not.\n\nIt's also worth adding that the functional vs. artistic dichotomy is itself a relatively modern, Western notion. Where any kind of inscribed marking (\"writing\" or otherwise) serves a \\*ritualistic\\* function, it is kind of BOTH functional AND artistic AND more. You see that already in many nonwestern inscriptions and in Western but not-so-modern stuff like illuminated manuscripts. Doing script as \"glory to [pick your god]\" can't be broken down so easily into those functional vs. artistic categories-- the ART is what helps the writing serve the FUNCTION of propogating, glorifying, etc., one's belief system.\n\n- Jay\n\n"

      "content": "Laura-- I agree with you, as my note above suggests (I think). I am interested in this very same set of questions. My sense is that it's probably not a good idea to search for a specific, lone criterion that distinguishes the two, but rather to focus on what features of what \"marking systems\" (my own way of putting it) are good at doing what kind of thing. Phonemic alphabetics, e.g., do a fairly decent job (with varying success) at presenting a graphic clue about sound. The IPA does it better, though. Pictures can make an impression, but they can't lay out an _explicit_ cluster of premises, claims, conditional statements, etc., quite as well as text (alphabetic or not-- Chinese, e.g., is written and read \"serially\" but isn't alphabetic).\n\nThe only way I've been able to make a distinction between \"text\" and \"nontext\" is not too different from yours-- it has something to do with what is made explicit and what isn't, what is meant to convey points A, B, and C to any given audience, and what can convey points X, Y, and C to a specific audience provided they have the right contextual knowledge.\n\nLest this sound like a bunch of jibber-jabber, consider the photo below:\n\nSome would say that it may make quite an impact but can't really articulate an _argument_ the way a text could. On that line of thinking, a picture is NOT really worth a thousand words. But if we say that such a picture conjures up all kinds of claims, evidence, reasoning, conclusions, etc., provided one has the contextual knowledge to bring to one's viewing of it, then a picture may be worth a whole lot MORE than a thousand words.\n\nNow, this makes things a lot easier for those wondering whether type is an image or not, or what criteria there are for separating them. The examples above are nice-- they show all kinds of funky ways \"letters\" can be given pictorial embellishments. But if you want to talk about can even, say, a simple Times New Roman \"A\" be seen as an IMAGE, well, the answer is YES obviously. Then, if we want to say, but can it make an \"argument,\" again, the answer is YES, but ONLY if we see it in some context that gives us an \"A\" in the form of some kind of argument (A-list, a grade of \"A\", The A-Team, etc.). The triangular, upward-pointing \"shape\" helps, of course, but the letter being in the first position of the conventional Latin alphabet does, too.\n\nAnyway, this is cool stuff you're interested in. ANd not simple. I won't pretent what I'm saying answers it all. Just some speculations.\n\n- J\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111223092815im_/http:/typophile.com/files/blackpower.jpg)\n\n"
