I'm not a big fonthead, but I know enough to know that using more than a few fonts on a single web page is quite risky.\n\nI did this design in one night with no particular idea in mind from the start, and I was quite satisfied with the result. However, I'm using a weird mix of fonts, so I'd like to know if anyone would have a strong opinion on my choices!\n\nI'm using Lucida Sans Unicode uppercase for headers and logotype, Garamond for most content and navigation, and here is where I doubt my design skills: I'm mixing with small-caps Trebuchet MS (READ MORE links and search bar) and Georgia for the dates.\n\nAlthough doing that is something I tend to avoid, I think the result is pretty OK... what do you think?\n\n[http://www.epgui.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417092506/http:/www.epgui.com/?b=1)\n\n",
