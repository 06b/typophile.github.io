  "content": "Hi all! I need help understanding how you are meant to use one san serif font with another san serif or serif? I tend to use them in families i.e. for headline I may use Gill Sans and for the bodycopy, i might use Gill Sans Light or Helvetica for headline and Helvetica Nue or Helvetica Neue Light for bodycopy etc but how do I use another typeface instead of choosing from the same family. Please help and how am I meant to understand how to use a serif font with a san serif. Please show me examples. Thanks :)\n\n",
