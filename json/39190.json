  "content": "I’m curious of the perspective on building Stylistic Alternates into a font. I have a typeface that I would like to have an alternate ’O’ that wouldn’t have a corresponding spot in my font glyph window in the way that ’Oslash’, as an alternate does.\n\nI’m new to this, but in this situation is the way to go about it to just create a new glyph and name it something unique that relates to my alternate character?, since, in this situation this is a completely original character that I want to be accessed as an open type feature just to change up the style of the font if desired.\n\nI have other fonts that I would like to do this with in the future containing multiple sylistic characters?\n\nI’m curious how this is done since what I’m doing isn’t an alternate in terms of being small caps or swash characters just creatively a unique variation on one particular character and in the future multiple characters with unique variations.\n\nThanks for your input.\n\nMike\n\n [‹ ScanFont 5 is released](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119020213/http:/typophile.com/node/39095 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Classes Issue ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119020213/http:/typophile.com/node/39149 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
