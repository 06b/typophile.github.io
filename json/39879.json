I have noticed that Adobe only sells their fonts as OT. So why should anyone else do it? Is there a large group of customers that need type-1 or do they only buy them because they don’t know the difference or because that’s what they have always bought?\n\nRegards,  \nHenning\n\n [‹ similar to P22 Jacobean Initials](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152220/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39989 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Idea Magazine ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152220/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39980 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’ve seen this recently in the particularly problematic case of a design agency using hack encoded Type 1 fonts for Hindi with proprietary InDesign plug-ins. Their entire workflow is based around this system, and it is a major obstacle to use of new typefaces. Needless to say, it is also an obstacle to text interchange, since the hack encoding is completely non-standard, recognised only by this plug-in, and not cross-platform compatible.\n\n"

You can always offer pared down versions of your OT fonts for the bargain hunters. Format has nothing to do with price or feature excess.\n\nI long for the day when all fonts are OpenType and various offerings of the same typeface are distinguished by their feature/glyph set, not by their format.

See the attached screenshots, which are what the short repertoire looks like in Mac Font Book when you install Cronos Pro, as opposed to a “nice” OT font like Adobe Garamond. Notice the latin alphabet has somehow been cross-linked with foreign language equivalents. I’m not an expert in Unicode and Font Lab Studio et al., so I don’t know the technical reason why this occurs. But I know the result.\n\nIn current versions of Microsoft Office products, a font like Cronos Pro, when installed, confuses it to no end. You can select text and Cronos will result; but as soon as you click ANYWHERE on the text, or move the cursor across text, Word (for example) will freak out and the entire word will revert back to the previous typeface selected.\n\nI am guessing this has something to do with Word’s inability to handle OT fonts, and I wish I knew a solution. For now, my advice to others (and myself) has simply been to avoid using fonts like this until Office 2008 comes out.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152220im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/cronos_4151.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821152220im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/agaramond_3595.jpg)\n\n"
