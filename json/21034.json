For quite a while I have tried to read about fonts suitable for Biblical Hebrew and decided to buy Narkisim, after having read that Zvi Narkis was responsible for the Typography in the new Hebrew University Bible. The font has an impressive number of characters, but it does not appear to interact well with Indesign. In particular does it place tsere under nun completely wrong (see example in the attachment) in a text. When the nun is written alone with tsere it looks fine. I assume that the problem is connected automatic positioning in Indesign and would appreciate some suggestions on how to solve this. My questions are:\n\na) is there a way to turn off the incorrect \"automatic positioning\" or is the problem connected to something that I do wrong?  \nb) is there another font which works better with Indesign (I'm not particulatly fond of the Ezra SIL).\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nsefer\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [CS2ME.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810052550/http:/typophile.com/files/CS2ME.pdf) | 35.9 KB |\n\n",

As [this note](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810052550/http:/www.masterfont.co.il/web_articles_show_e.php?article_id=3) explains, you need open type for accurate placing of vowels. Masterfont says they have 50 open type fonts that are programmed to place nikud (vowel points) properly in Page Maker and InDesign. I have been using their Hadasa MFO which places nikud beautifully in InDesign.\n\nI bought mine at My Fonts, but I don't see the Masterfont open type fonts now on the My Fonts site. But you can contact [Masterfont](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810052550/http:/www.masterfont.co.il/), the publisher of Narkisim, directly. From what I read somewhere I think the font that Narkis did for the bible was a special one and not Narkisim.  \nYou will see that they have some English parts to their site, though not a lot. Just e-mail them in English and I'm sure they can help you.\n\nFontbit I have heard also has excellent open type fonts that place nikud correctly. You can contact them [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810052550/http:/www.fontbit.co.il/indexENG.html).\n\nIf you want to set the marks for chanting Torah also, you will have to ask for that, as that is more demanding again. Typophile John Hudson's SBL Hebrew, which is based on the Sefardic style, sets all marks beautifully and is available for free download from the Society for Biblical Literature [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810052550/http:/www.sbl-site.org/Resources/default.aspx).\n\n"

Secondly, I just wanted to say that I have always thought it strange that vowels are not always used in the Hebrew language. My heritage, being jewish, means that I have had many years to witness and realize that this is one language that can be sometimes cryptic, as the vowels may or may not be present. I suppose I really just don't understand why it is that the sacred Torah lacks such pronunciation clues, were as most books and such do contain them.\n\nI have read for many years, not recently, but, I did have a bar-mitzvah which I was required to recite a significant portion of scripture from the Torah. This was very difficult, as you must first learn to read the section with the vowels, and then remove them. Somewhat relying on memory, and even more so on my Rabbi standing next to me in case I stumbled over a word that I simply couldn't remember. Granted, I was reading this particular section to a group of about 100 or so people, so that didn't make it any easier for me.\n\nThere may have been a time when I knew the reason for the lack of the vowels in the torah, and their use in more everyday materials, but I just can't remember now. It is one thing to be able to read the language, another to be able to write it, and yet another to be able to understand and translate it. Personally, I was only fortunate enough to read it, and when studying specific sections, I would understand through the translations of my teachers. Today, I have to say that I have forgotten most of it, and really, I would be hard pressed to make even a meager attempt at reading anything with or without vowels.\n\n"

The Tiberian vowel system is a mediaeval development (c. 800-1000 AD\\*), applied to the Tanakh by the Masoretes. When you read the Torah aloud at your bar-mitzvah, you were actually reading a mediaeval, Masoretic pronunciation of the text, which is likely different in a number of ways from the way in which the text was pronounced when it was first written down using only consonants and matres lectiones (consonant letters used as vowels, just to make things even more confusing). The classic examples of an evident distinction between classical and Masoretic prounciation is the word Yerushalem. The ancient consonantal text has YRSHLM but the Masoretic text inserts two vowels between the L and M, because the pronunciation had changed from the classical -LEM to the contemporary -LAYIM. Because the consonantal text is sacred and cannot be modified, it cannot be changed to -LYM, so a basic rule of Hebrew orthography, that there can only be one vowel per consonant, is broken in order to maintain the consonantal text but also reflect the later pronunciation. The conventional way to write this is for the second vowel to sit under the right sight of the final M. Needless to say, this requires some special handling in fonts:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810052550im_/http:/typophile.com/files/yerushalaim_3657.gif)\n\nNote also that the Tiberian pointing system used for vowels by the Masoretes is only one of a number of vowel systems devised for Hebrew, although it is the only one still in current use. Other extant systems are the Palestinian and Babylonian, and the latter was in widespread use for some time. I know someone who is working on a proposal to encode the Babylonian pointing system in Unicode.\n\n\\* I use the BC AD dating system, rather than the relgiously neutral BCE CE system, because I am a Christian, and obviously believing what I believe about the person of Christ makes this an important reckoning for me. I mean no offense by this, especially not to my Jewish brothers in faith, and trust that people will mentally substitute whatever date reckoning system is important to them.\n\n"

I didn't know about the poems and teen works with nikud--why is that done?\n\nAlso as I understand it traditionally the vowel points were not used. The text of the Mishnah (finished c. 200) is originally not vowelled. So again native speakers did not ordinarily use vowel points. I don't know how far back they go. The Babylonians would have spoken Aramaic, and so likely would have needed vowel points so as not to mispronounce Hebrew words as Aramaic ones. As John says, the currently used system is relatively late as the history of Hebrew language goes.\n\nBy the way, John, I don't think it is correct to say that in classical Hebrew the yod and vav and hey used as vowels are simply for ease of reading--if that's what 'matres lectiones' means. They are there because they are part of the root of the word, and hence figure in conjugation as well as pronounciation. In other words they are there for essential grammmatical reasons. That's why in studying grammar you need traditional spelling plus vowel points.\n\nps. Matthew. One prime reason why most American Jews find the traditional Hebrew service crashingly boring is that they don't understand Hebrew--they only know how to pronounce it phonetically, which is not remotely the same experience. When late in life I learned enough Hebrew to actually understand the liturgy, I was astonished by the power of the language in the sacred texts.

Trying to mix Davkawriter, MS Word, and Tiff files sounds to me like a nightmare, but I may be wrong.\n\nA basic advantage of InDesign ME is that you have access to all the regular Hebrew fonts, and the InDesign's power as a layout program.\n\nI don't know enough to tell you what is the best way to go for your project, as I don't know the capacities of Davka writer as a layout program--eg whether it can place the TIFFs easily where you want them, which InDesign certainly can.\n\nAlso if you are going to have this printed offset, you have the important question of what files the printer can handle. With InDesign ME you can reliably export everything to PDF files, and the printer will be happy.\n\nAlso you might want to consider MS Publisher which will be a lot cheaper, is a lay-out program and I believe does Hebrew. I believe it doesn't have nearly the power of InDesign, but it may work for you, depending on your needs.\n\nMy suspicion is that you are going to want to dump DavkaWriter, but again the key questions are lay-out capacity and whether the files will work for the printer.\n\nHopefully, others who know more about the limitations of the different programs will come on and help you out.\n\n"

However, you will need a font in InDesign that supports nikud and teamey mikra. However, you will lose the kamatz katan and shva na when copying a pasting. The workaround for this is to do a search and replace in DavkaWriter for a kamatz katan and replace it with a different character that you are not using. I used this method successfully when typesetting the new Singer's Prayer Book recently published by HarperCollinsUK. The texts were all input on DavkaWriter and I typeset the siddur in Fontbit's Hadassa using InDesign CS2 ME.\n\n"

We also will be making the entire Tanach text available digitally so this could be used with other fonts that have been programmed according to this text.\n\nThe real problem is that in order to create a good positioning you need a text and every Tanach text is slightly different. So if you solve the problem of positioning for a particular word in one text, you will find that in another text of the Tanach, that word has different diacritics.\n\nBy making the Koren Bible text available digitally, this will mean that an accurate, proofread text (both for mistakes and trop positioning) will be available.\n\n"

I released v1.5 of the font this summer, which adds support for Dead Sea Scrolls transliteration, but does not significantly change any of the existing spacing or mark positioning, which I know need some more attention. In version 2.0, which has been in development for some time, I have revised the mark positioning approach and am adding contextual spacing lookups to improve the relationship of marks on adjacent letters. This is based on an analysis of letter and mark combinations in the Leningrad Codex, which is the most widely studied masoretic Bible text. It sounds like we are working in very similar ways, with different texts, and I agree with your comments about the need to have a complete text for good positioning.\n\nThe primary purpose of the SBL font is for use in scholarship, rather than in Bible publishing per se, and I'm conscious of the fact that much of the academic and publishing community that is funding the work and is the principle audience for the font is non-Jewish, and that there are some differences in the evolved conventions of typesetting the Biblical texts in different communities. I can imagine future versions of the SBL font tailored to the needs of particular communities, individual publishers and even specific texts.\n\n"
