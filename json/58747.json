The most similar I found based on these letters was [Eidetic Neo](http://web.archive.org/web/20121213111501/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/eidetic-neo/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D34%26w%3D600%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DCiencia.%2520Inovacao%25202010%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D26). I searched mainly keying on the C and a, using my [Serif ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20121213111501/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php). If there were more letters the search may have been more fruitful, but I tried every 'a' that might have been roughly similar. Other fonts that were close structurally, but not as similar by eyeball, were Fiona Serif, Rebecca Samuels and Veljovic.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Letters come in two layers. Here I separated the layers for the \"c cedilla\" and made it clear that the cedilla was never merged into the \"c\". Is a normal font likely to have such a free cedilla?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20121213111501im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ccedilla_4650.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "The whole thing looks rather lame to me. The /1/ especially needs a bigger head serif. My conclusion would be that the designer had to create the /ccedilla/ from the /c/ and the /cedilla/ because there wasn't a /ccedilla/ already in the font. To me this indicates a non-commercial font.\n\n"
