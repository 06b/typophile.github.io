But there are problems with using this font for Latin characters and I was wondering if there is something similar, but better that you know about.\n\nIt should be just as simple and have rounded terminals. I only need the uppercase letters.\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090413032202im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_sample_4765.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font\\_sample.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090413032202/http:/typophile.com/files/font_sample.png) | 15.31 KB |\n\n",
