Is this a per-file setting that will keep coming back in old files? Is it supposed to be on by default? Is there a way to make sure that it never, ever comes on?\n\n",

You might want to learn some keys first -- try them at random, 'cause I'm not at work, behind the 'good' computer.  \nThere are keys to toggle smart and dumb quotes translation, and to insert both the single and double straight quote. Try combinations of Alt, Shift, and Ctrl (prob. Cmd on the Mac) with the Quote key and the '[' and ']' keys.\n\nIf pressing keys at random fails, look them up in the Keyboard Shortcut Editor (under the Edit menu). The fastest way to find what you need is simply hitting the Show Set button. This will create a plain text document, and open it automatically in your plain text editor. Use the Find command there to find what you need.\n\n"
