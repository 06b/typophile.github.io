The crossbar on the \"e\" doesn't connect on the left (like Banjoman) and the \"g\" has a number 8 appearance (sort of like Al Koch Antiqua and Locarno - only connected). Long ascenders (like Bernadette and University Roman) and a large bowl on the \"a\"(exaggerated, resembling Kabel).\n\nAttached is a larger sample.
