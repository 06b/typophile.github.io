Do people have any favorites?\n\nI’m not talking anything fancy or gnarly - just simple - something rather than helvetica or myriad. This is the first website I’ve designed myself and I’m literally melting down about the type usage.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ Tironian et and viz](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706222954/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35095 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Stationery content typeface ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706222954/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35276 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
