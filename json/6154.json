It is a reliable face, given our printing conditions, but body copy is the only use it is worth for, as when set bigger than 16 pt it looks, well, weird. However I would like to set some pull quotes/leads in a serif face so I'm looking for a font which would be close in its characterics to Nimrod yet a little more sophisticated, so that it could be used for body copy, and also for nicelooking pull quotes in 25 pt. Or should I introduce a second face? Or perhaps a family with book/display sets? PS. Other faces used in the mag are Interstate (headlines/pullquotes/leads) and Syntax (small sansserif body text)\n\n",

Paul Luna of the Oxford dictionaries loves it.   \nAnd as far as I'm concerned it looks weird at large sizes _because_ it's a \"real\" text face!   \n   \nWould you be interested in commissioning a display cut of Nimrod? That would really be ideal.   \nOtherwise try looking into Scotch faces that are narrow and have high stroke contrast.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

That would really be ideal.   \n---------   \nHehe, I wonder how much that would cost.... not that I could afford that anyway - our boss still thinks that serious investing in quality design is a futile thing to do - just curious.   \n   \nAnyway, both Utopia and Hercules seem alluring, but I can afford only one of them. And with that comes another question: how do you determine if a textface is appropriate for a particular task, if you don't have a chance to see it set in a large text block together with other faces you intend to use? In my experience a test line of a font may seem rather good, but when I set it in the particular page, columns and all, for one reason or another it simply doesn't work. Is there a way to know it beforehand? Does this kind of knowing come with education or experience (I don't have much of either), with intricate knowledge about the letterforms? Or do we all just kind of make a 'blind shot' and see what we get?\n\n"
