  "content": "Hi All,\n\nDoes anyone know where I can get hold of the European Estimated Symbol (the little 'e')? (I'm aware it's easy to get on the PC but I'm only on Mac) and I can get it on my Mac OSX system i.e. in TextEdit, but the symbol won't appear in Illustrator or Quark; ideally I need to get the symbol as outline in a vector EPS format.\n\nDoes anyone know where I can get one from? I've Googled it and it's not proved helpful... I'm tearing out my hair on this one!\n\nThanks,\n\nSi\n\n",
