I am a student in New Zealand,   \nand we have been charged with a brief -   \nto brand NZ. I am, naturally, taking a typogra-   \nphic approach. I woner if any of you typophiles   \nhave been to NZ, or know any thing about it?   \nIf so, what strikes you as being quintessent-   \nially kiwi typefaces? Thank you, keep up the   \ndebate. (We students learn quite a lot from   \nthese ramblings)\n\n",
