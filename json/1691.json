  "content": "\\>\\> having a full-fledged off-topic forum on Typophile is not a good idea.   \n-- hhp, from the Definition of Terrorism thread.   \n   \nI think it remains to be seen whether the non-typographic   \nthread is useful or not, whether it'll turn out good, bad or   \nugly. Formalized venting is one way to describe it, but not   \nthe only way.   \n   \nIt hasn't really been tested.   \n   \nOf course it seems like a useful place to share an off-topic   \nlink, a news item, lawyer jokes, Bengal Tiger sightings, etc.   \nThis stuff is getting tossed into General Discussions.   \nThis is just a more specific place to toss it.   \n   \nFocus, that's your mantra Hrant, if i'm not mistaken.   \n   \nDoes organizing a library by subject compartmentalize discourse?...   \n   \nWhy not just have one big general thread   \nand call it Stuff about Letters; that'll contribute to   \nmaking us all rounded people I suppose.   \n   \nThe thread also serves as a spillover area when things veer   \noff topic and turn ugly. Who wants Hrant v. William   \nname-calling in their InBox? I know I know, we haven't   \nseen ugly.   \n   \nTo say that the existence and usage of a little thread in an   \nonline forum makes us less-rounded people?... autobrainwashing?...c'mon.   \n   \nbj\n\n",
