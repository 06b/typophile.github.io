      "content": "Aha! Also, many thanks for the tidbit of the aka name Oscar. It was originally an Aldo Novarese design! I just knew it was good!  \nI saw it used as the caption font on the Fox News late night comedy chat show \"Red Eye\", The shots I took off the tv screen are here:  \n [http://www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021224758/http:/www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont1.jpg \"http://www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont1.jpg\")  \n [http://www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021224758/http:/www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont2.jpg \"http://www.dazeofourlives.com/CaptionFont2.jpg\")\n\nNo shots of the lower case, but when I saw that used in the tv show's captions it only served to make me more interested to find out what font it was.\n\nAgain - thank you Mark!\n\n"
