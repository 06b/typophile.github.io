  "content": "Hi, I am having a nightmare job trying to identify the font used to design these logos. I am trying to re-make a copy of 1 of these logos so that vinyl cutting software can vector the image properly (at the moment the software goes a bit haywire and doesnt trace the image correctly)  \nThe logo was originally designed by a friend, but I am currently unable to get a hold of him to ask him what the font is, so if anybody can identify the font it would be very much appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823032846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/adrenaline%20stompers%20logos_5778.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823032846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo1%20(3)_6311.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [adrenaline stompers logos.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823032846/http:/typophile.com/files/adrenaline%20stompers%20logos.jpg) | 60.73 KB |\n| [logo2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140823032846/http:/typophile.com/files/logo2_2.png) | 136.3 KB |\n\n",
