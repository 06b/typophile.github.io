This probably has more to do with marketing decisions than with any instrinsic merits the design has. Fette Fraktur is a very 19th Century Fraktur. It has been described by some as \"Victorian,\" even though it was designed before the Victorian-era (and in Germany instead of Britain). Others have described it as Neo-Classical or Romantic (in the sense of 19th Music and Art forms, not necessarially in that other romantic sense, i.e., love).\n\nFette Fraktur is probably bestly described as a Fat Face variant on the Fraktur theme. Hey, fat face worked _so_ well for Didones…\n\nFette Fraktur was first released sometime before 1842 by [Joh. Peter Nees & Company](http://web.archive.org/web/20150107165340/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Joh.%20Peter%20Nees%20%2526%20Company) in Offenbach, Germany. The foundry was later purchased by the Ruhard'sche Gießerei, which during the early 20th Century because the [Klingspor](http://web.archive.org/web/20150107165340/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor) foundry.\n\nKlingspor was absorbed into the [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150107165340/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) by the 1950s. Stempel converted Fette Fraktur into a photosetting face, which was later converted into a digital font. This digital font was part of a very popular bundle that Linotype and its partners (including Adobe) distributed during the 1980s and 90s.\n\n[Linotype Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20150107165340/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype%20Library) now sells Fette Fraktur via its website, amoung other places.\n\n",
