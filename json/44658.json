  "content": "Hi eveybody,\n\nI´m trying to learn how to use this page at the moment but the reason that have been taken me to write you is because i´m trying to find the best typeface to represente John Ruskin Gallery in Cambridge School of Art,\n\nI was thinking to bring up the connotations from the Art & Crafts Movement with William Morris influences as well. I´m not sure whether i should be using Calligraphy or Lynotype. The sign for the Gallery is going to have Ruskin Gallery written on it but as well I´m thinking to create a symbol with just R G in a circle to be recognised by all the viewers\n\nLooking forward to hear your comments!  \nKind regards\n\n",
