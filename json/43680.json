(it’s like finding out how many words/characters there are before Microsoft Word was invented LOL)\n\nANyway, is there a good tutorial on how to do this on the net somewhere?\n\nPerhaps with pictures.. easy to understand..\n\nMy book doesnt explain it very well, and my class is hybrid format and i dont really have a teacher..\n\nHere’s what the assignment says..\n\n“Comping - Due- April 2\n\nLine Length = 36 picas  \nComp Garamond; 60 pts; uppercase  \nComp the paragraph on Page 28 as 12/18”\n\nwe got some tracing paper and this transparency-ruler thing with points, inches, and picas on it...\n\nand this part in my book says...  \n“When comping text type, you need only suggest the lines of type, not render each individual word.. “\n\nand then for Comping Display Type... it says..  \n“When comping display type, you must carefully trace each letter so the copy is readable and the typeface is recognizable.. “\n\nIt’s apparently an old way of doing something that became obsolite after computers were invented..\n\nbut i cant find ANY info about it on the net at all \\>\\_\\<\n\nThanks ^^\n\n [‹ sans serif to combine with Plantin](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001156/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43669 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sumner Stone slashed his prices. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001156/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43579 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
