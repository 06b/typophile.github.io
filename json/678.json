Don't let Kent fool   \nyou, he's younger than his typographic knowledge indicates.   \n   \nBTW, question 35 was much more difficult as they presented   \nsome of the designer's older, more obscure faces.   \n   \nCan we get Kent to upload the original pics?\n\n"

Lots of groans and fun hints. My cropdusting of gray hairs was no help whatsoever. It's not an age thing: it's a matter of keeping lots of unrelated information available for output at the proper moment. It should also be obvious that a bit of knowledge of the local typo scene is needed. It's time to start studying up on the Bay Area!   \n   \nI managed to get only one right:   \n   \n_18. Who is the man in this picture?_    \n   \nMy answer: the one on the left!\n\n"

In the end, they all wound up in Allan's lap and he was responsible for the final cut. (I just counted: twelve of the finals were mine.) He put together the PowerPoint presentation, which I reviewed and offered a few corrections and suggestions. Then I created the printed questionnaire form. We met for about ten minutes Friday night to coordinate the presentation. It was fun.   \n   \nI'd have to do screenshots from the PowerPoint presentation, which I still have a copy of. But I don't have PowerPoint (I reviewed the presentation on a client's system.) I'll see if I can come up with the images for you.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

No offense, I hope.   \n   \nKeith -- In restrospect, I agree, the quiz may have been a little obscure. What can I say? I'm an old fogey deep down inside -- (just ask Tiffany ;-)   \n   \nIn my defense, I think only three of mine were truly obscure. Well, and that #16 was pretty challenging; I think we should have scored partial points on that one.   \n   \nWe'll just have to see what Will and Allan come up with for next year. But you might want to start keeping copies of Lawson and Bringhurst on your nightstand for bedtime reading. ;-)   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

I really noticed that driving thru Northern Minnesota, visiting OLD NAVY, retail America with retro scripts from House and Font Diner, and the conservative press with fonts from HTF and the Bureau. And the Book Center exhibit on Bruce Rogers, I mean, imagine going to a software conference and there's a party in the Turing museum.   \n   \nStephen, is your hair starting to thin...? Perhaps you will do better next year.\n\n"
