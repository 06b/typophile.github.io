      "content": "According to Wikipedia, FF DIN is (also) classified as a [realist sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225952/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FF_DIN). This type of sans-serif falls somewhere in between humanist and geometric sans-serif typefaces. The humanist sans shows strong influences of handwriting, so there is considerable stroke contrast, and the glyph shapes are based on those of Venetian or Garalde old-style typefaces. [Optima](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225952/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/optima_pro_roman/ot_ps?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=60&sample_text=GKMQabeltuy&ft=liga) is one of the best known humanist sans-serif typefaces. The geometric sans, by contrast, relies heavily on “geometric shapes, like near-perfect circle and square” (Wikipedia), i.e. the letters are rather constructed than handwritten, and display little stroke contrast. [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225952/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/futura_pro_book/opentype_cff/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=60&sample_text=GKMQabeltuy&ft=liga&acs_pt=32) is a prime example of that. FF DIN and your work are not quite as rigid as that, but also straighter in appearance than a humanist sans, so that’s why I’d call them realist (or neo-grotesque, an alternative term if you like that better ;).\n\n"

      "content": "@ R.: You’re right =)  \nI was confusing the tags of FF DIN in MyFonts with possible classifications (my bad) … so there **is** something between humanist and geometric, that’s fascinating, i’ve seen myself confronted with a choice between those two. Unfortunately my teacher was a little old school, so he only taught us the [DIN 16518](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225952/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_16518) classification, according to which the font would simply be called group 6: sans serif linear antiqua (Gruppe VI: Serifenlose Linear-Antiqua in german).  \nWould it be silly to ask you about a more adequate system to classify fonts (may be with a source of some kind)?\n\n"

On her [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225952/http:/kupferschrift.de/cms/tag/classification/) she has published a number of posts about various classification systems (some in German, but that doesn’t seem to be a problem for you). I have not read all of them, but she probably also makes mention of the [Vox-ATypI classification](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225952/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox-ATypI_classification) according to which FF DIN would be a neo-grotesque (or a realist sans). I like that one.\n\nAnd by the way: good look with your first typeface! :)\n\n"
