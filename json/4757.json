Look at a metalic orange or floursanent color. I like 3 if you could imply motion better. Gradients in the archs, or dividing the arcs so pieces go from apart to solid. Good solid work your not far away.\n\n"

It's still very effective, though, particularly with that nice marque.   \n   \nPerhaps this is a regionally biased viewpoint, but where I live currently (in the US), orange is the \"universal colour\" to represent construction\n\n"
