Most often, these two forms are intermingled.  \nDo you know [Spatium issue Nº 5; ‘hamburgefonts’](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222214638/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30378)?\n\n<cite>to market typography</cite>  \nThat is, (new) typeface designs?

      "content": "Hi Florian, I have mostly design-based brochures now and was looking for something a little different so I thought of type designers. Thanks for the jpgs, however I’d consider them less what I’m looking for. I need to show examples of non-traditional (not 6-panel, two-fold) brochures and thought ’how would a type designer market themselves?’ The book I’m working on is more geared for the small business owner, and I was hoping some of those who frequent this site might have examples they use for marketing their services.\n\nAnd yes, it’s more about print brochures than specimens. However I think some of the the things “Emigre” did early on are interesting. I’m looking for non-traditional thinking. For example, one of the designs I’ve gotten is assembled with a rivet and looks more like how a Pantone swatch book is assembled. I’m looking for anything BUT the two-fold, six panel brochure that fits into a #10 envelope. And what better way to expose a non-designer to typography??!!\n\nThanks.  \nMarj Crum\n\n"
