I have found the latter two of particular interest:\n\n[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/warpwoof1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100119161558/http:/www.stonetypefoundry.com/warpwoof1.html \"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/warpwoof1.html\")\n\n[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/letterslost1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100119161558/http:/www.stonetypefoundry.com/letterslost1.html \"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/letterslost1.html\")\n\nOne of the most interesting facet in both writings is Stone's growing concern towards pre-Roman letter shapes, an unlikely approach in today's typography, I guess.\n\n",
