You can add an anchor point anywhere on a path (not just centered between the 2 closest points) and as many as you want.\n\n"

The stroke will reset to None but you’ll now have 4 individual lines instead of the 2 intersecting. Also, this will make them a temporary group, just un-group them before you delete the lines you want to remove.\n\nThen you can use the direct select (white arrow) to select the two end points you want to rejoin, and press Ctrl+J or Cmd+J on a MAC.\n\nIf this isn’t what you’re looking for, then I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking to do.
