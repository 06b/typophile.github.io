  "content": "ok. so i have made some pixelfonts in my days.   \nbut i still need to know one thing.   \nmac can use bitmap fonts without the vector curves. but can windows do the same?   \nso far, i believe not, but i'm a mac person.   \ni need to listen to a pc expert.   \nthis time around, i didn't bother to make the curves, only the pixels. (and it works just fine in mac)   \nand now people now want me to make a pc version.   \nis it really necessary to make the curves, or is there a way around this problem?   \nmaybe i ought to make curves anyway to make it flash compatible, but that is another discussion.   \n-martin (core)\n\n",
