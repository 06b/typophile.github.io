Reminds me of Trajan. I'm sure the N and R in a few instances are customized.\n\nJust wondering if this rings a bell for anyone.\n\nThanks all.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Friz Quadrata \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [DPape](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201938/http:/typophile.com/user/3945 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [fineartschamberplayerslogo.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201938/http:/typophile.com/files/fineartschamberplayerslogo.JPG) | 54.75 KB |\n\n",
