The [Jukebox](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232801/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jukebox) collection is a Veer product, seeing as [Jason Walcott](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232801/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jason%252BWalcott) produces new typefaces under contract to us specifically for Jukebox. Whether or not Jukebox can be considered a _hot foundry_ given the aforementioned criteria, is certainly a debatable point.\n\nPersonally, along with many of the foundries mentioned already, I’ve been finding the work of Neil, Silas, Dino & Co. over at [The Type Trust](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906232801/http:/www.typetrust.com/) as hot as anything on my radar.\n\n"
