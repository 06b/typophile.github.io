  "content": "I'm designing a logo for a natural toys and baby goods store, and the client has suggested that the type look \"folk-y\". When she says this, I take it to mean that a lot of their toys are handmade and in a traditional (but not necessarily retro) style. I've considered Old Century Schoolbook because it looks like old Dick and Jane books, but I think she's more interested in something a little more organic/hand drawn.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",
