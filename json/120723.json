  "content": "Hey there,\n\nSo... I've no idea why, but whenever I type \"/\" on my keyboard, when trying the font I'm designing, the slash doesn't appear. But then when I type \"/\" again, and it appears. So, every time I type \"/\" 2 times, only 1 \"/\" appears on my screen.\n\nIt happens in both FontLab preview and Illustrator. Any thoughts?\n\nPS:  \nSorry if somebody already posted this, I looked for another post with a solution but couldn't find anything.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

This necessitates \"//\" to mean \"this is not a delimiter, the following is not a glyph name, just put a slash here.\" Nothing is wrong with your font. I didn't know there was a similar feature in Illustrator, but there must be.\n\n"
