  "content": "Hi Everyone -  \ni am new to typophile and i hope you can give me some suggestions.  \nI am searching for some Sans Serif Families which can be an Alternate to Helvetica.  \nThey should have a thin or ultra/extralight/light version too.  \nTeh typeface should not look very humanistic - instead more straight! I already consider for example Akkurat/FF Din as Alternates, but i am not very satisfied.\n\nWould be thankful for every suggestion!  \nBest, Adam\n\n",
