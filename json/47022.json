The comment I hear most from my GD and AD colleagues is that many new type designs are so full of personality, they don’t allow the designer to instill their personality in the work they are doing. So they don’t use them.\n\n"

In past times, when type used to be expensive and dependent on availability, it made sense for a typesetter to carry fonts that could go the distance. Today, fonts are quite cheap and very easily available. designers and art directors still have loads of faces to choose from with minimal personality—far MORE than they EVER did. There surely is room for more vertical market type in our quick-turnaround world. I rather like the new face and applaud his efforts for pushing the boundaries a bit. Nobody is saying this is a book face or a newspaper face but I can see ad copy and some magazine pull-quotes done in it.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Or to put it another way, because there is nothing like this, it has a place!\n\n"

Not really low cost in relation to other type faces.\n\nThe lower cost of type in this sense I gather came in with the photo type you are referring to. And “low” really now means in comparison to what it would cost to hire a letterer to do the same job. I don’t know the going rates, but I am guessing that if you reuse the type at all, it would be cheaper than hiring a letterer.\n\n"

After all, every shop must be organized to get through the day... :-)\n\n"
