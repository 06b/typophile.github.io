I really wish that Apple would make a pen computer so that one wouldn’t have to resort to third-party hacks like the Axion ModBook.\n\nIf the question comes down to doing actual “design”, then the big winner would be graph paper and a #2 pencil or my fountain pens (I usually carry either a Sheaffer Agio w/ 0.8mm italic nib ground for me by the nib meister of [www.pendemonium.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070717214948/http:/www.pendemonium.com/ \"www.pendemonium.com\") or an Esterbrook LJ w/ a 9312 medium italic nib) —- it’s production which gets done on the computer, though I have done roughs and tight comps on pen computers ranging from my Newton MessagePad through an NCR-3125 up to my Stylistic (I usually use ArtRage for that, though sometimes I’ll use FutureWave’s SmartSketch).\n\nWilliam\n\n"

Well it’s all happening, and along with the multi-touch display that MS and Apple are using, this Cintiq item completes the puzzle. All I need is for it to be sized about 40” wide and 30” high and set at a slight angle on legs. Most of this is now built into the shipping iPhone, so it’s just a matter of scale, processing power, and display technology.\n\nShort answer: Wait a few months and they will, is my prediction.\n\n"
