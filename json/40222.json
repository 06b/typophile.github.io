Fedra Serif, for example, would be a good candidate for small sizes.\n\nIf this is a reference like a dictionary or timetable, where one is looking up specific information, and only reading a short bit of it, then a sans may be OK.\n\n"

      "content": "For best legibility, stay with serif. The best legibility at 9pt, in my experience, is ITC Stone Serif with oldstyle figures (available from ITC, not Adobe). Also, Sabon, though its x-height is not as big. Stone Serif is a stupendous three-weight workhorse that is not over-exposed. Also, look at Freight Serif, Bitstream Arrus, Celeste, Haarlemmer, Stempel Garamond, and Warnock.\n\n"
