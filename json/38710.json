  "content": "I've got a confession to make. A few days ago, I used Papyrus. I think it was the first time, and I've felt an inner turmoil ever since.\n\nPlease allow me to present the context. My kids needed to set a quick Halloween poem to give to a friend. I had all of 3 minutes to produce this thing, so I scanned through my font menu, and after trying a few other defaults that didn't feel spooky enough, I settled on Papyrus. Who was going to know? Problem was, the client (Isaac and Naomi, ages 6 and 4) loved it.\n\nAs a parent, I let my children down. Hopefully this won't be the pivotal experience that leads them down a pathway of Hobo and Comic Sans for the rest of their days. As a member (note convenient omission of \"founder\" here) of Typophile, I've let all of you down and disappointed myself as well.\n\nIs there redemption for a font sin? Will it be possible to regain my inner peace? Is there some sort of penance I could do, perhaps buy an H&FJ font family or something?\n\nI humbly await your judgement.\n\n",
