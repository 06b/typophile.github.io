See for example the revivals by Spiece Graphics as Edison Swirl [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102438/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/\") and by HiH as Edison [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edison/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102438/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edison/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edison/\")  \nThe \\_P\\_ and \\_H\\_ in your image look like modified versions of the \\_P\\_ and \\_H\\_ in Houghton.  \nDon\n\n"

I needed the font because one of my customers uses this font for a logo, but they never had any core files of the logo when it was designed back in te days.\n\nSo this helps me a lot! thanks.\n\n"

Earlier ones include John cummings Kismet from 1879 [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kismet/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102438/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kismet/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kismet/\")  \nDon\n\n"
