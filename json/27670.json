  "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am currently in the market for a new scanner. The reviews at online shops haven't really been helping me much because I am not really sure where my standards should be set. Ultimately I want to be able to scan photos, patterns and textures for design projects as well as font sketches for typeface development.\n\nI was interested in the Microtek s400, but then I read some reviews that called it slow and one even said that it doesn't work with Mac OSX.\n\nDoes anyone out there have any advice on what I should be looking for? What do you use? How do you like it? How much should I expect to spend? Do certain brands work better with Macs and Adobe CS?\n\nI really appreciate any advice or guidance you may have,\n\nDuncan Robertson\n\n",

Many scanners bundle software with scanners that is buggy, and if it does work they may not support it so it may not work with the next OS upgrade.\n\nSilverFast is very powerful and can make the best of a lower end scanner IMO.\n\n"

For now I am using the \"Vendor Code\" along with Photoshop and my test scans are nice and clear.\n\nI looked into it and SilverFast is available for the s400. Based on jupiterboy's opinion and other reviews I read online I am planning to buy SilverFast in the near future. Sounds like that should prevent software problems in the future and it should help me avoid \"buggy\" bundled software issues.\n\nThank you for your help. I'll definitely post updates if I run into any note-worthy problems or magnificent revelations.\n\nDuncan\n\n"

SilverFast allows you to do all your correction that you might do in photoshop directly in the scan. With some practice you will be able to get as much dynamic range as you possibly can out of your hardware. Yes, it completely replaces the native software, comes with custom transforms for your scanner and interfaces with photoshop. It also has little how-to videos that can be activated at various stages to help on the learning curve.\n\n[http://www.whitecube.com/html/artists/gig/gig\\_frset.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130215013852/http:/www.whitecube.com/html/artists/gig/gig_frset.html \"http://www.whitecube.com/html/artists/gig/gig\\_frset.html\")\n\n"
