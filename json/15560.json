Another new favorite of ours that we’d like to acquaint you with is the Bodebeck™ typeface, a re-cutting of timeless English lettering styles. Additionally this month, we are proud to introduce over 250 new East Asian fonts that have entered our library; these include fonts for the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages/writing systems. Rounding out this month’s report is information about our new magazine; published from time to time, the Linotype Matrix will keep you informed about the most up-to-date design trends, and how typefaces fit into them…\n\nHave fonts of fun; view the complete LinoLetter [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808144739/http:/www.linotype.com/8-38-8-18953/issue200510.html)!\n\n",
