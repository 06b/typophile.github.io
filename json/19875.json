Trying to contain their glee, they said I needed to say it louder. So I did. When the puzzled look on my face indicated I still was clueless, they said I need to almost yell it. I think I got it after that.\n\nNow when I do something stupid, I say \"Way to go, Sofa King!\"\n\n(corrected with Samadam's help below)\n\n"

It is a beautiful site, i love the logo, the navigation style of scrolling to the right, the coat of arms, the Citgo, everything. Nice work.\n\nAnd by the way, fontplayer, it would have been better to say:  \nI am Sofa King  \n_We_ Todd did.  \nMakes more sense syntactically and sounds better.\n\n"
