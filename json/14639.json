  "content": "Hey everybody,\n\nMy name is Andy Welfle, and I am a writer/amatuer designer. I have a question for the Masters…\n\nWhen I am picking out a typeface, I like to see my options. I like to see a sample of text in Myriad, Frutiger, Utopia, etc., all next to each other.\n\nI downloaded a demo of a program called FontTasteTester for Mac, but it expired (and being a cheapskate, I don’t want to renew it…). It was also for the old OS.\n\nCan anyone recommend a freeware program for Mac OS X that can display a chosen phrase or word in list form all the fonts available?\n\nThanks for your help, I look forward to posting more often!\n\n",

      "content": "You really should say what your “this” is, but it’s FontExplorer, and a bit heavy of a program for his purposes. Although, if he needs all that functionality, it is useful. They have a [Free PC Version](http://web.archive.org/web/20051122170856/http:/www.linotype.com/freedownload/tools/fontexplorer/FontExplorer-Setup.exe) and [Free Mac Version](http://web.archive.org/web/20051122170856/http:/www.linotype.com/freedownload/tools/fontexplorer/FontExplorer.sit) but at about 180 Mb each, it’s a pretty big program. A smaller program, only 658k, is a free version of Advanced Font Viewer called [Easy Font Viewer](http://web.archive.org/web/20051122170856/http:/www.styopkin.com/details_free_and_easy_fonts_viewer.html). Still, I prefer [Advanced Font Viewer](http://web.archive.org/web/20051122170856/http:/www.styopkin.com/details_advanced_fonts_viewer.html) and it is still small but powerful. It’s main feature is just what he’s looking for. A text box to type in the text you want to show in a particular font, and then a window that shows that text in all your fonts, listed neatly and quickly.\n\n"
