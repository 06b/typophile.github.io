Which reminds me, where's the lowercase u?\n\nBut a gorgeous, highly legible font. I'm particularly fond of the jenson-y e and the tail on your a.\n\n--Jim K.\n\n"

      "content": "some things on first sight:\n\na: has a hangover to the left (top is a tad too long?)  \nd: bottom right slightly too short/small. is the same part of \"a\" bigger?  \ng: great :)  \nh, m, n: serifs too long? somehow they look strange  \nt: bar seems to be ok, i think it's a positioning problem between t/v  \nz: slightly too heavy? Stroke-weight too indifferent?\n\nO: seems to be a bit goofy in the bottom part (moved slightly too much to the right side?)\n\nBut overall, this looks very promising.\n\n"
