(Petrograd)   \n   \nI have a couple of weights and styles:   \n-Regular   \n-Bold   \n-Regular Osf   \n-Regular Monospaced   \n   \nThe problem is when I make the font files and   \nactivate them in ATM, only one weight/style   \nshows up in my programs.   \n   \nI have convinced myself that this is because   \nof the \"font info\" being entered in a wrong way.   \n   \nCan you help me with this? (if this is indeed   \nthe core of the problem)   \n   \nIn fontlab the info page looks like this:   \n   \nFamily Name:   \nWeight:   \nWidht:   \nStyle Name:   \nFont Name:   \nFull Name:   \nMenu Name:   \nFond Name:   \n   \nI just can't seem to figure this out correctly.   \nHow should I fill this out in the right way?   \n   \nThanks   \n   \nMagnus\n\n",
