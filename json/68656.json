  "content": "March 22, 2010\n\nDez Boulder is a Strong-Brewed OpenType display face with Multiple Personalities.\n\nDezcom Typefaces is proud to announce the release of \"Dez Boulder,\" a rock-on typeface with three personalities on display.\n\nThe Dez Boulder family of display faces acts in a supporting role to give meaning to message and context to content. It is a very bold face, not understated. Each of its three personalities (and their sub-personalities) have a different timbre to speak the nuance of your message in a bold voice. Dez Boulder works like a character actor, presenting the author’s lines but not with the deadpan delivery of a news reporter. Boulder develops the role, adding meaning through facial expression, gesture, and body language.\n\nA bold and character-rich display family in three personalities: ego, id, and alter, each with its own way of acting—Dez Boulder averages more than 800 glyphs per style with uppercase, lowercase, small caps, proportional lining figures, small cap figures, superiors, inferiors, fractions, stylistic sets, alternates, ordinals, case specific punctuation, and more. It has a full range of diacritics and covers all European languages using the Latin script.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [http://dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014015338/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/ \"http://dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/\")\n\n[http://dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/DezBoulderSpec.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014015338/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/DezBoulderSpec.pdf \"http://dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/DezBoulderSpec.pdf\")\n\nCopyright 2010 by Chris Lozos and Dezcom\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014015338im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dezBoulderDAM_550_6729.jpg)\n\n",
