It's a wedding . . . to the people involved, you can never try too hard.\n\nAlso, don't dumb down a good design just because everyone might not get it at first. Chances are that everyone will get it right away anyway, as they'll all know the bride&groom's names.\n\npenn\n\n"

As they 'join' in the circle to a unit, you cld nicely create the letters of two simmilar but differnt fonts, maybe..? showing a joint of two items. Just a thought.\n\n"
