I don't know what the process is today, but at one time it was all done by hand with some kind of pantographic engraving tool to transfer and reduce the artwork to the plates.   \n   \nSome of the letterforms on currency look like familiar typefaces (Copperplate, for example), so maybe they start from type in some cases.\n\n"
