  "content": "Keeping in mind I am not a type designer (AKA this might sound like a stupid question), and this may have been discussed in a previous thread…  \n ~~~~  \nOver dinner with an (ex)photographer friend of mine we got to talking about the various pricing models of stock photography companies — _that existed at the time he got out of the industry c 2004_ — and one of them was to the effect of “every time a customer wanted to use this photograph, the original photographer got a little bit of money.”\n\n**Questions** :  \n1. Does such a pricing model exist for typefaces companies?  \n2. What other pricing models are there? (not including web fonts)?  \n3. Who uses which model(s)?\n\nWith this info, it should be fairly simple to create an informative matrix.\n\nThis is just out of personal interest. Not for research, professional, &c.\n\n",
