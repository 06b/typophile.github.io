      "content": "I'm not certain, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was hand-lettering.  \nA few years back I had the opportunity to repackage the book the \"Anatomy of a Murder\" movie was based on. At the time, a design with [no resemblance](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043345/http:/images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/516H559HXKL._SL500_BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_OU01_AA240_SH20_.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Murder-Robert-Traver/dp/0312033567&h=240&w=240&sz=18&hl=en&start=14&um=1&usg=__qCGstDjzRmOkhFVlM9-OcWjhnPs=&tbnid=pakdg6cy51D5SM:&tbnh=110&tbnw=110&prev=/images%3Fq%3Danatomy%2Bof%2Ba%2Bmurder%2Bst.%2Bmartin%2527s%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den-us%26sa%3DN) to Saul Bass' iconic poster was in place. I pushed to revert back to using Saul Bass's iconic movie poster image [on the cover](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043345/http:/www.designrelated.com/portfolio/Karen/page/6/entry/6587/). And when I needed to add the \"#1 Bestseller\" line I found the font [Hatmaker](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043345/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/hatmaker/) to be the closest match I could find at the time. Not perfect--but a similar feel. (And [just for for fun](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043345/http:/www3.isrl.uiuc.edu/~unsworth/courses/bestsellers/images/A1319980216130350.jpg) here is the package for the first edition of the book back in 1958)\n\n"
