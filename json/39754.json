      "content": "The story on Jews and proselytizing is rather long and complicated, as with everything in this nearly 4000 year long history.\n\nHillel (about 30 BCE) said “Love all your fellow creatures and bring them near to the Torah.” This indicated a positive desire to convert others to Judaism. And the famous story of a non-Jew saying he would convert if Hillel could tell the whole Torah while standing on one foot also indicates a desire to proselytize. The statement in the New Testament about how far the Pharisees would go to make a convert is probably based on reality.\n\nThis changed with the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, when the Romans forbid Jews wfrom proselytizing, under pain of death. Though this situation changed, the precariousness of Jewish security did not, and the policy became not to proselytize, and to warn any potential convert of the difficult conditions for Jews—while welcoming converts as full Jews, if they still wanted to convert.\n\nThere it remained until after the holocaust and the establishment of the state of Israel. In Israel, with its tinderbox of religious conflict, I believe all proselytizing by any religion is forbidden. In the US it has been different. The US became very tolerant and accepting to Jews, and intermarriage has increased greatly. This is to the point where I have read that in the US there will soon be as many people with one Jewish parent as two.\n\nIn response to this situation, in 1978 the then head of the Reform movement, the late Alexander Schindler, changed this traditional policy and urged “outreach” to the spouses of Jews, inviting them to learn more about Judaism, with bring them close to Judaism, and converting more of them. The invitation was also out to anyone not associated with a religious movement.\n\nSo it is still true that Jews will not approach anyone who has another religious affiliation about converting, but the invitation is there to others by the Reform movement.\n\nThere is an umbrella organization dealing with these issues, [The Jewish Outreach Institute.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143124/http:/joi.org/)\n\n"

Hence I find proselytizing basically abhorrent, whether it is to increase one’s numbers, to spread one’s word, or to tame the savages.\n\nIt was shocking to travel to a remote village in Guatemala and see an enormous Seventh Day Adventist church that dwarfed every other building in the town. Heartening, in another village in Chiapas, Mexico, to learn that the Mayans had ejected the bishop and basically taken over the church for their indigenous religious rituals, into which they incorporated the left-behind saint figures, along with rose petals, incense, and soda bottles.\n\n"

Or wear wigs, or be lashed for being the victim of a gang rape. Or have to shave their head and go live in a cloister after their husband dies. I judge these religious practices from what I consider a universal moral and ethical standpoint, not from the standpoint that my religion is any better or morally superior.\n\nMost of these barbaric practices stem from the idea that women pose a threat — that if women are not mutilated, hidden away, de-sexed, or worse that men will not be able to control themselves. This is a pretty curious state of affairs, don’t you think?\n\n"

I was just using some of the vehement language—though a lot milder than what is actually said—to get across that this is a real life issue now, around the world, that people feel very strongly about, and are very divided on.\n\nI don’t agree with the anti-feminists, but my point is that relativism doesn’t get you anywhere in having a respectful discussion with those you disagree with on ethical principles.\n\nI do think you can get somewhere if you start with the premise that that are some universal principles, but we can’t be so certain about what they are in detail. We need to look not only what is declared, but what the consequences of beliefs are for the welfare or misery of society. If we can start by agreeing on that as some kind of test, then we can discuss with those we disagree with. But that’s not relativism.\n\nSome views are truer than others, but we can’t be so sure we are in possession of the truth, and the other person is wrong. It may be the other way round. That kind of humility is the best basis of tolerance, not relativism, in my view.\n\n"

Those who want in one way or another to impose their religious beliefs on the rest of the nation—such as by kicking the teaching of evolution out of the schools—are significant minority, but still a minority nationwide.\n\nBut imposition of views, and arguing for them are two different things. If a Christian wants to proselytize me, it doesn’t bother me so long as I can proselytize him back and point out the error of his ways. But at that point for some reason they always lose interest in talking about religion :)\n\nps (edit)\n\nAccording to [this poll in 2004](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143124/http:/www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/22/opinion/polls/main657083.shtml) a majority of Americans reject evolution (depressing), but do not want to kick teaching of it out of the schools (encouraging). Only about a quarter want it booted out of the schools, it seems. According to [another poll in 2000](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143124/http:/www.commondreams.org/news2000/0310-02.htm) that tried to get deeper in to people’s attitudes, about 20% wanted to kick evolution out of the schools.

Adam Goldberg stars as Mordechai Jefferson Carver, also known as the Hebrew Hammer, a private detective who has an overbearing mother (Nora Dunn) and a propensity to whine when things get difficult. He is hired by Bloomenbergensteinthal (Peter Coyote), chief of the Jewish Justice League, to prevent Damian Claus (Andy Dick) from killing Hanukkah. The Semitic Stallion seeks out help in the form of the Kwanzaa Liberation Front, headed by Mohammed Ali (Mario Van Peebles in a great afro), while also falling for the JJL chief’s daughter, Esther (Judy Greer). Damian, who has his father brutally murdered by reindeer, Santa (Richard Riehle), is supported by his right-hand man, low-grade hood Tiny Tim (Sean Whalen). It’s hard to tell which side Jamal is on—but this foul-mouthed decadent elf is played by Tony Cox, who handles a similar role in the later BAD SANTA.

He portrayed Stalin and his circle not only as unbelievably brutal, and devoted to brutality, but also as driven by the dogmatic conviction of the “true believer”. The whole lot of them—30 or so of the inner circle—believed that they could get heaven on earth if they just killed enough people. The ’true believer’ aspect explains how many behaved in the show trials, which otherwise is inexplicable.

I want to give you a reason why you may be able to come to term with their actions as well. For Jews who accept “the Code of Jewish Law”, you cannot destroy any writings which are “holy”. Vavina, that means jews will keep all the holy writings and never throw any of them out. Sometimes they are kept in a room called a “geniza” or sometimes they are buried. There are differing opinions on when writings become “holy”. One opinion is the moment the ink hits the paper and it spells out “holy” writings its considered holy. The other opinion is that writing only becomes “holy” when it is read and used for a “holy” purpose. I think the typophiles can think about that typo-philosophy during this holiday (what side are you?) Anyways, Chabad believes that although there may be some risk that someone would mess with the “holy” writings. The sad state of american jews being lost to our family through apathy and ignorance is so great that they send and give these out in hopes that it will make a difference. If you dont use their menorah and prayer box, then you can rely on the second opinion - it is not holy at all. Just throw it away, or maybe give it to someone who might want it, and make it holy.\n\nhappy Hannukah!\n\n"

This key idea was that the truth is obvious, and that only prejudice, which blinds us, prevents us from seeing it. (You can read the fuller story in Popper’s essay “On the sources of knowledge and ignorance” in his book “Conjectures and Refutations”.)\n\nThe sources of prejudice were past authorities, both religious authorities and the ancient Greeks. Bacon’s idea that rejecting the past was the key to a brighter future help liberate thinkers to criticize past ideas, and that in many ways was hugely positive. It helped lead to modern science and liberal democracy. And it was a key ingredient in the tolerant “age of reason” in the 18th century.\n\nHowever, there is a small problem: the truth is not obvious, and human beings are highly fallible. What happened is that whatever seemed ’rational’ to a thinker was held as obvious, and everyone who disagreed was an enemy of progress. This arrogant version of rationalism became prominent beginning with Rousseau, and cut a bloody swath through history, beginning with the reign of terror in the French revolution. The persecutions in the French revolution were not exactly atheist, as most of them were deists. But they were definitely against traditional religion and violently anti-clerical. Later, with Marx, the idea became a militant atheism: that defeating religion, the “opiate of the masses” was essential to the progress of humanity. So atheism part of an aggressive, and in some hands, such as Stalin’s, a violent ideology.\n\nThe story is told most extensively, I believe, by Jacob L. Talmon, in the “Origins of Totalitarian Democracy.” I haven’t read that book, but I looked at it a long time ago, and believe it tells the story most directly.\n\n"

I had been baffled when one wing of the movement insisted that the late Rebbe was the messiah. It seemed to me that something must have gone very wrong in the movement for some followers to adopt such a view, which seems to me alien to Judaism.\n\nI had known that the founder of Chabad put study and learning back into Chassidism. In the wikipedia article it says further than he explicitly rejected the idea that a ’rebbe’ was an intermediary between a follower and God. This authoritarian element in Chassidism always struck me as its worst feature, and I was happy to read about what the founder of the movement had done.\n\nHowever, that late Rabbi Schneerson explicitly rejected the views of the founder, according to the article, and saw himself as having better access to God than his followers. Personally, I think that ridding Judaism of priests was was of the best things that happened to it, and putting back this authoritarian element is really a backward step. Since it is Chanukah, it is good to remember that it was the Priests who wanted to turn Jerusalem into a Greek city, and betrayed the Torah.\n\nWe already had our reformation, so to speak, in the rise and dominance of Rabbinic Judaism over the priestly cult of the Temple.

However, the positing of ’science’ in place of God as a source of certainty is “positivism” as defined by August Compte and as taken up by Marx. And positivism is a doctrine that has atheism as an key component. The key sin in my view is not theism or atheism, but rather being so certain you are right that it gives you license to kill. That’s fanaticism.\n\nIf you want to detach atheism from doctrines that it has been part of, like Marxism-Leninism, that is fine by me. But then for consistency you have to do the same thing for theism, and then you can’t blame theism itself for any of the manifold sins of religious groups. Stalin killed in the name of a doctrine that had atheism as part of it. The Crusaders killed in the name of a doctrine that had God as part of it. God was crazy one excuse, and ’science’ another, for murdering innocents. But Hitchens’ views still go out the window, because the problem is fanaticism, not theism or atheism.\n\n"

Would you agree that “life goes on, _good_” is not really the proper way to face life’s hardship? These are his very words, not even within the context of “imagining” as Lennons’. Whatever is he insinuating? What is the lesson?\n\nAnother Lennon-song is _Come together_. No need to quote the full lyrics since it’s out there in plain sight. Does this make you feel he’s trying to convince you and others to “come together”, and doing so “right now”; ie doing things together at a given time, probably to do undiversified stuff as one!

A worker (or possibly Red Guard) crushes the crucifix, Buddha and classical Chinese texts with his hammer; 1967”\n\nAs the article explains, at least half a million people perished in the cultural revolution, which even involved cannibalism in some places. And this doesn’t include the huge number of suicides. This is a real and recent history in which anti-religious fervor was one important factor.\n\n\\>\\>stop trying to stomp everybody else out and make us “one.”  \n\\>O dear me is that the truly relevant lesson of Hannukah?\n\nNot the only one but yes, a relevant lesson, yes. Chanukah was about not being forced to be part of the Hellenistic culture. Hitchens—like the Emperor Antichocus back then—thinks that the Jews were backward enemies of enlightenment, and never should have rebelled. That would have saved the world from Judaism and its offspring, Christianity and Islam.\n\nThe interesting thing about Lennon was that he wrote songs with contradictory messages, all artistically quite wonderful. In ’Revolution’ he ridicules the know-nothing revolutionaries, singing “If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain’t gonna make it with anyone anyhow.” That was during the Cultural Revolution and there were a fair number of crack-pot sympathizers in London then—I know, I was there at the LSE then and met a few of those guys. Then he wrote “Power to the people,” a know-nothing revolutionary song if you ask me—and beautifully done. Then he has “Imagine,” his secular hymn to utopian socialism, almost as good as ’Amazing Grace.’ Great artist, politically naive and confused.\n\nps I think ’bra’ is McCartney’s attempt to sound like a Jamaican saying ’brother’.\n\n"

Even the good Jew—ok, not so faithful—Irving Berlin had to write ’White Christmas’ and Chanukah song.\n\nRecently Peter Yarrow of Peter Paul and Mary wrote a [really good Chanukah song](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012143124/http:/www.beliefnet.com/story/59/story_5948_1.html), though.
