  "content": "Hello. First off, this board has been very helpful!   \n   \nCan anyone identify the fonts below?   \n   \n1. I want to know what font \"Screaming For Change\" is written in.   \n   \n2. What font is \"Wishingwell\" and \"Records\" written in?   \n   \n3. What font is \"Side Two\" written in?   \n   \nThese look like very basic fonts so hopefully it will be a no-brainer for someone. I'm guessing the fonts are the same but just at different weights.   \n   \nThanks again,   \nSean O'Donnell ![Image of Uniform Choice labels](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524130224im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37841.jpg)\n\n",

I actually wondered if it was a fake.   \n   \nI still stand by my ID. Given that it was 1986, if it's actually a Helvetica knock-off, I think it could be Compugraphic's Helios which would still have been common then.\n\n"
