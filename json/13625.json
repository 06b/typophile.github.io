The ink is placed on the screen, and pulled evenly across by the squeegee. The ink is pushed through the fine mesh of the screen, but not through the mask, leaving an image on the surface below. The screen may be masked by a piece of plastic stencil, placed on top of the fabric. More commonly, however, the mask is created by a chemical filler that won't allow the ink to pass through. The filler may either be painted on by hand, or created with a light sensitive emulsion.\n\n",
