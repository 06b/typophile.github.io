Try [Modesto](http://web.archive.org/web/20120116065646/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/modesto), and if you want something spikier, maybe [Saracen](http://web.archive.org/web/20120116065646/http:/typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100022) will fit the bill.\n\nEDIT: And also, slightly off-topic, but thanks for being so descriptive of what you're looking for in your thread's title and first post.\n\n"
