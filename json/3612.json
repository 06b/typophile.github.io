  "content": "feels good to be back again. hi there :-)   \nI just finished a logotype that, oddly enough, was immediately accepted by the client. due to the tight turnaround time (1 week only prior to the lunch of a new computer shop), it wasn't until now that I could take a step back and ask for some help as far as the result is concerned. I guess the work could well take in a great deal of finetuning, but I was mainly interested in the overall personality of the logotype.   \n   \nthanks a lot.   \ngeorge // cellsius   \n   \n ![\\img {mill02.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203657im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28632.gif)}\n\n",

As it stands the \"I\"s are fighting with the \"L\"/\"N\" (which have somewhat too thick lower parts, btw).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "thanks, Hrant. I feel I should provide further details since there are no more takers around ...   \nMILENIUM is a computer brand going national and they want a fresh ID system based on a logotype bold enough to be cast into plastic for computer panel usage. Besides this, I was free to come up with whatever I felt fit, within such a short period of time. My personal chioce went towards an \"indesit\" uppercase - lowercase lettering, modern and relevant. instead of taking the obvious way (E, L uppercased and the rest lowercase)   \n ![\\img {mill01.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203657im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28658.gif)   \nthey chose to go with this unusual lowercase \"i\".   \nI fear it might lack that good obviousness that turns an obscure detail into a clever idea.   \n   \ngeorge\n\n"

      "content": "Lower Design a bit trendy looking. Before proceeeding- The questions to ask would be where they are at but where they want to be in 5 years, 10 years, etc..., the branding they do now should be \"current\" looking in 5 years+. Who is buying they equipment 30 year olds, gamers, execs, what is price point?   \nAssuming it ie all somewhere in the middle I would say the   \ntop type properly be best in say 5 years as well as cool enough for the current young audience.. The bottom is nice but that trend is on it's way out in my opinion. Less legible.   \nU, N and M's look nice. I works. The E needs work. L too.\n\n"
