Still suitable, though. I have no clue about which small caps face to use. I was thinking Apolline by Porchez, but I’d rather get some informed opinions before laying out the cash.\n\nGentium is here: [http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site\\_id=nrsi&item\\_id=Gentium](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122055529/http:/scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium \"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site\\_id=nrsi&item\\_id=Gentium\")\n\n [‹ \"Designing Type\" by Karen Cheng: A great book!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122055529/http:/typophile.com/node/20510 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [TrueType vs. OpenType ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122055529/http:/typophile.com/node/20474 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
