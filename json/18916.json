  "content": "A pretty standard yet unusual sansserif font was used on Spielberg's movie about the aftermath of the 1972 Olympic games.  \nAnyone knows what it is? I am looking for the font actually used in the film's title's, not on the poster.  \n- I have tried attaching a small gif or jpg many times but it doesn't work. Anyone interested, please have a look at the trailers here, the font is shown at the end: [http://www.moviemaze.de/media/trailer/2179/muenchen.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418010745/http:/www.moviemaze.de/media/trailer/2179/muenchen.html \"http://www.moviemaze.de/media/trailer/2179/muenchen.html\")\n\nThanks my dears.  \nElton\n\n",

This morning, however, it works fine.  \nAnyway- in response to all above:  \nThe first sample of MÜNCHEN as posted above is not original, it looks different in the original english version of MUNICH. So if that posted sample is the abominable Arial, it certainly is not what MUNICH used, and NOT what I am looking for.  \nIt certainly is not Akzidenz Grotesk, but you might be right with Chalet - and I am surprised, as the lower cases of this font are very ugly. Uppercase seems to work really well:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418010745im_/http:/typophile.com/files/munich.gif)\n\n"
