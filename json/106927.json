This one is hand drawn so I know it doesnt exist as a font but there may be something similar.\n\n",

Schuenemann worked for Central before Cleveland and while at Cleveland also cut some fonts for Central. Don't know if this includes Euclid. The Cleveland version was very a creative and ambitious effort that occupied 8 pages of the 1894 specimen book and included alternate capitals with sweeping swashes.  \nThe swash initials are captured in Ryoichi Tsunekawa's Great Victorian [http://dharmatype.com/dharma-type/great-victorian.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122202140/http:/dharmatype.com/dharma-type/great-victorian.html \"http://dharmatype.com/dharma-type/great-victorian.html\")  \nAnother version by Claude Pelletier [http://www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122202140/http:/www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font \"http://www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font\")  \nCopying competitors typefaces and using different names is nothing new. From Euclid @ Central&Cleveland and Templar @ Palmer&Rey in the 1880s to the current batch found by Ryuk the practice never ends.  \nBTW, a link to Sophie MF that does not require downloading an exe file: [http://www.fontyukle.net/en/DownLoad-Sophie+MF.ttf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122202140/http:/www.fontyukle.net/en/DownLoad-Sophie+MF.ttf \"http://www.fontyukle.net/en/DownLoad-Sophie+MF.ttf\")  \nDon\n\n"

Rick Mueller's Wish MF [1997] differs in detail from Nalle's font and may also be an original. Wedlock [1998] is definitely an original -- based on type purchased by Dan X.
