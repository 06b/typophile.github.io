The end result will be an 1-bit tiff that will print with clean lines. Some experimentation is needed to get the best reults.\n\n"

Where the pseudo-engraving goes across the eye for instance, a real illustrator would have drawn a line along the eyelid, and a circle for the iris. To improve the effect in Photoshop, it would be better to combine using the engraving filter on flat areas, but use Levels for high contrast in areas with linear detail.\n\n"
