Here is a FontLab example (ignore the horrible lumpiness), along with another idea on the left: instead of branching from the bottom of the initial stroke diagonally up and to the right, this one loops backwards.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122112706im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Picture1_5038.png)\n\nBy doing this looping, the arch can spring from a more “normal” midpoint of the first stroke, but the whole retains the feeling of a letter written without lifting the pen off the paper.\n\nThe question arises: does the loop form a teardrop shape that will be too spotty and distracting to work in continuous text. (I did move the right side of the straight stroke in at the bottom to mitigate the thickness a bit.\n\n",

This sort of thing seems to lend itself well to a humanist touch, but I’d love to see it done in a more machinated, geomtetric way. Not exactly sure what applications it could be used for — maybe captions or footnotes?\n\n"

You only know when you design the other letters.\n\nAs an example, look at the recent ’Rocky’ of Matthew Carter. I usually don’t like pointy ’a’s, but here the way he relates it to everything else—compare the c and r—makes it work beautifully on this display font. It might not work so well in a text font, being too sparkly, but here it gives a very agreeable and lively bite to headlines.\n\n"
