  "content": " **Sudtipos** proud to announce the release of **[Voyeur](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817200319/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000597#specimen)**\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817200319im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typovoyeur_5532.png)\n\nSince you like to look, Angel Koziupa and Alejandro Paul bring you Voyeur, an entirely different direction from their usual collaborations. This typeface attracts two opposite design theories by mixing bold and blocky modernism with delicate ornamentals. The unlikely mix is not haphazard, however. It is calculated with an alchemist's (or voyeur's) attention to detail. This font includes many, many different ornamental treatments, each adjusted specifically for its letter form counterpart. Open your glyph palette to find plenty more variation and alternative combinations.\n\nFor everyone's eyes only.\n\n**[Sudtipos fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817200319/http:/www.sudtipos.com/)**\n\n",
