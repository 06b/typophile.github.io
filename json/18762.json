I wonder if they made a deal with the prolific digitizer Dieter Steffmann_\n\nYes, they did. the book includes the most common blackletter fonts (fontshop, linotype etc.) and has 2 sections about more modern blackletter interpretations. When I'm back home I'll search after the list of the fonts on the cd.\n\njürgen siebert from [http://www.fontblog.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015205313/http:/www.fontblog.de/ \"http://www.fontblog.de\") has more pic of the book and a small making of for all german readers.\n\n"

All fonts are for Mac OS X and Windows, except Tannenberg (Windows Type 1 only). More than 95 % of the fonts carry the famous long s. The fonts seem to work well. I had a crash (Mac, InDesign CS 2, FontExpolrer X) when loading all 150 fonts and my PDF was nearly finished, but who the hell is working with 150 blackletter fonts simultaneously? Some of the fonts (10 - 15 %) are not embeddable. That makes my file huge, because I converted most of the showings to path. The PDF is 3.9 MB. Have fun ...\n\n"
