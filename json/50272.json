More than a decade has passed since Abbott Miller first outlined the broad strokes of how letterforms might operate in space and time in the pamphlet Dimensional Typography. The question today is, how much further have designers pushed the boundaries of dimensional typography since Miller’s initial survey? Does dimensional typography have any implications further than simply being a formal variation on traditional typographic form, and does current work hint at what these implications might be?\n\nCALL FOR ENTRIES  \nThe Chicago ISpace Gallery invites submissions of current experimental, unfinished, unpublished or applied work within the sphere of dimensional typography. Artists and designers are encouraged to submit works which explore type and typography in spatial or temporal form in any medium. Unpublished and experimental work is strongly encouraged. Entries must have been created within past five years.\n\nFor further information or questions, email [hello@dimensionandtype.com](mailto:hello@dimensionandtype.com) or for entry details, visit [http://dimensionandtype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135723/http:/dimensionandtype.com/ \"http://dimensionandtype.com\").\n\nABOUT ISPACE GALLERY  \nThe ISpace Gallery is located in the heart of Chicago’s River North Gallery district, an area composed of art galleries, architectural offices, furniture and other high end design retail outlets. The proximity to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Arts Club of Chicago and other cultural organizations make this area a highly regarded destination for residents of Chicago and visitors to the city alike. Ispace provides a Chicago-based gallery and a public forum for the visual, performing and design arts. Its mission is to encourage the exploration, experimentation and understanding of the arts as a vibrant expression of human experience and intellectual discourse through exhibitions, performances, classes, and lecture-demonstrations.\n\nCurated by Jimmy Luu + Ryan Molloy\n\n",
