  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm looking for a typeface similar to Neville Brody's 'New Deal' which he created for the film _Public Enemies_. However, to my knowledge it was commissioned for the film and isn't available for sale and use elsewhere. It does however, have many characteristics that I'm in love with and it is a perfect fit for a project I have in the works. Any advice on a similar typeface would be much appreciated.\n\nMore details on the 'New Deal' typeface: [http://www.aisleone.net/2009/typography/new-deal-typeface-by-neville-brody/](http://web.archive.org/web/20101018072048/http:/www.aisleone.net/2009/typography/new-deal-typeface-by-neville-brody/ \"http://www.aisleone.net/2009/typography/new-deal-typeface-by-neville-brody/\")\n\nCheers in advance.\n\n",

It definitely nails it on the capital Y.\n\nAfter further examination, it's the capital M in 'New Deal' that really does it for me. I've done some more research and found a number of fonts that fit the bill to a certain extent, but none of them are able to quite capture the modern industrial feel just right:\n\n[Gagarin Anna](http://web.archive.org/web/20101018072048/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/2rebels/gagarin_anna/)  \n [Berber](http://web.archive.org/web/20101018072048/http:/www.letterbox.net.au/store/order_fonts_berber.php)  \n [Liquorstore](http://web.archive.org/web/20101018072048/http:/www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5123)\n\nPerhaps I'm best off modifying one of these appropriately? I've thought about contacting Chank to create a more appropriate capital M.\n\n"
