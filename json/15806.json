  "content": "Hi guys, I’m working on a historic timeline kind of thing, and I need some recommendations for fonts with pretty numerals. The rest of the book has kinda a old / vintage / grungey / handmade feel, but I don’t need these numerals to have this feel. I might or might not distress them.\n\nI kinda like the exploding numerals on the [Franck Muller watches](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014000206/http:/www.blowers-jewellers.co.uk/watches_franck_muller.htm) too.\n\nHope you can help.
