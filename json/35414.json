And I don't think Democratica is working. Try a script maybe, like Linoscript? Something upright, narrow and mannered.   \nMaybe Bernhard Modern:   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern/bold/testdrive.html?s=Apulia&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705154049/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bernhard-modern/bold/testdrive.html?s=Apulia&p=72)   \nA little bit cliche, though, I guess.   \n   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It seems your classes logo's are being spaced out over this month. Is this a long term project, and if so, when is it due.   \n   \nI remember my restaurant identity in design school. I guess I had about two weeks before crit on the restaurant logo. The final crit encompassed the logo, restaurant layout, and menu. I had much longer on that. Will you be preparing multiple peices for the identity?   \n   \nJust curious,   \n   \nAndrew\n\n"

It gives me a sense of old Italy and I can almost see those olive tree's in the sun, while a group of roman soldiers are resting in the shadows... or something like that...kinda....almost. Anyhow I agree about the contrast of the logo and the colouring. I would have it a bit more greenish - but I'm a sucker for green so don't mind me. hey talking about green - how about a few leaves? No? Nahhh your right...to used.   \n   \nAnd I like the squirting but keep it simple and not to much. Oh one thing that strikes me a bit \"easy\" The big \"a\" is exactly the same as the little \"a\" in the name with squirts and everything. Its seems a little \"copy/paste\" or is it just me?   \n   \nThats all from me - but I like the work... real nice   \n   \nMark\n\n"
