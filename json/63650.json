All sblackwell is doing it seems is sharing creativity and trying to get feedback on a proposed rebrand for the college. Surely you cannot be serious in thinking this is some kind of marketing ploy do you? Plus you have a crack at the moderators...you sound like an angry little man to me.\n\nCheers\n\nSimon\n\n"
