  "content": "So I recently saw Moon (great movie, by the way). I kind of laughed when I saw that they used Eurostile in the film for \"Lunar Industries\" as well as signage and such on the moon base (the titles were Bank Gothic - another popular choice). Clearly this is a visual cliché, but II'm having a hard time remembering where else I've seen this. So I'm asking typophile - what other movies/tv shows can you think of?\n\nPreferably within the movie/series, but if it's used for titles that's okay too. I did look up Eurostile and Microgramma on Wikipedia, and came up with these:\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey  \nThe Andromeda Strain  \nGerry Anderson's Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Space: 1999 and UFO  \nSeveral Star Trek movies, and ST: Enterprise  \nBSG (main title)\n\nIf there's enough of them I'll even make a video compilation (aka a [supercut](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010202317/http:/waxy.org/2008/04/fanboy_supercuts_obsessive_video_montages/)).\n\n",
