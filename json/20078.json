Available for Windows and Mac OS. Comes with a suite of command-line tools, and is also used by [FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontLab) and [TypeTool](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeTool), among others, for supporting some of OpenType's more sophisticated features.\n\n**URL**  \n [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/ \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\")\n\n**Presentation at Robothon'09**  \n [http://blip.tv/file/1908888](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/blip.tv/file/1908888 \"http://blip.tv/file/1908888\")\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**INSTALLATION**  \n_Both the command-line tools and the FontLab macros are self-contained and run independently of each other._\n\n**AFDKO command-line tools** _on Mac OS X_  \n**`1.`** Download and decompress the AFDKO package.  \n**`2.`** You should now have a folder named 'FDK'. Move it to where you want.  \n**`3.`** Open a Terminal window (Terminal is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`)  \n**`4.`** Open the 'FDK' folder and locate the file named 'FinishInstallOSX'  \n**`5.`** Select the 'FinishInstallOSX' file, drag & drop it on the Terminal window, and press the 'Return' key.  \nIf FinishInstallOSX complains that it does not have permission to make the changes, type 'sudo ' (no quotes and keep the final space) before doing step&nbsp;5. This command will prompt you for the system administrator password, which will allow FinishInstallOSX to complete its work.  \n**`6.`** Close the Terminal window (Command+W).\n\nIf all went well the FDK should now be ready to run. To test it, do the following:  \n**`A.`** Open a Terminal window.  \n**`B.`** Type 'autohint -h' (no quotes) and hit 'Return'. This should give you the Help information about the Autohint tool.\n\nIf you get an '`OSError: [Errno 17] File exists`', go to `/Users/(your_username)/bin`, delete the symbolic link named 'FDK', and run FinishInstallOSX again.\n\nIf you get a message saying '`-bash: autohint: command not found`', do the following additional steps:  \n**`+1.`** Open a new Terminal window and type `pico .profile`  \n**`+2.`** You should now have the '.profile' file opened in pico, and see some lines that look like this: `PATH=${PATH}:\"/Users/your_username/bin/\"`  \n**`+3.`** Select those lines, copy them, and close the file (Ctrl+X).  \n**`+4.`** Type `pico .bash_profile`  \n**`+5.`** Paste the lines copied in step +3.  \n**`+6.`** Close the file (Ctrl+X), answering “Y” to save the changes.  \n**`+7.`** Close the Terminal window.  \n**`+8.`** Open a new Terminal window. Typing 'autohint -h' should now work, as well as all the other AFDKO command line tools.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**AFDKO FontLab macros** _on Mac OS X_  \n**`0.`** Quit FontLab, in case it is running.  \n**`1.`** Locate the 'Macros' folder in your FontLab installation. The path to it should be something like  \n`/Users/(your_username)/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros`  \nIf there is no 'Macros' folder, create one on that location.  \n**`2.`** Download and decompress the AFDKO package.  \n**`3.`** You should now have a folder named 'FDK'.  \n**`4.`** Open a Terminal window (Terminal is located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`), and type 'cd ' (no quotes and keep the final space).  \n**`5.`** Select the 'FDK' folder, drag & drop it on the Terminal window, and press the 'Return' key.  \n**`6.`** Type 'cd Tools/FontLab' (no quotes) and hit 'Return'.  \n**`7.`** Still in the Terminal window, type 'python installFontLabMacros.py ' (no quotes and keep the final space).  \n**`8.`** Select the 'Macros' folder from step 1, drag & drop it on the Terminal window, and press the 'Return' key.\n\nIf all went well, you should see a bunch of lines in the Terminal window that start with '`Copied:`'. The AFDKO FontLab macros are now installed, and the 'FDK' folder can be deleted.\n\nIf you get lines that say '`Failed to copy file (...) IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: (...)`', it's because the AFDKO FontLab macros were previously installed. To install them again you'll need to remove the old files.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**AFDKO command-line tools** _on Windows XP_  \n**`1.`** Download and decompress the AFDKO package.  \n**`2.`** You should now have a folder named 'FDK'. Move it to where you want (e.g. `C:\\FDK`). _In case you put the FDK folder inside another folder, make sure that the folder name does \\*not\\* have spaces. Therefore, don't put it inside the 'Program Files' folder, for example._  \n**`3.`** Open the 'FDK' folder, proceed to the 'Tools' folder and continue to the 'win' folder. The Address field should contain something like '`C:\\FDK\\Tools\\win`' (assuming the 'FDK' folder was moved to the location suggested in step 2).  \n**`4.`** Select and copy the contents of the Address field.  \n**`5.`** Open the Control Panel (Start Menu \\> Settings \\> Control Panel)  \n**`6.`** Locate 'System' and open it. You should now have a new window named 'System Properties'.  \n**`7.`** Select the tab named 'Advanced'.  \n**`8.`** Press the 'Environment Variables' button.  \n**`9.`** In the 'User variables for _your\\_username_' field, scroll down until you see one entry named 'PATH' (or 'Path' or 'path'). If you find one, go to step&nbsp;A1, otherwise go to step&nbsp;B1.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`A1.`** Select the entry named 'PATH' and click on the 'Edit' button below that area. You should now have a new window named 'Edit User Variable'.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`A2.`** Select the 'Variable value' field and move the cursor all the way to the end, i.e. all the way to the right. (Beware that the contents of the 'Variable value' might be too long and appear trimmed)  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`A3.`** Once at the end, type a semicolon (;) and paste-in the contents from step&nbsp;4.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`A4.`** Click on the 'OK' button.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`B1.`** Click on the 'New' button (top one). You should now have a new window named 'New User Variable'.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`B2.`** In the 'Variable name' field, type 'PATH'. (no quotes)  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`B3.`** In the 'Variable value' filed, paste-in the contents from step&nbsp;4.  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **`B4.`** Click on the 'OK' button.\n\n**`10.`** Click on the 'OK' button again. ('Environment Variables' window)  \n**`11.`** Click on the 'OK' button once more. ('System Properties' window)\n\nIf all went well the FDK should now be ready to run. To test it, do the following:  \n**`A.`** Open a Command Prompt window. (Start Menu \\> Run... \\> cmd.exe)  \n**`B.`** Type 'autohint -h' (no quotes) and hit 'Return'. This should give you the Help information about the Autohint tool.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**AFDKO FontLab macros** _on Windows XP_  \n_You must have Python installed before you proceed. For information on how to install Python, go to the [FontLab Python page](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/www.fontlab.com/python/)._  \n**`0.`** Quit FontLab, in case it is running.  \n**`1.`** Locate the 'Macros' folder in your FontLab installation. The path to it should look something like  \n`C:\\Documents and Settings\\your_username\\My Documents\\FontLab\\Studio5\\Macros`  \nIf there is no 'Macros' folder, create one on that location.  \n**`2.`** Download and decompress the AFDKO package.  \n**`3.`** You should now have a folder named 'FDK'.  \n**`4.`** Open a Command Prompt window (Start Menu \\> Run... \\> cmd.exe), and type 'cd ' (no quotes and keep the final space).  \n**`5.`** Select the 'FDK' folder, drag & drop it on the Command Prompt window, and press the 'Return' key.  \n**`6.`** Type 'cd Tools/FontLab' (no quotes) and hit 'Return'.  \n**`7.`** Still in the Command Prompt window, type 'python installFontLabMacros.py ' (no quotes and keep the final space).  \n**`8.`** Select the 'Macros' folder from step 1, drag & drop it on the Command Prompt window, and press the 'Return' key.\n\nIf all went well, you should see a bunch of lines in the Command Prompt window that start with '`Copied:`'. The AFDKO FontLab macros are now installed, and the 'FDK' folder can be deleted.\n\nOn step 7, if you have Python installed but still get a message that says '`'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`', locate the folder where Python is installed, and add that folder's path to the 'PATH' User Variable.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**Related files**  \n [Font Production at Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_FontProduction_at_Adobe.pdf) (PDF)  \n [Font Testing at Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/typotechnica2007/TypoTechnica2007_StateOfTheArt_Font_QE.pdf) (PDF)\n\n**Discussions**  \n [New Adobe FDK...when?](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/node/20033)  \n [AFDKO 2.0 : Post your feedback here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/www.typophile.com/afdko2)  \n [InDesign CS3 problem with OT-feature Proportional Oldstyle](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/node/39487)  \n [AFDKO doesn't work with Python 2.5](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/node/43848)  \n [Installing AFDKO](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/node/45236)\n\n[The GlyphOrderAndAliasDB file](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/node/42076)  \n [MakeOTF and GlyphOrderAndAliasDB problem](http://web.archive.org/web/20140428160342/http:/typophile.com/node/42564)\n\n",
