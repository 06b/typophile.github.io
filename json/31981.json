  "content": "I’m designing a biz card and just had a question concerning the address block. The client has a PO Box and my question is; Is it correct to set ’PO’ in small caps _and_ set the word ’box’ with a capital ’B’ or should I set the entire word in small caps. Also, when setting an e-mail address on a biz card, is it necessary to type ’e-mail’ in front of it? Is it something that is obvious or will it be confused with a web address? I personally would like to do without the ’e-mail’ title for simplicity’s sake.\n\nWelcome any and all input you may have. Thanks in advance.\n\nIM\n\n [‹ Newspaper typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213222659/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31820 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Mono & Lino Together At Last ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071213222659/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27388 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This is just the right input I needed.\n\n_the po box question depends on context, styles, weights, overall block layout, any other uses of smallcaps?_\n\nThe reason I’m using small caps is because I’m using oldstyle numerals for the PO Box numbers, zip codes and telephone numbers to help with readabilty (the type is set in Freight Sans 8pt and it’s a tightly spaced font).\n\n_Use small caps if the letters are meant to be read as letters, not as words. So in this case, small caps PO, u&lc Box works._\n\nI Agree. I’ll go with my original plan.\n\nThis is how the address reads (PO and PA will be set in small caps and all numbers will be oldstyle figures, I even chose that PO Box specificaly becuase the ’6’ ascends, the ’9’ descends and the ’8’ ascends making it easier to read at small sizes).\n\npo Box 1698  \nReading, pa 19603\n\n_People look at business cards specifically to find your email address, so they probably can identify it at first sight without a label._\n\nYeah you’re right.\n\nThanks everyone, appreciate it.\n\nIM\n\n"

My interpretation is based on the fact that an address will be made up of a selection of numerals and words and each word will be in title case. So to introduce another level, especially at the beginning of a line, might affect the harmony of the setting, more significantly it might also affect the usability of the card, while not gaining anything.\n\nTim\n\n"
