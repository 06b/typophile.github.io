Thanks, Matthew.\n\nWhile I defintely prefer unobtrusive inline links to long lines of bulky URL rigmarole, the current implementation is way too subtle!  \nUnder certain circumstances (screen angle, lighting, …), I cannot tell apart the regular text in Georgia Roman, without underline, in medium gray – from link text in Georgia Roman, without underline, in grayish blue.  \nCan’t we have a `text-decoration:underline`, please? (It doesn’t have to be the chunky default one.) And if that is too much of a revolution, what about a little icon, like the wiki entries have?  \nI’ve sent a [feature request](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203155205/http:/typophile.com/contact); if others suffer from the same thing, please do so, too.\n\nAnd yes, Matthew, your ideas deserve a better treatment than 10px type in lengthy lines. A max-width in ems would help a lot.\n\n[sorry for the off-topic comments]\n\n"

I just checked in FF, OmniWeb and Safari and Opera and the fonts go up.\n\nAnd yeah I need to work on my site a bit. I've keep forgetting not everyone uses the smallest windows possible :)\n\nI would also like if any Portuguese-native users on the forums could tell me how they generally write the tilde over the A and the O. The standard Spanish handwriting for it I'm sure would be too easily confused for an acute accent.\n\nAlso if there's interest I can go back and find more examples of older tildes. ( [Cervantes Virtual Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203155205/http:/www.cervantesvirtual.com/) is your friend).\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».
