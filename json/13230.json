They'll be doing a discussion/talk type of event towards the end of the show (late Sept) and are looking for someone to speak about Kruger's practice from the point of view of graphic design (rather than from an art history point of view). The audience will most likely be artists rather than designers, so an awareness of contemporary art would be a help. There would be some kind of smallish fee and reasonable expenses (negotiable).\n\nSorry this is vague, but that's Tramway. Anybody interested?\n\nRobert\n\n",
