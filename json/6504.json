  "content": "So im about to embark on a journey I have been envisioning for quite some time now. I have always been rather involved in the field of typography, be it mostly digital and related to graphic design. I have been waiting for the right time -- and what I thought to be a good knowledge base -- before taking this road. So I think I'm ready. I find myself here, requesting advice, requesting a map or guidlines to guide me down this path. Anything you could give would help. A charcter map to follow? (western that is) things I should consider? Links to documents that may prove usefull. Just about anything would help. I just finished reading \"The elements of typographic style\", so I'm quite excited about the whole process.   \n   \nCheers.   \n   \n(p.s. forgive my improper use of quotes ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016212425im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n",

Put some counterweight on the other side.

Additionally, drawing in a type program allows you to think over your spacing while you're building your glyphs. I drew in Illustrator for years and looking back I think my work suffered (mainly the proportions and spacing) for it. I've fully switched to just drawing in Fontlab. Of course money is an issue so I fully understand sticking with Illustrator for awhile.   \nBest of luck!\n\n"

      "content": "Kyle -   \n   \nThe bad habit I was referring to was the tendency in Illustrator to design letters as individual pieces rather than related groups. You can shuffle the glyphs around so they sit side by side but nothing beats seeing them in strings or up against numerous other glyphs. Unlike Illustrator, you can do this easily in FL or FOG by having the metrics window open in the background.   \n   \nAs far as templates, you can import a PICT or TIFF into the background layer. I've never done this as I've only once designed a face from a scan. I however use the template layer often when designing a new weight of the face.   \n   \nBj -   \nI'll give you that one. The pathfinder in Illustrator is amazing. You can do anything. Especially bang out geometric and display style fonts. FL has a tool similar to this that requires you to reverse the contours in order to perform similar operations. In short, it adds an extra step. So basically it's just a different way of doing things. I only prefer it because you can work with the exact coordinates and measurements that will appear in the final postscript version. Remember that when you paste into FOG or FL everything (stems and handles) will have to fit the 1000 unit grid somehow. That means either rounding up to the nearest or down to the nearest. This can be trouble with an ultra light version of a typeface (something with a stem weight of 20 units or less).   \n   \nI'm however not totally gung ho yet for FL. It's very buggy and has TERRIBLE kerning assistance for diacritics and alike characters. I've been importing back into FOG for this lately. I would love to use OSX but it will be a few years before I can afford a machine that will run it. Maybe it will run better there. My G3 isn't up to the task.   \n   \nHope this helps.\n\n"

      "content": "Using FontLab to draw glyphs is worth it if only for all the time you save joining points. Rather than dragging two points on top of each other, hitting cmd-j, selecting the type of join, and hitting ok, in FontLab you just drag one point on to the other and they automatically join.   \n   \nAs for the pathfinder like tools, with FontLab I don't find myself ever carving out spaces, since I can just draw my counters and when I preview the glyph, it draws the counter carved out. In illustrator I used to draw the counters filled with white to see how it would look, but it's nice to not have to worry about setting the right color for these paths anymore. Sometimes I build my glyphs in pieces; joining these into the final shape is simple (cmd-F10).   \n   \nThe comment about helping you think about your spacing is dead on. I work most of the time with the preview window up. If I'm trying to adjust the weight and metrics of, for instance, the 'g' glyph, I set a sample word in the preview window, say... 'glowing', and I watch the word as I make adjustments. Once I'm satisfied with the word 'glowing', I try a few more words and make the changes that seem necessary.   \n   \nI also used to be really happy with Illustrator for drawing glyphs, but since trying FontLab, it's painful to go back. It comes down to the fact that FontLabs drawing tools are designed only for drawing glyphs, while Illustrators tools are much more broad, not as focused, so the extra power just gets in the way.\n\n"
