I would drag select all the text you wish to edit with the pointer tool; then switch to the text insertion tool and drag a box, then paste. You then get all the text together but usually need to add word breaks where there were line breaks. Sound like a pain in the tuchous? You bettcha. That is why it is better to make changes in the originating application unless you are in dire straights.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "When importing from Word to Quark rather than cut and paste, if you import the text using command e, it will keep it's formatting, and if it was created on a Mac and you have the same font it will import at the same sizes and font, however every text document will need close attention lookout for double wordspaces, incorrect quote marks and apostrophes, en dashes, tabs, ellipsis etc. The typographer's checklist thread will give you further investigations. For the pdf justified text will occasionally alter ranging – if possible I would ask the client to provide the artwork or do the chnages and resend the document – safer in the long run.  \nTim\n\n"
