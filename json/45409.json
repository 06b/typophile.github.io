Can anyone suggest some modern san serif faces... on the lines of art magazine fonts? I am looking for faces that have thinner weights for body copy and such.\n\nThanks a bunch!\n\n [‹ Theft?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063744/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45700 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Kyoto protocol poster ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720063744/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45878 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I, too, have been looking for a lovely sans serif typeface which I could use for a variety of purposes, including body text, headings, display.\n\nFor a while now, my face of choice has been Brioso, and I still love that! Now I need a compliment, a companion.\n\nI do like Scott’s suggestion of “Gotham” and I’m seriously considering that. There were a couple other faces I loved from typography.com,though they seem a bit pricey.\n\nI was tempted to get the whole Helvetica Neue family, but sheesh! At least from Adobe that’s nearly $1,000. I had no idea!\n\nI do hope this thread will receive a few more suggestions.\n\nOH, and does anyone have a suggestion or two for a typeface that evokes the Near and Middle East? I have a friend who puts on occasional cultural events and I’d love to help her do fliers, posters, and announcements.\n\nMy thanks and regards,\n\nKeith\n\nFabricando fabri fimus.\n\n"

In my view, it’s the closest to perfect among all sans of whatever style, mainly because the base weight is so well judged, not too heavy as with so many other starting weights. Also, ITC Franklin Gothic, tho it doesn’t have OSFs.\n\nFreight Sans is the leading Gill-Sans-inflected design recently, and many more followed its lead. A warning about Verlag: in actual use it comes off surprisingly rough and vulgar, lacking the finesse and finish you expect from that foundry.\n\n"
