Rosemaling-inspirasjonen ville definitivt vært spennende å se som en displayskrift.\n\nDet er et par ting du burde ta tak i her, før du går videre:  \n• Bredde – ‘s' ‘t' og til en viss grad ‘a' virker smale, ‘r' ‘v' ‘w' ‘x' ‘y' virker litt brede. (Når du tegner ‘r' er det veldig smart å løsrive seg mer fra ‘n'-kurven. Den burde være litt brattere, slik at du unngår et stort hvitt \"hull\" nede til høyre. Det kan være smart å dra den høyre seriffen litt ut også.)  \n• Avslutningene på ‘f' og ‘j' stjeler veldig mye oppmerksomhet.\n\nLykke til! Gleder meg til å følge dette videre.\n\n"

Try to redraw it make it more similar to the C.  \nThe G and the M are also a little narrow in my opinion.\n\nUpon close inspection the thicks and thins in the capitals don't seem consistent but overall they look nice. However I'm worried about the arms on the T and E I'm afraid they'll look too thin in small point size.\n\nI don't know the whole thing looks cool I love the \"C\" \"c\" \"g\" and \"r\" as drawings. I also liked the comma and the dots on the i and j a lot.\n\nGood works show us better capitals next time.\n\n"

      "content": "It's very pretty. I like the cultural background and how you integrate it into the type design! What I wonder is if this prettiness will come out, and work, at \"body copy\" sizes. Things like the tail of the \"Q\": I can see that looking smashing in a headline, but will (like Craig said) the gaps even come out at small sizes, and then what will they \\*do\\*? Will they look distracting (adding a bit of \"white noise\"), or will they help the glyph? Will they maybe – in this case – make the \"Q\" more confusable with the \"O\"?  \nThe way I understand things (and I'm a rather new type designer, so take with a grain of salt), text face design is not just about making glyphs look beautiful up close – it's also very much about functionality. So if you're really wanting to target text sizes, prepare to do a \\*lot\\* of testing at your target point sizes; and you might have to sacrifice some solutions that look good up close if they don't work at small sizes :-/ – something that doesn't have to happen nearly so much to display/titling fonts, which enjoy much more \"creative freedom\".\n\n"

They are all helpful, and I now know what to do next.\n\njohnnydib: thank you for your opinion on proportions of the characters. I will do some adjustments on these.\n\neliason: the reason why the 'w' is 'broken' but not the 'W', is that in the lower case the lines cross each other, while in the upper case the lines 'just meet'. I guess this means that maybe the 'Y' and the 'G' shouldn't have break(?) I also tried to set the 'T' with a break, but didn't think this looked good at all. Have tried a lot of different options with the breaks, but am having a hard time in making up my mind on which ones I like and which ones I don't like.\n\naltaira: I have done testings in a lot of sizes, and I try to have a high focus on the small sizes. The gaps works down to 8pt size. Of course they do not come off as 'hugh gaps' at this size, but one can still see the impression they give on each character.\n\n"
