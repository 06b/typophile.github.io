His film is really, really much more than I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be much more academic and historic. It was so much more than that. Helvetica is so much more than a typeface, it's a cultural landmark and Gary Hustwit's film put it into great context.\n\nIt was so great to see footage of [[Massimo Vignelli]] extolling Helvetica and the AmericanAirlines mark (that he designed, in Helvetica) put back to back with the Helvetica detractors.\n\nThe other question I would ask is: What is your Helvetica story?\n\nIn design school I had this fear of Helvetica, everybody did. And then I discovered it accidentally when I fell in love with a [[Bitstream]] face called [[Swiss]] (I was a sophomore; it was an easy mistake.) It was great and I spent a whole semester using it. Then in my career it was easy to ignore Helvetica until BMW's brand guidelines dictated it and again I saw it's merits.\n\nIf I were a design instructor, this film would be required material. Kudos again to Gary.\n\n",

      "content": "Good question.  \nMy case will not be typical, since I never had a formal introduction  \nto Helvomi... uh, Helvee... uh, Helvetica. In fact it's interesting  \nthat I had any reaction to it at all, since the first time I consciously  \nthought about its [de]merits I really had a weak grasp of typography.  \nBut over time my feelings haven't changed in essence: starting out  \nwith an intuitive unease about it, I've now elaborated my opinions  \nwith a more studious grasp of what's wrong with it.\n\nBTW, I was also very pleasantly surprised by the movie.  \nGary has done an amazing job conveying a balanced but  \nnonetheless passionate story.\n\nhhp\n\n"
