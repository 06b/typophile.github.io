  "content": "Hello all,   \n   \nAny ideas on these two? The Ghostbusters logo was created in 1984. The type seems very familiar but frustratingly I haven't been able to find it. The type is distinctive by the spur on the G. I can't tell if the type below (\"collector's series\") is the same family or different typeface altogether (maybe another Norvarese?). That too is familiar, but my eyes or my brain are too tired now.   \n   \n [Silverado](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124836/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/silverado-rr/) from Red Rooster seems close (including the spur), but Silverado was created after 1984. RR says Silverado was based on Eldorado, but they had to change the name since linotype had a dissimilar type by the same name. [ITC Symbol](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124836/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-symbol/) is also similar, as is [Memo](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124836/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/memo/), but both don't have the spur on the G.   \n   \nAs for the type in used for autamata _(another good CD, btw)_, I haven't a clue.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124836im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35877.jpg)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124836im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35878.jpg)\n\n",

Here's a french movie poster (I presume released around that same time) and they used a different but similarly styled font (likey one of the ones mentioned above (Flange or Quorum?). The R's are different from the one in the logo. While not the nail in the coffin for a custom logo, it certainly is evidentiary.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124836im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35980.jpg)\n\n"
