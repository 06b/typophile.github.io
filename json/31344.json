If so, can you recommend examples? Is this experimental or just stupid?\n\n",

I dont' know if I personally am a fan of the style, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't pursue it -- I'm sure that other people would have a use for it. As long as you follow through on making the letterforms smoother, I think you should be good to go. Now that I'm looking at yours, the effect is growing on me -- Dead History is a bit too out there for me, but yours has a more pleasing effect, even at this stage. Keep going.\n\n"

It might make for more balanced contrast, or it might just make it look weirder. It could suggest solutions to the problem of the lower half dominating in letters with long decenders like the \"g\" and \"y\".\n\n"
