  "content": "I'm looking for a definitive list of system fonts that are required for Windows (XP). Currently, my Windows Fonts folder is filled with almost 500 individual files and I know I don't need to have that many fonts loaded at once. I currently use Suitcase 9.2 to manage my fonts and I've noticed some conflicts with preloaded fonts and when I activate/deactivate fonts.\n\nI came across this topic : [http://typophile.com/node/9071](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205713/http:/typophile.com/node/9071 \"http://typophile.com/node/9071\") and have since removed all the fonts from .../program files/common files/adobe/fonts...\n\nDoes anyone have any information? I know enough to keep my web fonts, but what systems specific fonts do I need to keep?\n\n",

I'm looking for more of a minimalistic list, the basic fonts necessary to run windows and use the web without problems. I know a good bit of the fonts in my windows fonts directory were probably loaded when I installed Microsoft Office, those I definitely don't need, but I don't want to start deleting willy-nilly.\n\nI appreciate the attempt Jackie.\n\n"

Plus, all the default but non-critical fonts that you don't want would be restored, too.\n\n"

I went with the above, and it shrank my current list significantly. I appreciate the feed back, and hope that this has helped a few of the \"quiet commentors\" on Typophile.\n\n"

Pretty soon, though, we'll be seeing a lot of the new fonts that come with Windows Vista and Office 2007. Of those, the most crucial font families are Segoe UI (the new default interface typeface in Windows Vista) and Calibri (the new default typeface in Word, Excel, and Outlook).\n\nEdit: Well, looks like I was a little too slow. The [article](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205713/http:/graphicssoft.about.com/od/aboutgraphics/a/fontoverload_3.htm) linked to by Gus Winterbottom covers the basics fairly nicely (though not 100% accurately).\n\n"
