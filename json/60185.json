I can't even guess at a similar font to WATERWORKS. Any ideas? You guys always seem to be helpful.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [waterworks.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121029085223/http:/typophile.com/files/waterworks.jpg) | 28.61 KB |\n| [artcanada.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121029085223/http:/typophile.com/files/artcanada.jpg) | 29.78 KB |\n\n",

I think Neutraface was based on some older building signage (kind made out of metal) and that's where I got this from and then cleaned it up. Perhaps it is from Richard Neutra's work though I don't know if it was widely available back then or just on the houses he designed.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n[Tylor j Reimer DOT com](http://web.archive.org/web/20121029085223/http:/www.tylorjreimer.com/)\n\n"
