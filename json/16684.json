  "content": "Hello all :)  \nI am doing a design update for a business mag and look for a new body copy face. The one used this far is Bitstreams Aldine401 (which would be a revival of Bembo of sorts), it is too thin. I need something that would at least distantly resemble it, but read better at long texts. Elegance is important :). The tricky part is that I need an OT face, with custom characters, ligatures, cyrillics, small caps, lc numbers, and all.  \nSuggestions welcomed :).\n\n [‹ Essential fonts for windows xp](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180806/http:/typophile.com/node/17058 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [My second type design workshop ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180806/http:/typophile.com/node/16912 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
