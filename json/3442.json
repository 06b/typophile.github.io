But I think it is also okay in this case. Maybe try to make the right stem (or bowl?) need also 2 pixel.   \n   \nThe 'j' looks a little strange. Have looked twice before I regonice that it is the 'j'. Maybe thats difficult in a text.   \n   \nGreetings Jens   \nBTW: does anyone has a good site with all the terms in english?\n\n"
