It is now back in print in paperback, so it is again accessible.   \n   \nThe way Tracy analyzes typefaces is really wonderful. He usually critiques individual letters from the point of view of how they harmonize or fail to harmonize in the overall face, and so how they work or fail to as text types. He is so experienced and with such broad tastes - he appreciates both van Krimpen and Goudy! - that the book is really an education, at least for this amateur typophile.\n\n"

And I'm counting on all you typophiles to \"beta test\" the first edition and let me know where I've erred, so I can correct the next edition.
