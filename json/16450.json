It reminded me, always, of the cartoon with the portable hole that the cat-burgler character would use to get loot through windows and escape from the cops.\n\nI was moving whole cases back and forth then just to change serifs, or all of a stem type, or importing logos. Do other people use this path in the design porocess nowadays, or is it primarily an entry level, or very-special-case path. Also wondering if anyone knows of a InD/FL path? :)\n\n"

Seriously, there are some procedures which are easier to do in Illustrator, which is reason enough to use it in many cases. But you can always go from FL \\> Illustrator \\> FL if you just need to run a special Illustrator filter on a glyph or whatever. As a routine method for drawing glyphs, though, working in Illustrator involves quite a few extra steps and seems inefficient to me now. (I used to work that way.)\n\n"

It’s easy. The most dreadful step for many people will be using the command-line GhostScript. :)\n\nAdam\n\n"

(Quite often these days, I will start drawing in FLab.)\n\nOne of the greatest benefits of this “workflow”, or “workpuddle”, is that there are no surprises with nodes and BCPs aligning to whole units on the em grid. If you develop a font with a lowercase “i” with a vertical stroke width of, say, 25 units, and you want to center a 30-unit wide dot, you can make that in AI or FH, but it won’t fly in FLab. Likewise, if you wanted a 29-unit wide dot on your i, you couldn’t have a perfect circle, since the midpoint of 29 is 14.5, and decimals are verboten.\n\nUnfortunately, FOG gave us the false impression that we could work in decimals and half-units, but the app then “flattened” points and handles when the fonts were generated.\n\n"
