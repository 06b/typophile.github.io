For a face like this you can get by without UC, but numbers especially and some basic punctuation would make a big difference in its utility (hence its commercial success). In fact here's an idea: make a fuller font, charge even a bit more than €29 for it, but give away the lc-only version for free (to hook people on it, and then they'll be much more likely to pay for the full version).\n\nBTW, can the two styles be layered in any way?\n\nhhp\n\n"
