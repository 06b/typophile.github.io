It loosely reminds me of [Clearface](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215223853/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/clearface) and [Cheltenham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215223853/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/cheltenham) but that's far from being even close.  \nIf you need as vector, you'll find it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215223853/http:/www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo?search_api_views_fulltext=cruzcampo), freely available to download.\n\n"
