We [had this one before](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/typophile.com/node/50176):  \nThe masthead on the [AnOther Magazine website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/www.anothermag.com/) states that all its font design is by [Alias](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/www.alias.uk.com/) ( [Gareth Hague](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gareth%20Hague) and [David James](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/typophile.com/wiki/David%20James)). This typeface isn’t listed on their site, so I’m afraid it is custom.\n\nRelated typefaces include [Nicola Kroita Zucka](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/www.pfadfinderei.com/font/nicola-kroita-zucka#/0), [Easyscript](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Script+Fonts/Easyscript/), [Terital](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326195518/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/letterbox/terital_ot/?&sample_text=Poised%20in%20readiness).  \nF\n\n"
