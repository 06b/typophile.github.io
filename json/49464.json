They want to look modern, and have been using Eurostile for 6 months... aside for my general dislike of eurostile, I', just not very good at using it. just as I'm not very good at playing soccer.\n\nDo you know of corporate/finance sites who use eurostile successfully? Think ge.com, but with eutrostile.\n\nthanks!\n\nalex\n\n",

See if you can talk them out of it and into using another, more suitable face. Justify your advice with rationale like, \"It makes more sense. A more appropriate face will communicate your branding to your customers more effectively. I'm the type expert so you should listen to me, or the bunny gets it, mkay?\"\n\nI can't think of a single corporate/finance outfit that makes successful use of Eurostile.\n\nI blame neil Sedaka and his entourage.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

I couldn't find any decent images of the interior signage at MoMA:QNS since it's now closed (it was the temporary home of MoMA).
