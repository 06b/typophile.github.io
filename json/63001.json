The g is a relaxing italic, while the a is stuffy lowercase roman.\n\nCould you please suggest a font that has an italic alphabet, sits upright, and has serifs. To be a little more demanding, a slanted texture would be interesting as I have not seen that on an upright typeface :)\n\nThank you so much!!\n\n",

      "content": "Well, I may have used outmoded (and misleading) vocabulary because I have recently read Gill's 1931 Essay on Typography and I am still learning. Gill recognised only three alphabets: roman, roman lowercase, italic. His meaning of italic may be equivalent to contemporary cursive.\n\nIf I am permitted to give the fonts a personality: Perhaps I am aiming for cursive and vertical - as though the words are to be perceived as flexible and upholding. I reject roman typefaces because I associate them with inflexible content, such as the words of a printed book. I quite like Minion, for example, but it has that entrenched roman quality that does not suit my aim.\n\nStone comes really close to my aim and the only thing I mark it down on is for being rather bubbly and playful - its as though the typeface does not take content seriously. This is due to its large x-height and wide ems (although I do not yet fully understand the em unit).\n\nThe only thing that caused me to reject Rotis Semi Serif is its mixing of roman and cursive glyphs - its as though the typeface cannot make up its mind. My contrasting font is Rotis Semi Sans, which shares the same fault. So I am really looking for cursive vertical replacement of the Rotis family.\n\nI may need to print off samples because I have observed that fonts look different on screen. Consequently, Stone is still in the running :)\n\n"

I have realised that nearly all typefaces look sweet in small samples and its only when you see them in blocks on a grid that they expose weaknesses. Those sites don't make it easy to trial fonts - do they have a refund option? :))\n\nBendy, it has crossed my mind but I do not want to make an ignorant typographic blunder. I am at the stage where I understand how to read typefaces, but perhaps not ready to make them. For example, if I drop cursive a and g into Minion, anyone who recognises the base font is going to immediately identify the customisation and critique it. I might not be ready for that :)\n\nMay I ask, why did you refer to Rotis as pretentious? I do not disagree, I'm just curious to understand your meaning. For example, I see that the e descends below the line and it has other curious qualities. I think it would be interesting to read the creator's rationale.\n\n"

I'm sure some would be happy to customise their work, for a fee, it's worth asking at least.\n\nAnother option would be to look at the glyphs and see if the fonts contain phonetic letters, where you could find cursive variants.\n\nPretentious...the semiserif version at least pokes me in the eye with its 'too cool for school' self-conscious c and e. And the mechanical mix of serif and sans forms seems to combine the worst of both worlds. An interesting and deliberate but rather unsatisfying lack of unity. I once had to read a whole book in Rotis semiserif.\n\n"

In other words, I suggest there might be a good idea that has yet to be well implemented.\n\n"
