Alternatively, is there any family or cut of a solid \"western\" font (like Helvetica, Meta, Frutiger...) that includes letters of this exotic alphabet?\n\nThanks in advance!  \nThomas\n\n",

So, loosely based on Eurostyle, and on our requirements – it had to be bold, striking and compatible with a western font – we comissioned a custom-built typeface for the client, including three weights and Italics.  \nIt was primarily used in news graphics, channel programming and on-air menus, but soon found it's way to the website, you can see some examples here: [http://www.1tv.ge](http://web.archive.org/web/20130726020022/http:/www.1tv.ge/ \"http://www.1tv.ge\")\n\nUnfortunately the font is used exclusively in-house and not out there, as far as I know.  \nWe hired a native speaker/reader and tried our best to judge the effort, but if there are any mother-tongue readers out there, it would be interesting to hear their opinion about it!\n\nKeeping my fingers crossed for more good fonts in that alphabet,  \nThomas\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130726020022im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eurostyle_GEO_6330.jpg)\n\n"

A vague \"some problems\" and \"May I ask who did the work?\" and suggestion to better \"search for a developer here on Typophile\" is not an appropriate answer. The right answer would have been to tell what the problems are.

I have however made two Georgian fonts (one a \"progressive\" display face\\*, the other a run-of-the-mill text face), and as a non-native I appreciate what sorts of issues can go ignored (I was lucky to have the help of a semi-native professor at UCLA, as well as a native reader) and I see some of that here.  \n2) A native reader helps a lot when you're lacking a native type designer, but it's not enough by itself.  \n3) Most of all: it's too late. Any feedback at this point is largely academic. Certainly not a total waste, and it's nice to see a post-factum request for feedback, but I'd rather spend my own (inadequately managed) energies on things that can make a difference to a lot of people.\n\n\\* [http://themicrofoundry.com/f\\_akhalkalak.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130726020022/http:/themicrofoundry.com/f_akhalkalak.html \"http://themicrofoundry.com/f\\_akhalkalak.html\")\n\nhhp\n\n"

Since my team initially didn't plan to create a custom font, we didn't have the time to develop the font with the help of expert eyes and the broader discussion as we have it here.  \nGiven the enormously short development time, I'm really happy with the results, as is the client. But I'm sure that the font is imperfect. Meticulous analysis would be disproportionate - it's too late after all. However, if some native reader or native designer stumbles upon this discussion thread, I'd still be very interested to hear which impression it left on them.\n\nThrough a partnering company in Russia, we got in contact with Merab K. Getsadze who is the type designer. He is as far as I know Georgian or of Georgian descent.\n\n"
