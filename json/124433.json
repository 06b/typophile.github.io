And i need your help!\n\nI'm would like to hear which software for fontdesign is your number one choice? Fontlab, Glyphs, other? (and maybe why?)  \nDoes the company behind the software, and its appearence on the market matter to you?\n\nGreetings from Denmark, and thank you so much for you time!\n\n",

      "content": "Hello Bjorn\n\nI started out digital font design playing with Font Creator. It covered just the basics and a decade later I found that it has been developed further.  \nFont Forge seemed more professional but the learning curve was high. The same for Fontlab, but so many people use Fontlab and were helpful it has been my software of choice. In the beginning I designed with Illustrator and transferred to Fontlab, but eventually did all my outlines in Fontlab which is great for that.  \nAll of the above however have some serious limitations for working with complex scripts (i.e. Arabic) in some of their functions.  \nI had to use MS VOLT to finalize the OpenType features necessary to make Arabic fonts work properly.  \nIn addition I have used TransType to create web fonts.  \nI tried Glyphs demo version and found its user interface very appealing, but did not explore it in any detail, although I heard some professionals in fonts recommend it highly.  \nHope this helps.\n\nVladimir\n\n"
