  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nMy boss ask me if I can present a font chart where i place every fonts in many different sizes, bold, italic, all caps and also try them with paragraphs with different spaces and tracking to check the best one. I made a brief sample in InDesign like this:\n\n[http://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1udvYBNMWf7W6Gdi6twWRVnriFFsX0](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905135028/http:/www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1udvYBNMWf7W6Gdi6twWRVnriFFsX0 \"http://www.pixentral.com/show.php?picture=1udvYBNMWf7W6Gdi6twWRVnriFFsX0\")\n\nWe do have quite many of them, so to avoid a quite boring job, i would like to know if after i made the chart in an InDesign A4 file, let´s say i chose Garamond for the first chart and apply the same characteristic to Helvetica in the next page and so for.\n\nIs there any way that i select all the different font boxes an apply a different font name to the whole page without going text by text and paragraph by paragraph? Maybe there is some script or way of doing this very mechanical and boring task.\n\nThanks a lot for any idea.  \nBest regards,  \nSebastiao\n\n [‹ Apple and CFF: what's the deal?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905135028/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37122 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Is Leopard OS good to go now? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905135028/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39789 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
