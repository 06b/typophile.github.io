A great and very legible typeface for fine offset printing. (Surprisingly the shape of the q does not seem to disturb the legibility, although I think it is larksome and not needed to vary from the \"normal\" shape of the q.)\n\n"

Jenson’s books were exquisite; his paper, proportion, and typesetting are simply fabulous. So as long as there are books, there will be book designers who have sought out Jenson’s work and let it influence theirs.\n\n"
