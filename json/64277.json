My first guess was something from Nick Curtis, but I can't find anything of his that matches. Thanks in advance for the help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234005im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kit2logopng_5056.png)\n\n- Lex\n\n",

If so, Adrian must have found inspiration in Alf Becker's book. See Red Rooster's [Saint Louis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234005/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/saint-louis-rr/). I notice the 'a' is a different style, but otherwise the resemblance is startling.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
