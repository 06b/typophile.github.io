I like the squareish loopy bits on the capitals, and the chunky bowls on the lowercase letters, and the triangular ends of the c and k.   \n   \nCan anyone tell me if whoever did this did it on purpose, or if it's just an old font back from when you couldn't do so much with them?   \n   \nIt's just called ScriptC on my computer, and there's not much interesting information if I open it up in my Fonts control panel.   \n   \nThanks,   \n   \nBrian\n\n",
