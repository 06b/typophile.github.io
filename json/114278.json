  "content": "Hi  \nCan anyone help with identifying the font used in this stamp please? I'm not sure if the distressed look is inherent to the font design or an effect of stamping. On the same note, I'm not sure whether the character alignment is irregular or whether the letters have been stamped individually.  \nAny help is very much appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141014073921im_/http:/typophile.com/files/seventy_4864.jpg)\n\n",
