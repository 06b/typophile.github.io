Create some type on white backround. Rasterize the type.   \n2. Use eraser tool with grunge brushes to wear out the text. Add some filter-\\>distort-\\>ripple and pinch/punch etc.   \n3. Add layer effects, some white inner glow looks nice. Flatten the image   \n4. Make a different image that has a paper texture. Paste the stamp on the background, use blend mode \"multiply\"   \n   \nEdit: Oops...I should've thought about his a bit more, now there isn't any inking in the corners...   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142206im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24464.jpg)\\</font\\>\n\n"
