  "content": "I enjoy writing in calligraphy, and I want to make a font that looks renaissance in style, with a stress on the pen and a humanist angle. I am showing an early sketch below. I don't have anyone to show it to, or ask my questions to, so hopefully you can help me make it decent. Parts of it look very chancery cursive-like, while the capitals, which I haven't started yet, will probably have more renaissance 'flair'..possibly. But please let me know what you think!   \n   \nSo here's the first JPG. I'll put down a few of my initial questions/concerns following..   \n   \n ![scan01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060709230231im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif)   \n   \nIs this looking like a renaissance typeface?   \nI like the tall ascenders, but how badly will this hurt it if I try to use it in text?   \nSome of the letters are kinda tipsy, like the b and d, but if the uprightness seems okay, they'll be more like the third h, the l and the k.   \nI have specific questions for several letters, but I'll see if it's worth continuing first. The only g that I like is the one marked down at the bottom. The marks on the w, b, and e just mean that I like those versions better than the previous versions on the page.   \n   \nAll comments welcome. It's my first attempt at a typeface, but I'm very determined to make it work. Thanks in advance! I have sketches prior to these, so let me know if you want to see previous versions or process of any of the letters.   \n   \n�Brian\n\n",

      "content": "i am by no means an expert on calligraphy, but a friend of mine has made several calligraphic fonts that you can view and download from [his website](http://web.archive.org/web/20060709230231/http:/mysite.freeserve.com/Kingthings/fonts/fonts.htm). Kevin's a good guy and perhaps he could be some help at giving you a crit on calligraphic letter forms. In any case his fonts are great to look at for inspiration, I think you may want to take a look at his Petrock for this one, as i think (i could be very wrong) that it is of a similar style as what you are trying to do. Hope this helps!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the link. I like the \"shape\" of calligraphic letters.. the angles mixed in with the round forms; something the petrock light really does well.   \nI've been doing some more reading, and I'm redoing all of my letters..they're too handwritten/calligraphic. Hopefully it will turn out as something of a cross between jenson/bembo and calligraphy.. leaning more towards calligraphy. (the cradle!) \\*\\* Not to say it will look as good as jenson or bembo.. but that's the direction i'm re-aiming. ;)\n\n"
