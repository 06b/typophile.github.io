The idea is that if you need something done in a script font, you have one that was designed to match perfectly (e.g., you can get rid of the fora where people ask \"What sans font goes well with [insert serif font]?\"). The changes might be small or large. In my font, I have a 5 faces so far, and as you can see they all share certain qualities. The same x-, ascender, and descender heights, same colour (at least that's the goal), etc.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192629im_/http:/typophile.com/files/coruna_serial_example_5128.png)\n  \nThe sans versions are tests I made a long time ago and haven't returned to them, hence the atrocious letter-spacing. The basic idea for me of a serial is that you have a multitude of fonts that, whilst potentially very different in appearance, can be used together with a guarantee that they will \"match\". \n\nA (far better) example might be the Daam \"Entity\" by hrant, each of the faces DominationAvailable, Cristaal, and Brutaal, each go perfectly together yet have serve very different purposes.

Unfortunately, until I'm done with my thesis I can't put in a lot of hardcore work on the font, and only get a character or two done every here and there as of late. But, the sample layouts I've done so far have the serif version for the body text, and of course italic as necessary. For captions and footnotes, the sans version is being used. This isn't too unlike a lot of journal style guidelines, where all figures and their captions must use sans-serif fonts. I doubt I'll use the fraktur variant for the book though.\n\nOne practical use for a font like hrant's (He normally posts rabidly on here, but on another thread someone said he's on vacation or something like that) would be for setting Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. If you've read it, you'll rememmber that flashbacks/forwards were designated only by italicising the text. This was not the original way that Faulkner intended, rather, he wanted the different time switches to be represented by type setting that entire passage in a different colour. But, with many pages needing then three+ colours, for novel, it was considered too pricey at the time. (The only novel I can think of off the top of my head with a multi-colour printing in that style is House of Leaves, where the most commonly available edition prints the word \"house\" in blue, all certain passages in red. The \"full version\" also has parts in purple and (!) braille.) However, one could design a series of faces in the vein of Daam and have a different way of signally the transitions betwixt times, basing them off of the different feelings the narrators had on them.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

In fact, let's for once be brutally honest. There is a relationship: it's called type fatigue. He's done too much.\n\nWhat would be more interesting to explore is the question whether formal relation (between for example sans and serif) is desirable or not. This is far from established. There is a lot of hype based on the aesthetically unproven assumption that a formally related sans and serif are desirable. [Really? Contrast does not exist as a beneficial force in art since cave drawings?] Clearly, a lot of this is hype and simply not to be taken seriously in a serious study. It is as bad as the assumption (which I have never found to be the case) that there exists, anywhere, a designer who is equally good at designing serif and sans serif type. I am speaking of course only about the very highest level of endeavour.\n\nEvery effort to form an italic from roman models has proved disastrous in the end. The best illustration is the very first integrated type family, Romulus. The ideal italic is not formally related to a roman; it is above all a contrasting element. Why should this not be true also of the sans serif that might be used in contiguous composition? That leaves the bold - - - the late 19th century bolds were not slavish replicas of romans but simply darker types that happened to work acceptably and agreeably with romans. I see no reason why this should not work today. I would even go so far as to say that it is more important to have a well-designed, well-implemented bold than to have a bold that is closely, literally formally related to the roman.\n\nThere is an impulse in these kinds of discussion that I deeply distrust. That impulse is the one that seeks to find a basis for type in some art or graphic theory. For me, it must always start at the functional level of the reader and the act of reading.\n\nAs everyone who has ever made a sans from a roman knows, you can't stick to the formal recipe blindly. That's because, as you see at once,\n\n\\_a Sans Serif has a vernacular of its own\\_\n\nand that is different from the vernacular of a serif typeface\n\njust as the vernacular of italic is different from the vernacular of roman\n\nTrying to impose unity on a family of types is to deny and disrespect that each constituent of a type family may have a vernacular and vernacular associations which should be honoured.\n\nAt any rate, that's a possible argument.\n\n"

GM News and GM Sans share x-height, extender length, stroke widths, some cheirographically informed joints, and general horizontal proportions, but the two alternates are conceived as the poles of a Humanist/Modernist axis. GM News is \"some serifs\" and old-style, whereas GM Sans is plain and modern. In the newspaper, the two variants are used in a variety of ways, e.g.  \n- For text emphasis, highlighting a word in a headline;  \n- For immediate layout contrast, as when a GM Sans overhead sits above a GM News headline; the most interesting of these is the contrast between a GM News italic (6 degree slant, classic old-style letter shapes) and GM Sans (10 degrees, a slanted version of the Roman);  \n- At the document level: GM News is the headline face in the news sections, GM Sans in the feature sections.\n\n[http://www.shinntype.com/Specimens/G&M.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192629/http:/www.shinntype.com/Specimens/G&M.pdf \"http://www.shinntype.com/Specimens/G&M.pdf\") for the type specimen,  \n [http://www.newseum.org/media/dfp/pdf7/CAN\\_TGAM.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192629/http:/www.newseum.org/media/dfp/pdf7/CAN_TGAM.pdf \"http://www.newseum.org/media/dfp/pdf7/CAN\\_TGAM.pdf\") for the usage (most of the sans fonts on the front page are GM News, but the overheads and sidebar text are GM Sans).  \nThese stylistic variants provide an extended design space for modernist page layouts, enabling many ways to contrast text while maintaining color and stroke contrast -- this equivalence being important to maintain the effect of locating the type on the plane of the page as flat graphic elements, without suggesting pictorial depth, which is what happens with stroke contrast.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nThere are cultural axes in several of my type families, Panoptica being the most diverse to the extent of becoming an alphabet system, rather than a typeface.  \nUnusual design axes in some other of my work:  \nCultural: Eunoia; trendyness -- 1) Art Deco (1930s), 2) Op Art (1960s), 3) Techno (1990s)  \nFormal: Monkey; Spacing -- 1) visually pleasing spacing, kerned, 2) tight-but-not touching equidistant spacing. 3) monowidth.  \nFormal: Handsome; writing tool -- \"a choice of pens\".  \nFormal: Fontesque Ornaments -- the family principle applied to ornament, with optical scaling, monoline/stressed members, and plain/solid members.  \nFormal: Brown Gothic -- text and display variants of a sans, optically scaling the \"distress\" axis.\n\n"

The distinction I'm making is between serifed faces with stroke contrast, and sans serif faces that are nominally monolinear. Modernist page layouts are typically the Swiss or International Style of layout, not something involving Didone faces.  \nThe challenge in the Globe was to handle a multi-element hierarchy in a modernist layout; usually in newspapers, that complexity is organized around contrasting sans types with serif types, but serif types undermine the flat graphic quality of the modernist layout. The solution was to use all sans display type, with contrast between stylistic variants of the same sans face -- \"some serifs\" (humanist) and plain (geometric).  \nAs you say, \"it must always start at the functional level of the reader\", and that provided the impetus and the context for those stylistic variants.\n\n_I find a little too light._\n\nIf not a \"cultural\" design axis, how then would you describe, with suitable gravitas, non-interpolatable relationships between typeface family members?

None of your exemplars merit gravitas-containing bandwidth, which is always in short supply. All you are doing here is devaluing the meaning of gravitas itself. You are using it like an ad-man. Your motives are transparently self-serving: self advertisement. A blog is not the best place to do that kind of thing so blatantly, because you are bound to get slagged.

How do you think it'll run? What can I do to improve it?'\n\nYou don't have to worry about the client seeing the post. The client who buys that kind of hype probably doesn't read type blogs.\n\nIn the meantime has anyone got anything serious to say about Peter's original question? It seems he is not going to have an easy time writing this article. It looks like the one historically important designer who tried to conceptualize a wide-ranging type family was van Krimpen, and further, that it was most notably a failure in several respects. Of the two italics, one couldn't be set, and the other couldn't be stood. The sans experiments weren't successful either. It strikes me as significant that this is a subject very little discussed by the older generation of type designers -- those who really know how to design type -- such as Stone, Carter, Unger, Zapf, Frutiger, etc. It's also significant that there is no attempt in Font Bureau's ambitious Poynter family to embrace this kind of light aesthetospeak. I am almost ready to dismiss the talk of relationships as pure salesmanship.\n\nOh, for a milligram of gravitas!\n\n"

Scala sans does not make so many firsts as Martin claims, and surely he knows about the celebrated Today Sans?\n\nThe first sans serif superfamily was Volker Küster's Today Sans Serif, 1987. Two optical axes, extra light to extra bold, lining and osf figures, small caps, all f-ligs, true italic, ad infinitum, ad gloriam. An astonishing achievement for its day, and, still, today.\n\nActually it is wrong to speak of axes here, and earlier in Nick's post. Axis should only be used where interpolability is possible, for obvious reasons (i.e, the word only exists in type to describe practical, interpolable extremes; style is probably usually the best word to describe something that is related but not interpolable). Some use was made of interpolation in Today, but for example the extra bold weights could not be designed to be interpolable, and the optical axes are not practically interpolable either.\n\nDrawings exist, in some stage of completion, for condensed and expanded versions of Today, but Küster seems to have lost interest in typeface design.

Another cultural axis is that they are being marketed as a package -- present day technological and economic considerations are involved in that (sorry, bit of a circular argument). Implicit too is the understanding that these kinds of faces are often used together, again, a cultural understanding of genre. But was the Splendid concept successful? Have art directors produced layouts with three or four of these fonts together on the same page?\n\nThe issue here: although non-interpolatable styles may be part of the same family, is it more a conceptual or taxonomic kinship than a functional one? To what extent do typographers create layouts using both the sans and serif versions of a typeface? How much contrast is enough? As an art director, the only time I've used sans/serif contrast within a family, sort of, was combining with Perpetua and Gill Sans.\n\nIn her talk on Morris Benton at TypeCon, Juliet Shen noted that his Clearface types -- the serif and the sans -- were closely related physically, and placed a few pages apart in the same section of the 1923 ATF catalog. So the relationship ATF presented was a bit vague and unrealized, in terms of physical kinship, marketability, and usability (they were not shown in the same faux layout).\n\n"

In this respect, Times Roman is similar, and many Didone Italics have median serifs that are hooked in the regular weight, but flat in the bold weight.\n\nWorking on the modern/oldstyle versions of the Globe sans types, I found that what I was doing, for the purpose of adequate differentiation, was trying to drive the styles as far apart as possible, to the poles of their relationship, as it were -- so this too suggested that the relationship was axial.  \nAnd within this major modern/oldstyle axis, I found there were sub-axes; for instance horizontal proportion -- varied in the oldstyle, more equal in the modern; terminal treatment -- angled and slightly bent in the oldstyle, straight and perpendicualr in the modern; joint style -- pronounced in the oldstyle, neat in the modern. In each of these \"parts of speech\" of the design grammar, I had the option of varying the amount of difference between the two polarities.\n\nHere's something from 1938, \"The following Alternate Characters are put up in separate fonts at quoted prices and when used with Series No. 140, shown on preceding page, gives a very pleasing effect.\"\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192629im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tourist_3546.jpg)\n\n"

I hate to say it, but I see here a possible genesis for the alternate characters in what is surely one of the most original of all typefaces, Renner's Steile Futura. How could _anything_ in Steile come from such an undistinguished source? Yet it seems inferentially to be the case. Oh, this is awful! Similarly, some of the most admirable of Zapf's and Frutiger's ideas can be found in Goudy, in pre-war German types, etc. etc.\n\nNevertheless, I wouldn't call them an axis or a design axis. What I resent about broadening the term is that it was invented by Adobe (if it really was invented by Adobe -- I would want to check this) to mean a very specific thing. I think we should respect that specific thing, and come up with a different term if style is inadequate. I can see why you are unhappy with style, or with some variant thereof, such as 'integrated style'; I can see the need for an extension of the terminology -- not, necessarily, as far as the type world goes, but as far as the type to management world goes. Isn't there some better way of talking about this?\n\nThat said, what is interpolable? The very first Adobe MM with an intermediate master was ITC Garamond MM, which had one character which was not interpolable across the 'design axis' (is that a correct usage according to my admittedly inept but well-meant plea?) which required the intermediate master.\n\nA definition of a font axis which meant only an 'Adobe MM interpolable axis' would therefore still not be completely simple. It wouldn't be linear -- although non-linear interpolation may not have been considered practical at the time these terms were being dreamed up. But, as we know, the Adobe model is incredibly simplistic; we have gone far beyond that conceptually. So what are axes?\n\nI would vote that an axis should be something that is either literally linear or very near linear. Some other term is necessary. Is 'design space' the term we use for the totality of the design? The sum of the axes?\n\nHere's where style should not be extended, obviously as I had naively originally proposed. For example, we can speak of the design space, the axes, of Minion Roman. The design space, the axes, of Minion Italic are something quite different.\n\nSo, for elements within a design space that are not axes -- what are they? That's supposing that you are going to limit 'design space' to the classic Adobespeak.\n\n"

Strangely enough, Peter Bilak interviewed Martin Majoor (feb. 2003) and you can read it here: [http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview\\_martin\\_majoor.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010192629/http:/www.typotheque.com/articles/interview_martin_majoor.html \"http://www.typotheque.com/articles/interview\\_martin\\_majoor.html\"). The part I’m reffering to is: Small capitals come from an old tradition, but designing something like Scala Sans Italic Caps was not done before.\\<\n\nThis transparently self-serving article by Majoor is factually incorrect. But let's take just the points you apparently took from it. First of all you wrote that italic small caps did not exist before the 1990s. This is completely untrue. They have a long history.\n\nThen you wrote that sans serif small caps were not available before Scala. This is equally untrue. The first sans serif superfamily, explicitly containing every possible feature, was Today, as Majoor perfectly well knows. The other thing to keep in mind of course is that in metal you don't need an explicit small caps weight because you can usually use the caps of a couple of sizes smaller, and because of the optical reproportioning, they will have the correct appearance.\n\nSpeaking of optical reproportioning, Today has two optical sizes, Scala has only one, so it is still behind the curve.\n\nNow, further to test some of Majoor's claims about Scala, do yourself a favour. Set some paragraphs in Scala, and make sure you have plenty of instances of words set between the right and left single quotation marks. Things like 'this', etc. -- the kind of thing you often find in the kind of museum catalogues that Scala is often used for, in fact. Find out what is wrong with these sentences, and find out why it is wrong, which will require a little detective work. Hmmmm. A lot of thought went into making that mistake -- which I think may be unique in type history.\n\n'It is my conviction that you cannot be a good type designer if you are not a book typographer. I am not talking here about display types but about text types. A type designer must know how type works in a piece of text, he must know what happens with the type on different sorts of paper, he must know how a typeface behaves with different printing techniques.'\n\nYou can say that again, Martin!\n\n"

(I used an online translator for this word) Many designers talk about influences, inspiration or \"based upon...\". Every typeface is based upon its predecessors or certain elements from an ancient face are re-used in modern types. It's allmost like there is some family-tree which passes on \"type-genes\" onto the next generation.\n\nExample: Different versions of Garamond are based upon the same \"genetic code\" which lies in the orginal Garamond (15th century).

Evert mentions some typefaces which have such feature, but they are \"overdone\".\n\nThe point I wanted to make, but Nick corrected me allready and I believe he's right: Different sources of inspiration could been seen as \"fathers\" and \"mothers\" of a new typeface. The carry the genes of their predesesscors (?). Because the influence of the designer is so big, this aspect of being a family is not suitable for type.\n\nI'm not sure if I said it correctly...\n\n"

Instead I think voice is a factor in the overall effect. Put another way; voice is important is only one aspect and may even be deliberately worked against to good effect.\n\nIt is definitely time for me to go back & re-read Evert!\n\n"
