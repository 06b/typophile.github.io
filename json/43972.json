This will create plain text marked up with your styles, and at the head is a complete definition of all styles. You’ll need to learn to decipher and wade through all the Adobe Tagged Text syntax (exporting as “verbose” rather than “abbreviated” makes it a little easier to decipher).\n\nNot ideal, perhaps, but maybe better than having to take a bunch of notes by hand.\n\n— K.\n\n"
