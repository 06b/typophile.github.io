  "content": "Okay I'll try this again...   \nI know there are no current applications that support this feature, but it seems that there is a moderate amount of interest in random fonts at least from what i read here on these boards.   \nAnyhow, I've wondered about the \"rand\" feature. Would it be set up like:   \nsub x from [x x.salt1 x.salt2 x.salt3 (etc.)]   \nand then the application would randomly pick from within that set? or is there a more ideal way that this would be set up?   \nunfortunately, i doubt any apps will support this feature anytime soon, but it'd be nice to know how this feature would be written in theory.\n\n",
