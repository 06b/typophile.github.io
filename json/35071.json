Still looking for the Typo on London Underground, or for the very first issue?_\n\nThen rejoice, we have some good news. Together with our publisher, we arranged to re-print the issues which have run out, and starting with July, you may order any of the older issues. So, if you have been looking for some of the older issues, you may now order them via our e-shop at: [www.magtypo.cz](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012195758/http:/www.magtypo.cz/buxus/generate_page.php?page_id=104). The payment can be made in Euro or USD, with a **credit card** or via the **PayPal** account.\n\nIn the same place, you may, naturally, also order a **subscription** of the magazine. The same options as for the ordering of older issues apply, that is, a Euro/USD, credit card or PayPal payment. Enjoy the summer with [Typo Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012195758/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typo%20Magazine)!\n\nFilip Blazek\n\n",
