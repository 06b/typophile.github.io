      "content": "Contemporary living, is that modernism?  \nIf so, a bit apologetic -- like yes, modernism is still up-to-date, really, even after post-modernism.  \nGo, modernity!\n\nThe content is almost all hard-surfaced, perpendicular and sharp cornered, yet all three typefaces used are at odds with that sentiment, and unrelated to one another:\n\nCocon: a sans softened by mannerist detail. The most contemporary thing about the site.  \nGeorgia: a Scotch (19th century) design. Surely the other Microsoft default, Verdana, would have been more in sync. (Or the ultimate default, Helvetica/Arial.)  \nThe serif tag-line, an old-style (antiqua) face. OK for Palladio...\n\nIf you're going for the classic mid-century, retro-modern vibe, something like the 1960s face Eurostile would capture the tone better:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017222425im_/http:/typophile.com/files/contempo_5848.jpg)\n\nWhy didn't you choose unusual types with plastic qualities and connotations that harmonize with those of your unusual subject matter?\n\n"
