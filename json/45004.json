      "content": "Eben:\n\nI’m assuming you know the little book called “The Centaur Types” by Bruce Rogers? Chicago: October House, 1949. Maybe this has some of that info on alternate sorts? I recall that in one part it talks about—I think—some alternate uppercase sorts For the Montaigne type that was Centaur’s precursor.\n\nI’m not sure where you can get this book. A few years ago a bunch of copies came on the market. Maybe through APHA. I’d reckon some libraries with good holdings about type would have it. There was also an even smaller book about that type published by I cannot recall whom; sorry. Both of mine, like most of my type books, are buried away. I need a few hundred feet of new bookshelves in this old house.\n\npowers\n\n"

There was a set of different caps cut for its use at the Metropolitan museum and its Press.\n\nBut maybe when you say “alternative glyphs” maybe you mean something beyond just alt caps at a different size.\n\nGood luck with this.\n\npowers\n\n"

What I am hoping to find is predictable if you have followed the topic of my posts. ;-)\n\nI am wondering if Bruce found that the type he had to work with had clashes or gaps and that he may have created an alternative sort to use instead for better fitting. If he did make alt letters that is just one of many reasons he may have done it. He could have also made an alternative swash or just tried to make a type look more even on the page or correct a poorly weighted S for all I know. But talking to Kay I started to get an idea that it might have been the case that the special cuts may have been to correct a fitting problem in existing type, and certainly Blumenthal might well have had a special interest in such things as well given his history with his own design: Spiral.\n\nHopefully I will also talk to the Author of Humane Letters today and see what he has to say. His name is Richard Landon. He works at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library in Toronto.\n\n"

      "content": "I checked all of the indexed citations for Centaur, but I’m not sure what Ms. Amert was referring to, since I found no reference to any kind of contextual alternates like you’re interested in.\n\nThe closest I could come were the various references to the fact that the design had to be subtly altered when it was adapted for Monotype setting in a full range of sizes.\n\nHere is the most relevant quotation:\n\n“Having the Centaur type cut has meant 3 or 4 times the amount of work I anticipated — besides all the unlooked-for delays. It was necessary to make 4 sets of patterns to cover the great range of sizes — with individual modifications of certain letters, almost without number. The design called for so many departures from their usual practices that even after the first size was satisfactorily made, they were all at sea about the other sizes — and I was equally so, except by experiment. So really I’ve made _four_ types.”\n\nThis is quoted from a letter to Carl Purington Rollins on 9 Feb 1930. [from <cite>Bruce Rogers : A Life in Letters</cite> by Joseph Blumenthal, page 115; published by W. Thomas Taylor, 1989.]\n\nI’d be willing to bet that all the extra adaptation was as much BR’s notorious perfectionism as anything else. That and struggling against the unitized constraints of Monotype. In other words, probably not the kind of contextual motivations you’re looking for.\n\n— Kent.\n\n"

I found this piece not in the Blumenthal book, but in BR’s own <cite>Pi : A Hodge-Podge of Letters, Papers, Addresses, written during a period of 60 years</cite> [The World Publishing Company, 1953].\n\n“The first cutting was admirably done by Robert Wiebking, of Chicago, and though certain modifications of the the design were made by him, they were in almost every instance improvements on my pattern. Several of the least satisfactory letters have been recut from time to time in the effort to better them.” [pp. 55-56]\n\nThis is taken from a Printer’s Note he wrote for the first book printed with the Monotype re-cutting of Centaur in 1929.\n\nAgain, it seems BR’s revision of any Centaur glyphs is motivated by perfectionism, not contextual adaptation.\n\nOkay, back to work now ;-)\n\n— K.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Kent! It does start to sound likely that Kay was conflating the two ideas. The other thing is that she didn’t have any of the Centaur work in mind but rather extra glyphs for other people’s existing types. This would have been pre-centaur. Still, it is also quite true that it may well turn out that he wasn’t making something to be used contextually with the existing glyph but rather as a refinement as you have just described.\n\nMaybe there will be something in “Humane Letters”. I’ll let you know if anything turns up.\n\n"

Sorry.\n\nI’m not going to try to run this down, but I’ll reiterate my suspicion that if anything of this sort was done, it was along the lines of customizing the look of a face and improving perceived shortcomings, not contextual alternates. Something like what Porter Garnett requested with Van Krimpen’s Lutetia when he wanted it for the Frick art collection catalog [see <cite>Letters of Credit</cite>, pp. 10304].\n\n— K.\n\n"

And if you were to run short mid-composition and had to cast more, you might throw a tweak in on the way.\n\nIt seems to me though that those few Jenson’s I have clapped my own eyes on, even when they held some variety, did also have a kind of “cast of characters” eg a1, a2, a3 and so on that had distinctive feature sets even through the haze of printing variables.\n\nStill, thats only what I \\*think\\* I see so far.
