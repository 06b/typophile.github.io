Two weeks ago Bringhurst told me he was \"finishing up\" the third edition, so I'm thinking it will be just a few months.   \n   \nOn a side note, of all the business/technology books I've read, _Information Rules_ is the most interesting, readable, solidly thought out and well-grounded. It is to the business strategy and economics of high tech and software what _Elements_ is to typography.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"
