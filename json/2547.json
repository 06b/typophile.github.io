I never knew there was a lowercase to this, very interesting. My previous attribution was based on something I saw in a magazine (the art director of \"Fader\" used Bustle for headlines, and in the colophon it was atributed to Glaser as its original designer).   \n   \n ![babyfat](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218044430im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23552.gif)   \n   \n   \nWhile I was looking for the Photo Lettering book I came across these two faces from a sample book from Typographic Innovations Inc.
