But I don’t think a firm like Pentagram “just” chose anything. I believe everything was thought out, tracked out and chosen to perfection. My “twist” had a concept behind it in the beginning. But by overworking it, I have strayed and lost it. Let’s see what I get in round 2 (more like 12 :)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Sugo - I think the ’S’ should be the same too. Nice considered choice of typeface - v good. I don’t know if you saw my post earlier but we are also updating our logo (Profile1). We are stuck between using pure Avant Garde or modifying it with one or two tweaks. I change my mind between the two at least three times every fifteen minutes! I have always loved Avant Garde - the KING of the geometric sans. I think you have to be extremely careful when you are tweaking such a fine piece of work. The amount of consideration and time that has gone into our tweaked version is huge - but i’m still not sure it’s even close to looking as good as the original set type. It so easy to do toooooo much.\n\n"

      "content": "The type weights you are using do not feel like they are harmonizing together. I feel like the word DESIGN is eventually going to give out to the massive weight of SUGO. Maybe the word SUGO can come down in type size, while keeping it bold.\n\nPlus the letter spacing feels really tight. Words in all upper caps always need a little extra space between them.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n-Joe\n\n"

I wanted to make the logo more solid, more grounded than it was in the original typeface.\n\nPlease link me to your previous post.
