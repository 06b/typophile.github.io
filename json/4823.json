I've created a bunch of custom fonts before, which contained my own drawings as characters. However now I need to create this font to look like our existing Myriad Pro text.   \n   \nI only need Upper/lower A-Z for this, plus [] and (). These will look like this:   \n   \n  ![How it should look](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018224712im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/36178.jpg)   \n   \nThis corresponds to:   \nEnglish language/Great Britain   \nFrench/France   \nHellenica (Greek)/Greece   \nJapanese/Japan   \netc...   \n   \nAre there open-source/free font designs that I can use that are somewhat similar to the Myriad Pro Bold Condensed font I used for these? I don't want to use Adobe's outlines (like I did for this illustration) so that we don't have to worry about this font for internal company work.   \n   \nIs the best solution to just draw the entire font myself? I am just using the alphabet as a basis for the font I'll be creating, but I don't want to step on other people's design for my base glyphs, I only want to base the font on glyphs that I have the proper permission to derive my font from.   \n   \nClear as mud?\n\n",

It will allow you to center the cap combinations in the boxes better while still leaving room for fr and ja to be nicely centered.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
