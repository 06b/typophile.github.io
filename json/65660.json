  "content": "Hello all! As we all know, type design can be a very lonely venture. Typophile is an awesome cure for that. I’ve been posting to the much-appreciated Critique forum every now and then and got a good amount of help. But, I think I’ve reached a point of self-learning  \nsaturation, and where message board help isn’t enough. I feel like I’d benefit from personal guidance. And still, I’d like to use the internet to my advantage.\n\nSo, with the holiday spirit in the air, I’d like to ask if any wise vets out there would be willing to coach a motivated novice. All I’m asking for is to be able to send a few e-mails back and forth each month to discuss detailed improvements to my type design. I’m particulary interested in developing a better eye for the nuances that crate good text faces. I’ve been doing display fonts for a while and would like to eventually transition into making text type.\n\nIf I had the resources to pursue a professional degree in type design, I would. But it’s not possible for me right now. If anyone is interested in helping me out, please send a private message. Hopefully, I’m not overstepping any bounds by asking. Thanks!\n\n",

And usually it’s done quite consciously! I remember when I showed an early version of Harrier to a Famous Type Designer, he wanted to wipe out everything that I had tried to make special in it. So it’s important to judiciously filter out certain things and keep what you really need (a tricky business for sure). Also, the best critic tries to get inside the subject’s head and help _him_ get to where he wants to go.\n\nThe conference idea is solid. For one thing  \nyou can get quick crits from experts there.  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4070517923](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103013946/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4070517923 \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4070517923\")  \nAnd TypeCon LA is going to rule.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I create online courses for a living as an instructional designer at an Ontario community college.\n\nThere are three software tools we use (all have competitors). One is Elluminate, which allows real-time conferencing. The beauty of this is that it allows up to 24 students and a teacher (more with a higher licence) to meet and discuss things. As mentioned, the instructor can share software on his computer, or allow a student to share his software. This means the student can \\_do\\_ the thing that s/he is having trouble with, and the instructor can see what the problem is, usually instantly if it is a rookie mistake.\n\nTheoretically all classes could be done with this software, but in fact I only recommend it for an initial meeting, and for remedial help. The reason is that the biggest benefit of online instruction is the ability to work to your own schedule, and having a fixed meeting time elliminates this. (The software does allow a session to be recorded, which means those who can’t make the session can watch the replay, and also this means that if a student is having trouble with a point that last year’s class also had trouble with, the teacher has them watch the tape of last years remedial, and only has another one if they still have trouble.)\n\nThe second key piece of software we use is something called Captivate. This allows you to build tutorials where your computer screen is recorded, along with your voice (and any annotations you want to add to the screen later). This software, or something similar, is what they use to do the Lynda.com tutorials, if you are familiar with those.\n\nFinally, you need a learning management system. We use Angel, although WebCT, Blackboard, and Desire2Learn are commercial competitors, and Moodle and Sakai are the open source alternatives. These are course management tools and handle internal email, testing and marks, and holding the files. If you are working with a college or university, they should have one of these and will give you a course shell. If not, and you have strong software skills (can set up a server, for instance) then Moodle will work for you.\n\n(Thanks to hrant for pointing this thread out to me ... I’ve been off this week ... it is rough working in education ... and not following the threads).\n\n"
