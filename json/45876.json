  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs refered [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819231803/http:/typophile.com/node/42228) I started a new Sans inpired in those letters...special the \"a\". After some work, please find enclosed a PDF for comments...\n\nI made it without any contrast in lines and started to wonder if a little of it won't help the final result. I made a \"abc\" in both cases just to give you an ideia here this may go.  \nPlease feel free to ad comments!\n\nThanks in advanced.  \nAntónio Fonseca\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tipo2.pdf.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819231803/http:/typophile.com/files/tipo2.pdf.pdf) | 55.73 KB |\n\n",
