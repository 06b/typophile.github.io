In my current photo op, Boroondara Kew Cemetery, last week I stumbled across [what looks to be the grave of a Baskerville](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203142029/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/arboghast/2898366374/) who lived in the late 19th century, one George Baskerville.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203142029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/george_baskerville_4480.jpg)\n\nI plan to go back this week and take loads more pix of George Baskervile’s fallen tombstone. Many thanks to **flickr** pal [Tom Margie](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203142029/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/tom-margie/) for noticing the name on the monument.\n\nj a m e s\n\n",
