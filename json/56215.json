  "content": "So the very first time I submitted to Print I got into the Print Design Annual.\n\nIt was really great since that is my favorite design contest out there. However I have been submitting every year since and have not made it in again. So now they have raised their prices and I have lost a bit of my confidence...\n\nso my question is are design contests worth the money to submit and how can one tell when something is worth submitting?\n\nthanks!\n\n",

I think it was at the AGI student conference this past Spring where the panel was giving us advice about winning contests:\n\n- make it big, if it's printed and huge, it dwarfs everything when they're all laid out on the tables.\n- make it quickly/simply understood.\n- no complicated folding.. the first judge going through the work will unfold it and wont care to fold it back up.\n\n- Scott\n\n"

At this point in my career just seeing the satisfaction on a client's face once Ive given them something they appreciate is enough for me. Even encountering a piece of my portfolio in it's intended use years after designing it is satisfaction enough. I often feel like I've won an award just knowing people like and use my work. It is wonderful how my pieces show up in odd places and not a soul in the room can identify the connection between me and the design.  \nIt is delightful like being the writer of a book with a secret alias.\n\n"
