  "content": "I'm been a magazine designer for 15 years, but never feel like I've gotten the body typeface right when desiging a new magazine. I'm about to start design a magazine for a small college, and I really want to get a body typeface that works this time and has a bit of style to it.\n\nNot looking for anything radical, and it must be very readable, must have all the features of a good body font-available in several weights, well kerned, etc, but something with a little flair would be great.\n\nThis is a pretty small budget, so there isn't a ton to spend on a custom typeface or anything, but we enough to buy something new, and not have to rely on the old standby's that I have in my type library.\n\nWould love to hear people's suggestions.\n\nThanks,\n\n-J\n\n",
