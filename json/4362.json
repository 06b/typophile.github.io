Instead of having a traditional saints' feast days, like those that can be seen on church calendars, I'd like to try having a \"patron typographer,\" or something like that, for each day. Some of these typogragraphers/type designers would have further details/descriptions/portraits/work samples/etc., and some would only have their names listed.   \n   \nSo, who has a \"patron saint,\" whose spirit they try to channel for inspiration?   \n   \nConversely, does anyone have \"typographic demon,\" whose presence occasionally needs to be exorcised from your work?   \n   \nDan\n\n",

My calendar will have saints days on many days (like a third of them, so far). My list may not be long enough! Some saints are paired up on church calendars, too, making the list even longer.   \n   \nWhat I don't want to make is something like Pentagram's 2004 calendar. They got 12 designers (living and dead) picked. Each month has the days set in a different typeface. In addition to holidays, the 12 type designers birthdays are listed. That is a neat promo piece, but I'm not going to learn anything new from it. I'd like my calendar to be a bit more encyclopedic.   \n   \nSince we are on the subject of religion, let me issue a public mea culpa here for including GGL on my list!   \n   \nSince this will be my calendar, the list sort of follows my interests. I don't think that I could hurt my own feelings You'll notice that there are several \"Offenbachers\" on the list (Klingspors, Koch, Hoefer), since I'm studying there now, and am naturally interested on what happend there in the past.   \n   \nI'm going to have to stay steadfast with Gill, though. His work has inspired me for years. Although he most certaintly was, in some regards, a shady character, we are only speaking about allegations here. He has been dead since 1940, and rumors have a funny way of spreading. If you give me definitive legal evidence that he molested children, or engaged in rampant beastiality, I'll take him off my list. Ok?\n\n"
