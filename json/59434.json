      "content": "To me this seems most likely to be hand-drawn. The way the letters are fit together, and the way the double-l is drawn makes this unlikely to be a font, in my opinion.\n\nSome of the lettering artists at Letterhead fonts, like John Studden, could have done work like this, as I'm sure many other lettering artists could have done as well.\n\nIt's a difficult style to categorize, and that makes it even harder to search for. I looked at the Letterhead Fonts, Sudtipos and Rob Leuschke's work and found no matches. Maybe someone else has some ideas?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
