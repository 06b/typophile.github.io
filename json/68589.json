      "content": "Thank you both for your responses. Strangely, the problem seems to have fixed itself (almost). That is, if I go directly from MSWord using the Acrobat tab, the resulting PDF is much better looking than if I start with Acrobat and OpenFile. The tilde is still doesn't seem completely solid, but close enough. And yes, I did check the properties of the document, and it does contain the different forms of TNR. Thanks again.\n\n"
