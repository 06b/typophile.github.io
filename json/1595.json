      "content": "hi mike,   \n   \nI don't know if this will help you, but I've got a keyboard from apple for the G4. (it'a a little compact keyboard) The font what's been used for the typography of this keyboard has a great resemblance of the 'Univers Condensed Italic Light', according Berthold entitled no '48' (you know the Univers got a system of numbers)   \n   \nThe difference is that the typeface of the keyboard is slightly less slanted than the original Univers. The numbers and capitals are almost exactly the same, the $, ยง also. The & is different, but I think apple made a few corrections to the typeface. It's probably used exclusively by Apple.   \n   \nBut I don't know of your keyboard-type looks like the desktop-keyboard from the G4, but there might be a great change.   \n   \nOtherwise, when I'm wrong, please try to upload a picture from the keys   \n   \ngood luck   \n   \nM\n\n"
