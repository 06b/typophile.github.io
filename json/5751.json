I can't get over that Pirouette ( [http://www.linotype.com/91918/pirouette-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050816180319/http:/www.linotype.com/91918/pirouette-family.html)) is Tatento's first typeface.   \n   \nI wish that I were at TypeCon, too.   \n   \nEven cooler than Pirouette and Picture Yourself, in my opinion, was Linotype's decision to fly the winners themselves (unfortunately, not all of the winners were able to attend) to SF, and put them up during the TypeCon week. It makes me kick myself for not having entered the ITDC 2003 contest myself (not that I have any designs that would have won anything...)   \n   \n(Joe, your links in the above message don't take me anywhere ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20050816180319im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif) )\n\n"

It was a really great conference - quite possibly the best ever I've been to - although it'll take weeks to see it objectively - as with anything so heady. It was great to be back. Special thanks to Tamye.   \n   \nBTW, Miles, TC98 was special, wasn't it\\*. The giddy \"exploring the unknown\" delight is gone now, but in terms of value and pure rockin' fun 2004 rules bigtime, and apparently it gets better every year. Helsinki or New York... Now that's an open question.   \n   \n\\* And talking to Stuart it's clear that feeling is pervasive - something magical happened back then. And maybe it was my imagination, but whenever two of us from the Old School (like Brian, Allen, Richard, James, Simon) eyed each other in SF we had this certain knowing, quiet smile. Bob was there too. But I guess this conference will generate its own nostalgia as well.   \n   \nBTW, thanks to Jared and Joe (duh), Typophile was like a subcurrent running through the entire conference: most blind intros referenced this place, even particular threads! Major symbiosis. Or mutual parasitism. ;-)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Maybe the first TypeCon--whichever one it was--will always have a special quality that can't be repeated.   \n   \nAs far as meatspace vs. online goes, when you talk to someone in person, you have much less opportunity to be misunderstood because you not only get the words, you also get body language, facial expression, tone of voice, etc., and it's much harder to forget another person's humanity when they're standing right in front of you.   \n   \nI think a good portion of what passes as debate online simply comes down to the difficulty of communicating through such a limited medium as text. They touched on this a bit in the Underware Typeradio presentation.\n\n"
