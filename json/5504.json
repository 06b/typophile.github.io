The new Kerry-Edwards logo is not doing it for me.It's U.S. Constitution Party grade stuff. Weak font, clip art flag design -- a major downgrade from the old Kerry logo.\" \"Modest Mouse\" added, \"they could at least put up a decent Kerry/Edwards header at [http://www.johnkerry.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051600/http:/www.johnkerry.com/) -- it looks so tacky!

But it's perfectly alright for text work in print, lacking only kerning, which InD can supply \"optically\", for those who care.   \n   \nMiller and Fenway would be no good, as I said -- Georgia is a good choice for a campaign, because it is easily available to grassroots workers.   \n   \nBeing a scotch roman Miller, even if it were available widely, is too \"businessy\" -- those fancy serifed news faces are Republican, but even something more tabloid would not be as broad-based in its familiarity and appeal as Georgia. Fenway -- no idea what that looks like, who sells it?   \n   \nI'm not so sure that \"display\" weights are best for banners. They are often glimpsed from afar, or seen reproduced on TV or web images (as held by a person in the crowd at the top of this thread), so a strong image is probably better.   \n   \nAlso, the \"logo\" will suffer considerable abuse (as on the Kerry website, where the type is horizontally scaled), so you want a typeface that works in the lowest common denominator, and a web font is a good choice.   \n   \nAny alternative (say, with alternate versions of the logo for different media) that required style guide management and logo cops would be unworkable for a political campaign!   \n   \nAs for the flag, it's not too bad, and I suspect that \"some style\" would be too much style for a presidential election campaign.\n\n"
