I know FontLab has [TransType](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142154/http:/www.fontlab.com/html/transtype.html), and I believe there are other tools around, possibly even shareware/freeware. (I use Fontographer to convert PC to Mac when needed, but that's a different investment.)\n\n"

It doesn't have the mix of angular & normal letters that Labomatik has, or the ink-trap design detail (as far as I can see in the samples), but it is quite similar in concept, to my eyes.\n\n"
