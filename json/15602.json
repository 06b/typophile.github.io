Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG). The typeface was commissioned by a group of German printers, who wanted a good text face that would appear the same on all three metal type mechanisms used at the time (hand-set foundry type, the [Linotype Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype%20Machine), and the [Monotype Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Monotype%20Machine)). Its design was based on [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garamond).\n\nSabon was later converted for use on photo-typesetting machines. Still later, it was made available in digital format. The digital Sabon is distributed by [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype).\n\nIn 2001–2002, [Jean François Porchez](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jean%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Porchez) revived and extended Sabon, creating the type family [Sabon Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Sabon%20Next). Sabon Next is distributed by [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype), and is part of their [Platinum Collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Platinum%20Collection).\n\n[Linotype's website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/www.linotype.com/) includes an overview of all of the [original Sabon font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html) weights, and all of the [Sabon Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424030335/http:/www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html) weights as well.\n\n",
