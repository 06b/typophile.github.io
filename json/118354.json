  "content": "Hey all, so I'm working on updating the identity for a productivity app. The message that needs to be communicated is as follows:\n\nTo-do List  \nTasks, Notes, Lists, Outlines  \nTime Management  \nProductivity\n\nLogo - I've got two logo options I'm choosing between. Both are just concepts so please don't critique kerning, colors or technical tweaks. I need to choose a direction, and it will then be flushed out further. I'm using the typeface Adagio sans for the logo in both cases. I'm leaning towards the page turn as it seems stronger and holds the space better. The dots communicate time management but the mark seems frail to me.\n\nTypography - I'm restricted to using fonts from the standard CSS stack. That said, I'm using Lucida for body copy, and futura bold for CTAs and some headlines. I'd like to stick with Lucida as the users will probably be reading large blocks of copy, so legibility is a high priority. I'm not sure if futura is working with it.\n\n\\*Please keep in mind this product is also an app, so the mark needs to work well in an app icon (square) shape.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317191455im_/http:/typophile.com/files/opt-1_3714.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317191455im_/http:/typophile.com/files/opt-2_4900.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317191455im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typography_4665.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Welcome to Typophile, Bridget.\n\nOption B would work better in a square shape (for an app), but it seems too specific to time management, I don't see \"todo list\" in it.\n\nSince the app has multiple functions, have you considered using multiple elements (maybe 4)? I know that makes the elements small which is a disadvantage, but Bento by Filemaker used a similar approach. I'm thinking simple and more iconic than Bento's more photographic approach. (Unfortunately Bento was recently discontinued, and I have most of my business records on it!)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317191455im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bento_4358.jpg)\n\n"

Though mine also covered a wax seal :)\n\nWith regards to the type choices, I'd say that while Lucida Grande works fine as a body text, it looks somewhat flimsy in large sizes, e.g. in \"Data Synching\". Not illegible, but kind of artsy-fartsy, not assertive enough. Also, another thing to keep in mind is that Lucida Grande is replaced with Lucida Unicode on Windows and it doesn't look \\*that\\* good nor is it remarkably legible.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for all the comments,\n\nI'm also partial towards B, as is my boss. The only issue is people misinterpreting it as only a clock, and losing the checkmark (as happened to JamesM). We noticed a few other people overlooked it too. Now the goal is to make the checkmark a bit more assertive for that option\n\nThe checkmark has to stay (to my dismay). I'm well aware it's used in every productivity logo ever made, but it's another constraint.\n\nThylacine- I can use any typeface for the logo, it's just the typeface used in the app where I'll be using Lucida and Futura. The interface for the app is used internationally and translated into different languages, so using something from the css font stack ensures there won't be any translation issues.\n\napankrat- Is the attached image a good representation of what lucida unicode looks like for windows? If so yes it is gross.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317191455im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Lucida-Sans-Unicode-Regular_6482.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah, by \"making the checkmark assertive\" what I mean is to assert the message of the checkmark (to do) more than the message of the clock (time).\n\nHand-drawn is definitely one way that could help. Good thinking\n\n"
