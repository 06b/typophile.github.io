Do their devices still use it, or did they just go to touchscreen keypads?\n\nI really doubt that there will be much more evolution of the Latin alphabet; there’s too much inertia to overcome. It’s more likely that the way the alphabet is used will change in response to the way technology alters our methods of absorbing and processing information. I do expect to see diacriticals jumping from one language to another as people find themselves needing to display foreign words more often than in pre-internet days.\n\nI think it’s that we’ll see an alphabetic revolution in China or Japan similar to what happened with the invention of Hangul in Korea.\n\n"

I agree with Sii that touch screen technology can/will play a role, but I fail to see the exact influence of that as of yet. I just hope we never evolve to “Star Trek: The Next Generation”\n\nI disagree with James on the diacritics though. The massive prevalence of txt-type messaging has removed a lot of diacritics from colloquial usage. For instance, my friend Jené just uses Jene for everything now, since diacritics are a pain in the bottom to use efficiently.\n\n2) Anti-futurist, eco tendencies also are highly prevalent. Walk into a Cost Plus World Market, or Trader Joe’s and you’ll see what I’m talking about. Ironically, this will only get better/more used as Opentype technology allows for greater “naturalness” of a typeset word.\n\n"

People who rely on pictographic symbols to express their emotions risk becoming emotionally stunted, if they are not already. This saddens me, because it seems futile to try to counter so prevalent a social phenomenon, but then in turn I am angered because I recognise that there are companies and individuals who are profiting financially from this phenomenon, in whose interest it is to convince me and other dissidents that it is futile to oppose such social developments, which are not in fact social in origin but carefully manipulated. And this particular sadness, and this sense of futility, and this anger, are also emotions that cannot be expressed in the Newspeak of emoticons, which discourage people from exercising their minds to describe their feelings and, in so doing, also rob them of the ability to register criticism and protest.\n\n"

I personally never use emoticons, but my silent protest has no bearing on a ship that has sailed and landed at every port across the planet. In my experience, vendors in Asia use emoticons profusely, and in official business emails that open up with stuff like “Dear sirs...” and end with “Cordially Yours.” It seems slightly funny to Western eyes, having extreme formality mixed with what we consider tween’s pictograms, but they usually get their point across.

I’m a nominalist when it comes to writing systems: an alphabet is a set of signs, and the definition of that set and the forms that those signs take are all the signs and the ways they are made by people who use that alphabet, in whatever form. Indeed, such diversity is a precondition of evolution, which is why handwritten script evolves more easily and more steadily than typography: it is by its nature more diverse and more adaptable. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t be pondering what the next evolution of typographic writing might be, and I’m not saying that this evolution will necessarily be influenced by handwritten forms (although I wouldn’t deny that possibility, because a lot of people designing type are also interested in writing). What I am saying is that there is an ongoing evolution that has been happening and is happening just outside of the consciousness of a lot of people who are interested in design and typography, and will continue to happen because this is one of the things that scribes do: they invent new ways of writing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBy the way, for the sake of clarity, we should say that the Latin alphabet isn’t going to evolve at all, because almost no one writes in Latin any more, and the two main conventions of writing Latin, classical and liturgical, are not evolving. That is what the Latin alphabet is: the set of signs used to write the Latin language. What we’re talking about in this thread is either something like the English alphabet or the Latin script, the former being a subset of the latter, which is a superset of all the signs, conventions and forms used to write all the languages, with their independent alphabets, that are derived from and have signs in common with the Latin alphabet.\n\n"

We already have the kind of modular square alphabets like on a digital clock, made from two boxes with an X in them. They are clear, but people don’t want to read them.\n\nAdmittedly this is partly for reasons of the way the eye works, not the hand. But I’m not willing to concede that what the hand does and the eye likes are totally unrelated.\n\nI’m a humanist. I want humanity in type. And the hand in motion can help give it.\n\nThere’s another thing here, and that’s a false idea of simplicity. The Bauhaus had the idea that simple geometric shapes are the simplist. But now with the ideas about fractals, we see that a very simple rule can result in very complex designs, with an underlying unity.\n\nThe best “simple” designs, like Futura and Frutiger, are in fact very complex and subtle.\n\nI not saying that the hand will dictate future designs, but it won’t go away either.\n\n"

I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised that this is news to a lot of designers, because I guess it was news to me or, at least, something I hadn’t consciously considered until a couple of years ago. I first became conscious of it when looking at contemporary Arabic writing, but then realised, the same phenomenon can be observed within all scribal culture. It happens that the scribal culture in the west is now small and marginalised, but it still functions as a scribal culture, doing the things that scribal cultures do. One of these things is invention of new ways of writing.\n\n_Because if you say there is an “ongoing evolution”, I’d say for it to qualify as an “evolution” it must be somewhat all-encompassing, i.e. actually transform common/general usage of the script, no?_\n\nI think the phrase ‘ongoing evolution’ was poorly chosen. The key thing that happens in scribal cultures is ongoing invention and resulting diversity. In evolutionary terms, scribal cultures continuously produce a lot of mutations, whereas typographic cultures only sporadically produce mutations. But it is also part of the nature of scribal cultures that a mutation may have localised fitness, i.e. a new style of writing might be appropriate for very particular jobs that a scribe is doing, whereas the same style might fail utterly as a font because its uses are too localised and limited. But how useful and how true is this evolutionary model?\n\nDan’s original question is problematic because it mixes categories, switching from modes of creating letters (scribal) to styles of letters (humanist, modern, etc.) I don’t think it is describing an evolutionary process so much as changing fashions in letterforms. The development of ‘modern’, i.e. romantic, lettering is not an evolutionary change in the alphabet, it isn’t a mutation of humanist lettering. It is a new form based on new tools and new skills, invented by scribes and adapted by type makers.\n\nSo I’m going to conclude by suggesting that the Latin alphabet has never evolved, and that the development of writing systems is not an evolutionary process. It is, for want of a better phrase, a process of intelligent design.\n\n"

In that case, something like your analysis of the invention of lowercase looks kinda evolutionary, especially if one has some sense of the mutations that ‘didn’t make it’ (which most people do not). The metaphor is tenuous, though, because I’m not convinced that the deciding factor in which mutations/styles survive and which don’t is anything like a Darwinian ‘fitness’.\n\nI wrote an article for _Communication Arts_ a couple of years ago that discussed the way in which technological and media changes function as filters, limiting both the content and form of what gets reproduced in new media. I was prompted by research that Colette Sirat had done regarding the transition from scribal to print media, recorded in _Hebrew Manuscripts of the Middle Ages,_ noting that only some books that had been popular in the Middle Ages were reproduced in print editions. I realised that something similar happened with forms of writing, that typography ‘selected’ certain forms—to use another evolutionary metaphor—and ignored others (e.g. the Beneventan script). It is tempting to look at this kind of selection as something like fitness to environment or purpose, but I think this is fundamentally mistaken, because, as your own example suggests, the ‘mutations’ are themselves intentional developments, not occurring by chance but through human ingenuity and creativity, and their selection or non-selection at critical technological junctures is determined by things like fashion, locale, political influence and personal ambition. Unless one is the sort of person who believes an evolutionary model can be applied to explain everything from how we crawled out of the oceans to what I had for breakfast this morning, I think at best evolution provides a partially apt but potentially misleading metaphor for the development of writing systems and styles.\n\n"

I say this mainly because the Latin alphabet has spread across the planet over the last few hundred years, now representing languages from Indonesia to Africa. More importantly, in the last few decades we’ve become so interconnected, not just amongst Latin-character-using societies but in just about every last corner of the planet, that the trend seems like it has to be towards standardization, rather than diversity that grows out of regional isolation. We’ve seen this in the type world, with the proliferation of extended Latin fonts and families like Fedra, with its recent Devanagari addition. The need for type that works globally is at the heart of Ikea’s switch to Verdana, as John Berry pointed out on his blog — [http://www.johndberry.com/blog/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090924021853/http:/www.johndberry.com/blog/ \"http://www.johndberry.com/blog/\") .

Tools are designed around font formats which they are supposed to create.

Tools in turn determine type designers’ conception of what “type” is ...  \nSo of course technology does and will continue to steer the type-ship, if type-ship refers to type designers like you and me.  \nThe real “limitation” is in what we conceive “type” to be.\n\nThe standardization which you are speaking about (“in just about every last corner of the planet”) actually means this: Technology, i.e. font formats and layout methods, which was created out of a Latin-script based understanding of “type” is now supposed to serve, with some add-ons, the rest of the world too — including scripts that are of quite different nature than the Latin script.  \nI am less happy about a vision of interconnectedness and standardization (vs “diversity that grows out of regional isolation”) when in fact what is standardized is very Latin-script centric and means to squeeze everything else into the Latin-script based conception of “type”.  \nAgain, the real “limitation” is in what we conceive “type” to be.

There are signs that this effectively means that — again — a Latin-script based conception of “legibility” is applied to other scripts too, though different scripts may require that “legibility” is defined by different sets of categories and thus is something different for different scripts.)\n\nP.S.

No doubt new advances in layout tables like Opentype have a major bearing on what’s possible in type design, but I don’t know how much influence that will have on the fundamental shapes of the Latin alphabet. These advances just take away limitations, such as type where the bitmap/pixel quality is extremely evident in older technology.\n\nSo (attempting) to avoid rambling, I’d say the winning forms for the Latin alphabet are the Italic and Roman construction. Writing/typefaces with a different underlying logic like blackletter are novelty or display type now, almost never used for extended reading. Forms like cursive, that I and most Americans learned in elementary school, are on their way out in education, replaced by simple Italics. And when you look at type across the world, from Japanese to Korean to Indic scripts to Latin, the trend in the latter half of the 20th century was towards low-contrast, unadorned letterforms — what you might call the “Helvetica-ization” of the world. I think a large part of this is not just the homogenization that globalization and efficient corporate communication (like the Ikea catalog, for example) brings, but the trend of the developing world to emulate the aesthetics of the western world. So I think in the next 25-50 years, we’ll see the Latin-character-using world change very little — the diversity of stylization will change, and probably expand even more, but the underlying architecture will stay the same. I think non-Latin scripts will try to fit into the Helvetica/clean-corporate mold more and more, possibly changing their fundamental construction in the process.\n\nAlso, type will probably become useless once we all have brain implants that allow us to communicate words, images, or any idea psychically.\n\n"

My guess is that design culture is so new in places like the Arabic and Indic worlds that those who are buying and developing type now are probably the first type, the more “sophisticated” members of their design culture — not the guys outside Mumbai pumping out Flash banners, in other words. Using India as an example, I think as the middle class grows, we’ll see more Indic scripts that are Helvetica-ized, a sort of cargo cult approach to typefaces — using the style of wealth and power to manifest itself. Once that has become over-saturated, there will probably be a backlash. I’ve recently been reading David Brooks’ book “Bobos in Paradise” (which is almost 10 years old now), and he talks about how American high-class in the 50s was Greek pillars and lion-head armrests — they looked to the wealth of Europe as their symbols of sophistication. The modern day elite, though, look to European peasants as symbols of sophistication — stores like Anthropologie use ethnic motifs and heavy distressing to connect to something we sense as authentic. I imagine this same process will happen in developing countries.\n\n"

As miscellaneous internet abbreviations and 1eet expressions are incorporated into everyday usage, designing good keming will become increasingly difficult, so gType will encourage the adoption of the new gAlphabet in which individual glyphs are presented the reader sequentially through our brain implants using bad flash animation so that they never need appear side by side.\n\nOnce this happens, there will be peace on earth and Fred Phelps will host gay-pride parades in downtown Riyadh.\n\n"

Personally, I prefer to have a touch of humanity in the type I read, whether it’s more or less simple.\n\n"
