I have Aktuelle, but it is not clean like this.  \n.  \nHow about Opti Sport or Spoleto? Are either of those as clean as this example? \n",

But to me, this Aktuelle looks like a scan of a scan of a live trace of a scan of a xerox copy of a... well, you get the idea.\n\n"

For my taste, Fenway Park has too many parallel lines and a bit much contrast. And many of the caps don't work for me.\n\nMaybe it's time to get busy in FontLab.\n\n"
