  "content": "Hi  \nI'm wondering if there's such a thing as a non-breaking period/full stop. My e-mail address is [firstname.surname@company.com](mailto:firstname.surname@company.com) and it looks really ugly over a line break because I end up with my first name at the end of one line and my surname at the start of the next line.  \nIs there a non-breaking period or some other way to get InDesign to keep the whole thing together?  \nThanks :)\n\n",
