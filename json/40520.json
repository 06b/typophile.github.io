  "content": "I’ve been working for this company for a year and a half. I hate their logo. I’m really looking for a good reason to prove to my boss that the logo is ugly and that changing it won’t hurt the branding of the company. My boss is the wife of the company founder. She and I both have fine arts educations, not design. She drew the logo and is very possessive of it. I think the fish is ugly and the free font “Addcityboy,” is not only ugly, but impractical as it becomes unreadable at a not-so-small size. Here is a progression of the logo since I have been working here:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709012243im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logospost_4574.jpg)\n  \na. The official logo when I arrived  \nb. The alternate logo when I arrived. Used mainly in print.  \nc. The logo appearing on the homepage when I arrived.  \nd. My first attempt at shaving some of the crap off the logo  \ne. The fish would fit nicely with the slant of the letters if only it was flipped over and rotated a bit. That is not allowed. Precious fish must remain unadulterated.  \nf. I was able to shave off a little more excess.  \ng. we hired this outside marketing/ecommerce software making company to build us a new website and help us with branding. They made the letters dimensional and then dropped them on to of the flat fish in order to save space which, imo, looks totally awkward. This is how the logo looks now at the to of our website.  \nh. This is how it will look when the brand new fancy site is launched (if it is launched, the company we hired has been kind of a disappointment). They wanted to update the look by making it more web 2.0, thus the shadows and gradients. How can they say it is more web 2.0 when they’ve removed the lighter yellowish green- arguably the most web 2.0 color on the web?  \ni. My suggestion for web 2.0 -izing the logo.\n\nActually, I’d really rather scrap the whole thing. By the way, any guesses at what the company does? In addition to the logo, I think the company name is somewhat inappropriate and misleading, but I’m not going to get into that.\n\nPlease tell me if I’m crazy and the logo looks fine, or if I’m right and rethinking the branding strategy might be a good idea.\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Community Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709012243/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41812 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Cookie Stuff (Critique Needed) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709012243/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41066 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Colors and type need to be changed, and that shark needs to be improved.\n\nI had the same situation in a print shop that I worked for one summer. The owner didn’t want to go through another logo change, and I proposed a digitized version of their original 1920 logo (amazing mark that was originally drawn and was in red and black, and looked great when I converted it to vector), but sadly, today it remains an ugly rainbow buffalo in distorted type (forgot the name of the typeface they used, but it was bad).\n\n"

      "content": "To tell you the truth, logo did improve a lot. If you sell bikes I think you will have to change type because I think a VERY similar type is used in many many sport equipment companies (Gary Fisher for instance). It’s different but not too much.\n\nUsing a bold typeface may not necessarily be bad since people associate it with sports because many companies use it, but it should be distinct enough.\n\nWeb 2.0 logo for a company that doesn’t provide web 2.0 services to on-line communities etc. doesn’t really make any sense to me. I’d rather go with a regular logo and then colour upgrade it with gradients/shadows/etc. if really needed.\n\nIf you’re a bike reseller I’d rather focus on that. A shark in the logo may be quite ok, since it’s agile, aggressive and powerful. But not the one that you’re using right now because it’s rather cartoonish.\n\nType in logos from A-F is very bad with various slants etc. G and F seem the only ones that may be usable.\n\nSome simple and fast suggestions:\n\n- I’d make all letters in Greenfish of the same size, without emphasizing the G.\n- in this case “adventure sports” will have to be adjusted\n- create a new shark that would be more suitable for a logo and more powerful and adventurous that this cartoonish one\n- discard the colour at first and work from BW examples\n\n"

Then every time I try to incorporate it into any sort of layout I just hate it. The fish is the result of compounding the founder’s name plus his wife’s former name. I think it’s kind of clever. I think the financing partner contributed the “adventure” part, hoping to spice it up a bit. When I first came across the company I thought maybe they led some kind of wilderness fishing trips. I guess mountain biking can be an adventure, but I don’t think most of what we sell really reflects that. The word Bikes was excluded from the title because the founder aspires to be the next Dicks Sporting Goods, eventually moving beyond just bikes. Really I think our branding problems stem directly from the wishy-washy business plan, or complete lack of a business plan, which is most frustrating, but I was hired to make pictures, so who am I to question their strategies? Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to produce effective graphics when one doesn’t know exactly whom one is marketing to or what one is supposed to be representing. I could vent for pages and pages, but I’ll spare you! Not sure how I’ll convince the boss- I guess outside consulting would be the only way, but we are reluctant even to pay $30 for a decent font, I can’t see anyone agreeing to pay an outside consultant!\n\n"

It’s just a fish trying to look intimidating and winking at you at the same time. Come on, it can’t be that difficult to draw a better fish. Have you tried it? I agree with your critics but just shaving it’s not enough, you have to come up with something to replace the existing one, and one your boss won’t have any objections to.  \nHaving said that, it’s clear to me that it’s a taste issue. A lot of people love this kind of grotesque cartoonish stuff. There’s nothing you can do about it. It’s their taste and they don’t find anything wrong with that.\n\nSo is a crusade worth it? Has your boss shown at least some flexibility or will to make changes (I mean radical changes)? I doubt it. I went through something similar.

      "content": "That we can’t afford to throw away all of our “built up equity” is essentially what my boss tells me whenever I try to mess with the logo. I usually don’t push the issue, though because I have a feeling the real issue has more to do with her pride in little fishy. I can’t believe that that fish has built up that much equity anyway; the company started in 2003 or so, and by the time I got there they’d adopted the ugly fish for some materials, but the top of their website still had an entirely different fish and typeface combo. Some of our shipping pouches had that old fish combo until at least a month or so ago. I can hardly believe that most of our customers identify with the fish in any meaningful way (evidence being that very few people buy any of our branded merchandise), or wouldn’t recognize the company if it adopted another fish. But I don’t have any sort of marketing or branding credentials, so any discussion would end up: “well I think this” “Well I think you’re wrong,” and she, being the boss, would end the conversation, and I, being rather non-confrontational, would drop the issue, and then at some point, after having kept all my opinions bottled up inside, would become frustrated and start ranting in a somewhat obscure forum on a typography website that I had come across while trying to find legitimate excuse for why we should not use the font “AddCityBoy” to represent our company, but that I had also come across in the past, and had bookmarked in my del.icio.us links, and had enjoyed reading very much, expanding my meager knowledge of typography, and in which I would be comforted by the good citizens (netizens?), by their reassuring disapproval of that which had caused my frustrations.\n\nReally, I’m hoping to be doing some graduate studies in in the Fall, so I just have to hold out until then. I don’t see them changing the logo any time soon, but perhaps if they can stay afloat despite the logo, someday they will become big enough to hire a consultant who will have the authority to tell them how ugly their logo is. Of course, by that time it probably will have gained some equity, but I’ll be long gone by then, so won’t have to worry about it!\n\n@dunk I like to think that my Fine Arts extends to a modest degree toward illustration, but I acknowledge my shortcoming as a designer. That said, I think (and I think she agrees) my graphics are much nicer than those of my boss. And getting better all the time! Slowly, but surely...\n\n"
