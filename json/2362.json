It's not really trying to be an editor, i just wanted to see if it was all possible.   \n   \nIf you have any ideas of what i could do with this, let me know.   \n   \nIts good fun to set overlay on, press a key, then click degenerate and then the key again, keep on going for a mess.   \n   \nlemme know what you think.   \n(oh remember to click the flash movie to focus beefore typing)\n\n",

BTW, there's also a pretty advanced Flash bitmap font (I guess pixelfont) editor - I forget the URL.   \n   \nTwo things:   \n1) The Overlay On/Off doesn't seem to do anything.   \n2) I can't get other chars to show up. When I hit a key there seems to be a lot of activity (HD churning), but the display just goes blank (except for the guides), and I can't even get back to the \"A\" (without a Reload).   \n   \n\\> Georgia ... is covered by Microsoft's EULA, which prohibits decompiling.   \n   \nI wonder what \"decompiling\" really is, though. What Nic is doing here seems to be equivalent to nothing more than something like a \"convert to outlines\" in Illustrator - there's no actual font action [that I can see]. Oh, but I guess you mean the initial conversion to XML... I get it.   \n   \nThe good news is that MS isn't extremely strict about this stuff - you can't even save anything at all out in this instance, right?   \n   \nIn the future though if it this is going to actually generate new fonts, including a public-domain font instead is indeed a good idea.
