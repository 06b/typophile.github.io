  "content": "Impressica is a distressed face I did for the 25th annual Seattle International Film Festival poster. I think that most distressed computer generated faces lack detail when printed in large size so with Impressica I have an average of 130 elements in each letter. This however became problematic when importing and generating postscript in Fontographer, as there is too many points, so it was left as eps files and I hand set it when I use it. There is 2-3 alternated for each letter.   \n ![Impressica.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416072432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Hey Ole. I like this. I enjoy distressed faces where you can see that the designer had to work a bit to arrive at a finished product. In other words, it takes a lot of work to make the font to be distressed and more work to pathfinder the interior of these suckers. Nice job.   \n   \nI'm curious if anyone's counted the maximum number of points or elements that Fontographer can comfortably handle without graying to eps.   \n   \nAlso, IN GENERAL, I think that distressed faces (not grunge, let's retire that font description) speak to a younger audience better than non-distressed, especially younger males. I have some anecdotal information about this, but I'd like to see if it holds true over a wider number.   \n   \n   \nYour background image, like in some of your other posts, is nifty.   \n   \nOf the 100 ways to make a distressed face, I like the sponge technique with white out or white paint and a rescan. Next time I do it this way, I'm going to try a Brillo pad, too. I was thinking that might yield some cool results.   \n   \n   \n ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416072432im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)k   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Brian, yes it sure is fun getting \"hands on\" manual work / off screen. Impressica was partially designed with old dry rub-off lettering. The SIFF poster features a poor bastard with the camera mounted into his head (who happens to be myself) I did this job with Robin Bartholick a good friend and and excellent photographer. We shot 13 rolls of 4x5 and had the best shots drum scanned. Final piece was 23 x 32 inches as I recall. You can see more of Robins work at www.bartholick.com.   \nAs far as maximum points, I believe it is around 2000\n\n"
