  "content": "This might be some custom hack, I don't know... Most of the letters are in the round bauhaus style, but there are a few idiosyncracies: The 'e' looks light it's straight from Frutiger, the 's' is normal, and the 'C' is very closed, and more oval than round. Otherwise, most of the letters follow the bauhaus style. It's a medium-bold weight.\n\n",

I saw it on TV on some signage, and it just seemed so deliberate, like someone said, \"well I don't like the e or the s, they just don't look normal.\" I mean, it's literally [the e from Fruitger](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023143423/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/65-bold/win-ttf/187428/character/0065/CP2/), which is not very Bauhaus.\n\n"
