  "content": "I used to like MS Word several years ago (1980s or so) before it became a full featured behemoth carnivore (This happened somewhere after version 5.5 for the Mac). Now I just tolerate it because it is ubiquitous and I must. It took some poking around to find a way to turn on kerning but I finally managed to do it.  \nMy next dilemma is finding out how to turn on ligatures. Is it even possible? Surely a word processing program pays more attention to all the things needed to set words more than all the things needed to insert clip art of the worst degree? The tacky clip art thing is quite easy to find but the kerning thing eludes my best detective efforts. Do I need Inspector Clouseau or Adrian Monk?\n\nChrisL\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017001421im_/http:/typophile.com/files/peter_sellers_3918.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "ChrisL,  \ncan you give me an example of a font/application combination where OpenType ligatures actually works and produces correct output? After my last posting I tried it with Indesign CS and Times Italic, Zapfino and Adobe Jenson Pro. Results in German language are not conform to the rule I explained in the last post. Indesign still makes Au-ﬂösung and au-fﬁnden, even with an automatic ffi-ligature if there's one available. I tried the same using TextEdit and the standard OpenType treatment of OS X 10.3.9, with similar results.  \nThe only workaround seems either to use a discretionary hyphen where the words join (this only seems to work while writing the text and before the au **f-f-i** nden is substituted with a ffi-ligature). Both applications give up their wrong ligatures if you kern e.g. at _auf|ﬁnden_.  \nAny suggestions?  \nSo the \"Wordly mysteries\" do not only apply to _the big MStery_ called Wörd.  \nMy way would be to use a typesetting system that relies on dictionaries and is really capable of handling ligatures. I've had good experiences with LaTeX in that respect.  \nAnd never trust the software (may it be a layout software or an OpenType font) you're using, it is always only as good as its developers knew what they were doing…  \nThe alternative would be (a) to stop using ligatures at least in the languages that \"the software\" does not know the rules of, (b) use fonts where ﬂ, ﬁ etc. look just the same as fl, fi (that is the case with many standard sanserifs, see  \n`span style=\"font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"` =)\n\n"

I am sure that this is possible with OpenType, only it is hard to have all the different norms of various cultures and languages encorporated in one piece of software. That is because most type designers are not linguists (of course, vice versa most linguists also won't care about whether their texts have correct ligatures as long as it looks ok and someone has made a nice layout for it).  \nRegarding the above example: I am quite sure that there are no german words that begin with \"auf\" followed by \"fi/fl\" and still need a ffi/ffl lig. Same goes for most of the words that start with the prefix auf- (and therefore should not have a ﬁ or ﬂ lig in this place), but although I admit that I had to think a little: there are instances in German where au may be followed by a ﬁ or ﬂ lig. All the words that start with ﬁ/ﬂ and have a prefix auf- should have a ﬁ/ﬂ, but not a ffi/ffl lig.  \nDoes some major foundry look for a consultant in german typography norms? ;)\n\n"

I'm just wondering: is there some reason why Microsoft chooses not to incorporate OpenType features in Microsoft Word? I work in a university setting, where it would be really nice to use some of the alternate-glyph and other OpenType features without having to do search-and-replace, or (worse) manually inserting the characters I want. I know these features are probably considered a luxury or superfluous to many users, but it would be nice to have them available, for those times when I really want to \"pull out all the typographic stops\" without having to invest in another piece of software. Do you think it's too much to ask for in a word-processing programme these days? Is there any chance that the forthcoming edition of Word might finally include these features, for us non-professionals who try to use our limited resources to produce the best typographical output we can?  \nI'd be grateful if anyone has any insight into these questions, which I'm sure many other people are asking as well.  \nAll the best,  \nMurrayK\n\n"
