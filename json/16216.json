  "content": "I’ve been using Scala for a while now, and I’m pleased with it. It is a phenomenally clear and legible face. Very comfortable and inviting, thanks to the generous x-height and moderate colour, among other things. It seems that Scala and Scala Sans can be used for almost anything, but I use the former for lengthy tracts of text, and the latter for occasional heading/subheading use.\n\nI’ve recently seen some samples of StormType Andulka. Its x-height seems generous as well, and its form also appears especially clear and readable.\n\nCan anyone provide a bit of insight about how Andulka might perform on the printed page (as opposed to Scala) at 11-12 pt., 600dpi?\n\n [‹ What is your best fonts mix](http://web.archive.org/web/20071226011719/http:/typophile.com/node/15937 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [modern but still corporate sans serif? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071226011719/http:/typophile.com/node/15631 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
