En cuanto a la g, yo dejaria el ojo de abajo abierto.   \n   \nMe gustan mucho tu \"f\", la ligadura \"st\" y \"tz\" y la \"j\".   \n   \ntambien encuentro que la \"b\" y la \"d\" se ven contra la corriente de tu tipografia, fijate en como se ve la \"d\" entre las dos \"a\".   \n   \nel terminal de abajo de la \"s\" lo har'ia mas extenso.   \n   \nme gusta mucho tu sitio web   \n   \nnos vemos   \nCG (\\*L\\*)\n\n"

      "content": "Mauro, there are some very nice things happening in this design. A few comments:   \n   \nThe g might be a little weak, but it is hard to tell without seeing it in the middle of a word. Certainly, it looks weak at the beginning of a word.   \n   \nThe j is too heavy.   \n   \nAs others have noted, the e is probably too ornate. More to the point, the flourish is actually out-of-style with the rest of the letters, which are very direct and gestural.   \n   \nThe t may be a problem because it is so similar to the l. Try making it shorter? It looks good in the tz ligature, but not so good next to the l at the end of Quetzalcoatl.\n\n"

Not too much, but just enough to really distinguish it from the ascender of the l very clearly.   \n   \nThe g is a real problem. I don't think you can make that left side so weak: not along the whole length at least. Try keeping the narrowing on the lower right, but strengthen the stroke again as it comes through the lower left. The transition you probably need is similar to what you have in the c. Also, you might try a version with a hook descender, but without the complete loop.   \n   \nBy the way, the recent change to the y is excellent: exactly what I would have recommended.\n\n"
