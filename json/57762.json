  "content": "The best way to snag that new job is to HAND WRITE a personal note (brief) and send it through the mail (yes, snail mail—USPS). This is in addition to following-up immediately with a brief email once you have forwarded your resume/CV and or had that all-crucial interview.\n\nAnother trick is to do your research, target for whom you want to work, write a letter and send IT through the mail.\n\nThis stuff really works, over 30 years I have maintained a consistent, successfull track record for getting in the front door of almost anywhere by finding the right person’s name (make sure to get the correct spelling) and title, then drafting a letter, signing it and send it via the post office. Wait ten days or so then pick up the phone. I get into 1/5th of the places to which I send real mail. This is a hell of a lot better results than any e-generated initiatives.\n\nAlso...get the 20% introductory special on REAL engraved monogram and notes. (These are about 2/3 the price of any other real engraved stationery!)\n\n[www.petitesuite.wordpress.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090611151717/http:/www.petitesuite.wordpress.com/ \"www.petitesuite.wordpress.com\")\n\nNot sure about how to write that letter or note? There’s loads of on-line help. When in doubt, check-out an etiquette expert, too.\n\n",
