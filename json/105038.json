  "content": "Hi,  \nI've have a friend that has asked me to design some stickers for his boat. I've attached the manufacturer logo that he would like to try and match. Can someone suggest a common font that will match this font. The only sticker that will be close to this logo will be the \"license\" number so it will only be letters. The other stickers will be far enough away from the logo that it should not be apparent that it is not an exact match. Any help greatly appreciated.
