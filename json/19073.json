First, someone will translate your paragraph into demotic Greek, then another person - a monk apparently at a big monastery in the mountains - will turn that into a polytonic version! When I’m sure this really can happen, shall I contact you via your website?\n\nLeads me to wonder what motivates font makers - yourself included? - to produce polytonic Greek type. Who uses it? As I understand it’s pretty much limited to classicists, the Church - hence the monk - and I guess academics discussing older texts. Not complaining, mind, just interested.\n\nAre you in fact making a Greek font of your own?\n\nToby\n\n"

      "content": "_Who uses it?_\n\nI was persuaded by several people.  \nDavid Lemon at Adobe saying that classicists need it, and there are a lot of them around the world.  \nGerry Leonidas at Reading saying that there are recent pre-monotonic texts (not just Homer etc.) that still are quoted and reprinted in Greece using polytonic, and a subculture of present day writers who use it — much the same way many typographers still use old type designs like Helvetica, etc.\n\n_what motivates font makers_\n\nObsessive adolescent behaviour.  \nAnd it’s those damn folks at Adobe always raising the bar.  \nProfessional challenge.  \nAnd one gets bored with the same old glyphs, so curiosity, bring on the Greek and Cyrillic.  \nAlso, I took Greek at school, so it’s familiar (although I’ve forgotten too much to be able to do the translation).\n\n_Are you in fact making a Greek font of your own?_\n\nOf course, and I’m not alone. Typophiler Chris Lozos (Dezcom) has one, a family actually, in the works too.\n\n"

      "content": "Toby, there are literary publishers in Greece who never stopped using polytonic. As Nick notes, there is also a lot of polytonic text floating around out there that needs to be typeset, and not only classical or religious text. I recently found out that one of my polytonic Greek types might be used for a new edition of the poems of Cavafy, which is a thrill for me because he is one of my favourite modern poets.\n\n"
