This is not only in headlines but also body text and caption areas where they specify the standard as such: (albeit 10 million different variations for different applications and all with an reference to \"em Kerning\")   \n   \n\"Stone Sans 14pt, Left Justified 10% em Kerning.\"   \n   \nI'm only guessing that \"em Kerning\" is an English term for tracking?...but percentages? I'm confused.   \n   \nThanks in advance\n\n",

      "content": "Be careful about tracking: different apps use different units for tracking. Notoriously, Quark tracking is in some terribly coarse units like 1/200 of an em, while Adobe's is more like 1/1000 of an em.   \n   \nSpecifying % of em is quite a good idea, if this is what your British standard intends, but only so long as you know what units your application is using. 10% of the em is going to be a different value in Quark than it is in Adobe apps, but if you know the unit used you can calculate the value from the x% em specification.   \n   \nThat's just my guess though. Can you contact the authors of the document for clarification?\n\n"

      "content": "Tanya --   \n   \nI'm not a Brit. But I am in agreement with the others. The \"em\" here goes with the 10%, not with the \"kerning\". The instructions are asking for kerning in the amount of 10% em. An em is, of course, a relative value equal to the point size of the type in question.   \n   \nAs John points out, different applications use different size units for measuring kerning/tracking. In Quark, the smallest unit is indeed 1/200th of an em. In InDesign, it is 1/1000th of an em. So in Quark, 10% em would be 20 units; whereas in InDesign, it would be 100 units.   \n   \nThese days the terms \"kerning\" and \"tracking\" are often used interchangeably. I've always considered them separate, though similar, adjustments. Kerning is fit adjustment between specific individual pairs. Tracking is set-width adjustment over a range of glyphs -- global kerning, if you will.   \n   \nIt may just be me, but I've always considered the default direction of kerning/tracking to be negative, so in the absence of a specification like \"positive\" kerning, my interpretation is to close up the space.\n\n"

So 10% em kerning for 14pt text is going to be 14\\*0.1 = 1.4pts\n\n"

It's all relative.   \n   \nWhen you type in 20 for tracking in Quark, you're indicating 20/200ths of an em (which is the same thing as 10% -- 20 divided by 200, right?). The actual physical value of this will change depending upon the point size of the type that has been tracked. If the type is 14 point, then the net effect will be to track it open by 1.4 pts. But if you change the type size to 24 points, the physical value of your 10% tracking will change to 2.4 points. But it's still 10% of an em.   \n   \nBTW, this is all regardless of what units you have your application set to work in -- points, ciceros, millimeters. It doesn't matter. An em is a relative measure. And the tracking is specified in fractions of an em.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

I was fortunate to have a younger brother who operated a Compugraphic at the local typesetters, and I would call him up and say, \"Could you reset that job 10 on 11 instead and bring it home with you?\"   \n   \nTanya, computers mostly just make it different, not always easier. The computer transferred so much more control to the designer. But with that came a whole lot more responsibility -- which many designers didn't/don't recognize, and consequently a lot of subtlety and quality was lost in the transition. It seems now, also, that often the technology dictates the design rather than the other way around.   \n   \nThat said, I'm grateful for the computer.
