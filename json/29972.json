Orthodox Jews interpret the Biblical prohibition on starting fire on the Sabbath as forbidding switching on or off electric lights, as that might involve a spark. However it is permitted to leave an electric light on.\n\nHence one night a week you have the problem of reading in bed before sleeping. If you leave a light on, then you can't turn it off. But this moveable shade hides the visible light without switching the lamp off, and without covering it so it might overheat and catch fire.\n\nNot being Orthodox, I find it kind of hilarious and sweet at the same time. Love that animated gif also. Definitely a 'unique gift item'!\n\n"

Here I quote from P22:\n\nJim Rimmer has completed: \"Leaves from the Pie Tree\". This magnum opus is an autobiographical account of his life with type and the book arts along with \"how-to\" knowledge of the craft that a rare few possess. This extremely limited edition of 50 copies will include a co-edition of 10 copies made for P22 and offered at a discount to the first 6 purchasers of the full Rimmer Type Foundry Collection. The size of the book is approx. 10-1/2\" x 14-3/4\". Printed in the monotype cast Quill type on 120 GSM Arches Cream text paper on a Colts Armory press. The book will be hand bound with a leather and linen quarter binding with linocut illustrations, tipped in images and even a hand cut letter pattern used in the creation process of his metal type. The book retails for $700(CND) and can be ordered directly from Jim Rimmer at the Pie Tree Press ( rimmertype {at} shaw {dot} ca ). The p22 co-edition will be available for $400 with the purchase of the RTF collection at $999.95. Only a few copies of the P22 co-edition can be accommodated.\n\n$1399.95 with full Rimmer type collection or $650 (US)\n\nThere are sample images if you follow the link above. It looks to be a tactile and educational experience. Long live the printed word!\n\n"
