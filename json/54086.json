      "content": "Thanks Ashfaq with Flowers. KFGQPC is less than expected!  \nKerning + Ligatures have been sacrificed for mark-positioning.  \nMoreover, some letter connections appear as if kashidas were added.  \nThough there is a trade-off among them, but it could have been done better.\n\nAs you can easily see, there is no middle ligatures at all.  \nAnd most essential initial+final ligatures are missing.\n\nWait for our Naskh that will be included in MirEmad of MaryamSoft  \nand the comparison I will make between the 2 here and then.\n\n"
