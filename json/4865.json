The letterforms you have chosen are nice and straight forward.You can do it.   \n   \nThe first thing to do is block in the letters. Your sample is made entirely out of rectangles. The part that will require some consideration is making optical thickness adjustments. 6 letters. All caps. It's a great place to start! Post some refinements. The good people at typophile will walk you through it.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
