I have to say..this is a very nice site and I can see it becoming a valuable resource for me..Kudos all around.\n\nSo I’m working on a project for Macy’s and need to recreate the Calphalon logo, because as usual, they cant get me a vector copy. I need to figure out what the font is.\n\nAny help is much appreciated\n\n[Here is the Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201144140/http:/www.milners.com.au/cache/images/1/190x100/calphalon_logo.gif)\n\nThanks a bunch\n\nCopper\n\n [‹ Is it Shango?
