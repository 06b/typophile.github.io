The guy currently assigned the job has turned in a bunch of dreck and I can swoop in and steal the show/money.\n\nThe place has ski-ball, video games, lasertag, bumper cars, ball pits that smell of urine, putt-putt, hot dogs, pizza, and hundreds of screaming sticky children. So, I need something fun and festive, but not Curlz or, you know, anything else really awful. Oh yeah, and the place is called “Grand Event,” which implies something classy... ergh.\n\nI’m currently thinking House’s Ed Roman, or perhaps some variation of Burbank. They have some class but are still “kooky” and “fun.” I’m hoping you guys will perhaps suggest something that comes at this from an angle I haven’t really considered yet.\n\n [‹ Fontoid by Barry Deck?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203120521/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40175 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Mean, mean FontShop! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203120521/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41536 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
