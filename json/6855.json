That's probably a bit beyond my skill with Illustrator, but probably not for a more accomplished professional. I think this is at least a close approximation. I used short line segments for the connections.   \n ![Hil St Soul Simulation](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518053310im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49816.gif)\n\n"
