When I saw the new Nationals hats, with it's loose, playful script 'W', I was intrigued! How old fashioned!   \n   \nBut then I saw the jerseys� The combination of the script 'W' and the jersey typeface is very frustrating to me. Typophile seemed like the safest place to vent.   \n   \n ![Nationals Cap](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109112251im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69793.jpg)   \n ![Nationals Shirt](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109112251im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69794.jpg)\n\n",

Given that this is a Washington team (read home of design by committee) I am not surprised to see a total disconnect from hat to shirt. Last night they did well from hand to glove at least :-)\n\n"

The hat is about the same as the 1969-71 replica shown above. 1971 being the Senators last season before relocation to Texas to be the Rangers.\n\n"

Not sure why this wouldn't have worked for 'Nationals'.   \n   \ni find sports typography to be fun to analyze. there's nothing like ruining a perfectly good football game by pointing out that the new philadelphia eagles uniforms utilize a condensed serif typeface. i think it works very well actually. and i bet you it makes them play better.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109112251im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69951.jpg)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109112251im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/69952.jpg)\n\n"
