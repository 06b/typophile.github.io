  "content": "I need some advice about identity.   \n   \nMy brother and I are soon establishng our own Graphic Design busness (within a year). But are in two minds about the direction for our identity.   \n   \nWe have two ideas which I would like to put forward.   \n   \n1 - Scratch Graphics (or) Vendetta Design : Focusing on graphic design within the creative industry, but also extending to brand/corporate identity.   \n   \n2 - Focusing our own identity on the fact we are brothers, therefore using our own surname and exploiting the brotherly LOVE/HATE relationship.   \n   \nI guess what I am asking, is would we be limiting ourselves from prospective clients if we name ourselves SCRATCH GRAPHICS / VENDETTA DESIGN. We are trying not to jump into an identity too soon.   \n   \nThe more I think this through, the more I am looking at the BROTHER identity. But would appreciate feedback from anyone offering their profound knowledge and experience.   \n   \nTake care   \nkumbuniko\n\n",

      "content": "You're definitely creating a recognizable and memorable identity if you use your surname, especially if your main marque is something, for the lack of a better phrase, horrifying or scary. Like if your logo was just all-caps 'Manson Design' written in blood.   \n   \nBut you certainly run the risk of repelling potential clients solely on the basis of your nameï¿½ it isn't something that a jeweler or community centre would care to acknowledge a connection with.   \n   \nSo if you're focusing primarily on an 'edgy' industry like the music or design community, and if the clients are primarily young enough to make the association but not old enough to have been terrified by the slayings, you'd be okay. Otherwise, I'd choose Vendetta Design, because there are a wealth of opportunities associated with that, like using violin cases as portfolios/briefcases and showing up to client meetings wearing chalkstripe suits with fedoras ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20070307014949im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Vendetta. Brothers. Manson. What is this, an Emigre promo? ;-)   \n   \nI think incorporating \"Manson\" would be great if the target clientele is \"edgy\" (like Chase says). The fact that your surname is indeed Manson means nobody can hold any allusions to criminality against you (at least not formally). And when somebody asks you if Charles's reputation had anything to do with your choice of name, you can tailor your answer depending on what kind of person is asking! It can help you create an atmosphere, an illusion, based on the needs at hand.   \n   \nVisually: I would try some kind of Yin/Yang opposition/unity thing (but not too literal a reference to the Yin/Yang symbol itself). Here's one of my most favorite logos (by Gahlord Dewald): [http://www.thtfct.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070307014949/http:/www.thtfct.com/)   \n   \nBTW, note that \"Manson\" is \"man\"+\"son\"; maybe you can play the sibling aspect into that. Like maybe some kind of tree with two branches?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The yin/yang idea is a good basis, but it's a pretty common reference.   \n   \nYou could use Hrant's literal idea and design a stylized man that tesselates with itself, either in the same size or in two complementary sizes (man & son).\n\n"

Promotional material which illustrated that envy, jealousy, and immature brotherly habits (such as the border within the shared bedroom) played a large role in our individual stride to \"out-do each other\".   \n   \nWe intend to target the \"edgy\" clientele despite which name we choose. But were concerned with regards to corporate identity.   \n   \nDo corporate identity jobs tend to be conservative clients? Would YOU be turned off by a surname?   \n   \nWe have constantly been asked throughout our lives about our surname. Resultng in us giving them the answer they were hoping for. Then it changed with Marilyn heading into the mix.   \n   \nI tend to be optimistic with regards to our name. And since we will also be striving into brandng/advrtising, it could make for a brilliant edge with promotional material.   \n   \nAll your feedback has been great, spurred us both into further discussions and scenarios. I want to get this decided well before my institutional study ends.   \n   \ntake care\n\n"
