      "content": "Looks too consistent for hand engraving.  \nBracelets, rings etc are usually engraved with a milling machine that uses fonts in a special format.  \nSome of these have the same names as regular fonts.  \nOthers do not.  \nI believe this one is in the latter category and is usually sold as \"Roman.\"  \nHere is a link to a typical list of engraving fonts:  \n [http://www.jewelryimpressions.com/fonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100600/http:/www.jewelryimpressions.com/fonts.html \"http://www.jewelryimpressions.com/fonts.html\")  \nThere are a few variations in \"Roman\" among engravers, but they usually are pretty close to your bracelet.  \nDon\n\n"
