The seller included a photo of something typed on the machine. The lettering was something I've never seen before. It looked very \"mod\" and somewhat thick. I've been looking and looking but can't seem to find the font. Does anyone know what typeface this is?\n\n"

In a bi-spaced system for example you could imagine most letters having the same widths and then have a half-width for letters like i, l, etc. It seems to me like it has a lot of educational value for newcomers to type design: they could start out with a monospaced font which is easier to draw because you don’t have to think about spacing much, and then they could move on bi-spacing it, trispacing it, etc. until they have something that actually works.\n\n"
