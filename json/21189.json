Since it's not the exact font I need, but rather something that looks like it, ideas for similar modern sans fonts are welcome as well.

I searched Typophile for Wallpaper ID and found it.\n\nIt's called Amplitude and can be found here: [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316032901/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude\")\n\nFor my kind of budget it's a little too expensive (1.750 $ for 2-5 cpu license) so I'm still interested in alternatives. Thanks!\n\n"

That sounds fair.\n\nI'm wondering when the sans-traps is available, Miss Tiffany?\n\nI like Parisine as well and Xtra sans looks good too. What In Amplitude is that it easy too read, it has some nice styles that mixes well and most of all: it doesn't havwe the feel of helvetica, Berthold Akzidenz grotesk, Franklin Gothick etc. which I love and have used a lot, but really need some time away from.\n\n"
