  "content": "Hello,\n\ni'm searching for an antiqua or a antiqua-like slab-serif as a compagnion for [FF Milo](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424143227/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11670.0.0).  \nFF Milo has (extremely) short ascenders and descenders - so the \"classic\" antiquas don't really go with it, i think. One i found so far, is Arnhem (OurType) – do you have other suggestions? Arnhem has a quite similar x-height, but Arnhem offers a different Capital-M, which could be a problem.  \nThe face should offer OSF and a minimal range of weights – regular, italic, bold, bold italic.\n\nThanks in advance, T.\n\n",

News)– that looks promising, but it is quite expensive…\n\nWe don't stop here :) Please more\n\n"
