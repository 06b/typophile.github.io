When we (or at least when I) say \"sans serif\", I am not necessarily thinking of the direct translation of \"without serif\". The \"sans\" part, despite it's origin, is not a modifier of the \"serif\" part; they are just one concept to me.\n\nThis is also why most people just say \"sans\" so often, and then so many people understand it. In French, it makes no sense.  \nWords like \"tomorrow\", \"whatsoever\", etc (even \"et cetera\" is acceptable as \"etcetera\"), are other examples of similar terms which were melded together conceptually and eventually also in their spelling. It seems like hyphenated versions come first before the terms eventually just melt into one solid word.\n\nI'm just trying to think of similar terms which were melted into a solid word, and dropped a letter in the process due to repetition.\n\n"

I don't know if I'm progressive enough to abandon it altogether though. It seems more likely that the English form of the term – if it hasn't done so already – will take on a new meaning which is related but different to its direct translation (more accepting of quasi-serifs and such).

      "content": "Well, I just happened to find these very interesting paragraphs today on the Typefoundry blog:\n\nI said above that ‘sanserif’ was a mistake on the part of the OED. The headword ‘Sanserif’ in the original dictionary was quoted from a Figgins type specimen dated 1830, the only known copy of which just happened to be in the library at the University Press in Oxford, the printer of the dictionary. But when I checked the name in the specimen (which is now in the Bodleian library) I found it was SANS-SERIF. In the dictionary the quotation from the Figgins specimen has ‘San-’ and ‘Serif’ at the end and beginning of two successive lines, the ‘s’ of ‘Sans’ having been lost. When they wrote the headword the editors perhaps read the hyphen as a word-break and deleted it.\n\nSo the term ‘sanserif’ should not have existed. Except that, curiously, it did. The OED has a few later quotations showing this spelling, long before the ‘S’ volume of the dictionary was published. And by using it myself I suppose I have added a bit of legitimacy.\n\nYou can find the complete post here:\n\n06 January, 2007  \nThe Nymph and the Grot, an update  \n [http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007\\_01\\_01\\_archive.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022841/http:/typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007_01_01_archive.html \"http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/2007\\_01\\_01\\_archive.html\")\n\nBera\n\n"

Well, it’s commonly held that the origin of the humble serif can be traced back to ancient Rome. Before an Inscription was carved into stone the letters were first painted on. Anyone who has tried painting letters will know that one is left with slightly wider sections at the ends of the brush-strokes. The stone carvers would then faithfully carve out the letters including the flares at the end of the strokes — thus was born the serif._\n\nHowever, it looks as though no-one knows much about the etymology of the word “serif”; some say that it comes from the Dutch schreef, meaning “wrote”, while other sources say the term “sanserif” actually pre-dates serif, so that sanserif on its own simply meant without serif (though that begs the question, where did the word sanserif originate?).\n\n"
