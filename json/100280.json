Not big branded stuff that we all know, more the homemade/sign-writer/weathered-and-looks-unusual kinda thing.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one to record type-in-action that's interesting, so if anyone else has something similar, feel free to share!\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/46913941@N02/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121519/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/46913941@N02/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/46913941@N02/\")\n\n",
