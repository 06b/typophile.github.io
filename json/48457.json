  "content": "Hi,\n\ni’ve got to design a brochure about an urbanism workshop that will take place in China. In fact, there will be three versions: a French, an English and a Chinese version (combined with a bit of English text). The porblem is: I know NOTHING about Chinese typography. I did read the following threads but I’m just more confuse than I was…\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/40032](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40032 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/40032\")  \n [http://www.typophile.com/node/47267](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47267 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/47267\")  \n [http://www.typophile.com/node/19200](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19200 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/19200\")  \n [http://www.typophile.com/node/38166](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38166 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/38166\")  \n [http://www.typophile.com/node/42433](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42433 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/42433\")\n\nSo, basically, can you guide me about choosing a good chinese font (I don’t know yet if the text will be set in traditional or simplified version). I’m in the early stage of the design so I don’t really know what I’m looking for, but as I understand it, I’ll have to work with the font that’ll work best technically with a short squedule (must be send to print on monday, 25!!!). A formal clue: there’ll probably be some [gridnik](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_gridnik/gridnik.html) or [simple](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.lineto.com/) in the layout.\n\nIs there Chinese typographic “rules” that I must know?\n\nIs there technical issues that I should be aware of (I’m using InDesign Cs3 on 10.5.4)?\n\nEverything else that you judge important…\n\nPlease remember that I’m a newbie about chinese type so if your answer could be short and consise, I’ll appreciate! It would probably not be possible, but…\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ american type](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50530 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Organic Type shirt ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50567 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Most Chinese fonts released by large foundries support both simplified and traditional, so don’t worry about it. I remember some Chinese fonts that may convey the sense you want with gridnik.  \nAs long as you are using a Chinese font, there shouldn’t any problem in InDesign, plus mac has very good support for asian languages.  \nAlso you might want to be careful about the leading.\n\n"

You said the workshop will take place in China? If mainland China then Simplified, if not then Traditional.  \nI can’t really give you the names because they are all in Chinese and PinYin doesn’t really make any sense. You can take a look [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.font.com.cn/downlist/s_12_1.html), or just go [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122102717/http:/www.foundertype.com.cn/agentmodel/NetEasyIndex.aspx?charset=ALL&FontUse=%D5%FD%CE%C4%D7%D6), it’s one of the most famous type foundries in China. Unfortunately I don’t have any English articles that I know of that deal with Chinese type.\n\n"

Just as the monospace latin characters are. I also notice halfwidth characters (the Latin words and numerals), how about those? Should the visual ’grid’ realign after these? Your image appears to be justified. And I noticed the first line indents precisely one square :-)\n\nI see an en-dash _and_ — 8th line — a “number one” character. Are those different enough? :-)\n\nI’ve seen punctuation in two different styles: either left-aligned in the character square, or centered, as your example shows. But I can’t find the special punctuation character you mention.\n\nA last question: Chinese doesn’t use hyphenation, but some phrases can only be understood correctly in character pairs, isn’t it? Does that bother anyone when reading?\n\nHope the storm doesn’t get any worse — I’ll keep an eye on CNN for ya.\n\n"

In simplified chinese, the width of punctuation varies, because it’s only set in one way, and they are left-aligned.  \nThere is no dash in the picture....it’s “one”. An em-dash is twice as long as that, and there is no en-dash.  \nCharacter pairs... ;-) There are some hilarious jokes derived from incorrectly paired characters, but no it doesn’t really matter that much.\n\nI’m not an expert on mixing chinese and english together, but I usually just decide leading based on chinese and justify english later on. I try to avoid mixing them up mostly, because english words breaks up the “rhythm”, in other words it interrupts the reading.\n\n"
