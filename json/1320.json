  "content": "Recently a generous friend gave me a PowerMac 6500, with a 17 inch Sony Monitor, and an Apple Personal Laserwriter 320 (PostScript, 2 baby!).   \n   \nThe system is in excellent condition, with:   \n- a clean install of Mac OS 9.1   \n- 48mb of ram   \n- 5gig hard disk   \n- CD rom   \n- internal zip 100 drive   \n   \nit all works, too. very reliable! Even the laserwriter. Great output. It's all been underused.   \n   \nTo me, this system just seems like a prime canidate for dedicating to font development. I'm a college student with very little money, and my G3 is overcrowded with junk as it is, so this thing is a godsend.   \n   \nObviously, I can't run FontLab or even TypeTool on it, so i guess I'm on the look out for an older version of fontographer. (or FL?)   \n   \nWhat do you all think? Is this feasable?   \n   \nI'm a complete newbie to the type design world, so I'm staring from square one. I know Illustrator well, but that's it. Any suggestions, advice, or help on getting started would be great. I know very little about the mechanics of all this. Once I get things up and running I'll post some stuff over in the Crit. forum.   \n   \nThanks!   \n   \nr.\n\n",

I was thinking about doing this to an old PowerBook 1400 of mine as a lark/experiment, but haven't gotten around to it yet.   \n   \nRoyalT is here:   \n [http://developer.apple.com/fonts/Tools/index.html#Editors](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108172649/http:/developer.apple.com/fonts/Tools/index.html#Editors) (you'll need to scroll to the top of the page and accpet the license in the first paragraph to download it)   \n   \nIf you don't have System 7.x disks or CD then System 7.5.3 is here: [http://www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html#system](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108172649/http:/www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html#system) (you'll need to scroll down a little from the place on the page that this link lands you).   \n   \nLet me know how it goes if you decide to (go insane and) do this.   \n   \nJon\n\n"
