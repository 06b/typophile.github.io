Died 1980, also in Zürich.\n\nMax Miedinger is known a type designer, mainly for his design of the [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) type family (actually, [Haas Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Haas%20Grotesk)).\n\nIn the late 1920's Miedinger trained as a typesetter, and eventually went to work for [Edouard Hoffmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Edouard%20Hoffmann) who was the director of the [Haas Typefoundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Haas%20Typefoundry). At the foundry, Miedinger worked primarily as a salesman. But in his spare time, at Hoffmann's behest, he designed a sans serif face, [Haas Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Haas%20Grotesk). Haas partners [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) and [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype) expanded the design into the complete [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20141101125016/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) family from 1957 onward.\n\nHelvetica's sucess was huge, and it put him on the map as a type designer. Linotype paid him a stipend for his contribution to their corporate success until his death in 1980—a very uncommon practice at the time.\n\n",
