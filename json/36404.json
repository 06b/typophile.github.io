  "content": "I watched the Ninth Gate last night from Netflix. IMHO, a rather unremarkable film that I normally would have just shut off if not for the fact that it all centered around antique books. Type didn't play a huge part, but got me thinking about what other semi-mainstream movies might use graphic design and/or type centric plot elements. Any come to mind?\n\nAny romances set in a print shop? Any murder mysterious surrounding a sign factory? The Scarlet Letter?\n\n",

The radically different endings between the two are an interesting discussion item for those who've experienced both.\n\nAlso, note that the all-important book everyone's dying over in \"The Ninth Gate\" is a thinly-fictionalized version of the actual book \" [Hypnerotamachia Poliphili](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012030706/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnerotomachia_Poliphili)\" (erotic dreams of Poliphilus), printed by Aldus in 1499. It's a stunning book, with cool typography and imagery. Another fictional unravelling of the secrets of this same book, but under its real name, is also the inspiration for the best-selling thriller \" [The Rule of Four](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012030706/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rule_of_Four),\" which is also being made into a film.\n\nOddly, the Wikipedia pages on \"The Ninth Gate\" and \"The Club Dumas\" don't even mention the Hypnerotomachia.\n\nDang, must get back to work. :)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
