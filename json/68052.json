  "content": "For Immediate Release:  \nMarch 4th, 2010\n\nP22 announces new releases for March- 2 new fonts by Terry Wudenbachs for IHOF, based on designs from the Nebiolo Type Foundry.\n\nP22 Slogan is a non-connecting script font that captures the essence of the lettering used in 1950s European advertising. Bold strokes of this brush-drawn face make this design a great choice for both retro design and contemporary work. The font is based on the 1957 design \"Slogan\" by Aldo Novarese for the Italian Nebiolo Type Foundry. At the time of its original release, it was touted for \"striking publicity work\". This new digitization accurately reproduces the outlines of the original not found in previous digital versions of this design. P22 Slogan is a non-Pro Opentype font that includes Central European characters.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014053633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/slogan_poster_5072.png)\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/slogan.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014053633/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/slogan.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/slogan.html\")\n\nP22 Nebiornaments contains over 100 ornaments based on the Italian Nebiolo Type Foundry designs of the 1950s. Many of these ornaments are designed to create complex patterns and continuous borders.
