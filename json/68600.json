I think Mecanorma's [Galba](http://web.archive.org/web/20100329014003/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/Galba/fonts/) is closer. Almost the only thing it needs is to close the P. The C shape is what makes me choose it. The relative angle of the serifs seems like the PACIFIC lettering, even more than Trajan, and the serifs on the E and F are more like the sample.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
