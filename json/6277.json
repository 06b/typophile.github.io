In the back they list their type as Suite, Borneo, Luomo, Maeda, interpol, Xquare, SuiteSerif, Interfunctionnen, bonus plus and block. the designers name is Inigo Jerez. Does anyone know who he is and if he sells his font? I don't see much record of him on the internet. Suite is beautiful. ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050825103938im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47157.gif)\n\n",
