The [Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123013343/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html) was started in 2000, and it was quickly pointed out after a few months that I had the spelling wrong. It still works for ID purposes, and the newer samples have the right spelling.   \n   \nThanks for mentioning it, though.\n\n"
