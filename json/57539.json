  "content": "Hey.\n\nYeah, I guess the subjet line is worded a bit weird. What I’m looking for is if there is a term for the type design feature where certain numbers, most commonly 3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9, extends below the baseline or above the mean line whereas 0, 1 and 2 stays the same size as lowercase letters? Such as in the examples in the attachment.\n\nIf anyone could recommend some (or a whole slew) of fonts with that design feature, either serif or sans serif fonts, I’d be most happy. Thanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [numbers.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20090506142011/http:/typophile.com/files/numbers.png) | 17.92 KB |\n\n",

Most professional fonts should have them, especially serif fonts (if you have Adobe software, you’ll probably have at least a Garamond Premier/Adobe Garamond, Myriad, Arno, Caslon, Chaparral, Constantia, Consolas, Georgia (cool, didn’t know that one!), Jenson, Minion...). Those are just from a quick scroll-through. Personally I’m quite fond of Garamond, Jenson, Arno, and Myriad.\n\nA more experienced type-nerd could give you more specialized recommendations.\n\n"
