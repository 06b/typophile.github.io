What happened to that tradition? We invite you to imagine what “The End” would look like for today’s movies. For example, what would the end title look like for No Country for Old Men? Twilight? Terminator?\n\n(Images should be 4” wide at 300dpi, emailed to info–at–uppercasegallery.ca) Closing date: June 1.\n\n-Janine Vangool  \n [http://www.uppercasegallery.ca](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103131407/http:/www.uppercasegallery.ca/ \"http://www.uppercasegallery.ca\")  \n [http://www.uppercasemagazine.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103131407/http:/www.uppercasemagazine.com/ \"http://www.uppercasemagazine.com\")\n\n",
