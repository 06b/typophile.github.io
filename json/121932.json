Perhaps the letters are modeled on something from a lettering book? Any more book covers by this publisher or others?  \nThanks.\n\nDon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [VerlagHansHenningPodzun1955EnzianUndEdelweiss.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317115939/http:/typophile.com/files/VerlagHansHenningPodzun1955EnzianUndEdelweiss.jpg) | 73.87 KB |\n\n",

Also, most of them go for an hexagonal grid, which prevents horizontal strokes of some substance.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Riccardo, for mentioning Eskapade & Moyen Age. I had looked at them some time ago and liked what I saw as good reinterpretations of blackletter.\n\nI agree the hexagonal grid in many blackletter updates is not good. In my opinion it is too mechanical and too far from what makes blackletter appealing -- the variation in strokes and emphasis which can sometimes give an effect that is both organic and dramatic, as is well expressed in this lettering.  \nAnyone else with some leads or thoughts?  \nDon\n\n"
