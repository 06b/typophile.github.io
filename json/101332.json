The characters themselves look like a serif version of Playoff, an ESPN proprietary font family developed by Pablo Medina.

I remember when Disney's WWoS got the ESPN makeover a few years back, a lot of the signage, etc. changed from [City](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013050607/http:/myfonts.us/BWNdSo) to this new font, and I wondered if it was related to ESPN. [Playoff](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013050607/http:/cubanica.com/portfolio/epsn/) (which apparently does have a serif version) certainly seems to match the more recent branding.\n\n"
