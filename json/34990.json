      "content": "Thinking aboyt your question some more I would have to say no - there isn't just one best way to set it or to design it. The # varies quite a bit from font to font. Some of the best designed ones vary a great deal from each other & make sense in the context of the font they are in. But that also brings me back to my earlier question. Some fonts don't have such a wonderful # sign. And if you are using one you might be tempted to poke at it. But In general I would suggest using a font whose glyph set works, even the #. Then you don't have to muck around... Does this make sense to you?\n\n"

I admit that it's not the first character I look at in a specimen, but I have yet to find a stinker in any font that I would use otherwise....\n\n"

But sometimes you can a have a lovley font but you just don't love one of the glyphs too... Which ones? I don't recall - but I can look at them & let you know. I don't expect everybody to agree. But it will be interesting to see if they do or not & why.\n\nThanks Vince!\n\n"

Then the words like _The New York Time s_ Bestseller - normally in all caps is divided among the oversized 1\n\nI can't begin to tell you how many times as a typesetter it was set that way....\n\nIn text, I just go with the # sign of the font I'm in, however, trouble in today's type - the number sign is made as a full character, and we are getting very use to seeing it as #1 and don't think twice about it -- and so many think inch marks are quote marks and foot marks are apostrophies....\n\nDon't get me started...\n\n"

Do you think this trend has perhaps come about through conflating the # and the ♯, or do typographers these days prefer a contrasted octothorp?\n\n"
