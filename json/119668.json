We had a single glyph digitized (typesetting company logo) which appeared in the headers on all our Lino 202 galleys. Mergenthaler charged us several thousand dollars -- for just that single glyph! We were a large company though so the cost wasn't as important as the company image was, and we paid it.\n\n"
