  "content": "Greetings everyone  \nSearched far and wide and I haven't found an exact answer to this one so I thought I would post it to the forum  \nWhat is the typeface used for movie theater marquee letters, such as these shown [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215140038/http:/flickr.com/photos/emily_paup/302756590/)? Looks like [FF Din](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215140038/http:/fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_black/) is fairly close, but its curves seem to be a little flatter than those in the marquee letters; anyone have an exact match?  \nThanks in advance for any assistance!  \nsno-man\n\n",
