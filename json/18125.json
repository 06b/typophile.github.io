  "content": "Hello everybody! My name is Taylor Buley — I’m an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania and editor of the Pennsylvania Independent. I’ve got a pretty cool project that I’m currently working on and wanted to get you guys in on.\n\nA little while back, due to copyright restrictions on our masthead we were forced to change our banner. We went for the more modern look you can see at [the top of our website](http://web.archive.org/web/20060411093050/http:/www.pennindy.com/) and in the PDF issue. We tried to compliment the modernity by raising the photos and giving them drop shadows.\n\nWe want to continue the modernization process by choosing and establishing a new font for the header, the byline and the text of the paper.\n\nOur only competition is the [school sponsored rag](http://web.archive.org/web/20060411093050/http:/www.dailypennsylvanian/) — whose been recieving school funding since 1879 and hasn’t updated their style since. We already have better journalism, so I want to compliment our work with a fantastic canvas to print on.\n\nSo I’m turning it over to you guys. Are there fonts you think would work well? We have little to no budget, so freeware is preferred; but cheap files can be considered. There’s so much that needs work that I’m sure you all will have some good suggestions. Thanks!\n\n[LINK TO OUR LATEST ISSUE](http://web.archive.org/web/20060411093050/http:/www.pennindy.com/PennIndy.v1e2.pdf) [.PDF]\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=biglogo.jpg)\n\n",

I would definitely listen to what Nick Shinn has said. Even if you go out an buy the ‘best’ two or complimentary typefaces they’ll be nothing if you don’t learn how to use them correctly.\n\nI’m also not sure how giving your photos drop shadows makes your paper more modern? Go out and study as many instances of magazines/newspapers as you can. You can then start finding what you like and what works and work it into your own publication.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

(smaller than the name of the newspaper. UNLESS, you want to use type as an image for style. LIKE, “9/11” or “BLACKOUT”\n\nthe text-type or body type should be 8pts - 12pts depending on your audience with dim eyesight (san-serif) franklin gothic, trade gothic, news gothic to name a few.\n\nAnother suggestion. Perhaps you paper can be abbrev. call “PI”\n\nwith a logo created.\n\nPennsylvanic Independent may be white type on black backeground as a masthead, just to throw in some ideas.\n\nHope it’s helpful!\n\n"

Some things I’ve learned that we’ll be using in issue three:\n\n- the value of small capitals, and lower-case numbers  \n- justified text optimizes space and brings with it a more formal feel  \n- serif text fonts are dramatically easier to read  \n- headlines set in all caps are significantly harder to read than mixed case  \n- a single, consistantly used graphic as a bullet can make it sexy  \n- always hang paragraphs with bullets  \n- no more than two typefaces on the page  \n- one font pt. is exactly 1/72”  \n- w/justified columns, never allow letter spacing to vary; eliminate gaps and rivers  \n- never underline text; apparently it’s a style leftover from typewriters that didn’t have italics  \n- generally, a line should have 55-60 characters, or 9 to 10 words for optimal readibility\n\nQuestions I still have:\n\n- can quark automatically fix ligature combinations?  \n- can it replace true quotation marks with curly quotes?  \n- what is a good leading height?  \n- does quark do kearning?  \n- what could I do better with the column width?
