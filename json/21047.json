      "content": "There was probably something very similar to this available in wood at that time. However, this look a lot like they might have used [Champion](http://web.archive.org/web/20130204180715/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/champion/index.html) from Hoelfer & Frere-Jones with some manipulation.\n\n[I'm going to move the to the Type ID area to see if others agree.]\n\n"

      "content": "Yee Haw Industries recently gave a great talk for AIGA Raleigh. They brought with them a locked up chase for an announcement that used all original (19th/20thc) wood and lead type, and hundreds of limited edition ephemera printed from wood type or wood engravings. (Very cool stuff).\n\nThey have one of the most extensive collections of wood type in the U.S. and, while designers/printers Julie Belcher and Kevin Bradley often draw images and type, the work is clearly of their hand. I have a large wall menu (4 ft. x 5 ft.) they designed and printed packed solid with various widths and heights of beautifully aged sans serif wood types, similar to the fonts Jonathan was probably looking at when he designed the Champion family. So I would guess the letterforms are \"authentic\" and not digitized, which adds to the poster's quality.\n\nOf course, the design is a translation of the DaDa sensibility by the designers. If you haven't seen much of their work, visit [http://www.yeehawindustries.com/new/home.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130204180715/http:/www.yeehawindustries.com/new/home.html \"http://www.yeehawindustries.com/new/home.html\"). Enjoy!\n\n"

      "content": "kevin/julie-yee-haw industrial letterpress:  \nhi y'all, typography on the large dada print from the national gallery exhibition,  \nthe wood type is gothic, (20 pica-black type) up to (70 & 90 pica-red,) hamilton type foundry from the 1860's. no computer involved, no manipulation of the font, hand pulled straight from the wood blocks. we also did 2 dada posters, a small dodger of hugo ball poem - with some amazingly beautiful small metal type, 4 greeting cards, one-of-a-kind journals with typography covers and some mini card packs. I don't have any of these on our web site yet - as they were exclusive to the national gallery for the duration of the show... but very soon.\n\n"
