Logo.  \nThe text \"Warner Bros. Picture\" really looks like it, but i saw that they use this font since the 1980s. PMN Caecilia was released in 1990...  \nAnd my second thought: the letters are not as broad as the Caecilia. But the letters have the same design.  \nSo I'm a bit confused. Maybe you can help me? Does anyone know which font Warner Bros. use?  \nthx\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [example.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150203045007/http:/typophile.com/files/Bildschirmfoto%202013-03-10%20um%2021.42.00.png) | 66.25 KB |\n\n",
