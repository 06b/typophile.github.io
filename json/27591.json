I have a font dilemma, I am currently working a project for a customer and need to find out what font is used for the 2006 Liberty Silver Dollar. I have searched high and low and am not able to find it. Is this a special font used by the Tresury Dept? I would appreciate any help.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nJesse\n\n",

What a disgrace. The Arial doesn’t even curve evenly: the type is too big for the arc it’s sitting on. Shame! They spent about $2 Canadian to design the coin.  \nI bet Robt. Bringhurst won’t even carry those coins in his pocket.  \nAs for the US dollar coin, since it’s a reissue of a design from the 1920’s [assuming I am thinking of the same coin you are] the letters are hand-drawn. Those were the good old days: in 1907, Teddy Roosevelt chose Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a famous American sculptor, to design some coins for the US Mint, as part of a comprehensive redesign of the coultry’s coinage.  \nAccording to Wikipedia, the dollar coin was designed by medalist Anthony de Francisci, a naturalized immigrant from Italy.  \nFont Bureau’s Grand Central has some of the flavor of public lettering of the early 20th century…\n\n"
