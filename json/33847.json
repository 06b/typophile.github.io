I’m looking for a font with the general weight and structure of Clarendon Bold or ITC Bookman Bold, but with a much fresher, more contemporary feel.\n\nRealize that’s fairly subjective and apologize in advance for the ambiguity and lack of proper terminology.\n\nthanks,  \njarrod\n\n [‹ Professional, sophisticated, sporty handwritten font for signature/autograph](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024943/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33839 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [My dissertation plan, please help! add anything to the list if you must. thanks ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024943/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33532 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

[Fedra bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024943/http:/www.typotheque.com/fedra_serif_a_bold/) by Typotheque is about as contemporary as you can get.\n\nI’m just not sure that slabs based on the Clarendon model feel particularly contemporary, though that would also depend on the usage.\n\nOf course, if you want to get crazy with a slab, try Storm’s [Farao](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024943/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/typefaces-199-farao-black).\n\n"
