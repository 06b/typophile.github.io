I've designed some guidelines for a client in which the prevailing style is left-aligned, un-justified type.\n\nThe cleint's company have just been introduced to the new style and they are moaning about not being able to justify or centre-align text with the new guidelines!\n\nDoes anyone know of or have some concrete material that I can use to convince them that left-alignment is both more elegant and more legible than a centred or right-aligned column? Also interested in any benefits of un-justified type (although I know this is debatable!)\n\nSomething like a case-study would be ideal. Anything that concentrates on legibility benefits is really the key thing!\n\n",

      "content": "If you ask me FL/RR vs justified is a matter of taste and also can depend on the usage. For narrow column measures justified type can be problematic because you end up with word spacing issues as you sometimes see in newspapers or mags. Justified type is cleaner though and you don't have to deal with rag issues.\n\nWhat is the job? And why are you resistant to justified type?\n\nCentered type is fine for heads or for short bits of text like captions, callouts, or blurbs but can be very annoying to read in longer paragraphs.\n\nRight aligned type can be effective for heads perhaps but not for running text.\n\nAlso with either centered or right aligned text it can be hard to distinguish paragraph breaks.\n\n"

Especially ragged left text requires some eye.\n\nThe benefits of un-justified type come visible when there’s a very narrow column or when the language is something like German or Finnish, with long words.\n\n"

      "content": "One reason for not using centered or ragged right text is that it is harder to read. When the eye gets to the end of a line, it needs to travel back a distance (hopefully not too far) to get to the start of the next line. If that starting point is always at the same position on the x-axis, it speeds up reading. Ragged right and centered text mean the eye must return to that position, and then work across to where the text eventually starts.\n\nNon-justified type, as has been mentioned, should not be a problem in good typesetting. But in word processed documents, where hyphenation programs may be suspect, and users often double space after a period, you can easily wind up with a space between words, or at the end of a sentence, that is much wider than the eye expects. When it hits this, it acts like a brick wall. The reader stops reading, wondering if something should be in this space, as it looks big enough to contain something. Eventually the eye starts up again, and continues, but the delay from bad spacing can be significant.\n\n"

Even though I was writing all the content on my own, which gave me the freedom to edit words, line lengths, paragraphs, and what not to make the proper fit, I felt it was still just as difficult, if not harder to achieve a well balanced rag all the way down the page. Although, at this point, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised with how nicely the columns have come out, and how the publication looks overall.
