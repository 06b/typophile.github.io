The earliest example, besides Dead History, was Fudoni by Max Kisman.   \nAs Paul Shaw has written in an essay for my \"Letters\" book (coming out before the end of the world), in Fudoni the letters were not collaged but \"smashed together\".   \nBodolive does a similar thing and the result is not unpleasant, in my opinion.\n\n"
