As is, I don't know about that color.   \n   \nI can make up an underlying idea here, something like the serif glyph projects the image of the company and the double-pixel font shadow describes their work, but it seems a bit trite to me. What are your thoughts?\n\n"

This color is pantone process cyan. I was also considering PMS 021 (standard AWT orange). The smallest the logo will appear in print will be on business cards. I have considered stroking the individual 'pixels' in order to better define them at small sizes or for on screen use.   \nThank you for your input\n\n"

      "content": "I think the idea is plenty strong, just needs tweeking. I think the biggest reproduction problems (when it gets printed on my ghetto laser printer or faxed, etc) is going to be the fade in the shadow and the lines making the pixels. I might explore ways to say \"pixelated\" without the grid. I also thing the angle alone gives it the shadow flavor, no need to fade it out.   \n   \nHowever, having said that, there is no reason to not have two versions, as long as you can stress their applications correctly in the standards manual.   \n   \nGood luck, it's looking good.   \n   \nAaron\n\n"

Or maybe the H on each end could be capped or larger SC, with one serif and one pixel. But then again, you're entering Xerox logo territory again.   \n   \nIt's tough, but there's a lot of potential with the name and the subject matter. Personally, I'd try diggin into the company's personality a bit more, especially since they're small. That may give you something to work with that hasn't been designed 400 billion times already (generic 'digital looking' web company logos).\n\n"
