The top one is probably hand-drawn, and in any case it is probably not the same font as the “HOW TO WEAR IT” lettering, if it is a font. The latter is surely a font, but may be a custom-made one, since that style can be made by anyone very cheaply, and with no skill.\n\nI am not sure I understand searching for exact matches for fonts like this, because there are hundreds of free fonts that would have the same feeling, if not the identical details.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
