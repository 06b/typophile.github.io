[Melior](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014941/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/bold/testdrive.html?s=RPG&p=48) is similar as is the [Renault](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014941/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/renault/bold/testdrive.html?s=RPG&p=48) font, but there are no off-the-shelf fonts that will match these.

NC-17 was added much later than the original ratings (in the 90s, I think) and intended or not, became the defacto replacement for the dreadful-sounding but seldom-used 'X' rating. Also PG-13 was created in the mid 1980s after Spielberg campaigned the MPAA and argued there was too much of a gap in between PG and R. _(Many, including Spielberg, thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was too dark for the PG rating it received)_. As mentioned in one of those earlier threads, I don't think they redrew the seemingly-custom ratings logos, but simply patched them. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nJames is fine, Yves, but I don't really care either way. Hope you're enjoying that new arrival! Time flies, before you know it they'll be off to college.\n\n"
