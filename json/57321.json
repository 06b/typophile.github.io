  "content": "Hi guys, I´m working on a Jack Daniels Article in a magazine, and I wonder if you can suggest me some similar font to use in the headlines and other subtitles in the article.  \nI´m looking a font similar than the TENNESSEE word. I guess it must be a custom work, but maybe you know some font similar.\n\nthanks very much in advance\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115022819im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jack_3815.jpg)\n\n",
