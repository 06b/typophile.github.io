  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm just about to start doing research for my BA Graphic Design dissertation/thesis at Central St Martins in London. My topic as of now is \"The Evolution of American Hand Lettering In the 20th Century\" - this will probably change as I go along. It's an incredibly broad topic, and I want to narrow it down at some point, but I would like to determine my direction according to my research. As a starting point, I have picked out the following books and essays:\n\nAmerican Type Design and Designers  \nby David Consuegra\n\nHandwriting in America: A Cultural History  \nby Tamara Plakins Thornton\n\nScript and Scribble: The Rise and Fall of Handwriting  \nby Kitty Burns Florey\n\nAn Elegant Hand: The Golden Age of American Penmanship and Calligraphy  \nby William E. Henning\n\nHandwritten: Expressive Lettering in the Digital Age  \nby Steven Heller\n\nEdward Fella: Letters on America  \nby Lewis Blackwel\n\nHouse Industries  \nby House Industries\n\nAmerican Modernism: Graphic Design, 1920-1960  \nby R. Roger Remington\n\nThe Evolution of American Typography (Design Quarterly 148)  \nby Mildred Friedman\n\nThe Education of a Typographer  \nby Steven Heller\n\nThe Golden Age of Hand Lettering In American Advertinsing  \nby Nick Shinn\n\nAmerican Graphic Design Expression: The Evolution of American Typography\"  \nby Katherine McCoy\n\nNow, I haven't bought any of these books yet, as I am unsure if they all \"fit\" with the topic, and therefore worth spending money on. I am wondering if you guys have any thoughts on the list so far, anything that should be added or subtracted? Is this an OK starting point?\n\nThanks!\n\nAnders\n\n",

It is, without a doubt, the most incisive look at both lettering and calligraphy... two very different things. And it is the least agenda driven retrospective.\n\nIt will give you more names than you can search in a lifetime.\n\nMichael\n\n"

      "content": "There's very little in your list on commercial lettering, which comes into focus in the Leach book. And commercial lettering was at the centre of the profession, as most large text was hand lettered for the first half of the century at least. That's an awful lot of work in posters, advertising, brochures and packaging, not to mention one-offs such as tickets and show cards. Don't forget greetings cards.\n\n"

      "content": "I would suggest \"Lines,\" a book by Tim Ingold. This book is not written for a design audience -- it's geared towards anthropologists, but is written for a general audience. This will give you zero specific information about handlettering in 20th century America, but it will give you a broader picture of how the living gesture of the human hand has been replaced with a static and unmoving \"concept holder\" in modern typography.\n\nThe other book I would recommend is \"The Stroke,\" by Gerrit Noordzij. Again, this has nothing to do with commercial handlettering in 20th century America, but provides a good base for understanding the relationship of lettering and type.\n\n"

It is mainly sign painting, posters and showcards so might not be as refined as what you are interested in. The Atkinson 75 Alphabets is one of the oldest, from about 1914 but I've got books like this going up the '80s. Also a lot of British ones, such as Cecil Wade, for comparison. PM me if you're interested in having a look. I'm in Harrow in NW London.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083243im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SignBooks_5185.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Wow, I am astounded by the feedback I've received on this thread so far, thank you very much guys! I've just ordered a few books off Amazon, amongst those \"The Stroke\" and \"Lines\", which both looks really interesting. I am planning on getting Dangerous Curves when I get back to London (in Norway for the next 3 weeks) - looks amazing by the way. I have also contacted The Calligraphers Guild, to see if I can get hold of a few of their previous issues of Scripsit. The only problem is that they only seem to accept checks, which are hardly in use over here anymore.\n\nNick: I know there's little in my list on commercial lettering, which was what I initially wanted to write about, but I haven't found that much info on it. I know that my college library has a copy of Leach's book, so I will look into that when I get back. Also, my tutor recommended \"America\" by Baudrillard, since it touches on commercial and consumer society in America (not from a typographic point of view though).\n\nJustin: Those books looks amazing! I will definitely be interested in having a look, I'll PM you as soon as I get back.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for the information you've provided me with so far guys!!\n\nAnders\n\n"

You cannot ignore non-advertising sources of hand lettering from showcards through pinstriping through painted billboards and signage and non-commercial lettering such as the evolution of modern calligraphy and the height of lettering at the end of the Century revealed itself in millions of 'scrappers' who took the baton of hand lettering and evolved a new interest and awareness in hand lettering . . .\n\nYou're correct in your initial post that this is a broad topic but nobody has really addressed any lettering that occurred after 1970 so far in the thread specifically and there were a TON of changes just in the last 30 years of the century . . .\n\nStuart :D\n\n"

I can see how it isn’t much use to someone with years of experience, but for a designer working on his first font it’s great to have someone explain exactly why all those intuitive aspects of drawing with a pen can be used to develop, examine, and critique a type design. But James is right—it’s not relevant to this research, at least not enough to justify reading it over something else. A BA thesis just doesn’t offer enough time to read everything—trust me, I went way overboard on the research and everything else I did suffered.\n\n"
