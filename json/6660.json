  "content": "Hello, all! I am not a type designer and my level of knowledge about fonts is relatively scant. I've run into a question/problem that I have not been able to find an answer for, so I'm here hoping you'll help.   \n   \nWhen designing fonts, I've seen various geometric shapes (circles, lines, curves, etc) used to create the shape of the font. For example, notice the words \"Da Vinci\" in this image: [http://www.keynotethemepark.com/content/pages/T3/davinci/davinci\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014001356/http:/www.keynotethemepark.com/content/pages/T3/davinci/davinci_01.jpg)   \n   \nWhat is this process called? Where can I find more information about it? My final goal is to perhaps locate a font that looks like this for a \"Roman Architecture\"-style website.   \n   \nAny hints or clues?   \n   \nThanks in advance for any help offered.   \n   \nPeter   \nColumbus, Ohio USA\n\n",

      "content": "They're sort of just called \"constructed\" fonts, although that also makes one think of the 20th century \"Soviet-style\" stuff, or the cut&paste fad of the 90s. But if you're looking for a term for fonts that include the \"scaffolding\" so to speak in there, I don't know a term for that - probably because I know of only one such design: Agfa's Rubino.   \n   \nIn terms of references, Matthew Carter has written one of the very few substantial articles about the topic: \"Theories of Letterform Construction\", in issue #26-27 (AKA Volume 13-#2 & Volume 14-#1) of the APHA Journal\\*. That was \"Part 1\", but unfortunately it looks like part 2 won't happen. Carter lists Pacioli, Durer and Tory as having tried their hand at geometrically constructed capitals.   \n   \n\\* [http://www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/contents.html#26\\_27](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014001356/http:/www.printinghistory.org/htm/journal/contents.html#26_27)   \n   \nA harder reference to find is Oldrich Hlavsa's amazing \"A book of type and design\" of 1960. Part of it is dedicated to geometrically constructed alphabets, and besides Tory and Pacioli he covers Pierre le Be, Jean de Vingle, and Damiano da Moille. Besides that, Hlavsa's book contains many \"lost\" gems of type design as well, plus some interesting personal thoughts on type.   \n   \nBTW, I once bought a facsimile of Durer's \"Of the Just Shaping of Letters\" for $10, and it contains comprehensive sketches and full discussions of the whole A-Z, and even an attempt at geometrically constructing blackletter lowercase at the end. I just checked bookfinder.com and it looks like it's available for as low as $3.50.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
