From hand-drawn to any geometric sans, including freebie. Some: [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017100638/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/futura/), [Avant-Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017100638/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/avant+garde/), [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017100638/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/helvetica/), [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017100638/http:/typophile.com/wiki/%5B%5Bhttp%3A/%252Fwww.myfonts.com/search/avenir/), [Raleway](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017100638/http:/www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Raleway), [Nexa](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017100638/http:/fontfabric.com/nexa-free-font/)...
