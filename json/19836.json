  "content": "I've been working with a font family (that I love) for some time now, but it's limited to the traditional book typography variations: roman, SC, italic, bold (all with lining and old style figures). It would be immensely helpful if there were, say, a bold italic...and perhaps even a bold SC. It would probably also make the family more enticing to other designers, to be honest.\\* How realistic is it to approach the designer of the original directly and try to commission them to expand the family? Would current distributors of the family need to approve? I realize that it depends heavily on the specific designer's willingness, and how much one is willing to spend, but I'm very curious. I also have little to no idea what the typical cost of a project like this is. Licensing exclusivity is not an issue.\n\nI had the idea recently, and it may be too pie-in-the-sky to be realistic, but I'd like to get a sense as to whether there's any precedent and if there would be thorny legal issues. I'd appreciate any informed thoughts on the subject. I'd like to make it a reality, but for now it's purely a hypothetical.\n\n\\*I have no idea how well the family is selling.\n\n",

      "content": "If the designer is still alive I'd agree that this is your best first step. Your best second step is to approach the foundry and read the EULA. If the EULA allows modifications and/or derivatives you shouldn't have any problems. However, even then most foundries who do allow mods and derivs allow it only for in house use, ergo not for resale. So, that takes you back to the first two steps.\n\nSo, you aren't going to tell us the font?\n\n"

Should be no legal problem as long as you, the designer and the distributor have a dialogue. Allthough the typface is licenced to some distributor, the designer owns the design itself.\n\nGood luck.\n\n"
