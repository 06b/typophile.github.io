  "content": "For my second year form and concept class we have been working with grid based lettering. In order to learn the rules before breaking them. We are limited to perfectly circular forms and 45ï¿½ angles, but we are allowed to stray from the rules slightly as long as we stick to the grid.   \n   \nOur current assignment is to create a wordmark for Precision Tools & Instruments. a ficticious company. I have designed the letters needed as simply as possible, roughly based off a sample from a type specimen book.   \nThe problem is the ampersand. It's becoming to weird looking and inconsistent. I think I have an understanding of what should be happening , but am having problems getting there.... any help, maybe outlines of similar fonts to look at would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.....   \n   \nMike<!--attachment: precision-28562.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*243.3*Precision%2epdf*precision%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121507im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Precision.pdf<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050526121507/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/precision-28562.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>precision.pdf</b></a> (243.3 k)</td></tr></table>\n</center>\n<!--/attachment-->\n",

I reckon that teachers, tutors, professors whatever love seeing something else, they sometimes like to see things that aren't completely within the regime of the brief. Tutors can never be clients, and even clients can be persuaded otherwise.   \n   \nNice logotype, given the constrraints. Have you considered making the main strokes 2 squares thick and the thins 1 square thick? or even 3:2? I say this because the serifs on the n,m,r,s and c are too chunky, out of proportion. I wouldn't trash the Et idea, I have seen some pretty \"traditional\" ampersands that are created in such a manner.   \n   \nkris.\n\n"

I'm going to try those suggestions tonight.   \nI think I was just more hesitant to use something that was closer to latin in something really modern.   \n   \nKris, thanks for the sugestions, I originially saw this as more of a unistroke, but adding thicks and thins might really make this sing....   \nI'll add some updates tonight.\n\n"
