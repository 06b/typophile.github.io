As you can see, Adobe CS and Quark are pretty much it, at least for advanced features. If your friend wanted to use Word, they could cheat by going to insert\\>character, and finding each SC or whatever glyph they wanted, and inserting them one by one. Unless their poetry is Icelandic saga length, this might be a usable workaround.\n\n"

You can use fondu, a tool to convert fonts with resource forks, into a format which can be understood by X11. You are recommended to convert OpenType fonts into TrueType/ OpenType fonts, to preserve all the glyphs. (Type 1 fonts are limited to 256 gylphs per font.)”\n\nI’m not knowledgeable enough on OpenType to translate that.\n\n"

Just make sure to change the quick build command to using “xelatex” instead of “latex”, and to set default editor font encoding to “utf8” and you’re pretty much good to go.\n\n"
