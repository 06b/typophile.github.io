However I can't seem to find any digitised version of the font with anything like this. Can anyone confirm or deny this hunch? Am willing to swap to Goudy Heavyface if need be.\n\nIt seems like a very obvious extension of such a popular font, so I can't believe it hasn't been done before. If i had more time i'd start on my own version immediately...\n\nThanks for any leads.\n\nToby\n\n",

I wanted to lift some inspiration from Cooper swash and do a full range of swash caps for this font, but time was not on my side... maybe i'll go back and do that someday... maybe.\n\n"

There are two versions of the typeface which are included in the package: Oz Cooper's original design, which opts out of swashbuckling for a number of characters, and a modified version, where all but the S have swashes added. The original design is based on Barnhardt Brother's original casting of the Cooper Black Italic, with supplementary research done at the Newberry Library in Chicago (which houses Oz's archive of lettering and correspondence) for inspiration. Scans of Oz's hand lettering were analyzed to provide the structural basis for the custom version.\n\n"
