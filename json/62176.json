I have just read that section of Tam's thesis, and while he's a smart fellow, a good typographer and a nice guy, I am not yet convinced that the humanist sans typefaces of the 90s are all that different than those of the 80s. Their positioning in an extended family is more common, but not entirely new (e.g. Stone Sans / Serif, Legacy Sans / Serif). There aren't any specific design traits he calls out that distinguish these from their predecessors. Availability of oldstyle figures, maybe? But these are not such a fundamental characteristic of a typeface, in my mind, unless they are made the default figures.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

He raises some interesting issues and if one (or even better, a typographic scholar) includes all and all humanist typefaces designed up to the present day and then analyzes them his conclusions would be more acceptable than Tam’s.\n\nJust put Johnston’s London Underground Sans side by side with Frutiger Next, the former does give the impression of being quite aged, a classic nevertheless… while on the other hand Frutiger Next emanates postmodern aesthetics.\n\nAnd here comes an interesting question, which was the very first Humanist Sans? Doric Bold, aka Humanist 970 (1870) or Johnston’s London Underground Sans (1916)?\n\n"

What it is fair to say, and may be all that Tam was trying to say, is that some particular style of humanist sans became much more popular. However, one would need to define the characteristics of that style.\n\n- I would be very interested in how one defines the characteristics of this \"neo-humanist\" style, as to whether said characteristics are particularly \"new\" in the 90s or have antecedents in the 80s and earlier. I'm expecting the latter, but it depends on the definition.\n\nFor my part, as long as we have somebody calling themselves \"Hypatia\" in the thread, I'll note that the past decade or so saw a resurgence of geometric sans, which was largely a revival, stylistically: Avenir came back into vogue, and new typefaces like Gotham and Neutraface were innovative and well-executed, yet also in the style of previous work. (My\\* own Hypatia Sans was intended to be part of that geometric sans resurgence.)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n\\* I'll continue to call it \"my\" typeface as a shorthand, and because the main ideas and all the outlines of the upright were my doing, but I owe a huge debt to Robert Slimbach for constant input and guidance, Miguel Sousa and Robert for doing the kerning on the upright faces, and now Paul Hunt for finishing the italics.\n\n"

We could have a new type of Sans Serifs based directly on 'almost upright' handwriting and enhanced structurally according to the principles of Graphology.  \n2. We could alternatively have Sans Serifs based on curvatures and other structural details found in industrial objects, such as cars and even architectural buildings.  \n3. The Geometric Sans on the other had might evolve from experimental typefaces and ideas such as those presented in Letter Spirit:\n\n[http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/farg/mcgrawg/lspirit.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141227020115/http:/www.cogsci.indiana.edu/farg/mcgrawg/lspirit.html \"http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/farg/mcgrawg/lspirit.html\")\n\n4.

A better way of looking at this is by seeing how the neo-grotesques/neo-humanists address the problems that exist in typographic settings.\n\nI still think that Scala Serif/Sans as well as other early [super families](http://web.archive.org/web/20141227020115/http:/typophile.com/node/29924) are the most notable contemporary examples of how the sans serif can be used in a complete typographic system. They address the problem of the lack of harmony that exists in a setting where non-linear reading occurs (as mentioned by [Tam](http://web.archive.org/web/20141227020115/http:/www.keithtam.net/documents/sanserif.pdf) p.12), without being overly ambitious in creating a sans serif that aims to bear the full burden of body copy.\n\nI think that when one neglects looking at how typefaces are being used, the explanation of their success—or potential success—becomes too speculative.\n\n"

They way they look now (and if they are improved upon) they could be used for display or to deign logos with.\n\nNevertheless, it is something innovative and I believe that eventually a type designer or two might pick up these ideas and come up with quite acceptable ‘Letter Spirit’ inspired typefaces, geometric sans typefaces.\n\n"
