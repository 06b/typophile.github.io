I'm wondering why Landor would take steps to find something similar to Futura without just using a lighter cut of Futura.\n\n",

Why not just the word Kinkos in simple type and be done with it. Now it is a cluttered mess. Perhaps this was just \"corporate fencing\" trying to appease the old Kinkos bosses and the designers were just along for the ride.   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"

They were playing off the arrow in the \"K\" in Kinko's and used the colors FedEx currently uses with their different services. After some time they plan on dropping the \"Kinko's\" and just have it say FedEx Office and Print Center.\n\n"
