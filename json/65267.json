  "content": "Hi there,  \nI am having a bit of trouble identifying the two slabs in this picture.  \n\"restaurants\" seems to be a typeface very similar to Clarendon, but the lower case \"t\" is quite different.  \n\"BEST\" also seems to be a different face altogether, but the former is driving me crazy.  \nAny help would greatly be appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202121221im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC00002_4596.jpg)\n\n",
