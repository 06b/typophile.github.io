I also looked through the Solotype Catalog, to at least find a name, but this typeface only resembles a few types that were all upper case and more elongated. The other problem is that not much of the Solotype collection was digitized. The rights to the collection now belongs to Castcraft, so they claim.\n\n"

Castcraft site starts at [http://www.castcraft-software.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142125/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/). It may take some hunting to find the information that they acquired the rights to Solotype. I have heard that inquiries to them may never be answered, so I can't give you a very positive feeling about dealing with them. Frankly, I think you would be best off just searching for Wood types, Tuscan types or Western types and seeing what is available. The closest resemblance to this I know is a font from the old FontBank colelction called Old West. It is an open face style, but I think it could be called concave tuscan too. You can see and buy it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142125/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/oldwest.htm).\n\n"
