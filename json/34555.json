FontLab can make them. FontLab can’t make “true” bitmap fonts - that’s what BitFonter is for. True bitmap fonts are harder to deliver, not least because OSX ignores them...\n\nNote that good ol’ Fontographer used to be able to make both pixelfonts and true bitmap fonts, altough its latter ability might have been removed now that FontLab owns it... Can anybody confirm/deny this?\n\nhhp\n\n"
