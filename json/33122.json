There will have to be some compelling need arise for John and Sally Public to take an interest in it. Perhaps that is why only publishing apps support much of it. Even Quark is quite late to the party.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

The latter is a huge engineering challenge, which is why only a couple of companies have done it. If Windows Presentation Foundation and Cocoa provide easy access to this sort of functionality it might suddenly start showing up in all kinds of programs. Programmers love adding features, they just have a limited amount of resources. The trick is helping them get this stuff “for free” simply by using programming components that support it.\n\n"

In the bad old days, we had things like alternate characters in separate fonts, leaving it to the user to sort out. But at least it was a level playing field—no special application or OS support necessary to use alternate characters and such. With OpenType, if you don’t have one of the few programs that fully support the fonts, you’re stuck with a limited version of the font (in effect).\n\nI just got my Adobe CS3 upgrade today, and was disappointed by the relative lack of progress in the OT area. (I know, I should go make a feature request in the appropriate place.) In InDesign, for instance, it’s even harder to find the OT stuff than the previous two versions.\n\nRealistically, I know that most people buying my fonts will have one or more of the first four programs on my list. But I really feel frustrated when I get a complaint from a Flash user wondering why they can only access the basic characters in an “advanced” font they just bought from me.\n\n"
