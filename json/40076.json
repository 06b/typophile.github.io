  "content": "Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for a type to go with a logo design.\n\nThe company is called Setfire Media, they are a web development company, who mainly create and maintain e-commerce sites. They are expanding rapidly and need to recruit both better clients and better staff. The main things they want the logo type to suggest are intelligence as well as a forward-looking attitude, without being boring. Any suggestions for type that would suit this?\n\nBtw, I know this is fairly vague, but any ideas would be of use I’m sure.\n\nCheers,\n\nSam\n\n [‹ Arabic Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20071216225134/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38807 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fuse Magazine and D&AD ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071216225134/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39718 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
