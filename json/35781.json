  "content": "I just posted this in 'Blackletter', but maybe someone in 'Type-ID' knows more about this... I'm not sure ...\n\nVia Google books I saw a book, printed in some kind of Blackletter (Ueber Deutsche Runen, Wilhelm Carl Grimm, Göttingen, 1821). The shape of the umlaut caught my eye, but I paid no further attention. Today I visited someone who had a piece of furniture with type on it. This cupboard is made in 1855 and the type used seemed familiar. Indeed, it featured the same kind of e-shaped umlaut on top of the 'a'.  \nWhat font is it?  \nArjen\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414061554im_/http:/typophile.com/files/umlaut-e_4533.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "The e above vowels is the regular design of an Umlaut in blackletter. It doesn't just look like an e, it is an e that moved from behind the vowel on top of it. »Boese« became »Böse«. Two strokes or dots above the vowel are younger shapes that replaced the e over time.\n\nBut unfortunately digitized blackletter typefaces often don't use the original shape. Try Alte Schwabacher or Breitkopf-Fraktur.\n\nRalf\n\n"
