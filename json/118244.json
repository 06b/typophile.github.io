So that made me even more determined to find it! :)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201335im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bachfont1_6522.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201335im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fontfind_3590.jpg)\n\nSOLVED!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Wish I Were Taller \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201335/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bachfont1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201335/http:/typophile.com/files/bachfont1.jpg) | 59.14 KB |\n| [fontfind.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317201335/http:/typophile.com/files/fontfind_1.jpg) | 119.68 KB |\n\n",
