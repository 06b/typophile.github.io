You can say, “Jane has good taste, and Bob has bad taste,” which again amounts to almost nothing of value.\n\nPersonally, I really have an affection for Goudy Sans (with original alternates). I’ve only used it twice, in fact, I don’t think I actually want to use it. I just love the shapes, the rhythm and modulating color it creates on the page. But I don’t find it a very useful typeface. It’s like Arrighi’s forms in the [_Operina_](http://web.archive.org/web/20090713040807/http:/www.acmedigital.net/jiansabu/arrighi.htm), beautiful but basically unusable.\n\n——————————————————————  \nYes, I’m old, but I’m back in style!\n\n"

Maybe the way to offer type suggestions is post a new category of topics here at Typohile. Enough designers seem to visit the site (at this moment of post: 29 members 822 guests). Maybe that would help to increase active participation.\n\nThat way there would be no stagnant or “official” list of typeface suggestions, but simply typographers/type designers making graphic designers aware of new developments.

      "content": "Will, the essential typefaces for someone starting a studio are usually the ones you’ve already heard of. A lot of work can come from clients with established styles/fonts and they’ll expect you to match them. The essentials for us as a group? Heh. You’d never get agreement on 5 of them, let alone 100. I think we all have a handful that we use regularly when there are no constraints other than our own preferences. There are certainly other (and arguably better) versions of some of these fonts, but they continually come up in my life.\n\nThese are _not_ my favorites, just ones that I’ve had a need of/use for repeatedly.\n\nAdobe Garamond  \nFutura  \nHelvetica (all variations)  \nGill Sans  \nMrs. Eaves  \nMeta  \nTimes New Roman/Times  \nThe web fonts (Verdana, Georgia, etc.)  \nUnivers  \nFrutiger  \nMinion  \nTrade Gothic  \nFranklin Gothic  \nBell Gothic  \nUnibody  \nRotis (well, I’ve seen it all over, but haven’t had to use it)  \nAdobe Caslon  \nTrajan\n\nHowever, a lot of this list is determined by generational trends, design fads, etc. Also, notice the lack of script faces. I could make it longer, but I honestly don’t have the time. The majority of my work is given to me, rather than chosen by me. When I have control, other fonts I’ve chosen in the past few years are:\n\nFF Scala & Scala Sans  \nFF Absara  \nMelior  \nAdobe Jenson Pro  \nFilosofia  \nCitizen  \nMantinia  \nWhitman  \nDalliance\n\nI’m not sure they’d make many people’s ’essentials’ list, but they worked very well for what I used them for. I often avoid ’typical’ fonts, unless it’s the best solution.\n\nI guess my overall point is that a consensus would be impossible, mainly because our love of a font doesn’t make it essential or even particularly useful. It’s the equivalent of asking what color t-shirt is most essential; maybe useful individually, but completely subjective generally.\n\n"
