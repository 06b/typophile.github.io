David Nalle's site does have several candidates besides Captain Kidd (he has a [great web page](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413024540/http:/www.fontcraft.com/scriptorium/kidd/index.html) on the inspiration and development of the face).\n\nYou can also find many \"historic\" styled faces available at [The Walden Font Co.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413024540/http:/www.waldenfont.com/). By mixing a titling face and \"handwritten\" lines here and there, you can emulate an \"old treasure map\" look. Look at their \"Divers Handes\" collection for scripts.\n\nFYI- you might contact them direct since they seem to be working on a new \"Nautical Themes\" collection. Maybe you can be one of the first users and be truly unique with your project.\n\nDid you see Type Oasis [Pirate & Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413024540/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/pirates/index.htm) yet?\n\n"

I just don't know yet whether it's applicable already in professional use, but I'll put an update there the next minutes, so you can have a look at it.  \nPossible problems: No bold, no italic, maybe too filigree, and never been used in productive systems yet.  \nPossible pros: made from a map of america from 1561 (spaniard), has titling capitals, lots of special characters (astrological, astronomical, roman numbers, ligatures, etc.).  \nIf you want to use it, I could produce a version with merged contours and send it to you for a try.\n\nSebilar\n\nBtw: Has MVB Sirenne been proposed already?  \n [http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/sirenne/pk\\_sirenne\\_text.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413024540/http:/www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/sirenne/pk_sirenne_text.htm \"http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/fonts/sirenne/pk\\_sirenne\\_text.htm\")\n\n"
