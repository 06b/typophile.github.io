  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for a font that is near identical to Gotham Condensed Ultra. I would purchase this font from Hoefler but do not sell this font on it's own but combine it with the set for £500! Anyway, I would love to hear from someone who could suggest a couple of alternatives.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nColin\n\n",

For an alternative; have a look at [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417144549/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/) by Mark Simonson.\n\n"
