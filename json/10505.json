I'll post a small sample. Any help you can give me would be great!   \n   \n ![E sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050515203710im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70546.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I'd guess maybe they are 'pseudo-names', such as the ones Printers and Stationers make up to avoid using the copyrighted names of commercial fonts.   \n   \nE17 looks like Alternate Gothic No. 1, or one of the other numbered Gothics.   \n   \nE10 could be another of the Gothics or even Helvetica compressed.   \n   \nIn my opinion one of these commercial fonts would be nearly indistinguishable to all but a Typophile fanatic, and you would know what you were dealing with, license-wise.\n\n"
