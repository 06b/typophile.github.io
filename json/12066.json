Many foundries also sell their own fonts directly and sometimes in addition to selling through a retailer.\n\nMany of today's font retailers also carry their own font collection, such as [Veer's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer) Umbrella Collection, FontShop's [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) foundry and Phil's Fonts with [Garage Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garage%20Fonts). In other scenarios there are large foundries that have spun off a retail arm, such as [Bitstream's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bitstream) [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MyFonts) and [Monotype's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Monotype) [Fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fonts.com).\n\n[Font Bros](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Bros)  \n [Fontever](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fontever)  \n [FontHaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontHaus)  \n [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop)  \n [Fontspring](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fontspring)  \n [Fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fonts.com)  \n [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MyFonts)  \n [Phil's Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Phils%20Fonts)  \n [T-26](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/T-26)  \n [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer)  \n [Village](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Village)\n\nBefore adding retailers to this list, please consider whether the entry you're adding is better listed under [Foundries](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114039/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Foundries).\n\n",
