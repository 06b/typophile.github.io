  "content": "After reading that Helvetica is primarily considered a display font (in one of the other discussions), I was interested to know what sans serif fonts are considered good for laying out masses of text?   \n   \nPerhaps something that would have complimentary accompanying numerals for laying out the financials of an annual report.   \n   \nWhat are the qualities one should look for when identifying a suitable sans serif text face?   \n   \nThanks for a great resource :-)\n\n",

I've watched the   \nSacred Nipple for some time and it's nice to have   \nanother experienced fontographer on board.   \n   \nWelcome, Brode. [Shoe Repairs](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090817/http:/www.t26font.com/fonts/fontshow/db.cgi?db=default&uid=default&ID=900&ww=on&view_records=View%2BRecords%2CShoe) is a wonderful thing   \nand your [newer stuff](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090817/http:/www.sacrednipple.co.za/new.html) shows some great potential.   \n(What's the \"FRESH\" font on that page, btw?)   \n   \nStephen\n\n"

      "content": "Geez ...thanks! Although 'experienced' is hardly a word I'd use to describe myself. Infact if people ask me if I'm a typographer I say 'no, just a designer who really loves type'.   \n   \nThe hardest thing for me creating type in South Africa is that there is absolutely no one there who I know of that has an expansive knowledge of typography and fontographer. So I've pretty much been working in a vacuum. That's why this Typophile forum is definately the best thing I've come across on the net...ever! Props to those concerned...I cling to your every word.   \n   \nOh, the \"FRESH\" font is basically 'Retoric', designed by Darren Scott and released by [[T.26]](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090817/http:/www.t26.com/changeyourface.htm), that i've just given a stencil effect to and tweaked around a bit.\n\n"
