I need this typeface for a new Pharmaceutical product, mostly used by women. Basicaly I am trying to give a fresh, organic and elegant look to the new product. Any suggestions?\n\n",

As he never intended it to be, Nick was quite surprised when I told him there was an uncanny similarity between his delicious brush script [Gizmo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311063639/http:/www.identifont.com/show?4Y0) and Korean cursive calligraphy. If you want to go Zen without being too obviously Asian, this is the way to go. ;^)\n\n"
