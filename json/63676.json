The size was Non Plus Ultra, which is roughly 2 or 3 points. And I got to hold the \"Evangile selon St. Matthieu\", a book the size of a matchbox, set with that very type. And you could actually read the text! And there is loads and loads more stuff there.\n\nWhen I went there, I found an e-mail of the curator and set the date and time. No photography allowed, since the printworks where the museum is in the basement of still prints money.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n"
