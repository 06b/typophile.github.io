But we’ve been busy starting our  \nown publishing company – Bruhn Förlag – so that we can be able to release  \nour own books and catalogues. Read more about it below.  \nSome of you may have seen these new typefaces pre-released through  \nVeer, but now’s finally the time to release them on our own site. With this  \nrelease we also give a warm welcome two new designers - Thomas Crolla  \nand Ricardo Santos.\n\nScrixel 8 & 16 - a script pixel family in two different sizes. Besides  \na set of alternates and bolds it also features a massive collection of  \ndecorative elements and arrows. More than you need for your  \nwebdesigning jobs. Optimized for use in Macromedia Flash. Designed by Thomas  \nCrolla.\n\n[http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/scrixel.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20070804104445/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/scrixel.asp \"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/scrixel.asp\")\n\nLisboa - a typeface tribute to the Portuguese capitol . Lisboa is a  \nhuge family (63 weights). It features a large complement of ligatures,  \nlining and old-style figures, expert characters, arrows, brackets, and  \nsymbols.This modern humanist sans serif contains a lot of warmth.  \nDesigned by Ricardo Santos.\n\n[http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/lisboa.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20070804104445/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/lisboa.asp \"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/lisboa.asp\")\n\nGretel - inspired by old antique cross-stitch patterns.
