Thats interesting that someone in New Zealand is using it.\n\nI guess the reason it doesn’t appeal to me is the spurs of the lowercase ’m’ and ’n’, and tail’s of the ’a’ and ’d’.\n\nThats just a personal thing – I don’t really like Enigma either. I go for more... hmmm classic faces with not so much flare to them (Arnhem, Meta Serif) real work-horses. But of course most of the time it depends on the typographer rather than whether or not the type is good or bad.\n\nThanks though! :)\n\nDuncan\n\n"

      "content": "Duncan,\n\nThanks for your reply. Delicato is somehow a bit of an experiment. I wanted to see how personal I could make a typeface intended for body copy in books etc and still keep it “classic”. It works in smaller sizes of course. I’ve done some other more “traditional” text faces like Tarocco and Anziano which might look more attractive for your taste?\n\nBtw did you see Delicato used in a local magazine or what. I would be happy to know the name of the magazine in order to be able to check out the result.\n\nCheers\n\n"
