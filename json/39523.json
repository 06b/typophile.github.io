Putting that into the terms of use of a Web site would be tricky - so I’m guessing this is another case of “turn a blind eye from the font guy”.\n\nNote that some sites (or foundries on distributors sites) use watermarks, stripes of give their previews a background color in order to prevent misuse.\n\n"

Now I am wondering if something similar could be done using Flash to sell outlines of a few characters to people who just only want to use a font once and can’t justify buying said font.
