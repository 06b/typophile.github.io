A set of posters imitating displays of cash dispenser machines prompted the viewer with a set of statements and questions about his/her lifestyle. The font was initially designed to imitate an existing LCD display and has now been redesigned and extended by Stephan Müller.\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Screen Matrix at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018075527/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=screen%20matrix)\n\n",
