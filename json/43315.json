AWARENESS. i think fonts are traded so easily among friends partly because they remain, in many people's minds, fairly anonymous. this may be hard for some of you to believe, but it's true. you are unsung heroes.\n\nthis is an open call to typophile for suggestions on how we can raise awareness in the public, among small and amateur designers, crafters, magazine readers, etc. as to the real work and time that the font designer spends at their craft.\n\ni really appreciate the bio's and histories of designers on myfonts.com.\n\nthe FDRC could promote a public campaign along the lines of :  \n\"it took me two years to design this font. it took you two seconds to download it\".\n\nmaybe i'm naive but, despite my call for EULA reform, i'm on your side.\n\n",

I sure didn't until I started coming here. Just clicked \"agree\" and figured as long as I didn't share or resell the fonts I was in compliance. I was pretty shocked to learn that in sending a pdf to a client for approval I was violating the terms of some of them. Still think that's absurd BTW.\n\n"

I'm sure it would not be difficult to find examples of life-long works that are rubbish, or brilliant types that were executed very quickly.\n\nIf the message is \"don't download type because it's stealing from poor, meagre type designers who dedicate their lives to a thankless art\", it becomes pretty easy to come up with counter examples of people who have made millions from (comparatively) little effort, or corporations who are still selling the work of dead designers for more than the prospective \"pirate\" will likely ever make. (This reminds me of the MPAA ads that showed pathetic looking stage hands and their waifish children.)\n\nI think the better tack is to release new stuff frequently and provide a positive purchase experience that adds value at a reasonable price. People will buy fonts when they need them rather than nursing a decrepit old collection of thousands of gross fonts gained through perilous ventures into the underbelly of the internet, braving viruses, and gross pictures for fonts that don't work that well anyway. Adding value through new type technologies is a good tack as well. Who wants all the gross old fonts they collected in the 90's when you could buy shiny new \"Pro\" fonts.\n\nAnother viable business model for the digital age is custom or exclusive types. The cost of producing a typeface has fallen such that custom types are much more achievable for publications and corporations that previously couldn't afford them.\n\n"

I think the fundamental problem is that exactly. Maybe if font software was somehow managed like iTunes mp4 format, (no, not the 99 cents part) where you can't copy music (the iDump software notwithstanding), but you can only authorize it on the computers you use. I'm not an expert on font files, but i imagine it's a long time before this kind of security could be embedded. Any store without security will be stolen from, that's what makes digital files so dangerous.\n\nAs for monitoring rip-off fonts, that would be decidedly harder, until some optical-recognition program could create a master database of any little font that has ever appeared. You're always going to have people who forge art for their own gain, businessmen who steal their underling's work.

If those designers are frequenting the different font vendor sites, subscribing to various newsletters, reading certain blogs, then they learn about the typefaces available. Maybe we here are the few (although I doubt it), but the fonts on the various sites are getting licensed or why are all the foundries still in business?\n\nBundling might give some designers some nice basics to use. Yes, I use them when I need to. But the basics are just supplemental. I really depend upon a nice variety to get my work done. I think most of us do. Perhaps foundries need to run ads in business magazines, or blogs, or newsletters, to start getting their stuff seen more?\n\n\\*Aesthetic Apparatus, being one of a few who do not need a lot of variety, have done great work, IMO, with just one typeface family.\n\n"

Oatmeal makes a wonderful breakfast as well—probably my favorite, but it has a sort of, I dunno, utilitarian aspect. I would hope a font would be used because it was appropriate rather than because it was available.

We all have our preferences, and I know I have hesitated, partly because type designers have been so generous in lending sample copies of their fonts for comping. I guess that is where customization comes into play.\n\n"

I think nick makes a good point, and perhaps not only does it sort of contribute to ubiquity of some good typefaces (e.g. Times), but perhaps it sort of masks the creator behind it. On the other hand however, i fail to see how upstart firms or freelancers could possibly afford between $500-$1000 for individual fonts, let alone building a repertoire. The only solution that I could see is if somehow they were less expensive across the board. Maybe that would help alleviate piracy, and thus bring in more paying customers? Perhaps this is not my place to say, since I personally don't have any typefaces for sale, while many of you do. I'd prefer not suggest my own price tag on another person's work.\n\n"

There might be a lot of hacks out there using Rosewood, Papyrus, and Helvetica for every other job, but they probably wouldn’t buy good fonts even if they didn’t get the bundled stuff. Regarding your statement that fonts are undervalued, I agree, but I don’t think that it’s because of bundling. I blame that more on the esoteric nature of type design, something almost nobody knows anything about.\n\nLast Saturday I was at a dinner party and one of the hosts started talking about the Helvetica movie. He really got into it, and had no clue about type design before seeing it. Getting that kind of educational experience to more designers would do a lot for type appreciation.\n\nPersonally, I would have very few legit fonts if I hadn’t picked up an old copy of Corel Draw on eBay for $50. It’s going to be a while before I can scrounge up the cost of a big type library, so bundled fonts will be getting me by for a while.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick, I think your comments about bundled fonts show a very closed view of where type appreciation stems from. Your proposed drastic changes really only affect professional designers who can justify spending large amounts of money on typeface families. If we're looking for widespread type appreciation, then including only Helvetica and Times (or Gotham and Garamond, if you prefer) with every machine would kill off any and all type appreciation that exists in this world. Design would be an exclusive club of privileged elite who can afford to purchase more than two typefaces per year.\n\nDo you know what creates appreciation for good type more than anything else? Bad type. I started reading about type design because of the website bancomicsans.com. I knew practically nothing about type, but I knew that I hated Comic Sans. I would start to notice flyers around campus set in Comic Sans, then I would start to notice flyers set in Arial Black, then (god forbid) Curlz. I began to recognize certain typefaces that I liked, and I started reading typography blogs and books and such.\n\nMy point is, cutting bundling down to a serif, a sans, and a monospace would only serve to alienate people like me who are interested in typography as a hobby but can't afford to invest our lives and savings into it.\n\nThe real question is, how do we define an appreciation for type? I don't want to set up a straw man, but Nick, it sounds like you're implying that an appreciation for type involves people only using really, really quality typefaces because they don't have mediocre ones readily accessible. But only people who already have an appreciation for type would go to the extra effort and expenditures to carefully choose which faces are in their libraries.\n\nTo me, type appreciation is not about every professionally designed item being set in really quality typefaces. Type appreciation is about my being able to point out to my friends how ridiculous it is to set a flyer advertising a class on Gender and Islam in Cooper Black without getting a raised eyebrow, or to point out bad kerning without being ridiculed.\n\nArguments like yours, Nick, only serve to put off those of us who are mildly interested in type as a hobby because they create a sense of elitism. At the end of the day, font awareness is not about designers owning certain fonts that are considered good by a group of elites such as this one; it's about ordinary people recognizing good design.\n\n"
