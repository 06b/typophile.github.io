It gives the impression of exactly what it is, a rework. /m and /n look out of the scope now, still too close of Billabong's, /n and /s feel unbalanced together (don't like the way /s x-height has been reduced to be aligned with the rest), /g loop and following /r look weird creating a big gap probably because the designer wanted to keep the tracking (making /g leg longer and reworking loop).  \nThat said you may like to have a look to `[Bad link]` and `[Bad link]` fonts, 2 fresh and new foundries.\n\n"

Quite helpful.  \nRyuk, your critique is perceptive Gives me a better insight into the merits, or perhaps demerits, of the redesign. I agree a cursive style \\_s\\_ works better when it is allowed to punch above the X-height. The cursive letter \\_r\\_ is always a problem. Handling the \\_gr\\_ link is particularly difficult. Should the tail of \\_g\\_ snake up to follow the pattern of letters like \\_a\\_ and \\_e\\_, compare to Aaron Script by Seniors\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428171556im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AaronScriptAsInstagramSM_4703.jpg)\n or should it stay below the baseline and allow a break in the cursive structure. I wonder if that would have been a better version for \\_Instagram\\_? compare to Shintia Script by Seniors  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428171556im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ShintiaScriptAsInstagramSM_6139.jpg)\n  \nRiccardo, indeed Authentica is close to clonesville -- \"legitimacy\" in the font business is often an oxymoron that matches \"jumbo shrimp.\" :)  \nJust for ease of future reference:  \n [https://creativemarket.com/Seniors](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428171556/https:/creativemarket.com/Seniors \"https://creativemarket.com/Seniors\")  \n [https://creativemarket.com/artimasa](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428171556/https:/creativemarket.com/artimasa \"https://creativemarket.com/artimasa\")  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "About the Instagram reworking, I understand the need to smooth the logo down and to make it more a logo and less a word set in a nice font. But I think the result took away too much of the liveliness from the original. In this regard, for the g\\_r pair probably a more “twisted” curve would have helped (less tame loop for |g|, less wide counter for |r|, a bit like your Fertigo Script sample\\*).  \nAs for Authentica, it’s not the first time someone is called out for ripping off Wisdom Script (see [http://typophile.com/node/93171](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428171556/http:/typophile.com/node/93171 \"http://typophile.com/node/93171\")).  \nIf you need to “improve” upon an existing script, at least do it with something which allows it (example: [https://www.behance.net/gallery/Blenda-Script-Free-Font/13832171](http://web.archive.org/web/20150428171556/https:/www.behance.net/gallery/Blenda-Script-Free-Font/13832171 \"https://www.behance.net/gallery/Blenda-Script-Free-Font/13832171\")).\n\n\\* Although in Fertigo |g|’s loop could look a bit cramped, and the joining a bit thin.\n\n"

      "content": "Good point: liveliness vs. regularity in script font design. This seems to me to be perhaps the most difficult issue for a script font maker. The new \\_Instagram\\_ logo does indeed seem to emphasize regularity at the expense of liveliness.  \nBlenda Script as a remake of Lobster -- one of the most successful font designs of recent years -- is not close to \\_Instagram\\_ because it is too crisp and regular for a match. Is it an improvement? Perhaps. In any case, It looks like a good font for some uses.  \nThanks for the comment on the \\_gr\\_ pair issue.  \nDon\n\n"
