  "content": "[sigh]\n\nI need to come up with a name for a type blog to be hosted at work (Adobe). So it will be work-related. My idea is to post musings on the technical, business, historical and design aspects of type/fonts and type technologies, with particular attention to OpenType and a bit to SING as well. It won’t be 100% Adobe-centric - I will certainly call attention to cool things from other foundries and companies.\n\nBut what to call it?\n\nI have long thought that if I ever got a vanity license plate, it would read “FONT MAN” - but I’m not sure that’s a great name for the blog. Another option suggested by David Lemon (whose license plate reads “TYPE NRD” btw, if you didn’t know), was “Thomas on Type.”\n\nI am eager to hear any other suggestions. If I end up using your suggestion, I will buy you any one Adobe font family or application of your choice. (Note that delivery of the prize may be slow, as there is an internal ordering process I have to go through. But I’m good for it.)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n",
