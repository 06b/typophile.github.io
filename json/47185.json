  "content": "Hello, all. I posted this query in the wrong forum, and am reposting. I have a partial answer.\n\nmbcohen  \n8.Jul.2008 12.09am  \nCan anyone help me identify the slab-serif typeface used on so many Bantam paperbacks of the 70s? Always with outline and heavy shadow. It resembles a condensed bold Clarendon, but the R is distinctive.\n\nYou can kind of see it in a terrible image here, from the 1970 edition of Ross MacDonald’s THE GOODBYE LOOK: [http://www.yesterdaysmuse.com/shop\\_image/product/067351.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150314211627/http:/www.yesterdaysmuse.com/shop_image/product/067351.jpg \"http://www.yesterdaysmuse.com/shop\\_image/product/067351.jpg\")\n\nTo which SuperUltraFabulous very kindly replied:\n\nSuperUltraFabulous  \n8.Jul.2008 1.28am  \nHello there:\n\nJust so you know this topic should be posted in the Font ID forum not in the Design forum.\n\nNo problem tho, this is Profil (not a misspelling)\n\nGet the Bitstream version here:\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/decorated-035/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150314211627/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/decorated-035/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/decorated-035/\")\n\nEnjoy!\n\nMikey :-)\n\nHowever, while Profil/Decorated 035 is definitely a recognizable paperback titling font from the era, and I can definitely use it, it's not quite the one. It is too much of an oblique.\n\nI would appreciate any further assistance anybody might be able to give.\n\nMalachi\n\n",
