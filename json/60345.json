There was a typeface called Atlas which is somewhat similar, but other than Bifur (also known as Matra) and Sinaloa there wasn’t much else that was very similar. It’s possible that they used an original (custom) design for that titling. All the shading lines are straight lines, so it may have been fairly easy to create.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I am still leaning towards an original design, although I am sure my collection is not complete enough to be sure about that.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
