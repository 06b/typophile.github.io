I already have a bunch of older designs in the Bauhaus Guide (see several on [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142729/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1B.html)), and I could use those with samples of the newer fonts mentioned in your links. (Some of which are no longer working links, btw). I think multi-line and inline fonts could be included. I'll try to get something started this week, and we can use it as a reference for these types in the future.\n\n"

At this point it consists of 2 pages with about 30 fonts each. If I get other suggestions, or samples, I will keep expanding it. It's not linked into the rest of my site, but eventually it will have a place in the Site mape and links from other parts of my site.   \n   \nMy impulse has been scratched for the time being.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the input Stephen and the additions. I agree that mixing them slows the identification down a bit, so I think I will segregate them by types: Multilinear, and Inline. It's still pretty easy to do with only 2 pages.   \n   \nThe toughest part at this stage is just getting the images, especially if I don't have the fonts. I have to copy multi-part test drives, or appropriate site graphics. (This is a naked appeal to anyone with any multiline fonts, or inline fonts, to provide samples showing the complete character set and font name. Use either vertical style (250 pixel width) or horizontal layout (max 730 pixels wide), and e-mail the .gifs to me for inclusion. Image donors will be credited. Thanks.\n\n"

I also added all the ones that were mentioned (if the links were good, and not all of them were), except Surreal Post-Indian, from Type-o-Tones, because I couldn't find a decent way to produce a sample without owning the font.   \n   \nI am also trying to get a good sample of Damien Gautier's [\"LeChaufferie\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142729/http:/typotek.free.fr/caracteres/lechaufferie.html), if any one has the ability to make one.   \n   \nI also welcome any other suggestions for inclusion in the Guide.\n\n"
