Find one of these and the rest should be there as well.\n\n"

It's 'ad hoc' -- at the spur of the moment -- because the _proper_ way would have been placing them into the shared fonts folder. If Microsoft hadn't discontinued that option.\n\n\"Version Cue\" does nothing with fonts; it's just one of the programs in my Common folder.\n\nPersonally, I'm having high hopes for Win7. It can't be any worse. It just can't be.\n\n"
