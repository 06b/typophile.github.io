      "content": "You’ve done pretty well. Tough to space a clarendon in general!  \nHere are a few ideas:\n\n1. Use a real apostrophe (not the ’ )  \n2A. There are two ways of approaching this spacing, one is to make things as evenly tight as you can and not worry about stuctural space troubles (like the AR combo). This is pretty much what you’re doing now. One way you might help this is to modify the letterforms for better spacing. Reduce the serifs between the A and R. Or, eliminate the left R serif completely (might be too weird).\n\n2B. The other approach is to space everything based on your loosest pair (AR). Space ARD, figuring where the D should go. Then add the W and so on. The overall spacing will be looser. You may decide the logo looses impact with looser spacing. The only way to get more even spacing without modifying letters is to loosen.\n\nHope that helps.  \nRandy\n\n"

Begin by tightening every combination up so that it is tight but not touching.  \n2. Reduce the two serifs between the A and R. (then make tight but not touching)  \n3. Add a serif to the right side of the middle stem of the W (it is emphasizing the bad spacing on the WAR combo)  \n4. Add a little space between the W and A  \n5. Extend the serifs slightly on each D (but keep the tight but not touching). Add more to the ED, and only a very tiny bit to the RD. This will improve the spacing but keep the logo lockup nice and tight.  \n6. Narrow the point of the apostophe and wedge it down flush betweet the D and S, you may need to shave off the top.\n\nShould give you a nice tight lockup.\n\nR\n\n"

Even though it’s a logotype after all.\n\nThis is a real apostrophe. And I’ve checked all the signs included in the font. There is only such apostrophe.\n\nMeanwhile I’ve tried the 2B instructions.  \nIt works good with 3-4 letters. However putting near an additional ones cause an optical spaces disorder. So I have to work with all the letters together.\n\nAs it seems now on that file I’ve attached earlier - are there any small corrections to do before it’s done???\n\nThank you!\n\n"

I have already tried that. However, this logotype doesn’t have any symbol attached to. So its’ font and general shape must be recallable. and I think that apostrophe above the text helps the logotype be much recallable. It makes a kind of “jump” which is reminded first when I think ‘bout the logo. What do you think?\n\n"

Is there? If you do keep it I think the placement of the mark will signal the preceived expensiveness/class of the logo. Having it up there is jarring & looks like a cheaper/less classy mark. If this is a ’family restaunrant’ as they euphemistically call themselves ( or some other business trading in value over prestige) and cheapness is the point. Maybe keeping it there makes sense in that case. If on the other hand this is a logo for a business where presitge & class matter then I would move that puppy a little lower.\n\n"
