I think that's the one, a little out of my price range for now but i've gone with St Marie as a free alternative and will purchase this one once I have the budget as it's just the perfect balance of formal and elegant with a whimsical feel that I wanted... nowhere has a slab serif with the round ball S's that Arhcer has :( xx\n\n"
