Specifically, that it is meant to be read from left to right as a timeline. Or should I add some visual aids to help guiding the viewer through the flow?\n\n",

Even with the visual aids you propose the question would arise why the zigzag up and down, and it's a bit late here (around midnight) to try and think about a reason.\n\nAndreas\n\n"

It looks like I need to test this assumption on more people.\n\nThe reason for zigzaging is to allow for a larger font size without crowding things too much.\n\n"

It is really a smaller part of the process, and I am concerned that putting it front and forward may assign it too much importance, and that would rub people the wrong way.\n\nI do agree with you that having whole five items to read through might be a bit too much for an average Internet Speedy Gonzales. I was considering employing an animation to reduce the number of simultaneous on-screen items, but then the animations are harder to get right than a static banner.\n\n"

I had a version where there was a line waving up and down between the words, but it looked... erm... dorky... lol. Let me just put a simple straight line with five notches on it. It might just work.\n\nThe arrows too I tried, to me it looks unbalanced:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423134618im_/http:/typophile.com/files/banner-2_6549.png)\n\n"

I'd try to put it on one horizontal line, but there are many possibilities. For instance since you say it's a small step in the process, I'm thinking you might try making the type smaller, and the type for «conceive» very large, but use color/opacity and the background gradient magic you have to get the visual hierarchy right, and shift the visual focus onto the small step that your tool focuses on.\n\n"

I should've been more clear about that.\n\nHere is a version with a timeline. I think it is actually starting to get there. The background and gradients still need work, but my main concern if the implied left-to-right progression needs to be hinted in some way.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423134618im_/http:/typophile.com/files/line-r1_4986.png)\n\n.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423134618im_/http:/typophile.com/files/line-r2_6266.png)\n\n"

Some sort of directionality hint appears to be needed, few people I polled noted that the timeline reference is not obvious.\n\nA simple animation would work, i.e. slide in Conceive, Implement, Record, Release and Assert from right to left in that order and assume the user is paying attention.
