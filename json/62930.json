  "content": "I am currently in the market to purchase a new desktop scanner. Many of the reviews name the CanoScan and Epson. I am not going to be scanning any negatives, so that isn't a crucial factor in my final decision. I have used a CanoScan Lide 60 and an Agfa Snapscan 1212u. The CanoScan interface was clunky compared to the SnapScan. The SnapScan software gave you the ability to select several small areas individually on a page and scan them as opposed to scanning an entire page. I found that to be very helpful as I do a lot of thumbnail sketching. However, it was loud. Obnoxiously loud, to be more precise.\n\nDo any of you have any suggestions on a good scanner? I'm not all that technically advanced and was wondering what ever happened to scanning from within Photoshop. That was another thing I liked about the SnapScan. It can with a driver that allowed you to do so. As far as I know, the CanoScan does not allow to scan from Photoshop. Am I wrong?\n\nAnyway, thank you very much for your time and any assistance you may provide.\n\n",

The scan quality is great, it’s fast and quiet, and I think Epson makes some of the best scanner software around. Unless you’re scanning photographs for high-end book design you just don’t need to spend a lot on a scanner these days, it’s more important to just avoid really crappy brands (don’t buy HP!).\n\n"

Back in the day, File\\>Import\\>Twain and away you went. However, with the CanoScan Toolbox, I have to use its interface and it will automatically open the image in Photoshop. Is this what you were referring to?\n\n@James: I owned an Epson ink jet printer that I was really happy with until it finally stopped working. It served me very well and I have no complaints. I never really thought of them as being an option until you and mk2 suggested to look at them.\n\n"
