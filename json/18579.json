The brief is:  \n\"Communicate with an illustrator\".  \nWe need the best typographers in the  \nworld to design a brief for the best  \nillustrators in the world. Since the  \nbrief has to not only inform but also  \ninspire illustrators we will settle  \nfor nothing less than perfect typography.\n\nMore info about the project:  \n [www.thecaravanproject.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320002246/http:/www.thecaravanproject.com/)\n\n",

Pretending it's Evil and it should be verboten is a good tactic if you're an established professional in an affluent society who is mostly interested in making more money (by trying to discourage spec work on the part of others). To be fair though, some people discourage spec work because they -incorrectly- assume it's pure bad for everybody. Humans aren't so simple.\n\nhhp\n\n"

The people who organize their professions are volunteers whose bottom line would have been much better if they hadn't spent so much time volunteering. But they do it to raise the status of the profession in general, and part of that is increasing the value of that kind of work in the marketplace, for everyone who does it, not just the professional elite who made the grade and pay their dues. By having a code of ethics that prohibits members from doing spec work, professsional organizations may in fact hamper members from getting work that goes to those prepared to compete with spec.\n\nIf professions don't organize, they will be populated by contract workers without benefits -- Bush's \"entrepreneurs\" -- who will be exploited by a capitalist marketplace dominated by powerful corporations. Graphic design freelancers are such entrepreneurs.\n\nI'm surprised you would favour capitalism over the worker, Hrant.\n\n"

Betcha Big Oil ain't paying to tow the caravan from A to B. Also, I think copyright is a good way to protect intellectual property, so creatives don't end up working for nothing -- so I ain't got no kind words for the we-want-your-best-for-nothing \"no copyright\" crew.\n\nI don't enter competitions these days, because, especially in type design, it's a lot of work and expense preparing specimens, and those who organize the competitions (and print the literature and awards books) get paid for their work; the winners get publicity, funded by the losers.\n\n"

Your view of volunteerwork  \nis very dark and I think its sad since  \nprobably many designers agree with you  \nafter failed specworks and such.\n\nWho we are? We are three graphic designers  \nfrom Sweden. We are all freelancers. What more  \ninfo do you want about us? Do you want us to  \nput pictures of ourselfs on the page? Then we  \nwould def be accused of voyerism and we don't  \nwant that since we dont want individual attention.\n\nWe will not pay anyone for doing design  \nthat we view on our webpage or show at  \nan exhibition BUT we want TCP to be an  \nonline and rolling gallery that shows and  \nbring together all parts of the designculture.\n\nWe will not sell other peoples work and  \nwe will not take any profit from other  \npeoples work. We think galleries, be it  \nonline or rolling, should never charge  \ndesigners or people for using it.\n\nTCP might get attention due to other peoples  \nwork but isnt that a good thing? To get more  \npeople involved in ethical and moral issues  \nsurrounding our culture and design today.\n\nTCP is a rolling gallery free for anyone  \nto use or view. It is supposed to bring  \nart, design & culture together and back  \nto the people, not manipulate or fool  \ndesigners to do free work.\n\nWe can only be honest about this and it's  \nup to you to believe in our ideas or not.  \nWe just hope that if you dont want or dont  \nhave time to get involved just visit the  \nwebsite now and then to see how the project  \non bringing culture together is going and maybe  \nyou will see that it's for the good of the  \ndesigners and the people and not for commercial  \nmatters.\n\nNp-copyright logo was created since we think  \neverything in our culture today is appropriations  \nand interpretentions from other peoples work.  \nWe agree with your view that the copyright symbol  \nis good in its way of protecting creatives but we  \nalso think that those who only copy other peoples  \ndesign and call it theirs isnt real designers and  \nprobably won't gain from it in the end.\n\n"

Meanwhile, volunteers are used to do the grunt work. The worst-case scenario is when a non-profit activist group that's been around a while needs to fund a project, but can't pay themselves for the work, however, others may be hired to work on the project. And of course tradesmen, services and materials are also paid for.\n\n_Do you want us to put pictures of ourselfs on the page?_\n\nMaybe, but I think as designers you should be able to find some way to discreetly provide reassuring background information and context.\n\n_We can only be honest about this and it’s up to you to believe in our ideas or not._\n\nThat's naive. You really can't expect people to take anything on trust. How is a potential contributor to know whether you intend to publish a book reproducing the typographic briefs, or the illustrations? Good intentions are not enough, people's attitudes can change. What if one of your partners has a change of heart and decides to make some money off the TCP material?\n\n_the best typographers ... natural selection_\n\nHow can you mix elitism with \"art for all?\"\n\n"

Now I start to see  \nwhy people missunderstand our whole message.\n\n1. TCP is not a company or sponsored by a company.  \nThe Caravan Project is a rolling gallery that will  \ngive local artists and designers the chance to show their  \nwork without having to go through the posh and pretentious  \ngalleries.\n\n2. The whole idea with the brief was not to get alot of  \nspec work. We simply wanted others to be as passionate as  \nus about our project and instead of just showing our own  \nwork and copyright everything we did we wanted to show as  \nmany talented designers as possible and also try to make  \npeople think about copyright since it nowdays is missused  \nin many ways through interpretentions almost identical to  \nthe originals.\n\n3. We on TCP wanted to contribute to swedens most cultural  \nand alternative music festival. We didnt want anyone to  \nspecwork for us. We simply wanted as many motivated creatives  \nas possible to join in, be it illustrators, typographers, artists  \nor musicians, and in the end try to get the ones involved attention  \nthrough an exhibition in Swedens capital Stockholm.\n\n4. To answer both Nick and Chris about elitism and art for the people I would like to clarify the manifesto since it obviously is missunderstood as it is today.\n\n\"A gallery should never forbid an artist to show his/her work\"  \nNo discrimination shall be allowed be it racial, genderbased, ethical, class etc..\n\n\"Unfinished and weak concepts should not be exhibited\"  \nJust because it isnt pretentious and posh it doesnt have to be a unprofessional and less qualitybased gallery.\n\n\"Provoking art should never be disallowed as long as the artist can explain why he/she wants to create it\"  \nArt and design that are provoking should never be rejected just because it is provoking. The artist or designer must always have  \nthe freedom to provoke. But the artist/designer must have a meaning as for why he/she wants to create the provocation.\n\n\"There must always be a general interest in art and design. Today the public tend to avoid the galleries that from the beginning was made for them\"  \nWhat about it? Who can argue against that most galleries today have a strange athmosphere where people are not quite themselves and dont dare to ask or debate the works on the big white walls.\n\n"

The problems with conceptual art are that most visual artists are bears of very little brain, so their insights are worthless; that the people don't want to spend their weekends going to see the embodied big ideas of idiots; and that visual art, _contra_ every exhibition catalogue produced in the last forty years, cannot \"explore\" \"issues\" because it doesn't have the structured semantic opportunities that language has. If you want to end the low-grade elitism of galleries now, direct your bile at conceptual art. Race-gender-class prejudice is hardly a dominant force in the art-world, for God's sake! Attributing all ills to that kind of elitism seems a bit odd after the long purge of elitism has has created this sea of gurk, in which people as obviously incompetent as you expect to be taken seriously as theorists.\n\n"
