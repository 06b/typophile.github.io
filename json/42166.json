  "content": "I went to Strand Bookstore with some friends today. I looked around in the rare books section a little, then I went to the graphic design and typography sections. (They’re right next to each other.) It actually took me a while to find the typography section; it’s right where it says on the map, but it’s in shelves right underneath the table of comic books.\n\nSo I sat down on the floor right next to that shelf and looked at a bunch of books there. After having selected six books, I went downstairs to look at ergonomics textbooks.\n\nOn my way down, I met one of my friends. My friends had been looking for me for about half an hour. The friend whom I met had only just thought of looking for me in the typography section.\n\nI hadn’t brought my cell phone, so my friends had even had the store announce over the loudspeaker that they were looking for me, but I didn’t hear the announcement because I was so engrossed in the typography books.\n\nIt turned out that I had been in there for a couple hours. Unfortunately, everyone else was bored of shopping for books, so I didn’t get to check out the ergonomics textbooks.\n\n",

After a couple of such incidents my husband doesn’t join me in them anymore, especially if the design department is of any quality/size. Instead, we agree a meeting point in a few hours’ time and he can do as he pleases.\n\n"
