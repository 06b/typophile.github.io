  "content": "Hi folks!  \nI'm a 3rd year design student and my latest assignment is a font showcase that reflects an interesting background or story to a font. Everyone is doing the usual (johnston in the london trasport font...clearview for highway signs etc) but I wanted something different. Ive been trawling books and the net for days but with no luck. Anyone got anything interesting about a font that not many people know?\n\n",

It was an album by indy Australian band, The Fauves titled WHEN GOOD TIMES GO GOOD. Upon its sleeve face was a photograph of an old message board (like one from a 50th wedding anniversary or what have you). Whilst the digital rendering was spot on the designer made a fatal error of judgment. Mr Michael Ebbels - although your random kerning amused me, Din (designed in 1994) was not, has not been made into plastic pin on lettering for primitive message boards.\n\nDiscuss,\n\n"
