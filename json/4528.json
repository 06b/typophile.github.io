They've been in business since 1986. URL: [www.shaddy.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821131749/http:/www.shaddy.com/)  \n   \nThe toughest part was finding the right font for the word SIM. In these sketches, the word SIM uses Argus Extra Bold and for the tagline Eurostile or Helvetica Neue. I invite any suggestions and/or alternatives for font use, color scheme, and design.   \n   \nBest,   \nMJ\n\n",
