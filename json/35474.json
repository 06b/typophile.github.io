  "content": "Hey everybody!\n\nI’ve been struggling with my own corporate image recently. I feel as though I’ve HIT my logo which is in Helvetica, but can’t seem to find a typeface for the body text. Although it may seem weird to say, I’m not a fan of helvetica as a body text. Not because it doesn’t work, but I feel that I’ve seen it a trillion times used badly, and it seems just so standard.\n\nI’ve been using APEX Sans as my body text for my current image. I have to say, I really enjoy the way its working for me.\n\nIs there a way to marry Helvetica as my logo and Apex as my body text. They are very differant SANS, but I forget is Sans+Sans is a no-no & wanted to see what masters (you guys) say.\n\nAlso, feel free to comment on the card design.\n\nThanks a lot in advance for the much needed help! :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [CardSample1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/typophile.com/files/CardSample1.pdf) | 11.58 KB |\n| [CardSample2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/typophile.com/files/CardSample2.pdf) | 15.6 KB |\n| [font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/typophile.com/files/font_74.jpg) | 66.71 KB |\n| [Old.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/typophile.com/files/Old.jpg) | 58.71 KB |\n\n [‹ large font families?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17684 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [copyright ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35542 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Well I chose helvetica because I’m a one person & freelance designer, so I feel that keeping a simplistic logo might reflect that I am a smaller company. The opposite of a giant corporation. Maybe this direction isn’t as strong as it should be.\n\nWhat makes me unique as a designer is my italian heritage, which I try to market (there is an E at the end of my name.. Davide). Everyone always thinks thats very cool. At the same time, I don’t want to SCREAM that there is an e in my name by making it another color or something.\n\nThanks for the feedback so far! I really need to get this done SOON!\n\nI remember seeing Addison hall [http://addisonhalldesign.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080401010236/http:/addisonhalldesign.com/ \"http://addisonhalldesign.com/\") on typophile and I really like his work and Identity. I like the typeface he uses also is great. I like his simplistic approach as well. Website is great too! :)\n\n"

Regarding the Italian angle, why does that matter to your clients? Identity is about defining who you are, what you would like to convey about yourself, and then reflecting that visually. It is a design problem. How would you design an identity for a client?\n\nChrisL\n\n"
