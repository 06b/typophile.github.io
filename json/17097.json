I _will_ ask the designer of the typeface the proper permission to use them, don’tchaworry.\n\nTHX a bunch.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [HappyNewYear2006.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180821/http:/typophile.com/files/HappyNewYear2006.pdf) | 634.91 KB |\n\n [‹ Expedia swipes valuable luggage?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180821/http:/typophile.com/node/18031 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [I have a type tool question ??? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180821/http:/typophile.com/node/18007 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
