  "content": "Hi all,\n\nSometime in the last few years, at one of the main type sites, I recall seeing a face that I think was based on something from Germany in the 1920s or 30s. I’ve gone back and can’t find it anywhere, but I doubt it’s that tough to ID. Characteristics:\n\n— Heavy/Thick  \n— San-serif with (I think), very slightly rounded corners  \n— Used for signage (I think)  \n— Might only be title case\n\nThanks!  \nT.

      "content": "Hi there,\n\nOk, I don’t know if it exactly fits - it hasn’t exactly got rounded corners - but even if this is the wrong one, it’s a doozy, so I’ll post it anyway.\n\nThe [Deutsche Blockschrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025051542/http:/isarsteve.de/blog/index.php?/archives/2006/10.html) was not a font, but hand lettering used in the 1920’s and 1930’s. It’s used in a bunch of the central subway stations in Berlin, most notably in a few old platforms at Alexanderplatz.\n\nI’ve always thought it definitely must have influenced Arno Drescher’s [Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025051542/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/drescher-grotesk-bt/familytree.html), which was also designed in the 30’s. After WWII, the (only) East German type foundry [VEB Typoart](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025051542/http:/pingmag.jp/2007/10/05/veb-typoart-the-east-german-type-betriebsstatte/) continued producing Drescher Grotesk, also called Super Grotesk, and it became one of their bestsellers.\n\nAfter the Wall fell and VEB Typoart dissolved, Sven Smital from Berlin design collective eBoy (known for their elaborate pixel drawings) did a [Super Grotesk revival](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025051542/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_super_grotesk/) for FontFont.\n\nAlso interesting and German and partly from the 30’s are the [FF City Street Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025051542/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/FF%252BCity%252BStreet%252BType)s, although they’re probably not what you’re looking for. The East Berlin version has rounded corners, but it’s from the 50’s.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
