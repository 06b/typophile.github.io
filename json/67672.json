In French we have \"île\" and \"Thaïlande\" just off the top of my head. I wouldn't normally consider them problem pairs, though.\n\n"

      "content": "Jens, your observation is correct. Swedes generally don't use \"ae\" or \"oe\" when \"ä\" and \"ö\" are not available (\"Anja Pärson\" being known internationally as \"Anja Paerson\" is a noteable exception, although there the motivation may have been to avoid the spelling \"Parson\"). Neither do they use \"aa\" when \"å\" is not available, although I understand Danes might do so. Interestingly, Swedes may go pseudo-Norwegian and use \"e\" instead of \"ä\".\n\nMy interpretation is that the regular and systematic connection between \"a o u\" and \"ä ö ü\" is very alive in the minds of German speakers, so that given technical limitations, they find it imperative to at least fall back to indicating them as digraphs \"ae oe ue\", where the added \"e\" takes place of the umlaut diacritic. But this sort of connection doesn't exist for Swedish speakers, for whom \"å\", \"ä\" and \"ö\" are indivisible units. They will use a similar-looking or similar-sounding letter to replace each of these if necessary, but not a pair of letters as the Germans do.\n\nTechnical explanation about my assertion:\n\nUmlauting refers to a phenomenon affecting vowels in Germanic languages (including German, Swedish, and English) where vowels for certain forms are fronted. In English you have man/men, foot/feet, mouse/mice, etc. In German, the spelling uses the umlaut diacritic to make this linguistic phenomenon very visible. Hence you have Mann/Männer, Fuß/Füße, and Maus/Mäuse; i.e. you have a systematic correspondence between the original and the umlauted vowel in German spelling.\n\nSwedish borrowed \"ä\" and \"ö\" from German, I believe, and in some instances the umlauting correspondence holds, e.g. man/män, fot/fötter. But the Swedish variation of the linguistic phenomenon of umlauting being different from that of German, there are countless examples like mus/möss, lång/längre (long/longer), and falla/föll (fall/fell) to demonstrate that there is no systematic correspondence in Swedish spelling as in German. So whatever connection the umlauted vowels had with the original counterparts in German, from which these letters were originally borrowed, is completely lost in the minds of Swedish speakers.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>So whatever connection the umlauted vowels had with the original counterparts in German, from which these letters were originally borrowed, is completely lost in the minds of Swedish speakers.</cite>\n\nNot at all. The umlauted letters are very much pronounced like their German counterparts in Swedish.\n\nThe examples just show that the vowel sometimes changes in words when going from singular to plural. In Danish, some of the examples would be mand/mænd, fod/fødder, lang/længere and I could add barn/børn (child/children).\n\n"

      "content": "Elias, of course the pronunciations are similar because the letters were borrowed for their sounds. That's not what I am talking about. By \"whatever connection the umlauted vowels had with the original counterparts in German\" I mean the connection between \"a\" and \"ä\", \"o\" and \"ö\", and \"u\" and \"ü\" in the minds of German speakers.\n\nIn German, there is a systematic correspondence between these pairs. But this relationship is not well preserved in Swedish, whose own _omljud_ has developed rather differently. The past tense of \"falla\" is not \\*\"fäll\" but \"föll\". In fact, \"ö\" can alternate with not just \"o\" but \"a\" (falla/föll), \"u\" (ljuga/ljög), and \"y\" (bryta/bröt), so Swedes are not likely to pair \"o\" and \"ö\" in their minds like Germans do.\n\nFor Danish, shouldn't the plural of \"barn\" be \\*\"bærn\" according to the strict German-style a/æ, o/ø paradigm? Well, it isn't. This is my point: the linguistic phenomenon of Germanic umlauting and the orthographical representation of it using the umlaut diacritic matches up well only for German.\n\n"

The use of _aa_, _ae_, _oe_ instead of _å_, _ä_, _ö_ I think was more common back in the early days of computing and internet, when need sometimes arose to actually write rather long texts without the proper letters. In such cases I guess unambiguity takes precedence over aesthetics. Nowadays there is rarely any reed to resort to this except in shorter texts such as e-mail addresses. My Typophile user name is _Mans_, though I could probably just as well have used the correct _Måns_. :)\n\n"
