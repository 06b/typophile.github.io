  "content": "Hi all!  \nWhat would you suggest to replace Lobster on a blog? It is currently used for the site name and all headers and while I don't mind it for the site name, I think it is messy and difficult to read in the headings and sub-headings in the posts. The main text font is Helvetica Neue, sans-serif, and the sidebar headings are Montserrat sans-serif. I'm looking for something that's clean and modern without being too stern.\n\nThis is the site:  \n [http://andmykitchensink.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417153030/http:/andmykitchensink.com/)\n\nAny ideas are greatly appreciated!\n\n",

The wide sans you’re using in the little stuff (Montserrat) also made me think of FF Ernestine, maybe the light weight could look nice (disclaimer, it’s mine). It’s definitely not narrow though.
