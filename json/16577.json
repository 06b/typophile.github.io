I put a space in the code and move lines code up or down to indicate if I am done with them (depending on the direction I am moving throgh the list). Happily you can change code & recompile with the space there & it doesn’t break anything.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109095903im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/screen.jpg)\n\nI don’t have 5.0 yet so I can’t say if this will work in that version.\n\nAnybody else have practical/process tips to share?\n\nOr a somehow better ways of doing this?\n\n [‹ typeface testing](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109095903/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15453 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Pasting from illustartor to fontlab (beginner level..) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109095903/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16450 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It will work fine in 5.0 as well (the properties of whitespace in the feature code have to do with the Adobe-defined syntax for that code, picked up by Fontlab).\n\nI often put comments at the beginning of a feature to indicate exactly what I still need to do with it. Because I’m only doing about 10-15 hours a week on type design, it’s the only way I can keep track sometimes.\n\nT\n\n"

(If you don’t already have a folder named “Language Modules” in there, make one.)\n\nNow when you open a .fea file in BBEdit, you should see some basic syntax coloring. The colors will depend on your preference settings. Nothing fancy, and some character names (like zero) are also feature tags, so they will be highlighted. There is probably some way to fix this, but, as I say, this is a quick-and-dirty module. If anybody gets ambitious enough to improve it, be my guest. But let me know, too.\n\n"
