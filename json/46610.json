  "content": "hey can you give me some advice on a logo I’m working on please. The logo will be on a the label of a pre made gourmet sandwich. The sandwich brand uses hand made stone-oven baked bread is fully Irish owned and uses all Irish products. I started using the hills in the back to represent this and the wheat to represent the traditional method in which their bread is cooked (apparently this is unusual) I’m having trouble with the font and as being done on a low budget I need to use a free font. I just feel that its missing a traditional, quality for money, good food feel all suggestions welcome!!\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110837im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo_4959.jpg)\n\n [‹ LATTE 2 GO LOGO](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110837/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41417 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Wine label and type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110837/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46761 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I do like the colors but would try to make the hills part of the logo not a background.\n\nThe name seems a bit hokey to me too - especially for the market. Sounds a bit “AS SEEN ON T.V.”\n\nIs the name fixed or possibly changeable. Right now nothing in this logo (name or design) suggests Irish owned or ingredients. Do steer clear of cliched stereotypes and iconography though. I’m Irish BTW :)\n\nHave a look at some nice branding by [Pink Inc](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110837/http:/www.pinkincdesign.co.uk/portfolio_obriens.html) who do most of the [O’Briens Sandwich Bars](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013110837/http:/www.obriensonline.com/) work.\n\n"

Even your image of the wheat is a bit sterile-looking.\n\nSince you don’t have the budget for a font, why not hand-letter the logo?\n\n- Lex\n\n"

You get plenty of options and they do it for around $100-$200. I’ve seen some pretty good ones on there.\n\nBut...on another note, if you want to make it like a family business, I think hand lettering it might be a great idea! It gives it a home-y feeling, which can relate it to your Irish background and your family business. And who doesn’t love a home-made sandwich?!\n\nAs for the hills, might be a good idea to drop them in favor for the wheat. Unless you get hills looking like hills, they are probably going to look unprofessional. A great tip. “Keep it simple”. Good luck!\n\n"

Try rendering the sun in the same style as the hills. Even just a golden circle between the hills would read as a sun. Wavy lines would also work, and would help break up the sharp angles at the bottom of the mark.\n\n“SANDWICH!” in upper-case doesn’t work. It’s already got an exclamation point.\n\nI can’t see any rationale for the way the text is aligned in either of these logos. The text is too far away from the mark and seems like a separate element. Imagine that the mark is a letter, and use the same kerning or leading you would use otherwise.\n\nTry placing the text to the right of the mark instead of below it.\n\nYou should try a version with Fontin Semi, so the angles of the text align to the angles of the mark. I still would love to see a hand-lettered version if you think you’re up to the challenge :-)\n\n- Lex\n\n"
