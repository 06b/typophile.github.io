  "content": "Hello.\n\nI'm working on an identity project and am considering using Memphis as the main workhorse for bulk text, correspondence, etc. I don't own it and haven't really used it before, at least not in this context.\n\nCan anyone comment on how well the OpenType version performs in day-to-day layperson use? I mean, how is the default character spacing, general flow of the text, etc. Does it generally need a lot of tweaking or can I just let it go and get good results?\n\nThanks,  \nThreeDot\n\n",
