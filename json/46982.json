  "content": "I've been doing some research on design and typography in Germany, roughly from just before the turn of the century until 1945. There seems to be a wealth of information on this topic. I have especially been happy with the fairly recent research on blackletter, a form that seems near and dear to many typophiles.  \nI am wondering now about type and graphic design after the wall went up, in East Germany in particular. I know you are very knowledgeable on type history; please forgive my ignorance in regards to this period in history. I am seeking sources of information, or interesting asides, that may be hard for me to uncover at first. Just to get started...  \nI am particularly interested in how individual designers fared after the wall cut them off from the greater design community.\n\n",

Lange suffered from pangs of conscience: he didn’t want to be regarded as a plagiarist, of course.  \nHis hope was that his personal handwriting style would rub off on the design and make the letterforms look sufficiently unique. But he wasn’t really sure about that.\n\nOn the occasion of a family celebration, Lange got an exit permit to leave the GDR. He seized the opportunity and met with Zapf in Frankfurt/Main (West Germany), in order to show him his sketches for ‘ [Publica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420113437/http:/www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Publica)’. “After what felt like an eternity – it must have been 5 minutes”, Zapf gave his consent and shook hands with his East German colleague.\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/1477637812/in/set-72157602243856192/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420113437/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/1477637812/in/set-72157602243856192/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/1477637812/in/set-72157602243856192/\")\n\n"
