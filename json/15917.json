  "content": "Well, I guess I’m what you call a newbie to the forum. I was hoping for a critique of a new logo/name for our small business. We specialise in on and off-site PC sales, service, and repair.\n\nOur current name “Your PC Service Centre” was deemed by all and sundry to be too long for the corporate world (our original target market was the suburban residential area) so a change was deemed to be in order.\n\nI’m playing with Phoenix Technical Services as a name, and threw together some roughs of a logo/typeface and some print adverts to see what it looked like on “paper”\n\nAlso included is our current logo soon to be retired, it seems.\n\nIf you could pass on a few words about my line of thought it would be appreciated :)\n\nTarin\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [phoenix1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/typophile.com/files/phoenix1.jpg) | 11.1 KB |\n| [phoenix2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/typophile.com/files/phoenix2.jpg) | 14.38 KB |\n| [phoenix3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/typophile.com/files/phoenix3.jpg) | 14.47 KB |\n| [some-people.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/typophile.com/files/some-people.jpg) | 47.01 KB |\n| [some-people-2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/typophile.com/files/some-people-2.jpg) | 46.96 KB |\n| [some-people-3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/typophile.com/files/some-people-3.jpg) | 25.63 KB |\n\n",

The name was chosen because the main focus of the business at this time is the repair and rebuilding of PC’s, so the phoenix legend seems to fit :)\n\nThe font on the Phoenix logo is Avant Garde Ext Lit ITC\n\nEvilBunny\n\n"

Open up the leading from Phoenix and Technical Solutions. I like number one the best because you don’t over do the flame/tail of the Phoenix. I don’t know though why you need to make the e orange. I don’t think it helps the logo. One last thought, don’t loose your original name it could be useful as a tagline instead of Technical Solutions in certain contexts.\n\n"

The old name ‘Your PC Service Centre’ was targeted at being approachable & friendly not corporate. The face you have here seems maybe fashiony to me. Classy yes, but not techy or corporate. But I am assuming things about your intent. What is your intent?\n\n"

I am new to this area so any suggestions on font choice will be quickly followed up. We have some of the adobe FontFolio CD’s onhand so any suggestion should be available to us. The red ‘e’ was a visual tie-in with the color of the bird logo, but has been removed in the revised image. The “Technical Services” font has also been changed to Avant Garde Gothic to highlight the text with the smaller font size.\n\nThe idea was that a colour change in the typeface itself would help to “break up” the business name as well as provide a point of difference from our direct competitors (who use all black standard typefaces) and hopefully be remembered by our market audience eg. in correspondence the name itself could be used as a distinctive mark seperatly from the logo.\n\nOur intent is to promote ourselves in a no-nonsense manner with a distinctive logo, typeface, and advertising style. Our intended advertising target will be IT professionals, office or financial managers, small business owners, etc.\n\n[Revised Image](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/www.yourpcservicecentre.com/phoenix4.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "I think this solution can work. It is stronger now. I wonder about making the 2nd line of text fill out a bit more so that it is more even visually. The type you have chose is oddly both analystic & romantic at the same time. Analytic in the perfect roundness of it’s ‘o’ romantic ranther than pragmatic in it’s insistance on such a simplification.\n\nI will still suggest that you consider some type that has a feeling of reliability - especially since you are in a service business! If you sold soap, art or cut hair I would not be saying this.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/zwo  \nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/klavika/  \nand if you are keen on your old foms but want to make yourself distict nonetheless consider  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/bryant/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/bryant/)\n\nor\n\nIf it was me I might well choose this\n\n[http://www.ourtype.be/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200324/http:/www.ourtype.be/)\n\nLook at Fresco.

He is right of course that the logo won’t sell you per se - but it can grease the skids or fail to do that or worse still grit them up. So I think it is worth spending some time & consideration on. The category of business you are in takes less advantage of logos & identity than other business do. Soap & Cars rely on identity. It’s their life blood. This isn’t true for computer services services. However, memorability of the identity will help later when you get word of mouth going. And finally the minimum standards that business and the public have for identity are rising every year. It is worthwhile to get it right so you don’t need to address the issue again in the near future.\n\n"

I’m thinking about letterheads, business cards, promotional materials etc.\n\nIf you have the time, I would love to hear your opinions :)\n\nEvilBunny\n\n"

      "content": "It looks like there is an auful lot of space between the the n&s in ‘solutions’ I would suugest that you show us these designs in PDf format so we can see if it’s just a bad screen render or if your spacing is actually a problem. I do think that you might try making the flames smaller next to the text. Maybe not too. Have you done any business card mock ups? If you lay your logo out with 6 others making them take up about the same amount of space optically then you can start to see where your design may begins to break. That Newbase really is pretty poor. What do you mean by stylized? The best way to see if what you have is working in general is to try it out - for cards: make one & print it. Hold it in your hand. Your eyes will tell you alot when everything is to size & context. Sometimes there are surprises. Sometimes good. Sometime bad. But testing is your friend. Your ads are a great example.\n\n"

Ones that will not be gone tomorrow leaving them high and dry. The only way this can be conveyed is through a good name, a good image and service that goes beyond expectations every single time. I think the way you advertise it and market it will be the key player in a name such as UR. Then again, I did just throw it out there to generate thoughts though. It may not be the right answer, but definitely something to think about. You have to break the mold from the name to the service and everything in between.
