      "content": "I have been unable to find any italic face with this kind of ‘z’, which drives me to consider if the ‘z’ is transplanted from a script face. For example, the ‘z’ from Edwardian Script seems quite close.\n\nThen, I think, the quest is which italic matches the rest of these letters. One candidate I think might be [Caslon 540 italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20061202100154/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/caslon-no-540/). You would need to tweak the i and remove the b serif, and then I think it would be hard to distinguish from your sample.\n\nThis is admittedly a compromize approach, but it might meet your criteria “its got to be a match, or so close as to be almost indistinguishable from the original”. Side-by-side comparison is usually too strict a criteria, I think. Look at one and then the other, and see if you think the appearance _seems_ the same.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
