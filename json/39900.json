It seems like everything I come across with tabular figures, they are lining, and every old style figure is proportional, and I can't figure a way to easily search for this feature. Any suggestions?\n\nIf there are more examples than I'm aware of, the application is for a lengthy academic journal, so a serif (or perhaps, sans serif) suitable for use as lengthy body copy is a requirement.\n\n",
