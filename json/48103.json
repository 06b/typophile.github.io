It is imperfect, like a lot of lettering would have been.\n\nAs for the Dr. AC Daniels, I’d suggest [Ultramodern Classic SG](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122031943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/ultramodern-classic-sg/), [Durak](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122031943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/durak/) or [Riot Squad](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122031943/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/riot-squad-nf/). But that’s just me.\n\n"
