I’m not confident in the fonts flexibility and range although I’m still considering it at this point.\n\nI do like how Cubanica was used in GQ (THANK YOU MRSHWARTZ). I wanted to test it before deciding if it works for me, but I feel its closer to a classic gothic, but with unique features built to distinguish it. It also has a subltle retro feel.\n\nI plan to test a few san serifs in my evaluation. I’m testing Foundry Monoline and Titling Gothic FB in addition to Omnes and Cubanica.\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n"
