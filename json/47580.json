  "content": "hey  \nI’m looking for a suitable font for a 5 star hotel, the hotel design is Art Nouveau is style so something that is decretive but still has a stylish, sophisticated look and feel. All advice welcome or if anyone has seen something similar I’d love to have a look. Maybe a font designed in the 1920’s as thats when the hotel was built? Look forward to hearing!\n\nMany Thanks\n\n [‹ Shall we hyphenate?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829164524/http:/typophile.com/node/48109 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Greetings ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829164524/http:/typophile.com/node/48147 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The hotel its self is broken up into 3 sections so I looked at this for inspiration. Its also in Malta and only 3 of Malta’s Islands are inhabited by people (as far as I know) Anyway let me know what you think\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829164524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test_5776.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi There\n\nThe element (and color) you show has an upper class feel. It looks a bit like a crown, but I think it could be refined. Perhaps some shapes of the mentioned islands?\n\nBut there is no coherency between the ’crown’ and the fonts used. The ratio of the image and the type. See my image.\n\nEspecialy the upper version strikes me as a bit odd.\n\nThe lowest looks much better (much classier), but the typography used is somewhat common. Not always a bad thing, though.\n\nHave you looked at lowercase lettering?\n\nThe idea of three inhabited islands is a good find. But be 100% sure of that. It will be a selling point and you don’t want the customer to tell you otherwise.\n\nCould you explain the ’crown’? What does it represent?\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBest of luck.\n\nRaymond\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829164524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Naamloos-1_3554.jpg)\n\n"
