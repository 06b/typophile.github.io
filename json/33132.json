Then with your cursor at the place you want to put the footnote go to Format/Reference/Footnote and press enter.\n\nWord will then put a footnote number both in your text and at the bottom of whatever column the cursor was in. You can format the footnote further by highlighting the text of the footnote and going again to the 'format' menu.\n\nThis works in English, I don't know about Arabic.\n\n"

I assumed that the text was also in two columns--in which case my suggestion will work.\n\nThe layout you explain now is unusual, and I doubt that MS Word can handle it. Word is set up to do common tasks automatically, and if you want to do anything else it is prohibitively difficult, in my experience.\n\nSo the only way to go is probably just to do it in PageMaker. There you can do it with two linked text frames, but it won't be automatic.\n\nedit: I just checked and the new version of InDesign does automatic footnotes like Word. You can see it here:\n\n[http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/video\\_workshop/index.html?id=vid0218](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075522/http:/www.adobe.com/designcenter/video_workshop/index.html?id=vid0218 \"http://www.adobe.com/designcenter/video\\_workshop/index.html?id=vid0218\")\n\nI don't know if it will do what you want though--and I don't know when the ME version is coming out. I have the first version of InDesign ME and it doesn't do automatic foot notes.\n\nps. According to this:\n\n[http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/timeline.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075522/http:/www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/timeline.pdf \"http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/timeline.pdf\")\n\nAdobe acquired Aldus and put out PageMaker under their brand in 1994.\n\n"

Yes, it is possible to make footnotes in 2+columns with PageMaker manually. But not with 2 linked text frames. Here is how:\n\nAssuming page size = 1, Top = Bottom margin = Zero  \n1. Make 2 separate files: footnotes-Only (F.pm) + Body-Only (B.pm).  \n2. Typeset the 2 files in the appropriate styles using the same page setup,  \nin such away that if B.pm uses G-Q then F.pm must use R-Z styles.  \n3. Find the F/B = Number of pages in F.pm/Number of pages in B.pm.  \nThen:  \n4. Make New.pm with same page setup + all the styles used in the 2 files.  \n5. Resize the page so that Bottom margin = 1-F/B and copy/autoflow B.pm  \n6. Resize the page so that Top margin = F/B and copy/autoflow F.pm.  \n7. Resize the page to back to 1.  \n8. Go pagemaking.\n\nHave been doing it for the last 14 years with bulky books of lengthy footnotes.\n\n"

InDesign CS 2, which Mili says has automatic footnotes is available in ME version, and here in the US they offer a free upgrade to CS 3 when it comes out. I found the transition from PageMaker to InDesign CS easy. InDesign is a more powerful program, though more expensive as well.\n\nI think I understand your procedure for footnotes in PageMaker. But I don't see how you can get two columns without linked frames on each page in the footnote file you write about.\n\n"

      "content": "William, there are excellent reasons still to use PageMaker; for example, by default, it automatically tracks type according to point size, a useful trick neither Quark nor InDesign yet have -- inexplicably. I personally find it a much easier and more useful program to run. Whereas I would probably not set a book in it today, I would not dream of importing the workflows I already have in PageMaker to another program. Although it is tottering towards the grave, it still performs wonderfully well; in fact I gave it a special 'iWard' in MacDirectory last year. I know several designers who have every program there is, and no financial problems, who still use PageMaker for preference. It's a great program!\n\nInDesign's 'fine typography' features, such as hanging indents, paragraph composition, and 'optical kerning' are so badly implemented, still, after all these years, that they cannot, still, be recommended for fine typesetting. Even Ventura does hanging punctuation better.\n\nI had some hopes that CS3 would bring some substantial improvements in this regard but from what I hear so far, my hopes are to be dashed. It's really a pity that Adobe has not considered it worthwhile to improve these important features, but it is abundantly clear that nobody outside of the type design community is interested in them. That's just as well, since they don't work as they should.\n\n"
