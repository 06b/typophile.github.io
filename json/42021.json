  "content": "hi there  \nI'm currently working on a catalogue for a client of ours.  \nThe used font family is tobias frere-jones' gotham.  \nIt all works fine until i have to create tables with  \nnumbers. None of them seem to line up (as in full-stop  \nand the numbers). Is there a special version of gotham  \nto fix this problem, or does anyone know of a good  \nworkaround? Is it possible for me to change the spacing  \nin the font itself?\n\nThanks a lot  \nJörg\n\n",
