There is a comma and period in the tag line. Should the comma and period be kerned the same amount as the letters?\n\nHere is my an example of what I'm trying to explain.\n\nM A N A G E M E N T C O M P A N Y , I N C .\n\nor...\n\nM A N A G E M E N T C O M P A N Y, I N C.\n\nThanks.\n\n",

No where does it say you need to spell out the full legal name of a company in their mark.\n\nTake a look at Fortune 500 company logos and you never see them. Below are just a few.\n\nNike, Inc.  \nPepsiCo, Inc.  \nMcDonald's Corporation  \nAdobe Systems Incorporated  \nApple, Inc.  \nYahoo, Inc.  \nMicrosoft Corporation  \nIBM Corporation  \nHewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.\n\n"

I have no idea why it’s not displaying on the post.</cite>\n\nThe Smarty Pants routine on Typophile automatically closes up multiple spaces. If you want to indicate extra spaces you'll need to hard-code in a &nbsp; or two.\n\nDon't track the punctuation as fully as the rest of the caps. But don't have them fitted tight either. They shouldn't stand out on their own by having too much space; nor should they cause a darkened spot by being unnaturally close in.\n\n"
