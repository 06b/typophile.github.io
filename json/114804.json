I used to be involved with a gaming fan site (not Disney) and the game company had strict rules about what fans could legally post. Companies don't like to offend fans but they need to protect their assets.\n\nIt's possible that Disney has posted somewhere their rules regarding fan use of their images, copycat fonts, etc. Also some fan sites may have discussions of what Disney allows.\n\n"
