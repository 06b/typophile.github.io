Is it known?\n\n2) On what character is it based?\n\n3) Is it available in any form? (not that I want to have it)\n\nStefan  \nthanks\n\n",

I don't know whether the designer was ever identified -- presumably Chanel has an art department that could have done this many, many years ago (pre-digital era).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
