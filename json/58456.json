One is also free to disagree with Bringhurst; much depends upon the font and angle of the italic; while the effect can be pleasing with italics of 7°–9°, such as Novarese Italic, Perpetua Italic or Futura Oblique, it can also be horrifying at the pseudo-italic (shudder) standard of 12°.\n\n"

Craig's example looks pretty weird to me, and Bringhurst's argumentation à la \"makes little sense\" and \"generally to be preferred\" does not _really_ help to penetrate the issue.\n\nI mean I understand that he says they aren't letters and an italicized parenthesis per se is a strange thing to conceive of; but certainly _if I'm speaking like this and including a (little) parenthesis in the process_, I really don't see why I should break the flow of the current italicization. _What if an entire paragraph is italicized – I tend to think of it as throwing the \"filter\" of italicization (is that a word?) over the entire thing. No way for a parenthesis to escape, and no apparent reason for that either._  \nAnd I mean, that question mark up there, the italic one, in the italicized parentheses, isn't a \"letter\" either – should it be upright too?!\n\n"

      "content": "I have proposed the following OpenType Layout feature to be added into the OpenType specification. Of course, if it's accepted, it will take quite a few years until it's actually implemented in any major applications, if at all. Nonetheless, I'll let you know once (and if) it gets accepted.\n\nBest,  \nAdam\n\n==\n\nTag: 'uprf'\n\nFriendly name: Upright Forms\n\nRegistered by: Adam Twardoch\n\nFunction: Some italic fonts (such as ShinnType's Scotch Modern Italic or Peter Baker's Junicode Italic) will have both italic and upright forms of some characters in a single font: typically parentheses, other punctuation characters as well as other symbols such as mathematical characters or the © sign. This feature replaces the italic glyphs with the corresponding upright glyphs.\n\nExample: The user would apply this feature to replace ) with ). In some typesetting practice, when an italic phrase is enclosed in parentheses within text set in Roman type, the parentheses should remain upright rather than italic. When the user sets the parentheses using the Roman font, spacing problems may occur in pairs such as the italic \"f\" followed by the Roman \")\". By including the upright alternate glyphs for parentheses in the italic font, the type designer can control the spacing and kerning behavior in such pairs.\n\nRecommended implementation: The uprf table maps the italic forms in a font to the corresponding upright forms (GSUB lookup type 1).\n\nApplication interface: For GIDs found in the uprf coverage table, the application passes the GIDs to the table and gets back one new GID for each.\n\nUI suggestion: This feature should be off by default. Note that not all italic fonts have italic style-linking in the family, so this feature should be accessible for any font that includes it.\n\nScript/language sensitivity: Applies mostly to alphabets that have distinct upright and italic styles such as Latin, Cyrillic or Greek; note that many non-Latin fonts contain Latin as well.\n\nFeature interaction: This feature is mutually exclusive with 'ital', which should be turned off when it's applied. It may be used in combination with other substitution (GSUB) features, whose results it may override.\n\n== Revise feature description 'ital' ==\n\nIn the feature description for 'ital', in the \"Feature interaction\" section, add as a first sentence:\n\n\"This feature is mutually exclusive with 'uprf', which should be turned off when it's applied.\"\n\n"
