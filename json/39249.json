  "content": "Hi all\n\nWanted to gauge reactions to this work-in-progress, for a logo design for a surfing magazine.\n\nThe target demographic is 6-16 year olds, male and female, with a view to (strapline) promote grassroots surfing in Australia.\n\nIt’s a redrawn Riptcure font for the logo, and for all other type I’m using Gill Sans.\n\nToying with the idea of a serif to contrast against Gill - that’s also very contemporary - any thoughts?\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Surf Aus\\_logo2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209110701/http:/typophile.com/files/Surf%20Aus_logo2.jpg) | 592.08 KB |\n\n [‹ Realist sans with small caps?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209110701/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39318 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Vista Sans for text, Bliss Pro for headline/lead ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209110701/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39284 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "In its current state, I don’t think this is very successful. Chopping off the leg of the R and the bottom of the F to make room for “Australia” feels arbitrary, rather than clever. (Sorry, Kat, I don’t see a fin.) The area where the leg of the R leaves the bowl is too thick.\n\nThe curves of the S are lumpy, and don’t match the R and F very well. The U is too wide — its big, open shape dominates the logo.\n\nConsider slanting “Australia” (in a more contemporary face, as Vanina suggests) to match the angle of SURF. And you might add a bit more weight overall; the whole thing feels a little spindly.\n\n"

I would encourage you to look at some unique type for the sans as well instead of Gill.\n\n"

But I’m sure you could make them work.\n\nI really like that in the original masthead, SURF is slanted... It goes really well with the angle of a surfer’s body. DIN bold italic may be another good option.\n\n"
