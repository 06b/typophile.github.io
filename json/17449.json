  "content": "Hello everybody,\n\nFirst of all I would like to say that I love this site. I'm relatively new here, this is my second post, but checking Typophile several times a day is already a daily routine for me.\n\nI designed this logotype for a webhosting company called W3SERVE. The letters are designed by myself. I think they are appropriate for this type of company. They are robust, a thing you also want to expect from a server, and are easily associated with computers and the internet.\n\nThe client already saw the design and liked it, but maybe you have some critique and/or suggestions. Everything is welcome.\n\nDavid\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [W3SERVE.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020062409/http:/typophile.com/files/W3SERVE.jpg) | 32.91 KB |\n\n",

I might try to bring more diagonals in too, since the one in the V seems a little lonely.\n\nThat said I think what you've got already functions admirably, and if the client likes it that's a strong argument to leave everything the way it is!\n\n"
