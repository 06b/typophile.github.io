You could possibly try to make the \"s\" more like in it's original font. But anyway ... it looks good and it communicates \"architecture\".\n\n"

It doesn't seem to be built on a solid concept for the company, but rather a cool looking font. Don't get me wrong, it's not poorly done, I just think it won't have any staying power once this kind of typography goes out of style.\n\npenn\n\n"

All the other \"round\" letters have the shape of a perfect circle but the spine of your \"s\" is too short and so the letter feels out of place.

Then also check out the build forums to see some of the technical hurdles and challenges in creating fonts. And then, if you're still not turned off by the amount of work necessary to create a a \"good\" and usable font, start developing your own, either with pencil/pen and paper and then converting it in a font creation program or start by jumping right into a font-creating software like TypeCreator, Fontlab, DTL FontMaster or even FontForge and creating your font.\n\nIf you're more just interested in creating a one-off \"font\" you could just create your characters in your favorite vector artwork program and then manually set everything.\n\nI hope this helps answer your question. Good luck!\n\n"
