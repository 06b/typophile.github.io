(By the way Chaucer's translation of Boethius _De consolatione philosophiae,_ printed by Caxton in 1478, contained a lot of type 3.)   \n   \nThe typeface shown above was used for _Sarum Hours_ V and VI, one octavo and one quarto.   \n   \nSo, you have the typeface and 2 books to find.\n\n",

Type 5's lowercase does not match and Type 7 seems to have been little used for bookwork. Nor do its caps match.   \n   \nAt any rate, I only have reference to Type 8 being in Tretyse of Love and Ars Moriendi.\n\n"

I chose a sample without too many examples of uppercase letters, so maybe it was a little difficult. Well done, anyway.   \n   \nI don't have any refernce to _Tretyse of Love_ in my source (Nicholas Barker's 'Caxton's Typography' in the _Journal of the Printing Historical Society_ no. 11)   \n   \nOf the four books he says were printed using this typeface, only 2 survive :   \n_Ars moriendi_   \nand a reprint of Mirk's _Liber festivalis,_   \nboth partially set in type 8.   \n   \n_Sarum Hours_ V and VI, entirely set in type 8, have disappeared.   \n   \nBarker suggests four possible suppliers of type 8: Anthoine V\n\n"

He was part of the team for UCLA's The Aldine Press project and also helped us work out some uncertainties with our Gutenberg book, Black-letter. Amazing depth of knowledge.   \n   \nUpdike's tome has a showing of Type 8 intermingled with Type 6 in Tretyse of Love, 1493. Caxton was one funky typographer.   \n   \nI guess I'm up then.
