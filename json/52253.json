It's for personal freelance purposes, not for a business; I've done work from _entertainment design_ to _web_ to _print design_, so I don't really have a specialty.\n\nIf anyone can give me some guidance I would appreciate it.\n\n~ corey\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130628083759/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_39.jpg) | 42.11 KB |\n\n",

Others can spot all three letters, and some others can't spot anything.\n\nI suppose the convention of guessing what a logo is is sort of self-defeating, so I'm going back to the choppin' block.\n\n"
