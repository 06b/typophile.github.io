  "content": "Hello,\n\nI recently started working as a typesetter on study guides for insurance exams. I am working mostly with pre-set styles, but there is a lot of tweaking needed to make the formatting right.\n\nOne of the problems I am having is with bulleted lists. There is already a style set up for the right bulleted list.\n\nHowever, in these bulleted lists are also sub lists with en dashes. I cannot make the rest of the paragraph indent properly.\n\nexample:\n\no Item one  \no Item two  \n - for example the second line  \n does not line up with the 1st line indent.\n\no Item one  \n - Does anyone know how to make the  \n rest of the paragraph indent.\n\nAlso if there is a way to set a style for these en dash - sub-points please let me know.\n\nIf anyone knows any good resources especially to do with hanging indents, setting tabs, and lists in Indesign CS I would be grateful.\n\n",

Note: The subsequent lines must be part of the same paragraph, so if you force a line break, be sure it is a soft line break (shift-return).\n\nThe same thing works in Quark--Adobe copied it from them.\n\nThere is probably a way to make this part of a style sheet, but I'm not sure off the top of my head.\n\n"

You don't need to set tab positions in the styles.\n\nAFAIK this works in Quark, Indesign, Word\n\n"

      "content": "The main advantage of that way (over the \"Indent to Here\" method) is that it gives you better control over the space between the bullet and the text. It's smarter but takes a bit more work. I find I use the \"Indent to Here\" more frequently because it's so simple to do.\n\n(I just remembered that Quark was not the first to use this idea. A Compugraphic typesetting machine I worked with in the early eighties had a feature that functioned the same way. There was a special character code that could be inserted in a line. Subsequent lines would indent to that spot.)\n\n"

In the third paragraph, the bullet is separated from the following text by a wordspace.\n\nIn the first paragraph, the hanging indent is accomplished by a paragraph indent and a first-line outdent. In the second and third paragraphs, the hang is accomplished with an indent-to-here character before the first character of Text.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316060050im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3bulls1.gif)\n\nObviously, the tab gives you more control over the amount of space between bullet and text. And at this point, you've made the compositors' job very simple—all they have to do is put a tab between the bullet and the text, and they don't have to worry about any finnicky hidden characters. Unfortunately, look what happens when some nutcase gets ahold of it and starts using text wrapping:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316060050im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3bulls2.gif)\n\nYou'll notice the space+indent-to-here character combo maintains its formatting quite nicely, while the tabs and indents get demolished.\n\n"
