  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm making a logo for a rock band called Rock Fuel. It's not going as smoothly as I thought it would. It's actually pretty difficult.\n\nI've picked out three basic sketches from all my wierd attempts. I used Helvetica in number 2 and 3 just because I don't have to think about the type, just about how to edit it and possible symbols. Wilhelm Klingspor Gotish is the type that think fits best to the namne Rock Fuel at the moment.\n\n1  \nHere I first picked a type that I thought would be suitable and then tried some variations with and without symbols. This is the one that I feel most confident that could end up as a nice logo, or some version of it. I just haven't come that far with it yet.\n\n2  \nThis is just a test with an old gaspump and how it could fit together with a text.\n\n3 a and b  \nJust tried some variations of how I could have it just as text and no symbols. Used Helvetica again, it would ofcourse be some other type, I guess I pick Helvetica because it's comfortable to work with.\n\nAny and all feedback welcome, thanks.\n\nPeter\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ruckfuel\\_logo\\_skisser.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20101211004814/http:/typophile.com/files/ruckfuel_logo_skisser.jpg) | 143.39 KB |\n\n",

But I have something against those distressed things in general, hehe.  \nAnd you defenitely want to lose Helvetica. ;)\n\nYou could try to integrate that fuelpump into the shield of the blackletter logo, instead of the thing (what is it?) it has in it now, to let it contrast with the lettershapes.

They thought version three was too much punk so I'm scrapping that.\n\nYesterday I made a combination of version one and two. Inspired by the vintage gas cans. I put the gas pump inside the pick, I think I'll tweak that some more though. Gonna see if I can come up with something else as well. I like the black/red/yellow theme, maybe add some dirt and stuff.\n\nJust give me your two cents worth on the this version. In the bottom one I added a text that would be a album name.\n\nthanks  \npeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101211004814im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rockfuel_v3_small_3952.jpg)\n\n"

It says neither \"Rock\" nor \"Fuel\" to me. This would be a great opportunity to use an old-timey sign painter style script. Check out [House](http://web.archive.org/web/20101211004814/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=23) or [Letterhead](http://web.archive.org/web/20101211004814/http:/letterheadfonts.com/) for some options (watch out for Letterhead's DRM).
