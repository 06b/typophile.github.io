Was there a logic behind it? Was it just a convention?   \n   \nAm I just imagining things?\n\n",

Most titling was in sentence form. It may have taken a bit of a conceptual leap to have abondoned the convention.   \n   \nGerald\n\n"

A friend of mine worked for them for a few years and to this day has a mania for putting full stops all over the place in everything he writes.   \n   \nTheir online version doesn't reflect this, though:   \n   \n [http://www.newrydemocrat.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018212848/http:/www.newrydemocrat.com/)   \n   \nMatha\n\n"

      "content": "An aside, hopefully related enough:   \n   \nAdvertising copywriting and creative direction has been making use of the full stop fairly regularly since the late 1960s.   \n   \nProbably as an outgrowth of interest in the poster as advertising, in ten decades or so, preceeding.   \n   \nThe school of thought that supports it looks at a typical marketing environment (even a magazine ad) as a 'billboard', of sorts. Or, as a 'bumper sticker'.   \n   \nIn either case, it is incumbent on the writer + art director to communicate rapidly.   \n   \nSome look at the style as the most rapid form available. The period seems to some to add 'immediacy' or 'urgency' to the message.   \n   \nIt's quite easy to find oneself in a battle royal with a copywriter who despises periods at the end of incomplete sentences used as headlines or subheads.   \n   \nI actually have always favored the full stop approach, because it does add visual interest and immediacy, when handled properly.   \n   \nI, too, enjoy those very old grave markers. Quite a lot of the work both in the lettering and the surrounding stonework, is breathtaking.   \n   \nJoe\n\n"
