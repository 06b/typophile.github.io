I think the advice was to pay Mr [Jim Rimmer](http://web.archive.org/web/20101123093424/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jim%20Rimmer) to cut a set of punches for you. Seems a bit excessive when photopolymer plates can be used for letterpress q. inexpensively - maybe that's what your friend was thinking of?\n\n"

It's all a matter of priority. If a person is passionate about anything a higher price is not a hinderance.\n\nQuite honestly I have never been asked to design and/or cut a metal font, possibly because it's assumed that the price is outrageous. Most things I produce in the metal foundry bring me about five dollars an hour. That stinks even in Canada, but I do it becuse it feels good, and I've been barred from the saloon and the pool hall.\n\nJim\n\n"
