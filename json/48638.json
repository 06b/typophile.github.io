I have multiple copies of most of those 1990s issues as well as many of the issues from the 70s and 80s. They are packed away at the moment during our renovation, but once I unpack them I'd be happy to entertain offers to buy them. I'll put together a list of the issues I have and you can let me know if they are of interest.\n\nUnlike Kent I'm quite ready to part with them.\n\nJames\n\n"

Maybe it the lack of understanding as to the value of what is being offered, or perhaps it is an economic thing.\n\nI remember in San Francisco, Dave Farey found a beautiful copy of \"Big Red\" in one of the bookstores, and put it up for auction for what he paid for it, and it never even got an opening bid. I wound up paying him what he paid so he wouldn't have to lug it back home to the UK. Now I have two copies of \"Big Red\"!\n\nSo I guess the short answer to your suggestion would be, probably not.\n\n"
