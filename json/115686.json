If you have other letter samples it might help. The letter that was hardest to match was the R, but all the candidate fonts I found had the same basic, straight-leg style, just slightly different counter shapes.\n\nSome other close styles: Sentico Sans, Glober, Prelo, Metronic, Dobra, Vinkel and FF Plus Sans, all at MyFonts.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
