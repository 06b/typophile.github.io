The conference is diverse in content, eclectic in spirit, marginal in its sympathies yet international in appeal. Each year the event has attracted a wide range of speakers and exhibitors prepared to experiment and push the boundaries of typographic design. Around 200 international delegates attend the conference, including design practitioners, artists, publishers, and advertisers, teachers, researchers and historians and those just starting their careers. Applications to participate are now being sought from interested individuals, organisations, institutions and businesses from across the international design, print and creative communities. If you have a topic that fits the theme, and would like to talk or exhibit at the event, please send an outline proposal and brief biographical note in not more than 500 words to [info@typevents.com](mailto:info@typevents.com) by 1 March 2006.\n\n· · · · · · · · · · ·\n\n",
