I’m not sure if it’s the same as number 1:  \n [http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/4971/picture4lx9.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220142615/http:/img201.imageshack.us/img201/4971/picture4lx9.png \"http://img201.imageshack.us/img201/4971/picture4lx9.png\")\n\n4) The font used for people’s posts on this board. Is it Times new roman? It looks different to me - softer.\n\n5) The font used on the main-page of this website and I think is the same one used to tell name of thread above this post:  \n [http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/8216/picture5ie0.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220142615/http:/img180.imageshack.us/img180/8216/picture5ie0.png \"http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/8216/picture5ie0.png\")\n\nThank you so much in advance.\n\nAdam.\n\n [‹ Logo book - body font ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220142615/http:/typophile.com/node/42163 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Arnell Group wide sans caps ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220142615/http:/typophile.com/node/39612 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
