To get full MM support on those OSes, you have to install ATM. Unless you want to pay for ATM Deluxe, install ATM Light 4.1, and the patch to 4.1.2.   \n   \nAlternatively, if you don't want to access the MM instances in apps other than Adobe's InDesign/Illustrator/Photoshop, just remove the fonts from the system fonts folder. Then the ones in the private Adobe location will get used, and you don't need the system level support.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
