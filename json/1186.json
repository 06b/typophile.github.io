  "content": "Funny thing I just ran across, a logo I did a while back, admitting I didnt spend a whole of time with this, I still think the choice over mine was much more political than anything.   \n   \nSo the FMUGAZ (Flash & Multimedia Users Group of Arizona) is who this is for. The guy that runs it is a bit of a dink. Some dumb kid that wouldn't know if good design punched him in the face. Whats funny is this kid applied to work for my firm some time back, and after I turned down his application, he actually asked if he could intern for free. Even then I told him I didn't think it would be a great fit. So long story short, I make a presentation at this users group (which is not run by Macromedia for the record) The topic, Flash search engine optimization (for those in the know, we call this throwing darts in the dark ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043145im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)), durning such event I made reference to the fact that Macromedia was notorious for \"poor support\", more like \"non-existant  support\", but that aside the point. So this guy at some point before this presentation asked me to please help in designing a logo for the group, this is what I came up with [http://www.kylehildebrant.com/downloads/fmug\\_logo\\_comps.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043145/http:/www.kylehildebrant.com/downloads/fmug_logo_comps.pdf)   \nand here is what they chose (not long after my presentation) [http://www.azflash.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013043145/http:/www.azflash.org/)  \n   \nLater I was asked not to participate in the group, due to my \"Negative Talk\" twards Macromedia.   \n   \nHaha, it all cracks me up. I just have a hard time thinking that the chosen logo was bettern than mine (and yes this sounds egotistical, but ohhwell).   \n   \nhildebrant.   \n   \nPS. In 3/4 drunk, so I will probably regret this in the morning.\n\n",

It had nothing to do with diplomacy.   \n2) The \"dink\" Kyle refers to happens to be a respected Flash developer. Aside from running the user group, he wrote a book on Flash basics for O'Reilly (which will be on shelves soon), tech edited several others, writes articles on Flash for InformIT.com, and works at KnowledgeNet, a very reputable eLearning company.   \n3) The manager of the group never touched the graphics for the group's web site. Everything on the site was done by group members who volunteered their time and energy.   \n4) As I recall, Kyle's removal from the group was the result of several malicious posts that both insulted group members and had no purpose other than to slam Macromedia. The posts were neither constructive nor useful for anyone but Kyle. The group manager received several complaints about Kyle's posts from group members. The manager then replied to Kyle on the list with the utmost diplomacy. Kyle's attitude was childish at best. The group manager acted on behalf of the group, and we applaud his efforts.   \n   \nKyle, the group has done a lot of good for a lot of people. You got yourself kicked off the list. And that's no reason to publically insult anyone but yourself.\n\n"

I like the one they chose because it fits a 'user group' attitude, and the other looks like it's more for an event or award show. There's another factor I think is probably going on: these guys aren't designers, and they don't want to have a logo they can't use loosely. Do you really think these guys could follow through with your identity across an entire site? Its better to leave superior design for larger projects where you can manage more details across all the collateral. Have a look at their Web site.. their logo fits better with what they are comfortable, thus I think it's better. That's a hard lesson I think a lot of logo designers need to learn.\n\n"
