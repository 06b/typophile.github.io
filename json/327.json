Using a semi-colon to separate a URL and an e-mail address might, however briefly, make both bits of information less than perfectly clear. If you're looking for an e-mail address on a card, you are unlikely to look at the end of what seems to be something else. It would be better to separate out the two pieces of information with a healthy space between them, or by putting them on separate lines.\n\n"

      "content": "I would also try to stay away from using a semi-colon on a buisness card, using the space that is available on the card would mean you would not need to use any colons.   \nUsing slightly different type weights helps to make a clear seperation between two words or addresses such as email address and website address.\n\n"
