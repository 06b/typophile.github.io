      "content": "There is a Photo-Lettering type called Edridge Bookhand that looks a lot like this. It's in the 1960 Photo-Lettering Alphabet Thesaurus (Vol 1). The problem is that the sample is too brief to see many letters. It seems that the possibility of film type being used must be a possibility too.   \n   \nYou asked if anything we know is close to it, and I would say [Lydian/Lisbon](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124119/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/lydian/), but that has no serifs. I guess you could add some if the need was sufficient.\n\n"
