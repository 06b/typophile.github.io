  "content": "I've historically had problems with pixel font families offering regular, bold, and italics. Too often, they look like three separate faces to me. I have seen a few though, that in my opinion really succeed.   \n   \nSo I'm trying to play with a bold and regular version of a new face I'll call Raster for now. My question here is, how successfull ar the two as a family? For the most part, it works for me, but I'm not sure over all.   \n   \nThe regular version looks a little too wide--fat even, compared to the bold. In fact, the x-height looks higher in the regular version too.   \n   \nAny suggestions?   \n   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414064158im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35606.gif)\n\n",
