  "content": "Hi,  \nI am currently using Eras Bold ITC font for my company name within my logo (see [www.route22.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417160909/http:/www.route22.co.uk/ \"www.route22.co.uk\")). I am fairly happy with the general look of my website but I'm no typography professional and would very much appreciate suggestions from people with abetter appreciation of these things.  \nI'd like to stick with Eras for my logo but I wonder if things could be improved through the use of different heading and body fonts that better complement Eras Bold ITC. Also, I have read that generally sans-serif fonts are best for the web but serif are generally better for print. Is this true and, if so, what body font would you recommend to complement my logo on printed material?\n\nAny advice welcome\n\nPaul Hooper\n\n",
