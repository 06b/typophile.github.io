Also could the Y have a double line at the bottom? But I think this is really terrific and quite original. I can see this being a success with a bit of work!\n\n"

      "content": "This is interesting. It has potential for some cool alternate characters, not to mention the ligature possibilities. Also, a lower case 'w' has to have a center stroke that partially meets the x-height in order to look balanced, same goes for an uppercase 'W'. On some rare occasions this not true.\n\nI understand that this is a mock up, but with such a simple approach to a typeface, i.e. grid bound, you have to follow the rules of the grid and create characters with consistent themes and \"color\". Some of the most simple typefaces are the most meticulous. Look at Wim Crouwel's faces for example.\n\nLastly, I would try making the diagonal strokes on the 'k, v, w & x' meet flush with the x-height, that is have them be squared off on the ends.\n\nGreat Job, looks cool.\n\n"

      "content": "I like this - it's a good idea for an apartment development, it has an architectural quality that also puts me in mind of Piet Mondrian. I could envisage that on the side of a building in sheet steel of maybe 1 cm thick by 15 cm deep.\n\nWith a bit of refinement here and there it would look great. Make the n, u and y the same width as the b, d, g, o, p, and q. I'm sure you can sort the rest yourself.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>it has an architectural quality that also puts me in mind of Piet Mondrian</cite>\n\nWouldn't it be more of Theo van Doesburg since he's got diagonals?\n\nBack to the design, I could also see the r with a horizontal instead of vertical double. Or, I suppose, you could put in some alt characters, there are lots of options with what you've got. (and am I the only one with this odd desire for a complement font made of swirls based on the current one?)\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

But I would ad a knob to the arm of the r and instead make the crossbar of the t double.\n\nMany of the problems in your design won't emerge to you until you start setting things in it.\n\n"
