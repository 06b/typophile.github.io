I actually was curious and intended to ask what other matches there are out there that people can think of.\n\nAre you saying that this happens MORE OFTEN than we realize?\n\nObviously, designs from the same creator often match, such as Gill's work, or Frutiger's other designs, but how often does a type designer create something to match another typeface \\_without obviously stating that fact?\\_\n\n"

Brown Extra Bold is matched against Franklin Gothic Condensed in those respects.  \nI didn't copy any of its parameters per se, but tweaked Brown until it was a touch tighter and a touch darker. So if you were to superimpose the two faces, no doubt there would be a similar overlap to your example.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121241im_/http:/typophile.com/files/target_4999.jpg)\n\n"

So my intent was quite clear. Of course, I would have rather designed something more original (and I did get that opportunity later with the same client), but the challenge here was to do something close yet with a different personality, and without point piracy.\n\n"

He wanted to use only free or open source fonts, because he's a FOSS nut from Korea, so I insisted that we stick to at least the professionally designed typefaces. Thankfully, the body copy was easy, Bitstream Charter and Utopia are both available. Matching them with a non-crappy free sans became the priority, and that's when I realized that Univers matched perfectly. We would swap them for headlines, and it worked great.\n\n@paragraph  \nI don't have Fontlab at work, but I can show some outline examples tomorrow.

It doesn't do it terribly elegantly like Tim Ahrens' RMX tools, but unlike them it doesn't require an MM font. It works best for very small adjustments, but even these will usually need some manual clean-up if you are trying to produce nicely finished details. But I'm finding the brute force approach useful, even with the distortions to terminals and joins, for looking at what is revealed about the basic structures of letters if, for example, one starts with a high contrast design like Didot and reduce the contrast so that the stroke are more monolinear, or with a low contrast design like Helvetica and increases the contrast to that of a Romantic typeface.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121241im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GTtransformations_6481.gif)\n\n[More of this sort of thing will probably feature in my lecture at St Bride's next month.]\n\n"
