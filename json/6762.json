  "content": "Hi folks... greenhorn here with a question (yes, I already did many a search before posting):   \n   \nI work for a car dealership doing design- now, some manufacturers are more than willing to give me their typeface (BMW and MINI demand it)... but other companies, such as Toyota, do not provide any aid to me whatsoever. I was wondering if Toyota happened to be a pre-existing font, or if they created it themselves. I'll try to attach an image here of my best attempt to mimic it (ironically, what I found to work best in my library is MINI's corporate font shrunk to 90%)... to me the most glaring difference between Toyota's and any other font out there are the O's which are basically perfect circles- in fact it almost appears as if all of the Toyota characters are basically geometric symbols of any sans serif font. Ok so at any rate, does anyone know this font, or where I might get it? ![toyotamimic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516225117im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/49350.gif)\n\n",

I don't believe that these people are passing some vector image back and forth whenever they do Toyota design... there must be a set of characters somewhere.   \n   \nThanks for the font suggestions... those are both pretty damn close... I think i'd give the edge to Gotham Bold... now if I can just get the brass to order it for me...   \n   \n   \nThanks for the help folks\n\n"
