Typically works for me.\n\nHowever, you always need to judge visually, there is no way to pass that responsibility on to a mathematical rule.\n\nTo answer the initial question: normally two categories, but with exceptions (rather than a third one).\n\n"

I went by looks rather than a rule; I did compare a number of fonts I like, though.\n\n[Mark Jamra has a nice discussion](http://web.archive.org/web/20110809065431/http:/www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_6.pdf) of these issues.
