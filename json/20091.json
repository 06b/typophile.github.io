  "content": "I am currently working on a graphic design education project investigating educational and instructional materials, particularly those known as reusable learning objects, such as Flash movies, interactive or otherwise. I am seeking examples of animated typographic pieces, these could be interactive, artistic and/or educational. As an example of the type of items that I'm seeking, there are some basic interactive animations included under the 'anatomy' section of this site: [http://www.rsub.com/typographic/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403081347/http:/www.rsub.com/typographic/ \"http://www.rsub.com/typographic/\") and an artistic piece here: [http://www.arabictypography.com/flash.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403081347/http:/www.arabictypography.com/flash.html \"http://www.arabictypography.com/flash.html\") (to view click one of the lighter moving squares)\n\nIf anyone knows of other such sites and would like to share, I'd be grateful. Thanks.\n\n",

All the stuff is currently on an open and distance learning platform and is only avalaible for registered trainees (and everything is in french). But tell me if you are interested and I will send you a login and a password.\n\nYou can also have a look at two files posted on my own website. The [first one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403081347/http:/www.pixels-et-papier.be/pages/Mep.html) is an attempt to explain the basic principles of page layout to non-designers. It is based on the books of Robin Williams and made in Flash. It is also only in french.\n\nThe second one is [a small application](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403081347/http:/www.pixels-et-papier.be/pages/FontExpert.html) dedicated to fonts exploration. This one is in french and english. Comments and critics about the content (and about my mistakes in english) are welcome.\n\n"
