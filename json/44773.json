The characters are designed to emulate the look of bold, cut-out stencil letters. Use this typeface to command attention on signage, and for special effects. </cite>\n\n"

These things need to be addressed, but can you word it with a bit more compassion? I’d try something like this: “Hi Phil, welcome to typophile. If you could post a sample or two of the fonts you’re interested in that will help us solve the mystery. Also if you can refactor your thread title to make it more descriptive you’ll get more responses. Thanks!”\n\nSomething like that. How are things going anyway Eben?\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
