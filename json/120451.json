  "content": "Spotted this type on a package of gingerbread dough at the supoermarket today. May well be proprietary – it's meant to evoke the kind of folksy blackletter-esque lettering that's found in [traditional rural painting in Sweden](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317151053/http:/www.nordiskamuseet.se/sites/default/files/styles/adaptive/public/public/amnen/mobler-boende/dalmalning_0198927.jpg?itok=aNthJBGR) (almost rotunda-like, except on the other extreme of Europe) , and I'm not sure whether that's a commercially viable style.
