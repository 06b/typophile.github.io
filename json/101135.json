They're pretty old, the first image around the mid 30's, the black and gold one 1925 and probably earlier.  \nRyuk- as always many thanks- some good leads. You think they're both custom jobs then?

I've never learned type design and its history. My suggestions are mainly based on visual memory and online resources (digital).\n\n> The second image with the upward slanting serifs has totally stumped me.
