  "content": "Hello everybody.   \n   \nThis is Janaina, an attempt to design a text   \nfont for reading on screen and printed media.   \n   \nI'm designing it as my final project at college,   \nso any kind of comment will be very useful.   \n   \nI didn't work spacing and kerning yet, so I'm   \nsorry I couldn't provide consistent examples of   \nthe font in use.   \n   \nI've tried to keep the x-height as large as   \npossible and avoided much thin/thick contrast   \nto help with low-resolution appearance, but I'm   \nstill analyzing how those design decisions   \nwould affect the overall readability.   \n   \n'Q' is still very experimental, as well as font   \ndiacritics. I'll have to work hard on that too,   \nbecause the font is intended to be used in   \nPortuguese language.   \n   \nThanks in advance,   \nhugocristo\n\n<!--attachment: janainaroman-7202.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*7.4*Janaina+Roman*janainaroman%2eswf --><!--attachment: janainaroman-7202.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*7.4*Janaina+Roman*janainaroman%2eswf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417095336im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">Janaina Roman<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417095336/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/janainaroman-7202.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>janainaroman.swf</b></a> (7.4 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",

      "content": "Hugo, it seems that flash is wreaking havoc with your   \ncurves, some of them look as if they've been cut with   \nscissors - at my end at least. It gets difficult to judge   \nthe sort of abrupt, 'uncultivated' style of the characters,   \nthe sort of inconsistency in stress and thickness of the   \ncurves... Does it work? Does it look amateurish? Or is   \nit just a bug?   \n  \nI agree with Eduardo about the proportions and the squarish   \nB. Also, the \"midline\" of B,E,F,H,R seems a bit too high.   \nWell, there are other problems to sort out, as you know.   \nI dig the Jj. I once designed one similar to this.   \n  \nabra\n\n"

I'll try that and post some   \ntests here.   \n   \nEduardo:   \n'B' is one of my favorite problems ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417095336im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)... I'll   \ncheck 'S' and 'a' as well. Talking about reading   \nfor screen, I meant both hinting and fixed-size   \nbitmaped fonts. I'm taking this way because   \nI'm working with type1 so I won't get accurated   \nscreen hinting and I'll need that for web   \napplications (mostly shockwave, but I'm   \nconsidering MS WEFT too).   \n   \nIn fact I'm printing the font in large sizes   \non transparent paper and then 'squaring' each   \nglyph to fit my intended size grid (8 to 14pt).   \nDunno if that's the best way of doing it but   \nit's working for me.   \n   \nRodolfo:   \nI've attached a PDF example here. I hope it   \ndoesn't look amateurish anymore ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417095336im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nThe font is almost complete, so I think it's   \nto start refining each character. As soon as I   \nfinish the figures I'll try to post some   \nimprovements here.   \n   \nThanks again   \nhugocristo\n\n<!--attachment: janaina_roman_typophile-7262.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*23.6*esp%e9cime+pdf*janaina+roman+typophile%2epdf --><!--attachment: janaina_roman_typophile-7262.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*23.6*esp%e9cime+pdf*janaina+roman+typophile%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417095336im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">esp</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n"
