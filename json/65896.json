  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm planning to move to Aachen, Germany this year from the Netherlands. I would like to find a nice agency to work there (as graphic designer). I'm willing to travel a bit as well, but I'm limited to public transport. I'm not very familiar with the design world in Aachen or its surrounding area, but I thought one or two of you might be. I hope you've got some tips for me, or perhaps some places to start looking. Thanks a lot!\n\nGreetings, Jeffrey\n\n",
