  "content": "Hello,  \nI'm quite happy with what I achieved today, so I take liberty to post a work-in-progress (hope this is the right place, and you won't mind).  \nI don't know, I'd call it an 'egyptian', maybe bold?  \nI like the shape of 'q b d', which reminds me of a 'serif din'; and 'a' is no bad either. I wonder if I could better match the 'e o c' with the general style. Maybe force the uprightness of the p on the 'e o c' letters?  \nOf course, no metrics or kerning whatsoever.  \nAny suggestion welcome.\n\nthank you very much  \nm.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font6.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204041343/http:/typophile.com/files/font6.png) | 16.33 KB |\n\n",
