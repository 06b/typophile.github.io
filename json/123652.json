You are right, this is probably an old font which is not included in the latest Sign DNA collection.  \nI can't find legitimate source for this font but you can always send a message and ask about it on the official Sign DNA site:  \n [http://signdna.com/shop/index.php?main\\_page=contact\\_us](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415181044/http:/signdna.com/shop/index.php?main_page=contact_us \"http://signdna.com/shop/index.php?main\\_page=contact\\_us\")\n\n"
