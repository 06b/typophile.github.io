  "content": "Hello,\n\nI need to design some bitmap fonts to be used in applications for mobile phones. These will be images, so they can utilize multiple colours, which will be useful for anti-aliasing or simulated anti-aliasing.\n\nDoes anyone have experience designing type for mobile phones, or any thoughts which I should consider for this project?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Optima with ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205033624/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12100 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Stock image sources ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205033624/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12508 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There are some interesting differences between designing hand-made grayscale versus hand-made 1-bit, as well as between hand-made grayscale versus outline fonts - differences that are not obvious, so they are best grasped when experienced.\n\nOne approach is to simply add some gray pixels to an existing 1-bit bitmapfont - but that’s cheap. Leveraging real Gray Power will put your results on a higher level, but it requires a delicate, even precarious balance between three things: letterform fidelity, crispness, and even color. It’s harder than it might first seem, especially when you factor in platform gamma differences (which luckly in your case doesn’t apply). I remember one Typophile member who started enthusiastically but later decided to give up... This almost happened to me too, but fortunately I had many years from when I started until the time it was actually possible to deliver such fonts for use by others.\n\nIf you want the experience, and aren’t worried about spending too much time on it, do give it a shot. But if you decide you need help, you can either commission somebody with experience to do it, or you could license an existing family (like Mana\\*) from Ultrafonts.com, the best source for grayscale pixelfonts. Good luck.\n\n\\* Which will have an 11-pixel size soon, and a 9 afterwards.\n\nBTW, I see you’re in Whittier - I’m in Glendale!\n\nhhp\n\n"
