The latter three constitute what I consider a sub-genre of humanist sans -- the Frutiger Line --, although Stone Sans also owes something to Meier's Syntax. It is a narrow sub-genre, clearly defined by Frutiger, but within it Myriad and Stone Sans manage to present novelty and originality: I don't consider Myriad a clone of Frutiger. Whatever the intent of the designer of Segoe, and whatever his design process/method, the simple fact is that there is neither novelty nor originality in the result: it just looks like Frutiger.   \n   \n_- Agfa/Monotype, Linotype and MS are in contact to try to resolve the issue._   \n   \nAnd I think we should let them get on with it.

Ross and I have done extensive work with ClearType, and there is no gain in trying to control x-direction stems or proportions: the ClearType resolution gain allows greater fidelity to the glyph form, so optimal screen readability can be addressed in the design process rather than in the hinting. Indeed, if a font does contain x-direction stem hints -- e.g. for the benefit of 300 dpi laser printers -- it is often beneficial to turn them off for the CT renderer, which produces better results without them.   \n   \nNote that these comments, while generally true of ClearType in its currently shipping incarnation, are even more pertinent to recent improvements that will ship with future MS software.\n\n"

Myriad is closer to Frutiger than Stone Sans, to be sure, but they do form a kind of sub-genre: there is a familial relationship. If Myriad is the direct descendant of Frutiger, Stone Sans is a kind of grandchild. In any case, my main point is that Myriad has both novelty and originality, whereas Segoe does not.\n\n"

It is now possible to achieve excellent, consistent, high contrast bitmaps with greater fidelity to the outline width and weight. Again, this means that screen readability can be optimised in glyph design.\n\n"

It obviously doesn't, or it shouldn't anyway. If that were the case then everyone would need to learn ClearTyping (which, frankly, I'm not prepared to do at this point); if you don't ClearType your face at the onset, \"someone\" else might do it in the future, which from what I can see in the comparison is what happened here.   \n   \nI agree that to make a more accurate judgement I'd have to see some higher resolution; regardless, at this point I can see only a few minor differences... and those appear to be the result of hinting variation. Doesn't make it a different face, though.\n\n"

But it can't totally get rid of the need (not at current screen resolutions - not everybody is using your settings :-). You say that ClearType ignores x-hints. Sure. But I can think of two reasons for that, both temporary: hinting at triple the resolution with the color filtering trickery thrown in is much harder, and they didn't want to hold up the other MS products waiting for a first iteration of CT; and they wanted to leave room for improvement\\*, and could afford to since even a \"low-tech\" incarnation of subpixel rendering is still a big improvement.   \n   \n\\* Leaving room for improvement has in fact become standard practice in the software industry, because you can charge for upgrades.   \n   \nBasically what I'm getting at is that even with triple the resolution and anti-aliasing, there's some room left for improvement, and that would come from superhinting.

      "content": "Well, Hrant, I can't argue with any of that, you're obviously right. Part of the difficulty in this discussion depends on which aspect (or, perhaps more accurately, which argument) we're going after. If we're talking about copyright protection then the points you brought up are major issues (not that they aren't otherwise). I would venture to say that type design is the most difficult copyright question to answer... it may be obvious to you and I, but it's clear that more than a few political types don't see it our way. Most of them can't see past the notion that we're not trying to claim the alphabet itself\\*, but our own interpretations of it; with that in mind, can you imagine the smoke that'd spout from their ears if they even heard the points we just discussed?   \n   \nOf course other factors play here, too. What amount of work has to be performed on a (pre)existing object before that work itself is protected as a new object? Perhaps a lessen can be taken from the field of translation: Translations are only granted a \"derivational copyright\" because they are considered derivative works, and the translator must still gain permission from the original copyright owner to do anything to it. (This is all keeping in mind that, oftentimes, the translator will put in almost three times as much work as the original author.)   \n   \nThis and other issues need to be resolved before most policy-makers are ever going to take the matter seriously.   \n   \n   \n\\*I read an article a few years ago about a visual poet (was it Richard Kostelanetz?) who had given the copyright office so much trouble that he was actually assigned a personal copyright caseworker. This poet's work consisted of a lot of typographical work (the one I remember was three sizes of the lowercase a arranged on various parts of the page). The caseworker argued that the copyright office wasn't going to offer protection to a pre-existing system, and that any modification of the forms involved was \"of a supernatural nature.\" Whatever that means.\n\n"
