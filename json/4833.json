I am thinking about converting most of them to type1 and manage them through ATM, But I don't know witch ones are system fonts, and have to be managed by windows.   \nPlease help.   \nThank you.\n\n",

      "content": "There are plenty of critical system fonts that are TrueType fonts (.ttf). I wouldn't touch Tahoma, for instance.   \n   \nAdditionally, I don't know anybody who thinks it is sensible to convert Windows system fonts to Type 1. Why on earth would one do such a thing? You'd break the extended language support and the TrueType hinting. In any case, it is not permitted under the Windows license.   \n   \nI can't find the list of Windows system fonts, although I know it's on the MS web site.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

      "content": "ATM Light doesn't really \"manage fonts\" in the sense of turning them on and off and handling sets. For that you need ATM Deluxe (or one of its competitors). ATM Light just provides rasterization services, and most of that is now build into the OS (except for multiple master support).   \n   \nChanging the format of the font won't help system performance. For that you need to deactivate some fonts, which you can do just as easily regardless of font format.   \n   \nThese days Windows can handle having hundreds or even thousands of active fonts. The main thing that gets slowed down is that certain applications enumerate all the fonts when the app is launched. Plus anything with a WYSIWYG font menu may have some extra work to do. But all this is pretty much linear; there's no magic number where things suddenly get much worse. 300 fonts isn't that much worse than 200.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

      "content": "If (cough, cough) there's any worth keeping, only install those. Then with ATM Deluxe or Suitcase you can turn them on and off individually.   \nWith dreamweaver, you won't be using fonts other than system fonts or default sans or serifs, unless there's something I don't know about. Nobody will be able to see anything else, unless they have the same font installed and active.   \nAtm deluxe can handle both ttf & ps. Also, if you need type reunion, it comes bundled with atm deluxe.   \nI'm not sure atm light handles ttf, and if it does, deluxe isn't so expensive anyways. And, like Thomas said, windows rasterizes most everything already.\n\n"
