We moved away from the logo with the 7 animation (no one got it anyway). Also gone is the newsprint inspired design. The white on black text reflects the default state of the screen, where black is white. As we look toward the future and see that print is going the way of the dodo, we have redesigned our identity to include the futuristic electron blazing around the word mark in all of its probabilistic glory.\n\nIf you see any bugs, or would like to see the text larger, or if you would like to express your opinion in any way, please post your comments to this thread.\n\n",
