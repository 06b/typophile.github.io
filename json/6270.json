That's why I think these postings are often tricky for a beginner. They may be confusing more than helping...\n\n"

I enjoy both versions of what has been shown as I can see a serif/semi-serf and a sans-serif version, as well as perhaps a wider version. Once set at a text size, it might work better a bit wider. (?) I can understand why some would consider this a display face, it goes against what has become expected and what we are used to using for text. It would be interesting to try this for text in small amounts for flavor. But I want you to convince us (me) that it can be used for longer texts. Perhaps once you are finished, or closer, you could set a page and create a pdf.\n\n"
