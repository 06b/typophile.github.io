      "content": "I would say that it was 'inspired' by a number of Blackletter alphabets that were then flamboyantly exaggerated to give it a more dramatic look. The letters are a mix of Fraktur and Old English features, but altered for stylistic purposes (and legibility). For example the 'a' is more like the English Blacketter styles, but the 'h' is more like many Fraktur styles, except for the spur on the left side of the stem, which I think is another stylistic choice not based on a typeface. The 'm' is made to mimic the 'h', but is not like an 'm' in either Blackletter form. The 'C' is more like an enlarged lower case letter than any Blackletter upper case C.   \n   \nI say it's a made-for-TV mutation, with little typographic basis.\n\n"
