That's the situation where you get the first word of a sentence, often \"A\" or \"The\" at the end of a line -- which is something that I manually fix in rag right text, and in Web text by using a \"nbsp\" after the article when it is followed by a capitalized name (if I remember).   \n   \nHowever, a better explanation is that the widths of the points in a monospaced font are hugely wider, relatively speaking, than in a proportional font. So that the character sequence \"comma-space-lowercase\" within a sentence really splits it, visually, and is much closer in status, as a visual marker, to the sequence \"period-space-capital\" that denotes a new sentence, than in a proportional font. A double space compensates and puts back the degree of distinction.\n\n"

I haven't been able to identify if it had a specific defined value in the context of Linotype typesetting.   \n   \nAlso, in Linotype setting (and also hand composition, for that matter) the spaceband is not part of a font of type. Lino spacebands go in a separate holding area of the machine and get inserted through a different mechanism than the characters of a font.   \n   \nThe Linotype spaceband is a long, tapered piece; this taper is what allows the line to be justified and all the word spaces adjusted evenly to fill out the line. The thin top end of the taper defines your minimum word space; the thickness at the bottom end defines the maximum. I believe you could order Linotype spacebands of different minimum widths (and possibly even different tapers).   \n   \nAdding a thin space (however defined) after an end-of-sentence spaceband would ensure that this word space was wider.

My ITU lesson books stated that it was a house style. In some shops it was prefereed in others it was not.   \n   \nAt one time I followed the notion that a thin space added was the thing to do, just becuase that was the style at JW Boyd & Sons. Now it jangles me to see an added space. To my eye, the white space above the period goves all the break needed. On the Monotype and in hand composition, I will drop even the word space if the next sentence starts with a cap T (on tight lines), and use only a thin space on more open spaced lines.   \n   \nMark: You could indeed damage things on the Linotype or the Intertype with tight lines. The damage was usually confined to bending the tails on the space bands when they were forced upwards to spread the line. The fewer spacebands there were in the line, the more likely the bands were to be bent. Another resultof tight lines was the mangling of the ears on the matrices, whose function was to assure alignment of the characters.   \n   \nVery loose lines caused the slow buildup of typemetal on the sides of the mats at he casting point. The result was that molten metal was allowed to flow between the loosely packed matrices and \"hairlines\" or fins developed between each letter. The longer these mats were kept in service the worse it got.   \n   \nTake a look at the columns of text in any old hotmetal-produced newspaper, and you will see the hairlines.   \n   \nThere was a hand tool available for Linotype machines which was used to drive out the side walls of the hairlined mats so that they would again cast cleanly without creating fins.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

If however the word space is 1/2 em, and the space of the period remains the same, then the increase of the end of sentence space is only 33% over a word space.

Did the Monotype technology generally result in tighter word spacing than the 'wedge' technology in Linotype?_   \n   \nThin space bands eventually cause metal fins. The same is true of wide settings on a Linotype. The extra space after a period however has nothing to do with that. Or, at least, was incidental to setting technology.   \n   \nJim and I have both indicated the extra space after a period is a matter of \"house style\". My words were, a \"bad fad\". And yes, certainly Monotype machines had some bad fad artists tapping keys.   \n   \nBut for sure, dreadful typography could be set by hand, set by Linotype or set by Monotype. Just the same as in digital typography. Machines do not set type, people do.   \n   \nVery tight spacing was possible with a Monotype, but not necessarily. Also it did not cause fins on a Monotype. Not the kind you see on the printed page.   \n   \nThe operator had exceptional control over setting text. Both variable and fixed spaces were available. Micro fine increments combined with the ability to unit add and unit subtract gave the operator the ability to do an exceptional setting.   \n   \nThe ability to unit subtract meant you could easily kern on a Monotype. Not so easily by hand setting. Hand setting was a matter of very fine hack saws, gravures, and files. Great care had to be made in that operation or characters could lean, or work upwards and become bolder. However good craftsmanship is a wonderful tool.   \n   \nThat particular difficulty was not a problem with Monotype kerning.   \n   \nBut all this depends on the knowledge and skills of the operator and the \"nature of the craftsman\".   \n   \nBut certainly, a slovenly mess can be made using any typesetting technology. And one way to be slovenly is to subscribe to adding an extra space after the period.   \n   \nThere is a good book called \"The Finer Points of Spacing\".\n\n"

Business correspondence is usually full of these things, and therefore scattered with full points that do not mark the end of sentences. Perhaps a little extra space was thought useful to prevent confusion where the full point was being used to do its real job?   \n   \nI don't think this can be the origin of the practice (because it is obviously present in 19th century books, where my explanation would hardly apply), but it might explain and even to some extent justify its use with monospaced typewritten business correspondence.   \n   \nA separate question: in earlier printing it was also customary to put a little extra space before colons and semicolons. Was this just a fad too? Is it ever justifiable? Because they rise above the baseline, I do sometimes feel that these marks are set a bit too close against their preceding text in some fonts at least at small sizes and affect legibility. I'm inclined to think it might sometimes be justifiable, since Finer Points (otherwise a great enemy of excessive space) reckons that a hair space might be justified in some such cases.

      "content": "William   \n   \nI think Gerald and Kent have probably answered most of your questions about spacing on the Linotype and Monotype.   \n   \nLet me add this:   \n   \nThere is not really a typical word space on the Monotype any more than there is on the computer in the setting of justified text matter (a book for example) since the word space spreads or pulls in at the command of the person on the keyboard. I suppose setting the H&J's on a Mac allows one to have very tight or very loose ranges of spacing.   \n   \nOn the Linotype, as has been mentioned, the spacebands (long, thin wedge devices) have a minimum width when they are not given the opportunity to be pushed upward by the spaceband bar to spread the line out to fill the measure. If an operator left a lot of space at the end of a line, and there were only five or six spacebands in the line, there would be a greater amount added to each word space than if there were ten spacebands and the same amount of space at the end of the line. Whatever is left over when the operator of the Lino sent the line in for casting, is spread out by the spacebands. The same sort of thing happens on the Monotype Keyboard when the operator decides that the line just keyed in is complete.   \n   \nAn operator wishing to set with tight word spacing on the Monotype would be conscientious in fitting the line as tightly as possible before punching in the justification codes on the tape. In either the case of the Mono or the Lino, the result is the same.   \n   \nRegarding the fixed spaces available on the Linotype: in addition to the regular spacebands, there are also available narrower spacebands that will give much tighter wordspacing. I am not aware if there are any other than the two widths. In the case of large type setting on the Linotype, say 18 point to 48 pt, the operator needed to add a correct amount of fixed thin spaces to each spaceband to avoid too skinny a word space. The linotype has fixed Mut, nut and thin spaces in the magazine, available at the stroke of a key. In addition there are brass and steel thin spaces which the operator places by hand throughout the line of matrices in that have been dropped into the assembler box of the machine by the operator's keystrokes. After the line is cast, these very thin spaces are retrieved again by hand by the operator before the line is sent off to be distributed into the magazine.   \n   \nThe Monotype (in addition to the flexible wordspace used in justified setting) has the following fixed spaces: Em(18 unit), 12 unit, 10 unit, nut (9 unit), 8 unit, 6 unit and five unit.   \nBy a magical manouevre by the operator it is possible to have access thinspacing as small as 2 units. This is a trick I have never been able to muster up the ambition to use. I did fall upon it accidentally once about 20 years ago, but have forgotten how it works. Too lazy to read the manual. I know Gerald Giampa is a whiz at the practice of thinspacing with the green justification key. This is a handy thing to have in the thinspacing of small cap lead-ins and in very tight lines where one needs less than a five unit space.   \n   \nSumming it up: the Linotype justifies by a strightforward mechanical process of wedging out the spaces between two pre-set steel jaws (the mold vise). The Monotype counts off every unit struck by the operator as each character or space is struck. When you are at what you feel is the end of a line, you are shown how many units are left in the line for the spaces to take up un a revolving mathematical drum. In that regard, the Monotype works in exactly the same way as the computer, in that what has been keyed is computed and resolved. Or more precisely, the computer works in the same way as the Monotype.   \n   \nIncidentally, there is a man in California by the name of Bruce Wasbish who has done marvelous bookwork using the Linotype. He once told me that it is possible to do fine books on the Linotype \"but it is excruciating\". (his words)   \n   \nSorry for this lonnnnnnnnng post.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

      "content": "Jim , great explanation of Mono and Lino justification above. I wonder, however, how much sense any written explanation can make in the absence of seeing a machine in operation, unfortunately. I don't know that I would have really followed the Mono explanation if you hadn't shown me last year.   \n   \nMaybe at TypeCon this summer, we can plan a field trip to Arion, or someplace like that, where interested folks can see machines in operation.   \n   \n_\\>Really? I'm all for letting users change the word spacing, but simply ignoring the \"default\" space that a type designer has (nominally) so carefully determined seems harmful._    \n   \nI think \"nominally\" is the key here. Hrant, you realize I'm talking about \\*me\\*, not the average user (remember, I'm an elitist ;-) And I'm talking strictly about justified settings.   \n   \nThe main reason for my comment is this: In justified setting, the default space built into the font is largely moot. It will almost never actually occur; the space is constantly variable. I think the spacing parameters are better driven by the type size and the line length and the leading.   \n   \nI prefer time-honored standards (at least as a starting point) and generally like to have optimum spacing of M/4 or M/5, minimum of M/5 or M/6, and maximum of M/3.   \n   \nHowever, these values cannot be entered directly. H&Js in Quark and InDesign are percentages of the font's space value. So I have to determine the value of the space in order to know how to set my H&Js. For instance with Stempel Garamond, whose space value is 250, I might use 80/100/133. But for Bembo, whose space is 278, I will need to use 72/90/120 to get the same spacing.   \n   \nVery inconvenient.   \n   \n_\\>Does the Quark default affect letter spacing as well? (I have InDesign)_   \n   \nQuark's defaults are 80/110/250 word spacing, 0/0/4 letter spacing. Notice the optimum word space is 110% of the font's space -- how idiotic. When the line cannot be acceptably hyphenated to run at optimum or tighter down to the minimum, then Quark runs out the line. After stretching the space to 250%, it will start letterspacing up to 4% wider -- even more egregious than excessive word-spacing!   \n   \n(I don't fully understand the intricacies of Quark's specific algorithm, so the above is a generalization regarding when it applies which decisions between hyphenation and justification. But the results can be atrocious, regardless.)   \n   \nI don't recall Indy's defaults off hand. But they are undoubtedly better. Plus, the multi-line composer can make better overall \"decisions\". But these are still not beyond contesting, in my limited experience with Indy.   \n   \n_\\>Kent, why do you oppose the bigger spaces? And if they are to be varied at the discression of the person setting the type, what considerations would lead to a bigger or smaller word space?_    \n   \nWilliam, the case for close fitting has been made by Dowding and Bringhurst. I won't repeat them here. I remember not accepting everything by either man at face value (it's been a while since I read either), but I largely agree on this general point.   \n   \nFor me the bottom line is cohesion of the line and minimizing vertical drift across lines. The closer word spacing comes to the interlinear spacing, the less cohesion the line has and the more easily drift occurs. Acceptable word spacing is closely related to leading, line length, and margins.   \n   \nThe minimum is a function of the openness and internal fitting of the font -- a wide, open design or a loosely fit font will not tolerate as tight a minimum.   \n   \nI won't go on about this. I have work to get back to. Meet me at TypeCon and ply me with sufficient food or drink and I will happily talk your ear off.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

And I've put it into some of my fonts also.)   \n   \nThis a default effect determined by the font designer, not an option by the typographer. Does InDesign's \"Optical Spacing\" do this also?   \n   \n2. Tolbert Lanston's original (1890s) justification system for the Monotype machine added incremental space between all characters, not just between words. He considered this a more sophisticated solution to the problem, however, the effect produced was not well received, so it was not put into production. Quark XPress had no qualms about making all-character justification the default setting, 90 years later.   \n   \n3. When a type designer is determining the appropriate width for a particular font, it's well to consider the amount of protrusion that horizontal strokes make in characters such as \"f\", \"r\", \"t\", \"v\", \"w\", and \"y\". Sequences such as \"r-space-w\" and the notorious \"f-space-T\" make the space less apparent (eg A Tale of Two Cities, set in Bembo: compare \"A-space-T\" with \"f-space-T\").\n\n"

Very few used it. It was always an option.   \n   \nThere were two ways to achieve incremental additions, or subtractions to the width of type. One had nothing intended to do with _word_ spacing.   \n   \nUsing a larger wedge for a more open fit, or a smaller wedge for just the opposite. Not too much smaller or mechanical problems would show. Bruce Rogers used this feature for special book projects.   \n   \nThen you had unit adding, or unit subtracting. Monotypes were incredibly flexible. That does not mean all features were recommended practice for every job. Many operators never knew of their existence. Many others just never bothered with them.   \n   \nThat said, I never remember too many operators habitually using unit adding or subtracting except on problematical settings.   \n   \nA good use for unit subtracting is kerning. A problem readily solved with a Monotype.   \n   \nUnit adding would be used in instances where the operator was stuck with a sequence of unfortunate word breaks. But still, the discriminating operator would first search for a judicious use of unit subtracting often improving the setting of a line.   \n   \nUnless an unfortunate line length was forced upon the operator unit adding would be a very rare thing, except when all of a sudden the author of the text decides to go on a name dropping spree. Maybe rewrite the text or cause the author to suddenly loose his friends. Don't look at me.   \n   \nThe wedge decision could have artistic merit, read Bruce Rogers' essay.   \n   \nTolbert Lanston was a brilliant inventor, combs, horseshoes, window sash, adding machines etc. He was not a typographer. Much to his surprise type design was a bigger issue then he realized. The same would be true of Apple computers the inventors of _desktop publishing._\n\n"

      "content": "\\> In justified setting . . . the spaces is constantly variable.   \n   \nThis is obviously true. In my experience with setting, the person setting the type must strive to come as close as possible to the most desireable space value. In good texwork this is generally thought to be a mid space (4 to the em space). The use of hyphenation makes this task easier to accomplish. Those persons who hate to see a hyphen in text must have a tough time. I would strive for even colour in spacing with the use of hyphenation, than resorting to some of the moves people use today. One that I really cannot abide is the practice of messing fit the overall fit of the type to cram a line in or to fatten one out. Now this is just a personal preference, but I would much more end up with a baggy line spacing-wise than to see some lines stand out as black bars, and others as lighter lines.   \n   \nI don't know how far one can go with the adding of space between letters in a line, but for me it would have to be very little.   \n   \nGoudy had a colourful comment regarding the practice of lowercase thin-spacing, but I am too much of a gent to repeat it accurately.   \n   \nThis thread is a good one, even if some of us have gotten a little off the rails about the space after a period.   \n   \nI think there is a lot of very fine work being done today with the current computer technology.

Not always a matter of quality, but a matter of production. If a letter gets damaged, which happens, it can be replaced with another from a sorts case, or galley.

But applications such as Adobe PageMaker, or InDesign are rather stubbornly wrong. Some of their customers are also. I remember this discussion in the typophile forum.   \n   \nStill I am not convinced that the Monotype Recorder has accurately stated this. Tolbert may have been describing a \"feature\" and not advocating a \"radical change\". Remember that proper nouns do cause a problem. For some reason unknown to me, proper nouns should not be broken. I say, \"go ahead, break them.\"   \n   \nAlthough, I don't.   \n   \nA tool frequently used by typographical experts, was the ampersand. The ampersand was one of the typesetters best friends. Unfortunately, today's typesetters do not treat their friends well these days. The ampersand has had its' feelings hurt and has gone away.   \n   \nWhen is the last time you attempted to use the ampersand in a text. I mean in a legitimate fashion? Try it, very disappointing. That's rubber for you.   \n   \nRubber type is not a \"feature\", it is a \"fault\". I am not saying it should never be used. I am saying it should not \"have to be used\". There should be choice. Those that choose bad typography should not dictate to those that do not.
