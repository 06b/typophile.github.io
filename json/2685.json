      "content": "You aren't the only one who's been looking for that 'font'. I saw numerous posts for it on alt.binaries.fonts, and someone else sent me a sample to ID a few days ago. Do you notice how the identical letters (like E and A) don't look the same each time they appear? That's the biggest clue that this is artwork. Another point is all the contour details on the letters themselves, with variable shading that you can't get from Photoshop or any other type-styling app I know. The last point is the completely outrageous 'baroque' swashes would be nearly impossible to make work in a digital font, although I know many fonts have swash character sets. These are beyond almost anything I can think of for complexity.\n\n"

Also Scriptorium's [John Speed](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142053/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/john-speed/) is beyond wild.\n\n"
