  "content": "Waaaaaaaaayyyyy back when (i.e. around six years ago) I had AOL and although I can't remember how I did it now, I subscribed to a newsletter that every so often (can you tell I really remember little about it other than that it made my life amazing?) sent out fonts to download. Although the fonts being free didn't phase me, well, that's a lie, I was a starving college student, it was really neat to find new fonts in my e-mail (it really doesn't sound as thrilling as it was) SO, my point is, does anyone know of anything like that that is around now? All input is appreciated :)\n\n--A\n\n",

Additionally some foundries and vendors also offer the occasional free font for download. You might also take a look through Typophile's [Typowiki Free Fonts FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109014444/http:/typophile.com/node/14652). Beyond that I know of no email newsletter that does this sort of thing.\n\n"
