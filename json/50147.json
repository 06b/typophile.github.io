  "content": "Welcome to our third newsletter! :)\n\nCheapProFonts is still growing. This quarter Derek Vogelpohl (of ShyFonts/Shyfoundry) joined the roster, as well - so now there will be some good text-fonts available in our usual large multilingual character set, too. We hope you will enjoy them!\n\nIn this news release I present 12 fonts:  \n- 4 from Derek Vogelpohl  \n- 2 from Ray Larabie  \n- 2 from Kevin King  \n- 2 from Brian Kent  \n- 1 from Nick Curtis  \n- 1 from myself - and it’s free! :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090814185734im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/CheapProFonts-NEWS-08-Q3.gif)\n\nI have also made a PDF Font Catalog available for download - here you can really zoom in on the details of all our fonts. I am rather proud of the (often) cleaned-up outlines, and the way I have designed and implemented some of the more demanding diacritics :)\n\nCheapProFonts is dedicated to supplying high-quality OpenType and TrueType fonts for setting “foreign” languages (languages requiring more than the basic A-Z characters) for professional Mac and Windows users.\n\nCheck our site for constant new releases, and see you in the next newsletter!\n\nRoger S.
