  "content": "Does anyone have a good visual reference that shows the terms used to describe font metrics. And by this I mean to ask for the typography terminology, not the computer terminology.\n\nSorry that I am struggling with this request. I want to find a way to describe the height associated with the small-caps portion of some text that I have set for a project. I made custom small caps by adjusting the font size and adding weight via stroke. The height is greater than the font’s small cap format and the font’s x-height, but smaller than true caps. Also,it’s not a common fraction as it is relative to the size of the artwork when produced to avoid problems with scaling.\n\nI think the term I need is x-height, but I would like to verify that by looking at a diagram of professional typography terms.Is there such a term as xcap-height?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI am a new member, but I have already learned so much from this site! Thanks.\n\nJase\n\n [‹ Where can one learn to become a professional type designer?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907044803/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40360 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Danno the Manno a Birthday Paisanno! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907044803/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39737 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
