More candidates for customization (mainly making /A top larger): [Alien Encounters](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064848/http:/www.dafont.com/alien-encounters.font) SF, [Elevon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064848/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/elevon) (good one simply closing /A counter)\n\n"
