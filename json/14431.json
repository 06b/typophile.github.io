I’d like to find a face that’s casual and has some attitude, a little graffiti vibe in the style of the Mossimo logo ( [www.mossimo.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090903141143/http:/www.mossimo.com/ \"www.mossimo.com\")), but not a bonafide graffiti face — I need pretty good readability.  \nThe closest thing I’ve found so far is Marydale [http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=3I00001201P2&start=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20090903141143/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=3I00001201P2&start=1 \"http://www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=3I00001201P2&start=1\")\n\nWhich is okay but not quite as stylish as I’m looking for.  \nIt seems all the handwriting or casual script fonts seem too Hallmark greeting card/Yuppie woman “pizzaz” / Kraft salad dressing label...\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nThanks\n\n",

The Plz Script is the closest thing I’ve seen to what I’m looking for, and it also looks cool with her (his?) “Architectural” font. The two could work well together for my project.\n\nChester, obviously research is an integral part of any successful design. However, my target audience/market is NOT graffiti artists or taggers. I’m looking for a face with an element of that kind of influence or flavor — but a “real” graffiti face would be all wrong for my purposes.\n\nFurthermore, you seem to be implying that we can’t design for a group outside our own, which would be creatively confining, to say the least. Does that mean only designers with law degrees can design identities for law firms? Only gourmet cooks can design cookbooks? If I use a face like Cezanne am I “talking down to” my audience because I’m not a 19th century French post-impresssionist painter (and neither are they)?\n\nAlso, you said that a typeface alone is not a design solution.

I embraced and enjoyed the life of a mountain biker, traded in my roadie attitude for a mountain biker attitude, hung out with fellow mountain bikers, and competed in races - which we preferred to call “timed rides”. I crashed, bled, and ate Clif Bars... I became a mountain biker. That was the only way that I could speak to my fellow mountain bikers through the work for the mountain bike company.\n\nDesign isn’t simply applying a “style” to provided content; it is understanding a set of needs and desires and finding the way to communicate those needs and desires. Modernism isn’t sans serif typefaces, it’s philosophy. David Carson is a design philosopher; thousands of designers have copped his “style” but they have no idea about the philosophy behind his work.\n\nTo speak to the “youth market segment” requires much more than an edgy typeface.\n\n"

This tenet is utter nonsense: it was waged to see which manner of slavery would prevail — chattel slavery or wage slavery. American industrial output exceeded its agricultural output for the first time in 1850, which is when the debate began showing up on the American political stage (the Missouri Compromise). The basic point of contention:\n\n- Factories required large labor pools from which to draw workers, and thus required large cities; and \n- Large cities were inimical to slavery, because they offered anonymous refuges for runaway slaves;\n\nBy this point in time, most European powers were no longer in the chattel slavery business, but wage slavery was a growing concern throughout the industrializing world. So, yes, Marx’s specific brand of communism was indeed inspired by capitalism: it’s just a shame that such a dysfunctional bunch of brigands as the Bolsheviks tried to pull it off...\n\n"
