  "content": "I work in journals production so get a lot of PDFs to check, of work done by our typesetting colleagues on another continent. Some of this was done in InDesign, and some in 3B2 (version 9). I often have trouble with them failing to set characters beyond the basic Latin alphabet (eg, accented characters such as Å, and even bog-standard non-alphanumerics such as the © symbol), and have queried this with them. For example, I've seen a regular A kerned onto a degree symbol (yes, not even a floating ring-diacritic, but a °), or a lowercase c kerned onto a circle taken out of some symbol font.\n\nThe response I have received is kinda hard to interpret, partly because it's techie but also because I suspect it's non-native-speaker English.\n\nSo if there's anyone on here who's _really_ conversant with 3B2, please let me know, and then I can show you more detail and see if you think their response is reasonable...\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n",

PostScript fonts had to go through a conversion phase into the proprietary format, before the program could use them.\n\nAs with TeX fonts, it's not unusual to see \"original\" solutions to accented characters, unhindered by any standard such as Unicode.\n\nBut,\n\n<cite>... typesetting colleagues on another continent ...</cite>\n\nhints to me those \"colleagues\" are unhindered by any typographical knowledge at all.

Some lines as well, although they appear on screen in black. And, come to think of it, all text is in RGB as well, leading to tons of warnings and absurd CMYK values. Ptoei!\n\nThe fonts have interesting names: AdvGreekM, AdvMT\\_SY, AdvPi1, etc., none of them has a recognizable regular font name. The plain text font, however, clearly is MS Trebuchet.\n\nI see a single '©', but copying yields an ampersand. So no Unicode, but it _is_ a real glyph, not a manually faked one. Copying an '=' gives a '¼'. A degree gives '8'. Well, perhaps those are symbol fonts.\n\nNo trademark sign--superscript 'TM' instead. No plusminus but underlined '+'.  \nBeta's have been slanted manually to fake italics, and they're not from Trebuchet.\n\nAll in all, yeah, some surprises. But at this level it's hard to differentiate between (possibly) program limitations and (probably) operator stoopidities.\n\n"

It's not very user friendly not being able to access all characters, somehow.\n\nI can't say anything on the Unicode version without any further knowledge on how 'a complete template change' works.\n\nYou might want to assure them it's unacceptable to _fake_ characters that _do_ exist in the fonts they use.

(If they're sticklers for their licence conditions they may be chary about doing this, but we'll see.) These fonts are bog-standard stuff like Times and Bembo and Stone.

They admit that _\"The switch of 3b2 version to Unicode would resolve this problem in totality. There would be addition work from our side, that would be to re-map all special characters and then validate the output. Apart from this there wouldn’t be any change.\"_\n\nSo my only confusion still lies in why the © would necessitate Unicode version in the first place; at a position well within standard encodings it's not like I'm asking them to set an interrobang or a rune or something...? And with Å, is the ring diacritic further outside the \"norm\" than the degree sign?

      "content": "Hi,\n\nyes your correct that originaly 3B2 used converted type 1 postscript fonts in its own fnt format to enable all it clever stuff with character setting. Version 8 brough truetype font support and 9+ added open type support.\n\nPre unicode the basic character set was 256 ISOLAT1 using the font table as set in the users own font. Unicode came in for version 7+ but the fear of change and lack of knowledge and availability of unicode fonts, and the fact it would change behaviours of kerning and ligatures (therefore line endings) made few typesetters want to change over existing templates. New templates however should have made this a breeze! :)\n\nAny further info i can help you with on 3B2 (now Arbortext advanced print publisher) please let me know.\n\ncheers\n\n[www.tformat.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20110526211122/http:/www.tformat.com/ \"www.tformat.com\")\n\n"
