  "content": "I scanned this image from the novel Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer and I'm pretty sure it's a font of some sort. I have successfully identified every other font used in all four books in The Twilight Saga (not just those that are common knowledge among fans, like Zephyr, Pablo, Carmilla, etc.), and I'm in the process of creating a website where I give the names of these fonts since there seems to be a great demand for this and for the fonts used the movies. Speaking of, I tend to have a good chuckle whenever I see somebody mistakenly identify the Twilight logo movie font as Zephyr or a modified version thereof. It is most definitely a modified version of another font, but it is NOT Zephyr. ANYWAYS, getting back to what this post is about; the picture I include here is of two ornaments. If by chance you are able to identify which font they belong to, PLEASE let me know.  \nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ornaments.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202045151/http:/typophile.com/files/Ornaments.jpg) | 6.6 KB |\n\n",

You see, since What the Font kept giving me disappointing results when I uploaded a fairly high resolution sample of the New Moon logo (only because HTF Requiem is so heavily modified in the Twilight logo), I scanned a font sample from the soundtrack to the Oliver Stone movie \"Alexander\" which I noticed used the very same font as in the Twilight and New Moon logos (I'm very sharp when it comes to fonts). It was identified for me by a kind soul on What the Font and I've known ever since. Clever, no? Lol.\n\nThanks to everyone else for identifying the font.\n\n"
