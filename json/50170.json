  "content": "Hello -\n\nI try to add some characters (with FontLab®) into an existing .TTF font (eg. \"çÇ\", …). In fact it's a font with many separated weight (each weight is a .TTF file)  \nWhen I export each file (after formated it as OTF table) everything goes well.  \nBut, when All the fonts are installed, well only see one of them into Adobe® Illustrator® font menu.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nNB. I checked all the fonts with FontDoctor®, and No font problems were diagnosed!  \nThank you, have a nice day…\n\n- Dimitri [http://www.thebend.be/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019131659/http:/www.thebend.be/ \"http://www.thebend.be/\")\n\n",
