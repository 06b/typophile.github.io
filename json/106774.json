The circle /o gives also more credit to the A-GG track. To me, that really looks like a custom job based on it. Actually, that'd even be quite easy: start with the Medium (or Bold) weight, remove /f crossbar left part and extend terminals, use a horizontally mirrored custom /f with a pulled upward crossbar for /t and recreate /p starting with /a adding a vertical stroke. Done :)\n\n"
