Companies like Adobe have European marketing and sales staff or associates, and they determine the price for the local market, based on their experience of what buyers in that market are able and willing to pay. Sure, not everyone in any market is able or willing to pay the asking price, but the pricing is based on maintaining some number of sales in given time period. If not enough sales are made, the price will go down, but as long as the product is selling at the current price that price will be maintained or may go up. It may seem unfair that people in North America pay less for a lot of things, but then it seems unfair to a lot of us that Europeans get such long holidays.\n\n"

The EULA explicitly states this as well - no transfer of licenses may occur to individuals or entities in Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea or Sudan.\n\n"
