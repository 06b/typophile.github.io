It also showed more words with the same treatment, which I did not get.  \nI would appreciated any pointers as to the font name.  \nI know it's not the one in a previous Demolition thread:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/84703](http://web.archive.org/web/20140405003056/http:/typophile.com/node/84703 \"http://typophile.com/node/84703\")  \nIt did not spot it in a Google image search for \"fonts demolition\" or at  \n [http://lava360.com/attractive-distorted-fonts-free-download/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140405003056/http:/lava360.com/attractive-distorted-fonts-free-download/ \"http://lava360.com/attractive-distorted-fonts-free-download/\")  \nDon \n",

As far as I can see Uptown is almost a match.  \nI also like Impacted and some of the effects in Mr. Black and Rust Bucket.  \nFollowed your link to DaFont's Destroy theme & during my journey through 56 pages of many ways and degrees of destruction I did find a font with some applicability to the shell hole concept in my other request: Malevolentz.  \nDon\n\n"
