In German, Helvetica (or any other typeface name) is often used in context, i.e., **die Helvetica Schrift** …\n\n2. Helvetica is derived from the Latin name of Switzerland, _Confederatio Helvetia_. In Latin, I think I can remember that Helvetia is a first declention noun, and therefore feminine. So Helvetica would be feminine because the Latin Helvetia is feminine.\n\n3. Switzerland in German is also feminine, **die Schweiz** , maybe because of the Latin root? Not all nation-names are feminine in German, though. Germany and France are both neutral ( **Deutschland** and **Frankreich** ) because their suffixes ( **Land** and **Reich** ) are also neutral nouns ( **das Land** and **das Reich** … country and empire, respectively).\n\nLastly, at Linotype (where German in spoken), all typeface names are feminine. This must be because of reason number 1, I guess.\n\nI do not know what the gender of Font is, however.\n\n"

So outside of academia, I often end up pronouncing non-English words ... \"incorrectly\". (Growing up in Chicago, I referred to a couple of streets named after two famous Europeans artists as Go-thie and Mo-zart, even though I knew how to pronounce their names.

I kind of doubt it.</cite>\n\nWe pronounce it like our “standard English” we have learned. So we don’t try to simulate how someone in Texas or Georgia or New York would say it, but we would say it in English of course. We will certainly NOT apply German pronunciation rules to English names. (As some of you do it the other way around.)\n\nI certainly agree that common usage also dictates the right usage and that can mean that proper names can take on slightly different pronunciation or for very common foreign words even completely new pronunciations. (The names of famous cities are a typical example of that.)  \nBut where does that “common usage” for font names come from? What if some say it this way and some say it another way? What is the right way then? What happens, when in each and every language the font name is pronounced as if it were a word of that local language? THIS would cause endless confusion when people from different countries talk to each other. The best common denominator is then to stick close to the original pronunciation. Neue Helvetica will then certainly still sound different when Matthew Carter, J.F. Porchez or Erik Spiekermann say it, but at least it will be more understandable then when every nation has “invented” a unique pronunciation.\n\nSo I see some benefit in trying to stick close to the original pronunciation. That collection of pronunciations in my blog is more about getting to know the original pronunciations. It’s up to you what you make of it.\n\n"
