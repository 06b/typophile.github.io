  "content": "**I got a postcard the other day from some friends who had been to Albania. They wondered if they could design the albanian ligatures for a typeface I've been working on, and if not, why. The answer is partly because it has already been launched and secondly I know nothing about these ligatures (or <cite><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131017085706/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_%28orthography%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">digraphs</a></cite>?). I looked them up on [Diacritics](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017085706/http:/diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=34) and [decodeunicode](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017085706/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/), and yes, there they were, but no indication they were to be designed specifically as an <cite>ﬁ</cite> or <cite>ﬂ</cite>. Have any of You seen more unique solutions to this? Would it be interesting to add special ligatures as alternatives, or is it simply not a good idea? Are there any Albanians on this board? <cite>Tungjatjeta?</cite>**\n\nƒ\n\n",
