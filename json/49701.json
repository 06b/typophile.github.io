  "content": "Hello everybody!\n\nI happened upon this old lead typeface recently (see attach). Its name is \"Industria\", and it was designed by Hermann Zehnpfundt for the Emil Gursch Foundry in Berlin in 1910/1913; Berthold later added a couple of weights in the 1920s. The most recent sample I have been able to find so far dates from 1933.\n\nSo far, not too much to ID, but: Has anybody seen this typeface digitised, or anything that looks more or less closely inspired by it? I already asked on the German [typoforum](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012060059/http:/www.typografie.info/typoforum/index.php), where nobody had seen it, but I figured if anyone knows at all, then probably here.\n\nI'm kind of hoping you'll say no, since I'm inclined at having a go myself. I really like this one. :)\n\nPlease let me know if you need / want more images. This is the base weight, I have also found specimens of the light, semibold, and bold weights.\n\nThanks for any pointers!  \nNina\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012060059im_/http:/typophile.com/files/industria_small_5469.gif)\n\n",

Indeed it is kind of reminiscent of the overall shapes; I think this one is special also with regard to what Erkki called the [\"special retro grotesk vibe\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012060059/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38174) :-), which especially shows itself in characteristic letters such as the a, g, and ß.\n\n"
