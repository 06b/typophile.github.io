      "content": "Agree with Bob that Pottery Barn is probably the closest you could get but I really doubt about it's legitimacy as it looks really too close to Imre Reiner's [Corvinus Skyline](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025739/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/corvinus). [Corvinus](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025739/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-corvinus) OL has the same bottom spurred /V but [Corvinus Skyline](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025739/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/corvinus-skyline) AP might be closer to your sample for the overall design. Another point for Corvinus Skyline is 'Pottery Barn' font has most probably been named after furniture company... Well... ' [Pottery Barn](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025739/http:/www.potterybarn.com/)' which [woodmark has been asked and identified](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025739/http:/typophile.com/node/12729) as... [Corvinus Skyline](http://web.archive.org/web/20141008025739/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/corvinus-skyline).\n\n"
