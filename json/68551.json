  "content": "Two more workshops are being offered at Cooper Union this spring in lettering: \"Organic Capitals\" April 17 & 18 and \"Compressed Styles (Black letter)\" May 1 & 2. To see complete workshop details [www.cooper.edu/ce](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012012207/http:/www.cooper.edu/ce \"www.cooper.edu/ce\")\n\nThese workshops are appropriate for people who have some background in lettering or calligraphy and are already  \ncomfortable using a broad edged pen. Absolute beginners will struggle but if you're up for the challenge Julian is an excellent teacher to begin with.\n\nJulian Waters is the son of calligrapher Sheila Waters and bookbinder/conservator Peter Waters. He also studied extensively with the legendary type designer Hermann Zapf, who later picked Julian as his successor to teach the summer master classes at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). Julian’s clients have included the U.S. Postal Service, National Geographic, and many agencies, institutions and companies. His typeface designs include Adobe Waters Titling Pro and a custom typeface family for the new Visitors Center at Jefferson’s Monticello where he was the typographic designer/advisor. He has received many awards from the Type Directors Club, Gra¬phis, Art Directors Club, Print, and Letter Arts Review, among others.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012012207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bismarck_4950.jpg)\n\n",
