It’s a very tasty 30 to 45 minute block of various indie tracks with very little jabber from the London-based host. He plays some obscure stuff (at least to my ears) - some Brit electronica, German electronic. Then he mixes in just enough recognizable stuff from Kasabian, Autolux, Aphex Twin and others to keep it at least a tad familiar. The unpretentious deejay doesn’t even mention his name.\n\nVery highly recommended!\n\nPS - make sure force yourself past the first 6 or 8 seconds of ironically dished 80s pop.\n\n",
