Does anyone know how to do this in Illustrator?\n\n[http://www.quentindelobel.com/files/gimgs/20\\_carto.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516002219/http:/www.quentindelobel.com/files/gimgs/20_carto.jpg \"http://www.quentindelobel.com/files/gimgs/20\\_carto.jpg\")\n\nThanks.\n\n",

Try linking only 5 to 7 lines, after that you link the blocs each other. If it really doesn't work, try making it one by one (I did it :-S).  \n5- You can now import your text.\n\nProblems:  \n- no hyphenate (hand made in my case),  \n- sometimes when you press \"enter\", the next line will jump 3 or 4 lines. To correct: double enter + apple (ctrl) Z\n\nI know it's quite complicated and not really quick. But I didn't find other way. So if you find something better?\n\nRegards,  \nQuentin  \n====================\n\nThanks a lot for your input.  \n®\n\n"
