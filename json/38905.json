  "content": "Back in the early 1990s I had a customer and I did just that for them. Created fonts out of their logos for them to use on their mechanicals.\n\nToday, I have been asked (after all these years of no communication) if I could do it again for them.\n\nMost of the logos are not a problem, very simple. However, one that was a killer then - is back with an additional S on the end of it. (They decided it should be a plural and opposed to the singular version.) That one had three layers, 4 key strokes for each layer, and then I was kind enough to put it all together for them so they could color each layer separately.\n\nI don't have the recall or strength to do it again - please contact me if you do, if you want to see it, and if you want to estimate what you'd like for doing it.\n\nWaiting to hear from you.\n\nJackie\n\n",

I'd like to pass your name on to the person who needs this project done.\n\nI just can't seem to make fonts anymore - I guess I don't like drawing upon bitmap images... been too long a time.\n\nThank you.\n\n"
