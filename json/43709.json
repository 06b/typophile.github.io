Find me a similar deal for Adobe and I'll change my allegiance.) Now, I'll be the first to admit I know nothing about PS fonts, but would it be worth my while to fiddle around with this?\n\n",

I'm not sure how it worked again, but you'd place a character on a page of certain size (which would work as sidebearings) and export/save it constantly to the same file untill the charmap was full.\n\n"
