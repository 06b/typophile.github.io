It is easier to view the fonts at that site.\n\nOne thing that I don't get with the expensive orange set is how are you supposed to know if that font will look good with the brand name you are creating? Without a letters-setter like most foundaries have, not only can I not see how the font will look with the company name, but how do i show it/ sell it to the client?\n\nI mean I could just tell them I found a font i want to use and that they have to pay for before seeing, but I wouldn't do that without me seeing it first either. Not to mention it would be a lot easier to sell them on buying an expensive font if I could actually show how it will look.\n\n"

Anything is possible though depending if you're willing to concider a custom version as a faster soloution for your magazine redesign?
