The designer of the logo probably used a variant of [Frankfurter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015043509/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frankfurter) and made a stencil version of the 6 characters he needed. KADA was drawn from scratch without further reference to [Frankfurter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015043509/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frankfurter) and the result now serves well as a very bold and graphic headline typeface, offering 2 alternate character sets on the upper case and lower case within the same font.\n\n",
