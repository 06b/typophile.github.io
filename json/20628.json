I definitely see a figure in there, the legs of the \"r\" have the baggy pants look to it. Again, I'm not sure I'm making the high fashion connection. Keep working on it. Logos are like ink blot tests, everyone will see something different.\n\n"

By combining the two to create a logo that suites the character branding. As for the letter A in the character I'm not quite sure about that myself either. It just seems a little more appealing and attractive to look at. I'll keep working on it though. Thanks for the comments guys. Really helps. I'll keep posting. Thanks again.\n\n"

I think you could use the copyright and r symbol with a bit more interesting type. Or mess around with different ways of displaying the c and r.\n\nWhat about a ligiature with capital RC with R before C? Or ligiature C above the R... I'll try to think of some interesting things.\n\n"

High fashion brings to mind didones wheras skate brings grunged fonts to mind, not that I would necessarily advise trying to combine those into a logo. Although some of the flavour of the samples on this link posted by Dav in another thread could give you something to consider  \n [http://www.youarebeautiful.co.uk/bitch\\_web/work\\_01.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419083745/http:/www.youarebeautiful.co.uk/bitch_web/work_01.htm \"http://www.youarebeautiful.co.uk/bitch\\_web/work\\_01.htm\")\n\nTim\n\n"

It's been all over the place in the fashion industry in the last couple of years or more.  \nWould it be possible to see a bigger version of the logo?

It may work for illustration but a logo is there to stay for a while so maybe it would be wiser to try something that is not going to look \"tired\" tomorrow. Just my opinion.\n\n"
