  "content": "Hey everyone. I am new to the board,although I have been a lurker and reader for quite some time. I am working on a t-shirt design that is based on the Jim Beam Black ad campaign. I am mostly finished with my design, but I NOT satisfied with the font that I have come up with. Here is the Jim Beam ad and my design side by side.\n\nand please ignore the typo :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307230502im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jim%20beam%20black%20image%20comparisons_4544.jpg)\n\n",

Numerous incidents around the country involving fraternities and drinking have resulted in hospitalization, death, jail time, expulsion, and the shutting down of fraternities.\n\nI hope your fraternity does nothing foolish in that regard. But if something should happen, you have already suggested (if not gone on record) that Delta Tau Delta is committed to drinking, thus increasing your liability.\n\nI have nothing against responsible drinking, but linking your fraternity (even by a T-shirt) to drinking doesn't seem like a good idea to me. Also, copying a company's brand identity is neither original nor creative.\n\n"
