Health - cross  \n2. observatory - binoculars  \n3. web portal - computer, arcade type font\n\nIs this worth anything? Does anything show potential?  \nI am not a professional designer, so I would really appreciate your advice.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045829im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_3559.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045829/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_5.png) | 69.64 KB |\n\n [‹ Updating to existing logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045829/http:/typophile.com/node/50634 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Personal Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045829/http:/typophile.com/node/50720 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I understand your thinking behind this. There are two problems for me. Firstly I think the red and white and the cross symbol represent first aid rather than a wide range of medicine and health. Also the “computer, arcade type font” is from a much earlier age of computers than blogging, and its fuzzy edges don’t help. Look for something bolder, clearer and more up-to-date.  \nI would get rid of the cross but keep the binocular form. Try a warm, vibrant green or orange rather than red to look healthy and lively, and make it smaller if you are going to keep it to the side of the lettering.\n\n"

      "content": "In my opinion, you’re approaching this design way too literally. The concept for the blog isn’t visually congruent and to try and create a visual image to go along with the blog is honestly, out of your skill range. Not to offend.\n\nI think you’d have better luck creating a clean logotype and matching it with health related images (stock photography perhaps) in the banner of the site.\n\nAlso, to reiterate what Jay said earlier, avoid the “computer/arcade” type. It’s a poor concept to assume that if you’re creating a logotype for a website it has to look “techy or futuristic”. Personally, I’d use a friendly slab serif typeface like Soho, Archer, Zine Serif or Officina Serif. Any of these fonts would bring a confident look without seeming too cold or tiresome.\n\n"

Too expensive to buy for somebody who is not into this line of work.\n\n**To whom do I turn to for designing such a logo and not pay a fortune?  \nThis is a non profit organization, run by people who are volunteers and they need to spend a lot of money on all the technical stuff regarding their portal, so the money is short.**\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n"

This portal would be on a global level not specific to Croatia.\n\nI am using up your time, but since you have been so very helpful I would like to ask you one more thing. I was looking a little bit on the net about logo design and prices. The first sites that come up in Google are these firms that offer logo design for like 150-300 dollars. Most of them have pretty ugly websites and portfolios, but this one doesn’t look bad \\> [http://www.logoworks.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045829/http:/www.logoworks.com/ \"http://www.logoworks.com/\")\n\nDo you think this is worth it? Is there any better solution for this price range?  \nOr is it just plain stupid to expect any quality for such small amount of money?\n\nThanks again.\n\n"

They might be great, they might not.\n\nI will say, if you’re expecting this website to be accepted globally, I would assume you have a pretty talented web designer. One that would design a site that’s both easy to use, navigate, translate multi-culturally and still be appealing aesthetically. Why not have them create the logo for the site as well? If you don’t have a web designer, then I’d say you’ll need to revisit your priorities, because a logo comes much later in the process.\n\n"

Since it’s owned by HP, I’d think it’s probably legit, although looking at the “Vista credit union” logo in their gallery (and its imitation Disney font), I’m not sure if their results are always going to be the greatest.\n\n- Lex\n\nP.S.

I can turned them back again and we can continue this game forever.\n\nHow much is a logo worth for me? 10 000 dollars? Which I don’t have.  \nThere are other things to take in consideration apart from the clients opinion of how much something is worth. There is of course the designer, his work, how good he is. There is also the market, the competition, other designers.  \nI am not stupid. I do realize that a job like this could cost from 100 to 100 000 dollars.  \nI saw this logo factories online offering work from 100 to 1000 dollars. This is what I liked about them, that they had some prices out there so I had some idea. OK they maybe bad, but still they are transparent.\n\nThat is why I asked you if it would be better to spend 300 dollars on these guys or if for this money I could find a better solution. Yes or NO, simple answer, no hard feelings.\n\nThese games with hiding prices and all the mystery remind me of the markets in Turkey and Tunis. Nobody has a prices on anything and they ask the same questions. So they sell you something for 10 dollars, then the same thing for 100 dollars to somebody else.\n\nI would like to know the price, or at least some price range, so I can see what I can afford and also so I don’t offend anybody by approaching and saying dude here is a 100 bucks.\n\nFor example Paul tell me how much would you ask to design a logo (only a logo) for the project I described.\n\n"

No doubt about it. Having said that, if you value a designers time at $100 ... you won’t have any choice but to be happy with whatever the results are. Clipart with a font might work ... who knows.\n\nI’ll refer you to the triangle ... you can have any two sides included in your project. Which two are most important to you?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045829im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fast-good-cheap_5922.gif)\n\nYou’re paying for the creative’s/designer’s TIME of finding an effective and appropriate solution to your requirements and their EXPERIENCE in finding that effective and appropriate solution.\n\nIt’d be great if it were a fixed price industry ... but it’s not. There are too many variables involved.\n\nAt the end of the day, one thing never changes.
