Of course some revivals can work well, as Bembo itself is a revival based on the De Aetna typeface (which you all know). To me it seems a bit odd to hear talk of reviving Bembo instead of the De Aetna typeface, but IMO it's probably not possible to recreate the full feeling of these types from outside their context. Just as Bembo looked to De Aetna and updated it, we should work in the same manner: not looking to reive Bembo, but to take from it and build something new that is more relevant today.\n\n"

I agree completely with the first half — and thought you were going to conclude that we need to do a better job of making digital fonts that match the style characteristics of metal type. But then you swing off to the left and make unfounded remarks about the irrelevance of older type in modern books. Given that you've just extolled the beauty of metal Bembo it just seems that you have two ideas running that have not been harmonized.\n\nJust my 2 cents.\n\n"

I think letter press looks blacker than offset, particularly on rough paper, which is a particularly attractive look.\n\nHowever, I do think you can capture a lot of the feeling of a metal type. As I mentioned in the thread, by careful attention to recreating the effects of ink spread, Matthew Carter's Monticello recreated the feeling of the metal Linotype version pretty well. --That was Carter's brief, as the digital font was intended for printing additional volumes of Jefferson's papers, the first of which had been printed with metal Monticello.\n\nAs to whether it is worth recreating the look of a metal font, it depends on the font. Bembo was the second attempt of Monotype to revive the De Aetna face of Griffo, and the most successful. In fact Bembo is one of the best book faces from the hot metal era. So to me reviving the look of it would be a worthy exercise. I don't know how well Bembo Book has succeeded in this.\n\nAs to the question of revivals vs new types. To paraphrase Duke Ellington, there are two kinds of type: good and bad. Whether it's new or a revival, it can be good or bad. Adobe Garamond was a good revival; monotype Bembo was a bad revival. Not everything is worth reviving, but when a type has been \\*great\\* with one technology, I think it's worth reviving. That was done in the hot metal era, beginning in the 1890s, was done again in the brief phototype era, and is being done again now in the digital era. I don't think it was a bad idea, then or now.\n\nOh, I should add that Monticello is unusual in Carter's work in being a very literal revival. Generally his types are a freer interpretation of an earlier type. He said to me that he thinks of a revival of a type as a new performance of an old score. And most people think Beethoven is still worth performing.\n\n"

But for his last publication, <cite>Beautiful Evidence</cite> he decided to create a digital font called [ET Bembo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416072408/http:/www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000bm), together with Dmitry Krasny and Bonnie Scranton:\n\n_When converted to an electronic font, Monotype Bembo became thin and spindly (the computer people ignored \"squeeze,\" the slight spreading of ink when the lead type hits the paper). So we made our own computer version and also made a some design changes (ligatures, several problems with the pi font, some letterforms, creation of a semibold)._\n\nI think it looks good as set in the book, but I seem to recall kerning issues every now and then.\n\nRegarding Kris’ article, I too have issues with Bembo although my reasons are completely different. It’s not so much that the digital pre-Bembo-Book Bembo is too thin (it is) or is misused for cultural reasons (it is, too, sometimes), but that during the original Monotype revival many choices where made that I don’t particularly approve of. So my issues are not even with the digital version, they’re with Bembo itself: I’m not claiming Monotype Bembo is a bad typeface in general, I think it’s a remarkable typeface and I have several books set in it that I truly love, I’m just claiming it’s a completely different beast from the De Aetna typeface designed and cut by Francesco Griffo da Bologna.\n\nContrast and compare Bembo with the De Aetna typeface, the Monotype Poliphilus typeface, and Giovanni Mardersteig’s Griffo type. The difference are just glaring: where Bembo is all spiky and sharp, all the other versions are much more organic and natural.\n\n(As an aside, I’d love to be able to see Matthew Carter’s Yale typeface at a higher resolution instead of the low-res GIFs on the Web, and possibly also another one of Carter’s own typefaces designed for the book <cite><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150416072408/http:/bielerpressiii.blogspot.com/2006/11/aldine-press.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Aldine Press</a></cite> by Nicolas Barker, composed by Gerard Lange.)\n\nI have been lucky enough to be able to see the De Aetna several times already and it’s incredible. I’ve been collecting bibliography, sketches and ideas for a while now, and I’d love to have a go at producing my own version of the De Aetna typeface in the not too distant future. Here’s wishing for that dream to come true, eventually.\n\n"

      "content": "Most photo and digital versions of Bembo carried over a strange characteristic of the metal version. In metal, Monotype cut two versions of cap R. One R had a \"long tail\" and the other had a tail many typographers would consider to be a \"standard tail\". For some reason, the standard Monotype matrix case carried the long-tail R. Good Monotype composing rooms (Stinehour Press, Mackenzie & Harris) made sure to alter the matrix case and keybars to yield the short-tail R on the caster. Merely competent shops did no such alterations.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the long-tail R in a well letterspaced all-cap line. But it looks like hell in a line of u&lc text, as the first letter in a word. It adds disruptive air before the following sort.\n\nMost photo and digital versions kept that long-tail R. Monotype or Adobe had a font in which the only sort was the short-tail R. But it was a pain to do the S&R to get the better R. I think Bitstream's version of Bembo also had that short-tail R, but their fonts had no smalls or oldstyles, which rendered it useless for book work. Yet I bet that 90% of books I have seen in Bembo (metal, photo, digital) use the long-tail R. To me that is a sign the typographer has not really studied the face.\n\nIs there an OT version of Monotype's new Bembo Book? If so, does it have both Rs? I guess I could look, but I'm so un-interested in Bembo these days that I have not bothered. There are far too many good new types to choose from: who needs Bembo anyway?\n\npowers\n\n"

Not only were the fine lines of Type 1 font too thin, the ascenders & descenders were too short. Yes, there are a lot of new fonts to choose from, but they too all seem to have flaws.

I enjoy listening to old songs reinterpreted by today's singers. I think that if no one ever sang Gershwin something would be lost. Don't you like to sing century-old Opera songs, Chris? Should they be banned?\n\nAlso at some point eg a jazz interpretation of an old song becomes almost as much an independent creation as a newly written song. I think here that you are neglecting the creativity that has gone into such revivals as Carter's Galliard--a revival of Granjon. For example Martin Majoor says of Scala: \"The form principle of Scala was definitely influenced by humanist typefaces like Bembo and by typefaces from the mid-18th century French typographer Pierre Simon Fournier.\"\n\nSo is Scala a revival? I would argue that what matters is not how new Scala is vs how new Galliard is, but how good and useful they are.\n\n"

      "content": "William,  \nReread my post. You have badly misinterpreted it. Nowhere did I say that anything should be banned. Nowhere did I say there was no value in older typefaces. Nowhere did I say modern original types (including Scala) should not be influenced by older types. That is just your misread. What I said was that \"Historic type will always have uses\" and that they are \"not the cure-all solution to typography that some users make it out to be\". My point is that older is not always better nor is it better by definition. If that were true, we would still be setting everything in Gutenberg's very first typeface and the faces that would have been banned from ever being designed were Garamond, Caslon, Bembo, Baskerville and every other face after the 15th century. Every face started out as the \"newfangled\" thing. When Baskerville first came out, it was not well thought of.  \nYes, I love to sing arias from the 18th and 19th century. I don't sing them at rock-and-roll concerts though and I don't think it is a requirement that today's pop-song writers and performers base their music on Verdi or Mozart. If they choose to be influenced by older works, fine but it is not essential nor particularly advantageous a pursuit. There have been successful borrowing of past forms like the broadway show Kismet that used Borodin's music and set it to words (see \"Stranger in Paradise\"). Miles Davis's \"Sketches of Spain\" was an adaptation of classical composition by Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo's \"Concierto de Aranjuez.\"  \nMy concern is that if we deify historic work too much, there will never be a new John Baskerville or William Caslon to come forward. I am asking that we don't freeze time and say there is no room for something new. I am NOT asking that we abandon, ridicule, outlaw or even criticize historic work. I am just saying \"let there be more\" than what we already have from our ancestors.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

William to address your points; I think that Chris is rightly suspicious of an over fawning or overly reverential approach to the old designs if that results in not thinking or looking or solving for the situation the type will be used in. Certainly the revivals you bring up do not do this. Also, in text you can stray only just so far from tradition in any event so I think Chris' position is really just a shade of grey away from yours. Chris, please correct my impression if I am misinterpreting you.\n\nStill, I think the thrust of Kris' position is that what's needed now are point (size) specific designs be they new or revival flavored or something in between. And I think he absolutely bang on with that.\n\nJames I think you may be spinning the Bringhurst position a bit too far. My sense is that he is making a case for picking type with some sensitivity to what might resonate with the content/context of material being set. Do you think that's a bad idea? I don't think he is suggesting that you discount what is a solid font to be working with. His point was ( as I understand it ) \"here are some types that are solid enough that you can select from them with tone in mind\". You may not agree with his selections of course, but that's another matter.\n\n"

In the short term it leads us into the yet-another-Bembo/Garamond/Bodoni/etc. situations, but in the long run this will be an important part of Western designers rediscovering their place in our culture and in relation to other cultures around the world.\n\n"

But I think that some design students have trouble reading Bringhurst, due both to the level of his writing and his tendency to segue into oddball historical details. It seems like every typography book aimed at undergraduates has a similar generic chapter about type history and Vox classification and how those can influence type selection, and some of the newer books hit on making connotative typographic decisions, but they lack a simpler version of Bringhurst’s examinations of letterforms, spacing, formats and so on.\n\n"

      "content": "I posted my comments on the thrust of Kris's article at the ILT site.\n\nRegarding revivals and revivalism, we must be aware that there are various ranges of things meant by various people and by various uses of the terms. I think John Downer did a thoughtful job of mapping out the territory in his article [<cite>Call It What It Is</cite>](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416072408/http:/typophile.com/node/33445) for Emigre years back. Unfortunately, his distinctions (and especially his terminology) have not gained much currency.\n\nBill, I think you span quite a gamut when you cite both Galliard and Scala in the same breath. And you run the risk of conflating two different categories of historically minded interpretation.\n\nTo draw a slightly different musical analogy, we might compare/contrast some roughly contemporary pieces from the realm of classical music. On the one hand, you have Respighi's <cite>Suite of Ancient Airs &amp; Dances</cite> (1917) and Stravinsky's <cite>Pulcinella</cite> (1920-22). In both cases, you find thoroughly modern composers looking back at 17th- & 18th-century melodies and recasting them in a thoroughly modern vernacular for early-20th-century ears.\n\nOn the other hand, you have Prokofiev with his \"Classical\" Symphony No. 1 (also 1917) in which he attempts to completely absorb, assimilate, and embody the style of the 18th-century Haydn and re-express this in his own unique, completely 20th-century voice.\n\nBoth approaches to historically informed work are fascinating and perhaps equally valid. It is interesting to note that the mining of ancient material by Respighi and Stravinsky was received as a rather radical move in the context of their times. However, it is also interesting to note that the expressive originality of Prokofiev's essay seems to have retained more impact over time (IMHO anyway).\n\nIt has always fascinated me that this kind of revivalism in classical music was happening at the same time as the classic type revivals of Monotype: Garamond, 1922; Fournier, 1925; Bembo, 1929; to name a few.\n\nA few years later in 1932-5, we find Dwiggins reacting, perhaps, to this literal sort of revivalism with his Caledonia, which I would argue is his Prokofiev-like approach to reviving the Scotch form.\n\nI don't think that anyone is advocating that the classics be \"banned,\" Bill. What I do sense is that there is objection to a mindless clinging to accepted classics, even when their expression no longer really serves. As I said in my ILT comment, the classics cannot simply rest on their laurels. They need to be either reinterpreted (and reinvigorated) or let to rest.\n\nAs I've tried to clarify, the approach to that reinterpretation may take legitimately different forms.\n\nAs you say, they must be judged on \"how good and useful they are.\"\n\nI might add: \"Just 'cause it's old, don't make it classic.\"\n\n-- K.\n\n"

I would put more emphasis on the fact that we can learn a lot from the old masters. This may be by something that calls itself 'revival', like Galliard, or something that holds forth as new like Scala.

What is so fascinating about the past?**\n\n**David Berlow** : What is fascinating to me about the types of the past is that they take me to a particular place and time where a type was required to solve some problem. The solution, quite often, then became visually associated with the person, publication or place where the solution was needed. Then, if the design was still cool several decades or centuries later, the design was revived for new technologies. Having the first one happen over 400 or so years ago, and then the second one 150 years ago to 50 years ago, we now have several layers of technologically and culturally motivated inventions and revivals to peer through for inspiration. And of course, with the physically vacant nature of type’s modern form, all of the pieces of the past that were used to make and use type, even the rottenest old job case, are fascinating to me as well.\n\n**More specifically, several of your own designs are inspired by nineteenth-century typefaces – I’m thinking of designs like Bureau Grotesque, Rhode, Giza. So... what’s so fascinating about the 19th century?**\n\n**David Berlow** : To continue what I was saying, I think viewers in many cultures have reactions to types from different times and places that infuse some of the cultural soul from those places, to the new places in which the type is used. In your example, the slightly decorative uses of type in the world that preceded Helvetica, had roots in the 19th century, and I, being inclined towards Anglo-American tastes quite a bit, made Grotesques, Egyptians and Industrial sans in response, because lots of people between me and the viewer wanted to take the viewer to a slightly more soulful place, perhaps.\n\n"

It is something new, with enough backward references to keep continuity with the book tradition of the last five hundred years.\n\nThe only empirical data points we have on what is `right for today', or `captures the soul of today' is what is popular with designers and readers today.

Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin are known as two of the greatest \"cover\" bands of all time, yet they put their own spin on the originals. They manage to pull the essence of the old tune into a new, modern context without destroying what it was about the original that was loved so much.\n\nThe people who play pastiche covers played at your Uncle Joe's wedding last year. What was their name again?\n\nSame goes for revival \"cover\" typefaces. Good ones will stand the test of time as rock and roll classics, even if a cover of an even older tune. Poor ones will be relegated to a brief and un-noticed appearance on the stage and subsequently forgotten.\n\n"

I also think it addresses some of the issues discussed here, though not, of course, a different master for each size.\n\nThis isn't the best paper for Bembo, but it holds up I think, and given all the color plates, you can't fault them too much for the sheet. In passing, the color in some of the art could be better, but I saw the originals, and the problems stem mainly from those supplied images.\n\n"
