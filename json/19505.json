      "content": "An affordance is the design aspect of an object that suggests how the object should be used. Not only objects but also substances, places, surfaces, shapes, etc. For ex. When you hold a pencil in such a way that it fits comfortably in the hand, you say that the pencil affords being held in this way as a result of its lenght, width, weight and texture, all with respect to the size, configuration and musculature of the hand. It’s common when you talk about a door handle for example...when you look at it, you should be able to establish immediately how this should be used...otherwise you are going to stand in front of the door not knowing automatically what you should do with the handle in order to open the door. Basically your E affords a nest for your bird because of its shape etc etc...another good example is the stork (I think this is the name of the bird that nests on chimneys...you know, the one that delivers babies :)  \nIt’s fascinating stuff, usually apllied to product design. Serious: I may need your pic but I’ll let you know what I am doing and how I’ll use your photo. Thanx again! Great stuff....  \nIf it’s not too much trouble I’d love the original file by email maybe. Rest assured you will be credited...\n\n"

In his classic work The Perception of the Visual World (1950) he rejected the behaviorism then fashionable for a view based on his own experimental work, which pioneered the idea that animals ’sampled’ information from the ’ambient’ outside world. He also invented the word ’affordance’: the interactive possibilities of a particular object or environment. This concept has been extremely influential in the field of design and ergonomics: see for example the work of Donald Norman who worked with Gibson, and has adapted many of his ideas for his own theories.\n\nThis entry is from Wikipedia...sorry if this is “too much information!”\n\n"
