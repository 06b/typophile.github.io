So it is quite a soft image. Note the variety of \"a\" shapes maybe a total of 4. There are two \"t\" shapes as well. I am not sure I have found all the contextual variations yet.\n\nThe type that inspired this font is in fact from the 15th century - printed at Subiaco in Italy in 1465.\n\nI am looking for good images of those original types now as well as better images of the Ashendene type called Subaico. This type is a transition from blackletter to roman. Conrad Schwenheym and Arnold Pannartz moved from Germany to Italy.\n\n\"Originally from near Mainz, Germany, Sweynheym with Arnold Pannartz established (c.1464) in the monastery of Subiaco the first known printing press in Italy. Sweynheym and Pannartz first used Greek type there in 1465. They moved to Rome in 1467.\"\n\nSome people think that that \"Sweinheim/Sweynheym worked at Eltville with Gutenberg in 1461-64.\"\n\nAnd look! Tiff wrote about it too\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/34038](http://web.archive.org/web/20100622054902/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34038 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/34038\")\n\n"

The fount was eagerly received by Hornby, who had been greatly influenced by Morris’s principles of good printing through an inspiring afternoon spent at the Kelmscott Press in 1895.\"\n\n[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/side\\_private.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20100622054902/http:/www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/side_private.htm \"http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/spcoll/virtualtour/side\\_private.htm\")\n\n"

I'll draw his attention to this thread.\n\n"

It a book printed in 1469, by Johann ( and maybe Wendelin too - I am not 100% sure about that ) of Speyer (de Spira). It's not something I am sure about like this but I am reasonably confident. I will make separate thread for that.\n\nThere is also is slight possibility that there is a Jenson - which would be pretty wild I think. I am not holding my breath on that one but he was working at the same time and I seem to recall his sort of taking over the de Spira business or something. Anyway - there was I think a real relationship of some kind. That one has a thread already.\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/43627](http://web.archive.org/web/20100622054902/http:/typophile.com/node/43627 \"http://typophile.com/node/43627\")\n\nI would appreciate any help you guys can muster in finding better images for these 3 examples!\n\nThanks!\n\n"
