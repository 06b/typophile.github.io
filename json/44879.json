  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m working on an insurance industry magazine and want to set the nameplate in a condensed or tall serif, maybe transitional or modern. The magazine is the market leader so I want to convey a sense of prestige but am also looking for something distinctive.\n\nI’d really appreciate your suggestions! I love this board!\n\n [‹ Translating into Korean?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708213142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44926 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Monograms ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708213142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44746 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The fonts are currently only available through the Font Bureau Studio library, but I’m hoping that we’ll be releasing these to Retail in the next month or two.\n\nI show a few examples here: [http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmDisOverview3.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708213142/http:/www.kentlew.com/WhitmDisOverview3.html \"http://www.kentlew.com/WhitmDisOverview3.html\")\n\nAlso, a PDF here: [http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay\\_Sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708213142/http:/www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay_Sample.pdf \"http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanDisplay\\_Sample.pdf\")\n\nIf you can tell us the name of your magazine, I’d be happy to set a screen sample.\n\n— K.\n\n"
