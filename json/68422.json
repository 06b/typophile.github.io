  "content": "Last year, when the first Taschen book \"A Visual History of Typefaces and Graphic Styles, Vol. 1\" popped up on an Amazon ad, I bought it immediately. After coveting it in close proximity, pouring over beautiful pages, I knew I was smitten. Shortly thereafter, the second volume appeared for preorder and I could not resist temptation. Yesterday, volume 2 arrived and did not dissapoint.\n\nI opened the book and that wonderful smell that says \"Book\" tickled my nasal passages. I felt like I had just sat down at the rare book section of the New York Public Library in Manhattan. It doesn't smell like book as in \"Barnes & Noble store at the Mall\", it smells like loved and cared for printing and typography with lucious plates of books gone by.\n\nIf you are the typical person who visits Typophile, you will surely love these two volumes as visual, verbal, and olfactory treasure troves.\n\nChrisL\n\n[www.amazon.com/Type-Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic/dp/3836511010/ref=p...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100317145652/http:/www.amazon.com/Type-Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic/dp/3836511010/ref=pd_sim_b_1 \"www.amazon.com/Type-Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic/dp/3836511010/ref=pd\\_sim\\_b\\_1\")  \n [http://www.amazon.com/Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic-1901-1938/dp/3836...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100317145652/http:/www.amazon.com/Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic-1901-1938/dp/3836515148/ref=pd_rhf_p_img_2 \"http://www.amazon.com/Visual-History-Typefaces-Graphic-1901-1938/dp/3836515148/ref=pd\\_rhf\\_p\\_img\\_2\")\n\n",
