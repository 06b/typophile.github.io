      "content": "Peter --   \n   \nI'm going to guess that what is happening is the translation from FOG to Postscript to FL. Postscript doesn't make a distinction about point types, coding only the coordinates of the on-curve points and the associated control points. If I'm not mistaken, PS doesn't handle decimal places, so coordinates are rounded to the nearest integer when a PS font is generated. Non-orthogonal curves and tangents are particularly susceptible to this.   \n   \nWhen FL reads the PS data from the font, I'm guessing that if the points aren't exactly colinear (due to rounding) that FL will not interpret them as tangent points per se. I would presume that your points and controls are still in the proper places (allowing for rounding). I'd be curious to see a screenshot with the control handles showing. For instance, did FL add a handle to the bottom side of that lower, outside curve point?   \n   \nI'm just starting the arduous transition to FL myself and am by no means an expert. Someone more technically savvy, like John Hudson, might have a better explanation.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

      "content": "Peter --   \n   \nI've been thinking about this and spending some time with the FontLab manual.   \nI had an insight that I think might help.   \n   \nThe FOG model is point-based. But the FontLab model is segment-based.   \n   \nWhat I mean is that in FOG you are usually focused on what kind of point   \nyou're placing. Whereas in FL, the emphasis is on what kind of line segment   \nis being operated on. FOG has three kinds of points -- corner, curve, and   \ntangent. FL doesn't make these distinctions.   \n   \nFL distinguishes between two different kinds of line segment -- a straight line   \n(which they also call a _vector_) and a curve (a bezier curve). A curve is described   \nby four points -- two end points on the curve (_nodes_) and the two bezier   \ncontrol points on the handles. A straight line is controlled by only two nodes --   \none at either end, with no control handles.   \n   \nFL also distinguishes two different kinds of transitions between line segments --   \na node can either be a smooth connection or a sharp connection.   \n   \nSo, if you have a curve meeting another curve, then the node will have two   \ncontrol handles, one contributing to each of the two curves. If the connection   \nis smooth, then the two handles will be co-linear -- that is, they are linked   \nand stay aligned with each other -- so this kind of node is what FOG would call   \na curve point.   \n   \nIf two curves meet and the connection is sharp, then the two control handles   \ncan be moved independent from one another. This node would then constitute   \na corner point in FOG.   \n   \nIf two straight line segments meet, then the node does not have any control   \nhandles and is necessarily sharp. This would also be considered a corner point   \nin FOG.   \n   \nIf a straight line meets a curve, then the node will have one control handle on   \nthe curve side. If the connection is sharp, then this control handle can move   \nany which way and the node would be considered a corner point in FOG.   \n   \nBut if the connection is smooth, then the control handle on the curve side   \nwill be co-linear with the vector segment meeting up with the curve and will   \nonly move in a line with this vector -- and this is what FOG would call   \na tangent point.   \n   \nDoes this help?   \n   \nSo, you need to notice whether the node between a straight line and a curve   \nis smooth or sharp. When it is selected, you will see off to the side of the   \nnode either a circle (smooth connection) or an x (sharp connection). You can   \nalso turn on all connection types for every node, whether selected or not, by   \nselecting the button from the View/Show Layers toolbar.   \n   \nSo, for example, if you select the node on the top of the inside of your   \ncounter, you will see whether it is a smooth connection or not. If it isn't,   \nthen double click the node to toggle the connection style. When the connection   \nis smooth, then you can change the \"curve\" on the right side to a straight line   \nby selecting the right control handle of the node and deleting it. (Deleting   \neither control handle of a segment will convert it to a straight line vector, since   \na curve needs to be defined by two control handles.)   \n   \nOnce the right-hand segment is a straight line and the left-hand segment is a   \ncurve and the node is a smooth connection, then the handle on the left will   \nonly move in line with the straight segment and you will have, in effect, a   \ntangent point.   \n   \nI hope this makes sense and is helpful.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

      "content": "To follow up on Kent's thorough description, I wanted to add that FL has an excellent way of keeping users on their toes with regard to what is allowed in the world of PostScript Type 1 fonts:   \n   \nFL doesn't let you form a curve by anything other than two points with control handles. In Fontographer, you're allowed to create a curve that has a BCP handle on one end, and an \"empty\" point on the other end. But this can produce errors, since it is effectively creating a point-on-top-of-point situation. FL shows you that this is happening by immediately introducing a complimentary BCP handle when you create a curved segment. It invites you to define the curve properly.   \n   \nFL also makes you aware of the nature of Type 1 curves, by making the \"closepath\" and start/end points a tangible part of the path. This can be disorienting at first, and seem like a hassle, but it reveals the nature of the curves and allows greater control.   \n   \nLastly, if you turn on the \"connection type\" layer as Kent suggests, FL does another neat thing: when two consecutive BCP handles cross each other's paths, the connection type indicator flips to the opposite side of the point, notifying you that the curve is not constructed as well as it could be.   \n   \nLastly lastly, setting the preferences to show points in color is another handy visual cue.\n\n"

When you create a one-sided curve, you are invisibly creating a BCP on the opposite end of the curve. That invisible BCP (invisible in Fog, at least) is located directly on top of the vertex, so then you have a point-on-point situation.

But if you create a single-handled   \ncurve in FOG, all that means is that the generated PS   \ninstruction will contain a few arguments whose values   \nare zero. There's no restriction or caution about these   \narguments being non-zero, as far as I can tell.   \n   \nI think that since these arguments only seem to be   \ncalculation values, this construction wouldn't constitute   \nany point-on-point sort of violation.

One good reason to define all your inflection points explicitly is TT output/conversion - it consistently blows up, at least in Fog. But I think there are other reasons too.
