  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm working on a logo design where the client wants the word to be all uppercase: it's an acronym. The word includes an uppercase I, and I suspect that the logotype will be friendlier to read if I dot it.\n\nI don't want to identify the name of the client here, but it's similar to SPRITE.\n\nFor the uppercase I, I'm echoing the lowercase i's design while keeping the weight of the uppers.\n\nI need your expert opinions: Where's the best place to put the dot ... above the cap height, or down a bit with the I shorter than the other caps? Any rules of thumb?\n\nMany thanks,\n\nDave\n\n",

I guess it's hard to post your work in progress when even the name is classified, but – very general speaking, if you were making a logo design for Sprite, I'd start of with the dot underneath the cap height, so it would read SPRiTE and go from there.\n\n"

You’ll find you get better a better response if you show people what you have already tried before asking for help. In addition, it is considered polite to use your full name in your profile. It has also been my experience that if you use your real name as your screen name, you tend to get more and better feedback. Good luck out there, and remember, may the fonts be with you™.\n\n"
