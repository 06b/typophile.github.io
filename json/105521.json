Although we tend to flex things a little, we will have an agenda and timeline, and I can put you on the mailing list with the students to see that.\n\nOn further thought, the easy thing that would be fun and require no prep on your part is you could join in on a round of critiques, if you like. I'd love to be able to list you as a \"special guest.\" :)\n\nIn any case, we can chat later this week.\n\n"
