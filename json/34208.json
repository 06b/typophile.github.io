What kind of typeface do they tend to use. Is there any specific reasons as to why they would use certain typefaces? I've usually seen more of san serif on wall clocks and more of serif on watches. Or am I wrong? Educate me! I'd like to know. Curiosity never killed the cat did it? :)\n\n"

My brother Erik lives in glorious Nippon (Japan) and there they use Roman numbers on their wall clocks as well as their digital wristwatches. But don't be confused, lol, their clocks read counterclockwise because their language reads in a different way than English.\n\n"
