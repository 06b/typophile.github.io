  "content": "I had posted about this in general discussions, but it probably really belongs here.\n\nAn obvious countermeasure to the spam problem we're having would be to require new users' posts to be passed by a moderator before showing up. But this may create an excessive workload, and cause other problems.\n\nUpon reflection, I think that this wouldn't be too onerous either to prospective posters or to the moderators if we made one exception to the rule: new users' posts would be queued for moderation before appearing, _except if they were directed to one of the Type ID forums_.\n\nBecause a Type ID request is the one general type of posting for which the poster might be in a hurry for an answer.\n\nAnd this would have the side benefit of addressing the issue of Type ID requests turning up in the wrong place!\n\n",

The software should be upgraded to a stronger community software in my opinion and there should be active moderators all the time organizing and overseeing the forums. Everytime I come on here there's always spam and/or a font ID request in the wrong forum.\n\n"
