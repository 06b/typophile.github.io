Many of these FontFonts are listed in the thread Paul linked, but [here's a handy search of FontShop.com with the figures from all the sans FFs displayed](http://web.archive.org/web/20100516055552/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FontFont+sans+-ot+-purchase&site=d&start=0&num=100&sample_text=0123456789&sample_size=48).\n\n"

These are, again if memory serves, in the URW 'Design Collection', a relatively inexpensive collection of competent goodies.\n\nI imagine Font Bureau is a good source for sans serifs with osf.\n\n"
