You can turn it on in Tools \\> Options \\> Outline font editor.\n\n"

      "content": "SparkyType,\n\nScanFont 3 was $198. ScanFont 5 is $99 and it can plug into TypeTool 3 (also $99). So the bundle costs the same as ScanFont 5 alone (hence no downgrade at all), and TypeTool 3 is much more of a full-blown font editor than the crippled ScanFont 3 font editing part. Instead of TypeTool 3, you can use FontLab Studio 5.\n\nAdam\n\n"

You will then be able to save the ScanFont output into a .VFB file that you can open in FontLab Studio or TypeTool using conventional means (File / Open).\n\nA.\n\n"

After rebooting and loading FontLab Studio first I still got the same error (something like 'Unable to connect to FontLab server').\n\nThanks for the .VFB exporting tip. I'll download the demo again and have another crack at it.\n\n"
