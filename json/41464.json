That style is flush & hang with superiors numbers. If you use paragraph style, with either on-line or superior numbers, it matters far less. Yes, you can make a case for tabular numbers, esp. if the book uses notes a lot of reference-type notes — <cite>ibid</cite> & title-only citations create a lot of short lines, so the numbers do form a sort of list.\n\nI can’t remember the last time we set superior note numbers for footnotes proper. It does happen, in once or twice per every 500 books.\n\nNote calls are an entirely different matter. Whether you are setting footnotes, end-of-chapter notes, or end-of-book notes, they have to be signaled in the text. Those are always superiors. Frequently, they fall after quote marks, periods, or commas. The way everything is spaced today (from most foundries), you get a very tight sequence of letter, period, quotedblright, and then a very gappy set of superiors. And the numbers themselves need kerning against the punctuation, they are too tight against a quotedblright, and too far after a period or comma. Then, you also run into a few authors who call a note after a word without punctuation.\n\nBut if you really want to do it in perfect harmony, have two sets of superiors for notes, one for the calls in the text, one for the few times when superiors are used in the note proper. And I suppose you could add another set for scientific superiors, if you think a particular font is good for setting science or math.\n\n"

      "content": "Charles:\n\n1. Yes, superior figures should be kerned to follow lower case letters, if for nothing else than “f”. However, some negative kerning may be useful when following letters such as “a”. So, for an OpenType font, the designer should create a kerning class for the superior figures, and then kern one of those, the two, against the lower case. Question: is there ever a need for superior figures to follow capitals or small caps?\n\n2. So, you’re suggesting the 7 is too close to the quote mark? I would agree. However, in this and the following example, I don’t have a problem with excessive space between superiors—it is of the same order as the space between lower case figures, and surely the goal is to create evenness amongst the different typographic elements? The 7 4 sequence is most gappy of figure combinations, but occurs so rarely, let’s leave it to the typographer/comp to kern, if they consider it necessary.\n\n3. The problem with introducing kerning between a period or comma and following superiors—it backfires when the mark itself follows f, r, v, w, or y, and is kerned negatively with them. In those situations, the arm of the f, for instance, would touch the superiors following the mark. Therefore, as letter-to-mark is a more frequent occurence, mark-to-superior kerning must be left to the typographer/comp. There, still some work for you guys to do, at least until Adobe invents three-character contextual kerning!\n\n4. In an oldstyle face, where capitals and ascenders have different heights, and the f is frequently tallest of all, surely it’s not a problem to have a variety of vertical alignment. As with accents (diacritics), it’s a judgement call for the type designer, based on the face and the particular accent/superior, whether to align by centering along a horizontal axis, or “flush bottom”.\n\n5. I’m afraid I have to disagree. IMO, the slash should, as much as possible, disambiguate from the vertical extremity of all other characters. Generally, this means it’s a little above cap top, and a little below baseline, only lining up with ascender top in old style faces. I mean if you’re OK with the irregular depth of old style figures, which is never the same as the descenders of letters, then surely having the slash somewhere else again fits in with that scheme. After all, if the bottom of the slash is lined up with the bottom of the descender, the question arise, why isn’t it lined up with the bottom of the old style figures? It’s better to have it line up with neither, which provides greater consistency.\n\n"

      "content": "[An addition. Nick, I only saw your post after clicking the “post” button!]\n\nSpacing superior numerals and letters is tricky and hard to address with the current sidebearings+kerning approach: superiors are smaller and need less space “within” (inbetween two superiors) but more space to the outside (between normal glyph and superior). Solving this by pair kerning alone would require kerning them with almost the entire glyph set. In future this could be done contextually.  \nThe same, btw, is true for all caps spacing. Uppercase letters usually are spaced to fit best in lowercase context. This implies that with the current pair kerning approach, uppercase-uppercase pairs requires a lot of kerning to make the white space in A L T V W Y disappear. Again, contextual positioning can help by not only do pair-wise corrections but by giving uppercase letters completely different sidebearings in all caps context.\n\nYour examples uncovers a weak point. Not so much of Arno or any other particular typeface, but of the underlying font technology.\n\n"

And it is off-topic.\n\nBack to superscripts: Obviously, the clashes & too tights should be fixed, either in the font, or by the compositor as set.\n\nAs to kerning the superiors themselves: whatever balance you want should be achieved. But look at the space between 7 and 4. Just like any other set of numbers, if not kerned, it is far greater than the space between 6 and 9. And 69 & 74 as note calls could well fall in the same paragraph Then look at 100. The space between the one and zero is large; the space between the two zeros quite small. etc. Just like with any tabular number set.\n\nThe example I gave does not show the usual situation, justified copy, with all the compromises of word spacing that occur on the page. But these spaces between the word and the note call are fixed, in that they result from the sidebearings of the characters themselves. How you space them needs to accommodate a tight and a loose line. Ideally (I believe), there should be less space between the number & what it refers to than in the following wordspace, whether that space be tight or loose in a particular line of justified text. Nothing new here, it is simply that these numbers must be made to space correctly just like any other set of numbers.\n\nFor what it is worth, when I rework a font, I make these numbers proportional (varying setwidths). I then kern them against themselves. I next kern them individually (pairs kerning) with close quotes, periods, and commas, because that is the most commonly found placement. When I get the sidebearings just right, I probably could use class kerning for period/comma & quoteright & quotedblright and the “super” class. I suppose if you are a foundry, you’d consider it sloppy not to do so. For me, since as a comp I have to go back into the file & find my place, I use pairs kerning for important stuff.\n\nFor the rest, these are the characters I start with:\n\nquotesingle asterisk exclam bracketright c d e g i j k l p r s t v w x y question uni02BE uni02BF];\n\nadjusting the class as needed for particular fonts.\n\nAnd typical kerns:\n\npos @\\_quotesingle @\\_zero.super 50;  \n pos @\\_f2 @\\_zero.super 130;\n\nFWIW\n\n"

Space inbetween two superiors is not touched.  \nAn advantage is that effectively you do a global adjustment — and are still free to _also_ kern superiors the usual way. Kerning values resulting from different lookups will add. E.g. the pair “X one.sup” will be kerned at 25.  \nA disadvantage is that older and most current applications would ignore this kern feature completely because it contains more than one lookup. Adobe CS2/CS3 applications <cite>can</cite> handle this, and hopefully other applications will add support too.
