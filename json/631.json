The impression that the line of \"s\"   \npastes together the two separated parts would   \nwork nice, giving typographicaly the meaning   \nof the written word.   \n   \nPropably this idea would work better with clear   \nforms as you try bellow, though the world is full   \nof clean cuts and pure linear forms.

I think it might have to do with the stroke not being consistent with the a and p.

I know) on the a... it'd definitely make it more legible, but I don't know if it'll kill the monoline quality of this.

You've got a nice thing going with the thick-to-thin transitions in the p, a, and s. The t-to-e connection still seems a bit fat, and the tail of the e also seems slightly less fluid than the other rest of the letterforms   \n   \n2. There's a little \"bump\" or \"kink\" near the top of the bowl of the e that is a tad distracting.   \n   \nOtherwise I think this is a great solution - well-crafted enough to be taken seriously, while retaining much of the playfullness of your original sketch.\n\n"
