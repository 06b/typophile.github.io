  "content": "Hi All:\n\nIt has been a LONG time since I checked in. Glad to see the old gang at it still.\n\nI've been asked to evaluate Ecofont, and am coming up short with actual data, or even anyone saying they use it. [http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont\\_en.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225002921/http:/www.ecofont.eu/ecofont_en.html \"http://www.ecofont.eu/ecofont\\_en.html\")\n\nMy thought is it's gimmicky, and the same thing could be accomplished much more easily by:  \nPrinting 25% fewer pages  \nWriting 25% fewer words  \nMake the font size 25% smaller  \nUse lightweight fonts, Don’t use bold anything.  \nSet your font fill color to a 75% black.\n\nBut I need to give a fair assessment to well-intentioned people. Does anyone have even anecdotal experience to share?\n\nThanks all,\n\nJoe\n\n",

      "content": "In order to measure it's effectiveness you first need to (get your client to) define what they mean by \"effective.\" Until then, you're chasing your client's tail.\n\nAnd if you are looking for data, you'll need to conduct some sort of experiment, be it laboratory or online questionnaire. In this instance your independent variable (the one you change) is looking like typeface, and other aspects of type.\n\nThe roadblock you're coming up is with the dependent variable (what you measure) which your client has simply defined as \"effectiveness.\" This could mean comprehension, time, visual search, fatigue, memory, aesthetic appeal &c.\n\nOnce that has been established you'll need to design an experiment which uses these variables. If you want reliable data then you will need to do things such as control your population, make sure everything is counterbalanced &c.\n\nLastly, you'll need to statistically analyze your data to see if your manipulations had a significant (outside the possibility of random chance) effect (pun intended).\n\nShort answer, collaborate with a cognitive psychologist from your local university (experimental, not clinical) with a background in reading comprehension. You may get lucky and find a masters or PhD student who will make this a project. This is not an easy task, but I applaud the people of ecofont for looking at it this way. And their cause.\n\n"

We have received permission for the processing of a font into an Ecofont font and its use in Ecofont.  \n...If you use Ecofont, we ensure that you have permission to use the Ecofont fonts. You are yourself responsible for possessing the correct licences for the font on which the Eco variant is based (the source font), e.g. Arial, Times New Roman or Verdana.\n\nThis means that Ecofont must be one of the few companies in the World that is allowed to modify fonts like Arial.\n\n"

      "content": "I seldom join a discussion on the Ecofont, but this forum topic triggerd my attention. In november 2008 SPRANQ creative communications, the Netherlands released the free Ecofont, that shows that ink saving holes can be made in glyphs while maintaining readability of the printed text. The Free version is no more than a way to show the principle. It does work, but it has some drawbacks.\n\nOur 'bigger plan': to apply the ink saving holes to widely used typefaces. Users will no longer need an (extra) typeface, but can use their normal fonts and print their text using less ink. For some typefaces, the ink savings (corpssize 10) add up to a mere 45%.\n\nThe professional software is available for both home and business use. Please note that the Ecofont solution is a printing solution and not made/meant for offset.\n\nMicha's analysis is correct; we do have the right permissions to do so, but only so under strict regulations.\n\nRegards,\n\nGerjon Zomer  \nCo-owner SPRANQ / manager Ecofont\n\n"

It is easier to save ink by using normal widths  \n- Ecofonts apparantly was developed for office use. Where toner and ink are best saved by printing less (which also saves paper)  \n- The Eco-font is, in short, a beautiful example of fashionable humbug.\n\n"
