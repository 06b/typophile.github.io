Since we are a visual community, a graphic:\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\nVoila!\n\nFollowing the grid straight down hits me wrong entirely. The point size is 9/12 so I feel as though the type is simply too small to run that much of it. (It's Minion Pro). Thoughts? I feel as though I have seen this **1,000** times in other publications but alas, I never paid much attention. Visually, the copy is very pleasing but even I get a little confused as to the flow; sometimes I read down as opposed to across.\n\n",

Thing is, I am in Canada, and had never seen such. Perhaps it was a western Canada thing. There would be a deck between the 1/2 and 3/4 levels.\n\nI personally find it confusing.\n\n"
