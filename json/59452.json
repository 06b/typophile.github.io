The wedding colors are cream and lightish pink and the flowers are lilies and roses. The wedding is pretty upscale and the bride is a girly girl.\n\nI am stumped just now; what do you guys and girls think of what I have so far?\n\nThanks,  \nRachel\n\nps I am open to crit/comments on anything/everything (type, concept, ligatures, legibility on a projection screen (worried about this) (not quite sure how large/far away the screens will be), contrast, whatever!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [J+R.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017053721/http:/typophile.com/files/J+R.jpg) | 432.13 KB |\n\n",
