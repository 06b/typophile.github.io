The family spans 9 weights, and also the italics have a double-storey ‘g’. There’s a [Pro version](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414232925/http:/www.hubertjocham.de/item.php/type/sans/SafranPro/) with small caps and extended language support.  \nBut Stephen’s right: without knowing why FF Kievit is out of the question, it’s impossible to come up with suitable alternatives for you.\n\n"

I’m looking for a sans serif (with no or at least modest modulation) that is neutral and clear. It has to serve two purposes: (a and most of all) to work well as a headline typeface together with FF Scala (, Minion and Albertina) as body text typeface; (b) to work as a body text typeface as well (good legibility).\n\nI’m just a non-professional, and I’m just interested in typography for my own purposes (typesetting scientific texts). Hence, I like to be sure, that I’ve chosen the ›right‹ font, before I purchase a license.\n\n"
