It does not have the curving bottom terminals on u and d. Leg on R seems straight. But I do not dispute your observation on the top terminals of a and s. So it's still not a match.  \nI hope you can find a way to get a legitimate copy of Matterhorn.  \nDon\n\n"

I really thought it could have been a mixed of Kyrial Display and Sans (awfully close to Matterholn BTW) which, now I see the answer, looks to be the only solution, Matterholn being an exclusive typeface for Disney so most probably not available for licensing.\n\n"
