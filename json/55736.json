The body is set in 11/15 Minion.\n\nThe page is 39 x 51p.  \nThe textblock is 26 x 39p.\n\ninside margin: 3.833p  \ntop margin: 5p  \noutside margin: 9.1666p  \nbottom margin: 7p\n\nI'm curious what people think of the large title size and if the leading for the body is too high. Also would like to hear thoughts on the block dimensions and location on the page.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nps-I've a NYTimes article as dummy text.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [test.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725182059/http:/typophile.com/files/test_3.pdf) | 35.99 KB |\n\n",
