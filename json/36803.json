On a related note, I was a bit confused to see the _Test Driver_ popup when I clicked on the _Characters_ link. It took me a good moment to realize that both features shared the same popup window. Nonetheless, congratulations on your Chronicle family and the all new website!\n\n"

It's also unnecessary, distracting, and inaccessible - a real usability mistake. Getty Images has made the same egregioius mistake recently and I don't know, for the life of me, why these fine firms would resort to 1997 presentation methods.\n\n"

While it's nice to see a complete list of serifs, I think it'd be better if they were broken up into sections to save bandwidth, and not have to wait to have it all load. Other than that, the look and feel is excellent.\n\n"

Although I do get a lot of server errors.  \nI've ordered the catalog, I always enjoy seeing type specimen in print.\n\nAlso, somehow I thought that before I could order single weights of Gotham (I need to purchase it soon). It seems that there's only packages now? Am I mistaken? Sorry for hijacking the thread with such a question. :)\n\n[edit]  \nAh, I read now that single weights is only for +50CPU's.  \nWhat a shame. Now I'll have to find another font to buy.\n\n_this stupid forum bug just kicked my post to the bottom_\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Mr. Hoefler. Your new site is very handsome, but I noticed a few things which I thought I would share.\n\n+ On my home computer, a 12\" laptop, the navigation bar across the top takes up a large portion of the screen.  \n+ The pop-up Interactive/Specimen Test Driver reminds me of old sites from a few years ago. Most sites incorporate the test driver into the main browser window.  \n+ The Interactive Test Driver states that, \"Some characters may not be accessible from your keyboard,\" which makes it seem like it's somehow my fault. I don't understand why characters which are typed using the option key are either missing, replaced by a ?, or completely wrong. (I typed ® and got ﬁ.)  \n+ The Interactive Test Driver doesn't have kerning.  \n+ The Characters Test Driver in a large font, like Chronicle, is awkward to scroll through. I had to press on the arrow key for 10 seconds to see the numbers!  \n+ The \"Fonts\" pages are difficult to browse with, as they show all of the weights of a font. It would be more helpful for me to see all of the same-style fonts in the same weight so that I can compare them.  \n+ I like the shopping interface! (See, I can pay a compliment!)\n\nThis is a fine effort! A very smart and serious-looking website which puts the Hoefler Foundry back on the top of the type league.\n\nJN\n\n"
