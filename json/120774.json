Renko's call of Houschka would surely provide a good base font, probably the closest one (/M to be tweaked). Mixing [Museo and Museo Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162300/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/museo) plus some little tweaking could work as well. [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162300/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova) even if top rounded /A needs to be reconstructed would be another option.\n\n"
