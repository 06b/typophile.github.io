If that is the case, then there is a good chance that some of the other characters have been modified as well. The D's look a little tweaked to me. There are so many different versions of Helvetica its often hard to tell which is which. Hope that helps.\n\n"

      "content": "Pretty darn close it's not.\n\nIndeed, at first sight, the M, A and N remind of Helvetica and the D and E could pass off as modified versions of the Helvetica originals.\n\nA closer comparison of the M, A and N reveals, though, that they're not from Helvetica. As far as one can judge from the low quality sample on the pack shot, in Helvetica, the M is narrower, the stems of the A broaden more towards the baseline and the modulation (line width variance) is more distinct in each of the five characters.\n\nThat was enough to make me suspicious, so I went to the EA Sports site and looked at another pack shot and, well, there's not much more Helvetica in the EA font than Comic Sans in the Coca Cola logo:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223073534im_/http:/typophile.com/files/not_helvetica_5061.jpg)\n\n(Undeniably, there is a certain degree of kinship between these fonts in terms of overall anatomy and the EA font might have been designed with Helvetica as a template.)\n\njpg\n\n"
