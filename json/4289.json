  "content": "I've really appreciated the advice (and the willingness to give it out) I've been given here at typophile, the instructional websites have been a real help. Does anyone have any suggestions for a good, all-inclusive book that covers the basics of type-aesthetics (there are many general graphic design books out there, but I've not come across any that deal specifically with the elements of things like letter proportioning--especially things like capital O extending slightly beyond the cap and baselines). Where can I find a book of visual rules/tricks for type, perceptual psychology stuff?\n\n",

That's where I first learned about notan, among other things.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
