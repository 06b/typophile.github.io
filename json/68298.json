  "content": "Hi,\n\nI currently use Suitcase Fusion but am a little annoyed with it. I find it difficult to make sure that the correct fonts are activated, especially since I have multiple versions of various fonts. I'm wondering if FontAgent Pro or Font XPlorer are better? What do you all prefer and recommend?\n\nI'm running Snow Leopard. Thanks!\n\n",

I also want to be able to meticulously classify and categorize my fonts. I've downloaded FontAgent and am playing around with it, but I'd be curious to hear what works for others.\n\n"

The X-fonter reads, previews, compares, installs and uninstalls quickly. It also displays special effects, but I have not much need for that.\n\nAwhile back The Font Thing was my favorite and had superior comparison abilities. But it can't read Open Type and I don't think it was ever updated to do so.\n\n"
