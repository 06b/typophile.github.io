  "content": "This logo is for a music based company that is designed with artists in mind. It helps them get matched up with appropriate venues. The name of the company is “mJambo”, which means “hello” in Africa, and also harks back to the roots of music itself. I have designed two very different styled logos. I’m leaning toward the first one. The client has specified that he wants the “m” lower cased and prefers just a type treatment as opposed to an icon. I’d love to hear a critique of the logos I have provided, as I know they need to be fine tuned.\n\nThanks.\n\n(please note I have attached all revisions made on this first post)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [mJambologos.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/mJambologos.jpg) | 22.17 KB |\n| [mJamborevisions.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/mJamborevisions.jpg) | 57.71 KB |\n| [rev3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/rev3.jpg) | 14.43 KB |\n| [rev4spacing.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/rev4spacing.jpg) | 14.43 KB |\n| [m\\_oneserif.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/m_oneserif.jpg) | 13.6 KB |\n| [flippedserif2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/flippedserif2.jpg) | 14.75 KB |\n| [Jchange.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/Jchange.jpg) | 14.81 KB |\n| [spacing.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200310/http:/typophile.com/files/spacing.jpg) | 13.92 KB |\n\n",

If its yes to any of these questions then loose the gradients and make it work as a vector mark.

I think it’s good that you’ve gone for 2 completely different logos too.\n\nAlthough I do agree with Dan (above), and I’m generally not a fan of gradients and shadows etc, i think the reflection on the 2nd one works well. It’d be a shame to lose that as it finishes off the logo nicely.\n\nOne other thing (which you may have allready be aware of) is that the ‘J’ in the first one isn’t a capital (or doesn’t look like one) as your client wanted/suggested.\n\nThe 2nd logo visually seperates as ‘m Jambo’ wheras the first one seems more like ‘m jam bo’. could this be a thing to consider also?\n\nCheers Leah!\n\n"

I tend to appreciate that quality in advertising in general, but I guess it depends on the intent, audience, etc.\n\nI agree with WhitePepper that the ‘J’ in the first one does not read as a capital though.\n\n"

For instance, you can add a hard 20% gray shadow and remove the gradient for black and white use, but use the gradient and the soft shadow for everything else.\n\n"

I have some idea about this word should sound - I lived in Tanzania as a kid. Jambo or mJambo is specifically from Swahili, a language spoken mostly in East Africa. The 1st m should have a small stop.\n\n"

But If you are looking for a more J like J I wonder if you can find another way. The current Serif on the cap J points back and holds my eye. But even so, my main suggestion is still that you restore the serif to the right side of the the 1st m. In the case of the J, I wonder if a twist could be introduced instead of a serif. Or a wave in the line. Sort of a coca-cola wave. It could be very funk fresh. Or a shorter serif. It is tasty though. In spite of my ideas about how it might be better I think this is an interesting and strong solution. But it is easy to accept very good. I think you should push on to great.\n\n"
