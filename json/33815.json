In Elements, Bringhurst suggests eschewing all superfluous punctuation (5.4.4), such as with the British take on \"Mr\", but also recommends using small caps for anything besides two-letter geographical acronyms and proper names (3.2.2)—the logic being that in some faces, full caps will be intrusive and mar the color of the page. If this seems to be the case with a given face for the word phrase \"PhD\", then it would only be consistent to treat similar, mixed-case abbreviations (such as Mr, Dr, Jr) in like fashion.\n\n"

A compromise, as weight was affected.\n\nTypical usage:  \n1. Acronymns in text, e.g. the problematic \"U.S.\", with the same letterforms as lower case  \n2. A line of all small caps used as a subhead  \n3. Titles (as in this thread).\n\nWith small caps that are barely larger than x-height, all these usages suffer.\n\nNow admittedly the problem of too-small small caps was traditionally ameliorated by letterspacing (tracking) them out, but that's a bit of a work-around.\n\nIMO, small caps should be around 120% of the x-height. Most are under 110%.  \nAnother reason for larger small caps (from the type designer's perspective) is that they are very necessary in Cyrillic, with many more common shapes between cases than in Latin.\n\nWhy do type designers make small caps so close to x-height? I suspect it is because we visually balance the effect of equal amounts of small cap text with U&lc text, one-to-one (symmetry), and that does not correspond to typical typographic usage, which is asymmetric, requiring a small amount of small cap to hold its own against a much larger quantity of U&lc.\n\n"
