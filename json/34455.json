  "content": "I am working on a redesign of one of my first fonts (Tirana released by T26). I feel that this fonts has flaws as it was my first. Since I feel strongly enough about it, I’d like to make something better of it, so I am redrawing it and expanding it’s weights. I think it is improving lot to the point of starting to become a different font, although the basic characteristics like the curves and proportions, which were my main motivation for going back to this font, are kept. I think this is a common feeling among type designers, if you were in the same situation, what would you think would be best the best way to release it? Releasing it with the same name and adding it something like “pro” or “new”? Releasing it with a different name and assume it is a new font? Not going back to it at all?\n\nYou can see attached a sample of the new upper cases.\n\nThank you in advanced.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113062543im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tirana0_5553.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tirana.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113062543/http:/typophile.com/files/tirana.jpg) | 85.62 KB |\n\n",

All I'm saying is that I like the font the way it is now regardless of whether or not it resembles other existing fonts. I think by designing something yourself, you'll obviously be inspired by a certain amount of things, but you'll always end up with something unique (unless ofcourse you're literally copying a design). Important to keep in mind when judging Tirana is that it's a \"remake\" of Rui Abreu's first font which also already featured many of the characteristics that resemble the new herd.\n\n"

But there's a limit to how bland you can make it before an \"out-of-the-blue\" corporation becomes much more likely to simply go with another similar design, with even more polish! What I mean is, unless you put an inordinate amount of polish on this (I'm talking about multiple weights, widths, all kinds of extras), a \"special look\" is what will sell it best to a corporation.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I'm worried you might be creating some dead fish.\n\nI will say that the majority of your newer characters are well done and definitely rise above the older ones.\n\nTry revisiting your G,K,R, and B and see if you can hint back to their original styles while maintaining the clean look the other characters have now.\n\n"

They have a nice tension & invention about them. To make a the redesign worthwhile I would try to find a way to make the other glyphs with straight lines inherit some subtle shift and maybe tension as well. To me the glyphs don't quite all relate as a group yet - in either set. I think they need to. You could loose the weirdness even more but I think that would be a shame. The shift I mean doesn't have to be huge. Just there - & helping the letters to belong to each other. If you are not sure how to do that yet; I would wait until you are & then finnish a version 2.0 You are clearly developing the sensitivity you need to do it. I think you can.\n\n"

It appears to slightly fall out of balance with the rest of the face.\n\n1: I prefer the angle of the original - as it now matched the 6's new angle.\n\n2: I like the suggestion above - perhaps de-emphasis the bottom.\n\n4: As noted above, perhaps emphasise this character as it would 'match in' better with the rest of the numeral set.\n\nAnd sorry all the mistypes - but I've been up for around two days straight again on my own project.
