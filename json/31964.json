The font “Haettenschweiler” came out from another font “Schmalfette Grotesk”? So why desifners use “Schmalfette” with impact together?\n\n2. What’s in the impact family? ” Impact Wide” “,Impact Wide Italic” ,”impacta”and”Impact™ Roman” are the members of the impact family?\n\n3. In the net, I saw “Impact has a high x-height”, what’s” x-height “means?\n\n4. The last question, I found out that Impact is a trade mark of “Stephenson & Blake.” but I also found out impact is a trade mark of “Ascender Corp”. Which one is True? (Besides, the impact wide came from Ascender Corp instead of Geoffrey Lee? )\n\nofcourse~ if there are any other info of Impact tell me too\n\nThanks for help!! I’d appreciate any of your answers\n\n",

[X-height](http://web.archive.org/web/20090417174954/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/x-height) is a comparative measure of the height of the lowercase letters (e.g. a letter x) to the height of the capitals or ascenders. Impact has a high x-height because there is not a huge difference between the height of the lowercase and uppercase. Something like Nicolas Cochin has an unusually small x-height.\n\n"
