  "content": "Hello,\n\nSorry about creating a new forum topic, but I am not sure how  \nto add pics to the message after you create a new topic.  \nIf someone could inform me on how to do that would be great.\n\nI have gone back and made more changes to my typeface.  \nI smoothed out alot of the curves and I also thickened up a lot of  \nthe horizontal bars. That definetly made it feel better on paper.  \nI also added an alt version with no desending serifs. Also please  \nexcuse the spacing on some of the letters. I forgot to  \ndo that last night.\n\nLet me know what you think.  \nThanks!\n\n\\< J o s e p h \\>\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ROUND2.1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423163520/http:/typophile.com/files/ROUND2.1.pdf) | 431.61 KB |\n| [ROUND2.2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423163520/http:/typophile.com/files/ROUND2.2.pdf) | 430.36 KB |\n\n",
