      "content": "bob evans\\> Thank you for the wonderful link. Thanks going in my 'special bookmarks' section in safari.\n\nPeter Bain & Ludwig M. Solzen \\>\n\nWell I'm looking for those old books (Baroque-Rococo-Neo Classical-Pre Victorian- from french/european derivation) with lots of lovely vignettes and ornaments. I'm not really in the know about the history of booksmakers or history period but I think from the Didots and Fourniers time. I'm assuming that's 1700's to 1800's? I guess I would prefer to only view the books as I really just want to assimated the typographic hierarchy.\n\nI want to see how these old printers / type designers handled caps, small caps and italic type. Where and how did they use them? I want to capture that antique feeling.\n\nI found a small image of the 'Manual Typographique' by Fournier in a book on french type and I was able to copy some but not all. If you have scans of something like this with lots of vignettes and different types I would be greatful.\n\nBleisetzer\\> Very intresting german books. thank you.\n\nI got intrested in this because I'm working on a design for a client and she wants her stationary and signage to have classic old-europe feel. So I chose Didot and Fournier as models. I will use Linotype Didot fonts for the project.\n\nIn fact because I'm a student I will post the design in the critique section so you guys can pick it apart and tell me were I'm wrong or right... (but mostly wrong).\n\nThank you so very much,  \nMikey Diaz\n\n"
