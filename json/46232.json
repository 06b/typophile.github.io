The usual playfulness and expertise of Angel Koziupa’s forms, along with the smooth, crisp outlines of Alejandro Paul, provide a humorous and lively typeface in two styles that fit perfectly on food packaging labels, greeting cards, journals or wherever a design needs to convey freshness, young spirit, and a cool spring breeze.\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**[Inoxida](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015205839/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/104)** is Oxida’s softer and more graceful sister. While Oxida has become quite the common sighting on the packaging of vegetables and organic foods, Inoxida now comes to fit the bill for food packaging that can benefit from more sophisticated script lettering. Inoxida is not just a softening of Oxida’s slightly rough edges. It is a complete reworking of the way its letters were constructed, and the introduction of a smoother size relationship between uppercase and lowercase.\n\n////June.2008\n\n",
