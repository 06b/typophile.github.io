  "content": "I am having exporting a few amount of characters from the family I am creating.   \n   \nI wanted all the characters to be accessible in the same \"style\". So i put an alternative lowercase under the \"option + letter\" and when I try to use it in Illustrator it does not recognize these alternate letters. I recognizes more than half of them, but letter like b,d,j etc. show the default font's original character when i do the abover keystroke( option + z = ?, not my character).   \n   \nI am using Mac Roman encoding standard in Fontlab and working on a Mac. Any ideas or should i make it it's own style?   \n   \njp\n\n",

I couldn't get option + o (oslash) to work, but I got its big brother shift + opt + O to work instead.   \n   \nAny reason though the other does not work?   \n   \nNight!   \n   \njp\n\n"
