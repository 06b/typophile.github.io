  "content": "A New Graphics Content Publishing Startup is looking for Fonts & Graphics Content to license. Products would be published under a new brand (which previously has published more than 180 best selling content products), and distributed through the 2nd & 3rd largest computer vendor's mail order channels for both their new and existing customer base. Fonts and other graphic content would be licensed - either as complete products, or compiled with other content into a complete product (depending upon quantity licensed). Licensing may be exclusive or non-exclusive depending upon product requirements. For further information or to express your interest, please contact by email: [bloc@mcguinnessdesigns.com](mailto:bloc@mcguinnessdesigns.com) Thank you for your interest!\n\n",
