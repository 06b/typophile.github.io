It operated from 1919 to 1933 and marked the beginning of the Bauhaus Movement. Above is a Bauhaus catalog cover designed by Herbert Bayer. The sanserif typeface and simplicity of the piece really exemplifies what the movement stood for. I like this piece because it is so bold. The colors and large lettering really attracts my attention.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629051956im_/http:/typophile.com/files/38dolepineapple%20resize_5540.jpg)\n\nArt Deco was a popular international design movement from 1925 until 1939 that affected the decorative arts (architecture, interior design, and industrial design), as well as the visual arts (fashion, painting, the graphic arts and film). This movement wasa combination of many different styles and movements of the early 20th century, including Neoclassical, Constructivism, Cubism, Modernism, Art Nouveau, and Futurism. Above is a 1938 Dole Pineapple Gems Art Deco advertisement. It was designed by A.M. Cassandre, a founding leader in French Art Deco graphic design. Like the movement, this piece is quite decorative. I like how the more realistic pieces of pineapple are bursting through the pineapple contour. the contrast really catches my eye.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629051956im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wes_wilson%20resize_3441.jpg)\n\nThe 1960s was a time of psychedelics. The style itself came about through sub-cultures of different cities such as London and San Francisco. Music, drugs, art, literature and hippie activities were the drive behind psychedelic art, which became an interesting fusion of fine art and commercial art technique. Wes Wilson was a leading designer in the Psychedelic movement in San Francisco and the creator of this poster.  \nI love the Psychedelic movement and this piece because of the amazing color palate that most of the posters of that time period are known for. They are crazy, bright, colorful, and most likely drug inspired. Personally, I think it’s nice that the artists behind the psychedelic art age took the drugs so we could appreciate the visual beauty while maintaining our sobriety. The imagery throughout many of his posters involves the female form and the flowing curves of the body/hair. These forms were made even more intense by the variations in line-work and extreme colours. The hand made type could almost blend into the image itself because it pushes the limits of legibility.\n\n",
