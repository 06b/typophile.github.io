      "content": "Nice work (visually speaking), but I wonder if it strikes a chord with intended target market.   \nBig adventure? Makes me think more of abstract theater performance. I think starting from scratch would be the way to go. Forget what you like personally, and stick with what sells for the client and audience. Design is business not art.\n\n"
