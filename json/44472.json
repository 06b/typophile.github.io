For now I'm calling it Aperture, but I'm open to suggestions. Also, keep in mind that this is an early beta so it's still pretty rough; I only started the thing three days ago.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017053634im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Mathematiques_6544.png)\n\n",

Some of the wobbly will probably go away with some polish. (What's the right formula for the stroke widths on a black 'w' !?) I agree, though, that it gives the face some personality.\n\n"
