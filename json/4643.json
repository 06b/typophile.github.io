      "content": "I'll begin by saying that I've hotwired many fonts before. In fact I've stolen Myriad before. Then I designed my first typeface and I realized that it takes many many months to draw all those letters. Perhaps [Thomas](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129061128/http:/www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-profile.pl?action=view_profile&profile=tphinney-users) can enlighten us, but I imagine it took [Carol](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129061128/http:/www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/twomblybio/main.html), [Robert](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129061128/http:/www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/slimbach.html), [Christopher](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129061128/http:/www.adobe.com/type/typedesign/slye.html), Fred and the rest of the Adobe Type staff many moons of labor to create Myriad Pro given the thousands of letters and languages included in the font.   \n   \nBut to answer your question, I don't know if Adobe sells a true type version anymore. They sell individual weights of the font for a mere 35 dollars. Perhaps the best way to find out is to do this:   \n   \nHey Thomas, is it possible to purchase a true type version of Myriad?   \n   \nCheers,   \nRandy\n\n"

Most of that is due to the combination of the extended language support and the perfectionism of the designers (including Christopher and Fred, not just Carol and Robert). Christopher did the Greek extensions, and Fred the Cyrillic, both with Robert's guidance.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

It's bundled with Illustrator CS, as are many other OpenType fonts like Minion Pro, and if you buy the whole CS suite you can download the complete Brioso Pro Opticals set of 42 fonts. At $35 per font, that's $1470 worth right there, more than the cost of the suite!\n\n"
