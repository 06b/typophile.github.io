I’d expect to see this in some enormous institution like IKEA or an airline, and I’d expect them to be good cookies, but good cookies brought to me by a faceless megacorporation that makes no pretense of not being a faceless megacorporation but still wants me to know it cares about its millions of customers and genuinely hopes I love and enjoy the cookies. It’s a very good design concept but if you want to emphasize “homemade” and “small-time” you’ll want to move away from Helvetica.\n\n"

Bite is nice but too small — maybe it would integrate with the new ampersand?\n\nOther points about general balance etc are relevant too.\n\n"
