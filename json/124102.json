  "content": "Hello!\n\nI really love the shapes of the serif fonts like - Fortesque, Lancet Wounded by Sang Mun, Feasby Semibold by Raf Rennie or Permeke Semi Bold by Josse Pyl. I'm looking for some similar fonts with this specific type of style, which are available for purchase.\n\nAnyone has some good tips?\n\nThank you\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Lancet Wounded.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330212314/http:/typophile.com/files/Lancet%20Wounded.jpg) | 109.45 KB |\n| [Permeke\\_Josse\\_Pyl.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330212314/http:/typophile.com/files/Permeke_Josse_Pyl.gif) | 431.01 KB |\n| [raf.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330212314/http:/typophile.com/files/raf.jpg) | 61.22 KB |\n\n",
