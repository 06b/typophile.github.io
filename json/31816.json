If I had to guess, I'd guess that it's some weird code-page issue.\n\nWhat platform and application is this happening on?\n\nHave you tried composing the text in another (text-only) app, copying and pasting it into the target app, and then applying the font formatting (Freight Micro)? If so, at what does the corruption occur?\n\nConversely, what happens when you copy the incorrectly-appearing text from your target app and paste it into a text-only app?\n\n"
