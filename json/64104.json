It might be because it's in a foreign language, but I wonder if the problem isn't helped by the use of all caps. Maybe try it without the use of caps, or perhaps space out 'INTERAKTYWNI' a little.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n"

You should at least \\*try\\* loosening the rest of the spacing to get it more-or-less even. But maybe it's too loose then. I guess a higher-class thing to attempt would be a T\\_Y ligature.\n\nGlyphs: Some seem too dark. The \"W\" needs help, and the \"K\". But that sort of stuff is hard to tell at this size. What font is that anyway?\n\n"
