  "content": "Wedge has been my primary project for a couple months now. I was inspired at first by the headlines of the SF Chronicle, set in titling Electra. I was also intrigued by the wedge serifs of Underware's Dolly, providing the design's temporary name.   \n   \nTwo goals for the project are, first, exploring new ways of modulating strokes, second, establishing an interesting rhythm in continuous text. I'm not sure yet how well I'm succeeding on either count. I think my modulation in the bowls of bdpq is unique. This same modulation seems to combine with the similar shape in hnmu to provide a nice rhythm at the top and bottom edges of a line of text.   \n   \nIn the attached PDF I included a recently hacked up sans version of font. It is truly a sans since I preserved the modulation of the serifed version and just whacked off the serifs. It's mostly an experiment though and I'd prefer critique of the serif design.   \n   \nI'm very anxious to get feedback on this design. I have a whole summer ahead of me to work on this so I'd like to know if I'm going in the right direction.   \n   \n ![Wedge Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143235im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11644.gif)   \n   \n [Download PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143235/http:/www.xtypa.com/ext/typophile/wedgespec1.pdf)\n\n",

It's difficult to put one's thumb on what's new about it; it's only evident when zoomed in or looking at large caps.   \n   \nIt would be sweet if there were ligatures to handle \"fi\" \"fl\", etc, given your overhangs. Also, combos like \"nc\" seem to mush together when zoomed out a lot. But on the whole an amazingly strong design; incredibly professional.\n\n"

      "content": "I think you can be duly proud of having made such a serviceable, polished face so quickly. With some finishing tweaks (and a bunch more extra characters!) this face could be used to set many types of works very nicely. The color is right on for the proportions.   \n   \nI do have palpable reservations however if this is more than an academic exercise: it's too \"80's Adobe\". It has that flow (which of itself is nice), but honestly it's hard to see too many third-parties getting too excited over it. A certain original modulation is too subtle a thing to be appreciated by people outside a certain circle of type designers! :-/ The overall softness in your joins seems somewhat \"nostalgic\", in a way that most people don't seem to appreciate these days. Or it could all be in my head! :-)   \n   \nAssuming the above even bothers you, I'm not sure what I'd recommend. Probably just finish it in the direction it's going (since it's doing it so well), and have a very nice usable font that strongly demonstrates your abilities of making a solid mainstream text face - not as easy task when you're not closely following an existing source!   \n   \nOn the other hand, there are certain things in the font that speak to me a lot, like the beak of the lc \"f\" and the tail of the \"q\" - wonderful features, well executed. If you feel like you have the energy to make Wedge really great, consider pushing as many of the glyphs as possible in that direction. If you do that, I'm not sure what you would do with the stately but static caps: maybe just leave them as is - caps actually exist in a somewhat different world than the lc set (annoying but true).   \n   \nSome specific things:   \nUC: I'd make the \"L\" and \"T\" narrower - helps spacing. I think the tail of the \"Q\" should dip lower.   \nlc: make the ascenders a hair taller. Give the \"g\" a stronger ear. Make the \"m\" narrower. Make the \"r\" braver. The \"s\" is way off. Give the \"y\" a much stronger tail.   \nThe asterisk is cool - maybe close it up just a bit.   \n   \nSpacing: It seems slightly loose for the point size that it would sing best in. And it's a bit uneven in spots (like \"e\" is especially loose on both sides).   \n   \nWeights: I'd make four.   \n   \nThe sans: It creates a very interesting paradox! The softness really explodes here, and it's hard to say if it kills it or if it makes it highly original! :-/ Looking at it some more, I think I'm liking at a lot, actually - it seems to have a singular voice.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Your design also looks to me like something between Minion and Adobe Caslon. But I like it better than either: less fussy than Minion, but more lively than ACaslon, which is dull. It has the sturdiness of Caslon without the somewhat awkward shapes. I think it could be a very useful text face.   \n   \nOn the spacing, I like that it isn't too tight - which I think Minion is. I suspect it is a bit uneven, but I don't have the knowledge to tell you how or where. The round vs straight letters might be something to check.   \n   \nTo my eye the round part of the C, D and G look very slightly too fat in relation to the rest of the caps. They would be more elegant if corrected also. The O and Q don't bother me the same way, I don't know why. This all may have to do with the degree of old style slant and what this dictates about the relation between the slightly diagonal and the vertical 'stroke of the pen'.   \n   \nThe sans doesn't work for me - it doesn't have the virtues of the serif as it stands.   \n   \nI am an amateur, but the fact that I like your face as a good text face - something rare - moved me to comment.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> Text looks good, although i'd tighten the spacing more.   \n   \nThere are two reasons that the spacing may seem loose. First, i've tried to emulate the looser spacing of older type. Second, I've targeted sizes 9 through 11 which makes the spacing too loose at larger sizes.   \n   \n\\> Maybe you could try flatening both endings of the lc 's'   \n\\> Or make more look like the uc 'S'.   \n   \nThe lowercase s has consistently bothered me. It may be good to give more flare to the ends of the s, like that found in the lowercase c. I've made a concerted effort in my uppercase to make all the characters structurally different than their corresponding miniscule, to make the two sets belong to one another because of their style instead of just a difference in scale.   \n   \n\\> I think you should try lowering the contrast in sansserif. To me its looks too much like being the serif version with the serifs cut away.   \n   \nThe sans is precisely 'the serif version with the serifs cut away'. I hacked it together in a couple hours just to see what it might look like. If I lowered the contrast in the sans, it might become more useable but I'm certain it would lose it's unique character, it's handwritten feel. Like you suggest, it would be curious, if I find the time, to sharpen the corners of the sans and see what that feels like.   \n   \n\\> Why did you decide to make soft endings, serifs and forms? You said you were inspired by the electra, which is harder and sharper.   \n   \nI suppose because I was also inspired the Electra of the ratty sci-fi paperbacks I've read so many of. Cheap paper and printing gave the pages a mottled texture and denied Electra its sharpness. On the other hand, my laser printer is woefully capable of reproducing the sharpest corner so I prefer to manually warm and soften the joints of my glyphs.   \n   \nI began work from Electra in the proportions of the lowercase and by the structure of some of the letters: c, f, j, n, p, t. But over time, my initial shapes changed quite a lot.   \n   \n\\> Maybe the q's descender (on serif version) is too heavy.   \n\\> The descender of p is shorter than q's (is that intentional?)   \n   \nMaybe the descender on the p is too light? The serifs at the ends of all my ascenders/descenders are heavy compared to the baseline serifs. I stuck a baseline serif on the p, but I think it could use some additional heft to make it fit in. The descender on p is shorter than q, though not by much. I think the effect is exacerbated by the comparative lightness of the serif.   \n   \n\\> Lowercase r is too \"shy\"/narrow.   \n   \nGood catch! I guess I really had my designer blinders on here.\n\n"

Just two more years lie between us and the 20 year anniversary of the Laserwriter. Or maybe I'm being too optimistic.   \n   \n\\> The overall softness in your joins seems somewhat \"nostalgic\" [...] Or it could all be in my head!   \n   \nIt is nostalgic. I'm trying to recapture the heavy softness of older print. Because of this, I'm actually starting to prefer books printed from xerographic copies of the old print than those re-typeset. The text is more relaxed on the page. It doesn't march and shimmer like, say, a page of Minion.   \n   \n\\> I'm not sure what you would do with the stately but static caps   \n   \nHere's what I [have done](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143235/http:/www.xtypa.com/ext/typophile/wedgecapitals1.pdf) in the weeks prior to posting here. ( [Download PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417143235/http:/www.xtypa.com/ext/typophile/wedgecapitals1.pdf)). My previous capitals are stylistically closer to my lowercase but I wasn't satisfied with text in all-caps, and depending on my mood, they galled me within continuous text. The newer set pleases me more in both cases.   \n   \n\\> I'd make the \"L\" and \"T\" narrower - helps spacing.   \n   \nWhen they were narrower (once upon a distant time) they bothered by at small sizes where they seemed too weak, but I'll give them another look.   \n   \n\\> make the ascenders a hair taller   \n   \nGood point. I read recently (I forget where) that the top of the capitals should align with the bottom of the serifs of the ascenders. It seems like good advice and Wedge is just shy of that measure.   \n   \n\\> Make the \"m\" narrower.   \n   \nMy working theory at this point dictates that the width of the counters of the hmnu shouldn't vary too much, to maintain a consistent rhythm in text. I'd prefer to make them all the same size but I'm too accustomed to having the m and u be narrowed, as I imagine we all are, so I've narrowed these to align with expectations.   \n   \n\\> Spacing: [...] it's a bit uneven in spots   \n   \nI'm not sure where my problem lies but I think that the sidebearings on my rounds may be too loose. I'd left them this way to avoid bunching on round-round pairs. Perhaps the solution is to kern round-round pairs? I was hoping to achieve great spacing without kerning, since few people can be bothered to use a program that uses Opentype kerns, but I may have to bite the bullet.\n\n"
