But being a sign designer I usually have to respace numerals out of that anyway. Phone numbers and numerical addresses on signs are so extremely useless....\n\n"

I’m not sure why they’re still on sale, curiously the [FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828043356/http:/www.bertholdtypes.com/info/FAQ.html#6) basically states that BE versions are dumbened down BQ fonts with the same outlines but different metrics and kerning, less language support and incomplete character sets.\n\nThe drop in quality is intentional so it seems. Utterly pointless as both font packages are sold at the same price point.\n\n"
