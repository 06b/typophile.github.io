I had encouraged him to contact Fred Peter.   \n   \nInstead, Kivart, who had created the font from an image of the lettering provided by a friend, was aghast that the lettering was actually an existing (albeit dry transfer only) typeface. He pulled Gamme from his website and would not reconsider.   \n   \nI remain very sorry to have played a part in that. Subsequent efforts by myself to contact Mr. Peter have been unsuccessful.\n\n"

I did managed to scan it at high resolution from the letraset book,   \nand did it the old fashion way...cut and paste.   \n   \nNow the question I wonder about; Technically speaking is this a breach of copy right even if I don't sell it to others.   \n\"Heck I can't get it anywhere else\" is my justification. BUT that is all it is. a justification.   \n   \nWhat do you (or anyone thinks on the matter)   \n   \nThanks again for the info and link(s) Mike   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nSerge\n\n"

I have looked for that typography a lot in file TT, because I really want to save myself the work of the edition of the typography, since story with the image of the whole complete family but I need to know if somebody has it and it can spend in file TTF for not making it:) I wait an answer satisfactory Thank you!\n\n"

You would have to get the permission of Fred Peter and Kivart - in that order.\n\nI really wish that Kivart had tried to talk to Fred Peter and try to come to some agreement, but he chose not to. It probably didn’t help that he was shot in a drive-by posting here by a respected name in typography – in which he was effectively called a “font pirate”.\n\n"
