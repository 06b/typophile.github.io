  "content": "Hi,\n\nI ran into a problem today. Currently working on my first font in FontLab, I wondered if there is a method to add for instance all ISO-Latin-3 glyphs (just the empty glyph cells) to a font without generating hundreds of glyphs one by one. I searched the manual but found nothing. Fontlab.com FAQ reffers to a page taken down in 2008 for this problem.\n\nSorry for asking such a basic question. I hope someone can help me with this. :)\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nPS: I hope I put this into the right section of the forum. If not sorry for that.\n\n",

The glyph cells will then show Latin 3 glyphs. If you select all of these and generate all you should have what you need. \n"
