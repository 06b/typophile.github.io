It looks like Gotham with tiny serifs.\n\nThanks!!!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135434im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jeffreys_4421.jpg)\n\n",

As suggested by Don, this is close to Copperplate but too many details remain off to me (serifs shape, none of the standard weights looks to match, overall design is far more balanced, stroke thickness more regular and consistent...). I can only confirm the feeling you have regarding Gotham. That really looks like it with some serifs added (which is a long process but not so hard).  \nAlternatives: [Biondi](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135434/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/biondi), [Garçon Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135434/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/thomasjockin/garcon-grotesque)\n\n"
