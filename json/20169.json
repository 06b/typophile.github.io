To make a shopping list, personal correspondence, or to set a book?  \n3. What software will you use? Will you use InDesign or something similar? If it's Word, don't bother - stick with what you have installed. (Someone here recently suggested Georgia, and I think it's quite usable at 10.5 pt).  \n4. Why Sabon? It's one of my favourite faces to read, but there are other good text fonts.\n\nAs for your question, the cuts of Sabon are the same.There may be differences in Kerning etc.\n\n"

All the user needs to do is to license the font.

So InDesign will only 'do things' to the default spacing/kerning if you ask it to.\n\n<cite>ID also has a preference hidden in the Type panel “Adjust text attributes when scaling”, which I suppose is there to support Adobe’s sizes, but which (I think) will add space between glyphs (globally) at small sizes, and reduce the letterspacing at large sizes.</cite>\n\nNo, that is not at all what it does. Basically the question is this: Do you want the text size to scale when you scale a frame? In other words, if you scale a frame that contains 12-point text to 75%, do you want it to then contain 9-point text? Or would you rather the text stayed at 12 point (possibly overflowing the frame)?\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

I've set a paragraph of text in a single-master design like Bembo or one of my own designs, at about 7 point, then copied the text, without changing any atributes except changing point size to about 96 point, and then zoomed the 2 samples to the same large size onscreen, and discovered that the smaller sample was set looser and horizontally scaled. Same with the large sample; tighter spacing, slightly narrow. What is that? I thought that turning off the \"text attributes while scaling\" preference stopped that behavior. It's a real bother when I'm testing and proofing fonts in development.\n\n"
