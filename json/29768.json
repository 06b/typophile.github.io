Are there any elements of his work that you have been inspired by?\n\nQuestion 2.  \nWhat did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)\n\nQuestion 3.  \nWhat do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?\n\nQuestion 4.  \nHow do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?\n\nThank you\n\n",

I was definately inspired by his work, but in a different way to a lot of people, I think - I liked the little quirky touches he applied to things. The one example that immediately comes to mind is the design he did for Speak magazine. Interesting concepts such as having the contents page on the centre spread and having plus and minus page numbering, pages preceding the centre were negative numbers; also, having an article which stopped abruptly in the magzine - the rest of it appeared online. It's easy to dismiss things like that as gimmicky, but it kept really well with the tone of the magazine and I still like the lateral thought behind them!\n\nQ2\\> I got into RG just after Carson left : ( but in the UK we had BlahBlahBlah magazine which kind of took off where he left off.\n\nQ3\\> It's inevitable that his deconstructivist approach would be emulated because I remember it stood out so much at the time - people pick up on that.\n\nQ4\\> I mentioned BlahBlahBlah above, I remember that had a direct link with RG. I think there was a real backlash against the deconstructive style around '98 onwards.\n\nSorry it's difficult to write too much at the moment because I haven't got much time, but I hope this helps you a little bit.\n\nIt's worth checking out TypeRadio, there's a recent interview with DC.\n\n"

      "content": "Q1: I think Carson's influence on design has been huge and I credit him for that. He busted it wide open. However, I am NOT a fan either of his work or of the direction he has moved design in. Call me an old fogy but I like to actually read type and don't consider it just another design element. I design in a way that is pretty diametrically opposite to his aesthetic. I'm much more of a minimalist - I believe good design says more with less.\n\nQ2: As for Raygun specifically I really didn't do much more than glance through it. I truly hated his book Cyclops, both for the photography (the awful Albert Watson) and the egregious type design.\n\nQ3&4: I have much railed and lamented at the way all of a sudden book designers thought it was cool to have the type all squashed together and bleeding off the page and impossible to decipher. Or the above-mentioned TOC in the middle of the book. I think it's calming down now.\n\nSo to me he's the design equivalent of rap music - generally kinda hate it, do my best to ignore it, but occasionally there's something that makes me go WOW and I have to grudgingly acknowledge his spot in the pantheon. He is certainly a valid subject for a dissertation.\n\n"

I had seen these trends and remember being happy in a way to see print explode the way it did.\n\nBeing a bit older now, I see the key being that we focus on the craft and the information. If the writer takes a deconstructed approach the design might follow. But, if the writer is formally trying to communicate I feel the design should respect and enhance the effort.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Ruth\n\nWhere I come from, Carson is a dirty word. Here's why. The seventh form school program in NZ asks students to research a famous designer as an 'artist model' – and design their work according to the aesthetic of that designer. Many of them pick David Carson. The school leavers then apply for places on the graphics undergraduate programs that I teach on. Every year I am confronted with hundreds of pieces of 'rip-off' Carson-esque work produced by impressionable young people who think it's great without ever questioning why it exists in the first place...\n\nTo answer your questions\n\n_Question 1.  \nHave you been influenced by Carson? Are there any elements of his work that you have been inspired by?_\n\nIn terms of style and understanding, Carson's influence on me has been as polarising and negative as his own Swiss School experience was on him. Like James above, I completed my formal training before the advent of 'The End of Print'. The caption that the book contains under two identical pictures run side by side _\"...this picture was so great we had to run it twice\"_ is inspiring in it's idiocy; I use it to illustrate to my students what not finishing your studies in visual literacy will do to you.\n\nBy the same token, Jessica Helfand's foreword is the only thing worth taking seriously about 'The End of Print'.\n\n_Question 2.  \nWhat did you think of Raygun at the time? (if applicable)_\n\nUnreadable and ugly-looking hyperbole. Which makes me sound just like Massimo Vignelli talking about Emigre. The difference was, Emigre had a point – so it's possible to see their editorial design as a function of their agenda. With Carson's agenda of 'how can I make this a frustrating (or, with the Bryan Ferry spread, an _irrelevant_) experience for the viewer?' that output is not so much design as fine art posturing pretending to be something else.\n\nThere is a back story, detailed by Rudy VanderLans in Emigre No. 69 'The End', about the critical difference between Carson's earlier Beach Culture and Emigre, which might be worth reading.\n\nIt's worth noting that the review pages and the adverts in the back section of RG (i.e. those parts that the publication derived _revenue_ from) were as conventionally-designed as any other magazine of the time.\n\n_Question 3.  \nWhat do you think of the many amateur designers that try to copy his work?_\n\nSee above. In that Carson never matriculated, what's the actual distinction between him and the amateurs? If you look at the big-ticket work post RG, such as the Pepsi campaign, you'll see how amateurish he could be.\n\n_Question 4.  \nHow do you think publishing in general has changed/been influenced since Raygun?_\n\nIf this is really a question about 'publishing in general' don't talk to the (hired) hand – ask the publishers. If you mean it as a question about changes in magazine editorial design since Raygun, then arguably the design (like the English language in general), has gotten a lot more self-conscious, but actually less precise in its ability to communicate, and it's correspondingly perceived as being more disposable by its consumers.\n\nGood luck with your dissertation.\n\n"

It's really no different from other offerings in principle, such as Attik's 'Noise' series, or Tomato's 'Bareback'. It's experimentation, playing about and self-indulgent - but it's certainly not limited to a single designer.\n\nNo one has mentioned that David Carson's work was (and to an extent) still is, exciting. I think graphic design would have been poorer if he hadn't appeared on the design scene and done what he did. It got me (and I'm sure countless others) into design and injected some excitement and enthusiasm into design at the same time.\n\nI actually think that he opened the door to a lot of people in what can be a very pretentious industry, by the very fact that he didn't get into design through the perceived 'proper' route.\n\nAlthough it might sound otherwise, I'm not particularly into his way of doing things (especially the questionable legibility issue, I could never swallow the 'if you have to dechipher it, it'll sink in better' line); ultimately the fact that this question was raised shows that he's left an indelible mark on graphic design (especially mid 90s design). Things have moved on, the backlash happened (and continues), but above all I remember being blown away by the designs at the time.\n\n"

There were some really hideous Type Directors Club Annuals back in the day. But that's the problem with trends in general, they can't avoid getting diluted and kitschy after awhile.

It was a cool in-thing to have on your surfboard tabletop. David Carson was actually a collage artist (and good at it) not a publication designer. He made tone-poems with type and photo fragments. The level of communication was all about visual tactile senses, not about conveying any specific information. His work was outrageous enough to get noticed for both good and bad reasons. He was good at making typographic paintings but nowhere near as good at it as April Greiman and she also could communicate intended messages clearly.  \nHas he been an influence on me in my design work? No, not really--to me he is an artist, not a graphic designer.\n\nRaygun is a collection of Carson's printmaking art and served to make the Basel school Weingart emulators look mainstream instead of avante garde.\n\nWanabbes have always been and always will be. Eventually the talented kids grow up and become themselves. The untalented kids just find someone else to emulate fearing their own ability.\n\nPublishing has not changed because of Carson.

It's just that I quickly realized that I simply didn't work that way naturally.\n\nAs for the horror stories, some of them are true. He abandoned a yearly course after just three weeks. The students, foaming at the mouth with rage, tried demanding their money back. He's also notorious for not returning illustrators' works.\n\nAs a guy, he's actually quite amiable, mild, and smart.\n\n"

I wouldn't doubt that had a lot to do with your experience. ;)\n\n"

My interactions with him were brief, so I can't say anymore.\n\nI used to bump into him in the Art Directors Club, NY bathroom at event openings. Haven't seen him since I stopped participating in these organizations, and that's a while ago.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nAnyway, as pointed out his typography is generally bad. The Albert Watson book and the ads he did for Armani watches (if I recall correctly) were atrocious.\n\nHe also worked on the Lucent Technology commercials, where the guy is typing his thoughts out onscreen. Can't recall the typeface he used...\n\n"

I do recall that a very attractive and provacative looking women came up to him as he was about to leave the stage. She handed him her card in that oh, so, transparent way. Carson just gave her card back without hesitation--along with a cold, dismissive look.  \nHe didn't stick around for drinks and munchies.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
