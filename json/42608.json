Make sure that the Text:  \n• goes right to left in direction (Justification is another issue).  \n• is Arabic-Spaced not Latin-Spaced, and  \n3 the Language of paragraphs is also Arabic.  \nAll the Best with Flowers\n\n"

      "content": "Hello guys,  \nI need you help. I am using InDesign CS6 (ME version) and I have the following problem when importing text. Namely, whenever I am importing text in English or any other left-to-right languages the text is imported right-to-left instead. Is there any way to change this? I tried everything but I could not find the solution. It brings the whole text and pages right-to-left even though it should be left-to-right. Any suggestions? Please, I need your help. I just occasionally use Arabic for small amount of text. I was hoping the ME version will work as an ordinary one just that I will have more control over Arabic text.  \nThanks in advance!\n\n"
