I understand of course it's importance in the context of the modernist movement and that it's a well crafted piece of design.\n\nShouldn't we be over this font, especially when we can all agree of it's very limited use in contemporary typography? (no italics, small caps, old style figures, ... and not very good for signage and very poor for reading enjoyment, ...)?\n\nDo we, subconsciously, long for the “generic/inexpressive“ in design?\n\n"

Do they have the recognition and broad exposure to make film the medium of choice or is a book or magazine or Journal article the best place to portray type?\n\nWe type lovers would all rush out to see any film about type (since there have been SO many) but the cost and time to make a film means you have to find a broader audience. You can argue the case for a few other typefaces as well but Helvetica is certainly on the list for either the love or hate kinds of interest which would entice film viewing.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

This doesn't negate that Miedinger was more art director than designer, too.

Someone made a typing errror on the internet; Max Medinger was not working on any typeface design that woule become Helvetica, or anything else, in 1937. I've mentioned this before on other forums. Why do you believe it anyway?\n\nWilliam, Hoffmann was Miedinger's boss, and he commissioned the work. Miedinger drew the key characters of one or two weights for Hoffmann's approval. These typefaces were then produced by Haas. I don't know who in their design offices worked on completing the sketches. After a few years, Stempel and Linotype in Frankfurt took over the typeface, developing it into the super family that we now know as Helvetica.\n\n"
