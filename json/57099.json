  "content": "hi all,\n\nI've been having this issue with inDesign lately. I am setting a  \nparagraph left-justified, ragged right. Hyphenation is turned off,  \nand snapping to a baseline grid is turned on.\n\nInDesign will send words to the next line which I am quite certain  \nwill fit within the column measure. And there is no manual carriage  \nreturn.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions to address this?\n\nthanks much,  \njarrod\n\n",
