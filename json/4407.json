  "content": "I work on an internal magazine for a large company. The CI typeface is Frutiger. I would like to keep this typeface for headlines and pull quotes, but not for the text. I cannot find a typeface which works great together with Frutiger. Times seems to be good, but I don't want to use it. Tooooooo many magazines use Times as a text typeface in the Czech Republic and I think the use of it is very ordinary.   \n   \nI don't want something too extravagant. The typeface should be rather invisible, but elegant. It should be economical in space and legible in small size.   \n   \nThank you for any idea...\n\n",
