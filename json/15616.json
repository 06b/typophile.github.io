FontLab will ask if you want to do with the imported metrics, whether they are compatible, etc.\n\nAlternatively, you can export the font from Fontographer as a Type 1 PostScript font. When you import the suitcase file, the kerning and other metrics will come along with everything else.\n\nYet another alternative is FontLab’s new FogLamp utility which converts Fontographer files directly to FontLab VFB files, as Paul suggests.\n\nLot’s of ways to go.\n\n"
