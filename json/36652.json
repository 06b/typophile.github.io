I'm looking for a script or italic font that is decorative without being overly saccharine.

For example the 'f' could be made by flipping a second 'f' (notice the loops look symmetrical?), and editing a bit. The 'n' also seems to have been edited from something else, but the a, c and y look exactly the same to me.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
