  "content": "An Ethical Question: Is it Kosher to look at OpenType feature code of existing fonts?  \nIn my effort to learn to code assorted Opentype features, I come to the conclusion that I could learn more quickly if I were able to look at feature codes from OTF fonts. I have seen nothing in the EULAs about it and I don’t plan to copy and paste it into my own fonts. I just want to see what it looks like. This sort of thing was common in HTML code borrowing several years back as well.  \nAbove all, I don’t want to be guilty of stealing other peoples work so I am asking.\n\nChrisL\n\n",

Thomas (I think) posted a link to the feature source for Bickham Script Pro on Typophile a while back, but the page seems to have gone missing.\n\nIt's okay with me if you want to peek at the OT feature code in Proxima Nova (which I know you have). Keep in mind, though, that FontLab does not have access to the source code. The code that is put into the fonts is compiled, so it must decompile it when it opens the font. Because of this, classes will have generic, numbered names and the feature coding will not necessarily make a lot of sense to human eyes. It also may not recompile.\n\n"

I think that's extreme - as extreme as a person completely ignoring a EULA. That's all. Tiffany is a great person - but Chris seems to be inheriting one of her very few flaws! :-)\n\n\\> it never hurts to ask the foundry.\n\nWhen it's a gray area, I totally agree. When you want to get permission for something that the EULA forbids (and expect to pay $ for it) likewise. But to check that the font house doesn't actually mean something in the EULA? That seems dumb.\n\nThe key concept here is Reasonability. I feel that's what's required most in human relationships. Making more money is not a Core Value to me. So let me ask: is it reasonable to expect a type designer (especially one doing a faithful revival for example) to pay out amounts to his sources of inspiration?\\* Likewise, anybody who expects to be able to place unreasonable clauses in a business agreement and get away with it is either nuts or needs to accept that what goes around comes around. Behavior is contagious. Humans are heuristic, while formalism (i.e. a EULA) is not - with the mismatch forcing us to choose between reasonable behavior versus parasitism.\n\n\\* Never forgetting that creativity never happens in a vacuum.\n\nNeither the vagaries of commerce nor the inspirational convenience of death remove an individual's responsability to treat his fellow man reasonably. Not selfishly.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I already knew the answer. To say I was surprise is wrong. I was basically just double-checking myself. I am not a lawyer. I have no hopes of becoming a lawyer. And, I don't mind asking what could be considered stupid questions in order to get a clear answer.\n\nUntil recently, as it happens, there was a rather large foundry who's EULA did have a clause like that. I need to track down an old copy of it. But, they no longer do that.\n\nI have more flaws that that, Hrant. In fact, if that is a flaw I welcome it. As my other flaws are real flaws and need my attention more urgently.\n\nIf anything in a EULA is unreasonable, then a person who _might_ license the type has two choices. Don't license the type or call the foundry and see if there isn't another license they can purchase which would allow them to do what they need to do.\n\nOn the other hand. If anything in a EULA is unreasonable, then a person who _has already_ licensed the type has two choices. Use a different typeface or call the foundry and see if there isn't another license they can purchase which would allow them to do what they need to do.\n\nIf someone enters into a business deal signing the contract thinking they might make changes to what they think is unreasonable I think they probably deserve whatever happens. If they choose not to enter into conversation before signing and work toward a more reasonable contract then I don't see why they deserve something more reasonable after the fact.\n\nYes. _THAT_ is me being hard-nosed.

They're written for people like Tiffany - people who want to just get on and do their job, set text, embed fonts in PDFs, work from home or the road and in rare cases modify a font.\n\nSo the EULAs won't adequately deal with the type of research that Chris would like to do. Asking the designer is the most ethical answer. But opening fonts in FontLab in the privacy of your own home and not bragging about it publicly is the most common.\n\nType Designers aren't generally stupid, they know that FontLab and other tools reveal the inner-workings of their fonts, so you can't, with a straight face, claim these routines as a trade secret. No EULA is going to stop people from learning techniques in published fonts. Increasingly I think designers and foundries realize this and have become more open about sharing their ideas - this forum is a testament to that.\n\nThat's not to say a unique approach or piece of OT code isn't protectable. If you don't publish the fonts just the results (the new PLINC project might fall into this bucket) then your trade secrets could be kept secret. Likewise, say if House felt that the Ed Interlock code was novel they could try for patent protection. But I just don't think putting a \"don't look\" clause in a EULA is helpful.\n\n"

      "content": "_Ridiculous demands can be made when giving gifts, but not when the other person is paying for something._\n\nYou have this completely backwards. A gift is something freely given and shouldn't have any conditions attached. When something is purchased, a contractual relationship exists, and it is precisely within such a relationship that conditions and demands may apply. In the case of fonts, it is precisely the license terms that are being purchased. They are, in fact, what is being bought: not the bits and bytes that make up the font but the terms under which it may be used.\n\nWhy is it ridiculous for a EULA to say that using the font does not extend to decompiling it and examining the contents? Simply because tools happen to exist that enable this? Or simply because Hrant Papazian has decided that he thinks it is ridiculous?\n\nI don't have such a clause in any of my EULAs, but if I wanted to have one it would be my right to include it and your right to decline to purchase such terms of use. You have no right at all to purchase precise contractual terms and then just go ahead and take more for yourself. When what is being sold are usage rights, taking additional rights that you have not purchased is as much theft as using an unlicensed copy of a font. Digital media seems to have confused a lot of people about the nature of usage rights, but the model is really identical to that used for photography and traditional illustration. You are buying rights, not a thing that you can use however the heck you feel like using it. Tiffany's attitude is simply a normal professional one, and is not at all 'extreme'.\n\n"

The maker is under no obligation to give you any rights at all beyond those identified in law as fair use, and he can determine what rights he will license to you and at what price. You determine whether or not you are willing to pay that price.\n\nDiscussion between licensers and licensees are a really good idea, and this can and does lead to mutually beneficial, negotiated agreements or special arrangements (individualised EULAs). But it all comes back to the point of commerce at some stage: will you pay the asking price for the rights being offered. If you pay the asking price while planning to take more rights than are being offered, you are a swindler. Tiffany isn't extremist or even more than usually professional, she's just honest: she knows what she is purchasing and that she doesn't have a right to more than she is purchasing. Does that make her a freak and her actions contrary to what you have decided is 'human nature'?\n\n"

      "content": "I almost hate to jump in on this, but I will. I can't recall ever seeing a \"don't-look\" clause in a font EULA, but I might have seen a \"don't-reverse-engineer\" clause, which is much more likely to be in any kind of software EULA (such as a font). Then it's a matter of interpretation as to whether opening an OT font in FontLab and checking out the OT code constitutes reverse engineering.\n\nThat's why lawyers have jobs. Personally, I would like to say that it does not constitute reverse engineering as long as you are not trying to re-create the particular font with all of its OT behavior. But a lawyer's take may be very different.\n\nRegards,  \ntim\n\n"

I guess what I am wondering is, where original creation begins in OT feature code.\n\nAnyway, regardless of where that line may exist I hope we keep sharing code.

Special value will come from the application of astute judgement of the eye.\n\nBut I guess if the code libraries get bigger that could change in time.\n\nWhat do you think Nick?\n\n"
