  "content": "This may seem off-topic, but I turn to you, my typographic friends and colleagues, because of your general expertise and friendliness.\n\nI'm having some strange printing behavior out of some Acrobat PDFs and I'm trying to figure out what might be causing them. One is a PDF exported using default \"high quality print\" settings out of InDesign CS3, and the other is a PDF saved as a PDF out of Illustrator CS3. Both feature a background image created in Photoshop, over which text has been superimposed with a \"multiply\" compositing mode.\n\nEach file prints just fine and as expected out of its native application, InDesign and Illustrator, respectively, but printing the PDF version via Acrobat exhibits two notable problems. First is that any attempt to print more than one copy at a time hangs and/or crashes the system. The second is a very pronounced color shift toward the red. Black text takes on a reddish cast, and the background image is noticeably redder.\n\nAnyone have any ideas about what might be going on? I'm printing from Mac OS 10.4.11 to a Phaser 6350.\n\n",
