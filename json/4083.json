  "content": "There's something in Adobe Illustrator CS that drives me   \nabsolutely freakin' _NUTS_ and that's the fact that text anchor   \npoints seem to have lost their \"snap to\" ability. I hope this is just   \na setting and not due to the completely reworked type engine.   \n   \nI often have short bits of text as independent units (without text   \nbox) and used to snap the anchor point to corner or center   \npoints of objects. Now this doesn't seem to work anymore.   \nAnyone knows what happened? I've looked in the preferences   \nand couldn't find any setting that might be responsible for this.\n\n",

I use them all the time, because they tell you what you'll select and snap to (point, line, intersection, etc.).   \n   \nCmnd + U should turn them on. Although, I admit I use AI 10 at work more than CS at home, so this may not be the solution.\n\n"

      "content": "I have the impression I haven't made myself entirely clear about   \nwhat exactly I meant, so please bear with me while I try to explain   \nit in a better way. From the Illustrator Help File:   \n   \nWhen dragging objects, the Snap to Point command helps you   \nalign your cursor with anchor points and guides in the document   \nwindow. Snapping occurs when the cursor is within 2 pixels of   \nthe point or guide.   \n_Important: Snapping alignment depends on the position of the   \ncursor, not the edges of the dragged object._      \n   \nTo snap to anchor points and guides:   \n   \n1. Choose View \\> Snap to Point. A check mark indicates that   \nsnapping is turned on.   \n   \n2. Select the object you want to move.   \n   \n3. Position your cursor on the exact point you want to align with   \nanchor points and guides, and hold down the mouse button.   \n_For example, if you want to align the corner point of a rectangle   \nwith a guide, click down exactly on the corner point._      \n   \n4. Drag the object to the desired location. When your cursor   \ncomes within 2 pixels of an anchor point or guide, it snaps to   \nthe point.   \n_The pointer changes from a filled arrowhead to a hollow arrowhead   \nwhen a snap occurs._\n\n"

      "content": "Now point 3 is utter bollocks when it comes to text anchor points.   \nWhen I want to have the anchor point of the text snapping to an   \nanchor point of an object, I click the text object anchor point,   \ndrag it till it snaps to that anchor point. One would assume that   \nboth text anchor point and \"snap-to point\" are then positioned   \nperfectly on top of each other. BUT when I enlarge it appears   \nthat this is _never_ the case, even if I try at 6400%!   \n   \nIf I try it the other way round and drag an object by its anchor   \ntowards the anchor point of the independent text object, it does   \nnot snap. So this means text anchor points have completely lost   \ntheir \"magnetic\" abilities! For what reason? It worked fine and it   \nwas a really helpful feature. ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018104911im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "I did some reading on this in Adobe's forums.   \nOther people are pretty upset about it too and   \nit doesn't seem like there is much of a fix yet.   \n   \nThe way it works is that the arbitrary place in   \nwhich you click your cursor inside an object is   \nthe spot that snaps to guides, not the outside   \nbounds of the object itself. So, short of   \ngrabbing as close to the edge of an object or   \ntext unit as you can, there isn't much you can   \ndo with Snap to Guides.   \n   \nTry turning on the Snap to Grid. That is the only   \nway I could get what you are attempting to work.\n\n"
