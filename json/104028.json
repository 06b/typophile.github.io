I was completely confused because the logo uses Ubuntu which I knew and yet the characters are very different to the sample, so I didn't think that could be Ubuntu. Thanks to you now, I have discovered that the logo is using Ubuntu-title which displays many characters completely differently! Many thanks again.\n\n"
