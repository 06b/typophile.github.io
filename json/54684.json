  "content": "Hi,\n\nCan anyone help ID the script and open face fonts in the michelle/edward, praline and cheddar biscuits images? My apologies for the small images.\n\nAlso, does anyone have a list of fonts with fantastic flourishes like those in the attached image? I'm trying to gather a list of the best fonts with the best flourishes and also great ornaments as well.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nJosh\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219144916im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-6_6738.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219144916im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-2_6045.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219144916im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-3_5486.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219144916im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture-4_4916.jpg)\n\n",
