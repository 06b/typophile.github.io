      "content": "I never quote on a custom job without first asking the client a lot of questions, including:   \n   \n1. What format will the font be? If TrueType, what level of hinting is desired for screen readability?   \n   \n2. How large will the character/glyph set be?\\* [Clients sometimes can't answer this question, so I ask what languages they need to support; then I provide a suggested character/glyph set based on their needs.]   \n   \n3. Does the client want to retain exclusive use of the font? For how long? If you will eventually be able to license the font to others, what restrictions might apply (e.g. I have made fonts for software companies who were content to let me sell the fonts to anyone except companies making similar products to their own).   \n   \n   \n\\* I almost always base a quote on a glyph count. I make a spreadsheet in which I list all the glyphs that will be included in the font, and then I note how many are base glyphs and how many are composites. This provides me with an accurate count on which to quote per glyph design and hinting costs. Things like kerning and OpenType feature development can't be dealt with in the same way, of course, and need to be added on top of the per glyph costs, but this approach will give you a solid justification for your quote, and will also reduce the likelihood that you will underquote.\n\n"

      "content": "Price per glyph is good idea, but only in context of large sets, such ones John Hudson do generally. For me, generally I stick with the usual 256, in several weights.   \n   \nWhat is important to me is:   \nDoes the still will be more like a complicate stuff, such Copperplate (extrem) or basis Sanserif.   \n   \nA basic sans is more easy to design generally, compared to the copperplate where each cap is quite different, same if you have connections in case of handwriting emulation.   \n   \nI hope you see my point.   \n   \nI generally charge 10/20% for a preview of the font, the first Creative step, with several proposals generally. Then, if the client accept the concept, we go to more big budget in more secure way and trust.\n\n"

Are the character forms complex or simple. Can the work be automated in any way... and that's just digitizing the outlines.   \n   \nDo they need hinting - if you haven't done that before then don't start now.\n\n"

      "content": "Essentially, though JFP says differently, I'd just treat it like piece work - ie cost per glyph. If you reduce it to that level, whether you're doing ten characters or 1,000, you know where you're at.   \n   \nWhat you have to think about is what everyone has said above - what are the tasks you need to complete, how complex are the characters...   \n   \nOnce you have some answers, then you can think about how long each character will take, and how much you want to be paid per hour. If you say you have 100 characters to do, and they average an hour each, then multiply your hourly rate up 100 times.   \n   \nSo, you're up to $50 now. :-)   \n   \nYou may think that for two weeks work you'll settle for $35, or you may think you really need $75 - tha's your choice.   \n   \nWhat you also have to bear in mind is how much running around you may have to do, besides just drawing the characters. This could add 50% to the job.   \n   \nThe figures above are just things to think about - designing, drawing, spacing and kerning could take a day per character or more. Just scale it to where you think it fits your skills and the job at hand.\n\n"

I suppose it's more that if you sit down and quantify properly what you're going to do, then it's much easier to extrapolate the price.   \n   \nA good starting point, IMO, is the number of characters you need to do. Then other items become quite apparent.   \n   \nEven if you buy oranges by the kilo you're more interested in how many you get than anything else - so a couple of big oranges costs the same as several small ones...   \n   \nEr. :-)\n\n"
