Does this mean that, for example, if fonts were made using Windows character sets that thay may have a certain problems on Mac? Or using Mac's set on Windows?\n\nI didn't mentioned Adobe's sets, since I personaly think that OS are more relevant then \"lower\" applications in system. Correct me please if I'm wrong.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
