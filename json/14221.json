Although I’ve looked through my selection of fonts and also scanned the fonts via the Bowfin site, I’ve not identified the name of this one and would love to know about it. I did ask Mike (with Bowfin) but he was unable to ID it and suggested I come here. So, I hand this over to you kind folks for any assistance possible. Wish I had a better image, but hopefully someone will recognize the loop to the “L” along with the dotted and circled “i”\n\nThank you in advance — Suzanne\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Font Needed.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=Font%20Needed.jpg) | 7.11 KB |\n\n",
