  "content": "Does anybody have any idea of what the font is that Spin used on Haunch of Venison?\n\nIt's the main sans serif used on the overall brand, rather than the various different typefaces used for individual exhibitions etc.\n\n[http://spin.co.uk/work-by-discipline/identity/haunch-of-venison](http://web.archive.org/web/20140715070619/http:/spin.co.uk/work-by-discipline/identity/haunch-of-venison \"http://spin.co.uk/work-by-discipline/identity/haunch-of-venison\")\n\nEverything I've been looking at with those 'U's without the stem etc. etc. have straight arms (? is that the correct term?) on the uppercase 'R', but if you look closely on the vertical set type down the side of some of the posters, if you have a look at the words 'BERLIN' and 'ZURICH' it appears there is a slight curve on the 'R' there.\n\nI'm stumped!\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
