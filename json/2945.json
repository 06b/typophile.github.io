  "content": "Two years ago I created a logo for a company called Trent's Prints. The company sells artwork by Trent Altman who also has autism.   \n   \nThe company wants to build a website and make brochures, catelogs, etc. Until now the logo has been on business cards only and before alot of money is put into things I want to make the logo better.   \n   \nThe font used is Rundfunk. Adobe Garamond is used as the secondary type. My customer liked Rundfunk because it has an \"artsy\" feel. The icon is a \"T\" brushed to give a feel for what the company sells. Pms 262 is the color used for the purple and pms 241 is used for the pink.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108204435im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25389.gif)   \n   \n(The purple appears duller than it really is)\n\n",

It seems to me, that while the illustrative part of this is playful and organic the type is toooo rigid, and I'm not referring to the Vendetta, not necessarily. The rundfunk seems to call so much attention to itself (to me) that the illust. loses it's impact.   \n   \n   \nWhat about typefaces with similar bone structure, but without being \"fussy\"? Nick Shinn's [Eunoia Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108204435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/eunoia/regular/testdrive.html?s=TRENT%27S%2BPRINT%27S&p=48)? It has the same contrast as Rundfunk. You might even think about something without so much contrast.   \n   \nJust ideas.   \n   \nMore spacing in the Vendetta was a good call.   \n   \nDo you \"need\" the rule at all? It also seems to drive away from the illustration more than it helps.   \n   \nOne more thing. What if you stacked the slogan and made it a little bigger opting for the lighter weight?   \n   \nBreaking through Autism   \nwith Artistic Expression.   \n   \nI think it makes too much of a statement not to be punctuated too.\n\n"

Do you think the whitespace around the illust is uneven, could the type be moved down? Is there not enough space in between the company name and the slogan in relation to how much space you have in between the letters of the company name?   \n   \nJust thoughts.\n\n"
