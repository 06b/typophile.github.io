  "content": "Hi,\n\ni'm hoping to get some suggestions from you.\n\nContemporary Dingbats –  \nespecially loaded with nice signs (as an addition, different weights would be handy) of abstracted mobile phones, phones, email, monitors, websites, small computer devices and all those regular stuff we are surrounded by.  \nMaybe this helps you (or me, hehe); think of the style genre of Klavika, FF Max, Etelka, Neo Sans/-Tech …\n\nPure vector \"art\" suggestions (not typefaces) are welcome too.\n\nThanks a lot, t.\n\n",

The one for \"hot beverage\" has given me a hard time due to the level of detail. It's hard to get the heavy strokes that I'd like. I'll add more objects if you think it's worthwhile. \n"
