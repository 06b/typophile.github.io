Lettering on buildings is often painted by hand, either because the letters are too big to render any other way, or because they're on a surface that's only accessible to a human on a scaffold. When letters are painted this way, the painter often uses improvised or simplified letterforms rather than precisely rendered copies of a commercially-available alphabet.\n\n"

Have a look\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421210239im_/http:/www.awa.pt/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/avioes18.jpg)\n\nAlso you can see H3 on this one\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421210239im_/http:/www.awa.pt/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/avioes13.jpg)\n\nLexikos seems close enough to me, the 4 is certainly wider on the photos, and the 3 terminates in a different way, but I can live with this approximation.\n\n"
