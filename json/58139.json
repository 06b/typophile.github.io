I know the sample is rather small, but I think there are enough trademark characters to recognise the typeface.\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090522223316im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BNP-Paribas_4976.jpg)\n\n",

Not many sans faces have a Roman ’f’ like that either. (All of which, I am sure you know, and that’s why you are asking this.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
