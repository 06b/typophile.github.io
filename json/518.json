This one is for my own design company, in which I want to focus on more sophisticated, subtle (less flashy) Flash design.   \n   \nThe logotype uses ITC New Baskerville. I added the \"tti\" ligature, and altered the descender on the \"g.\" And because it has to look good on screen, I flattened the bottoms of the baseline serifs (to avoid blurry little curves). I'm not sure about my kerning, or if my modifications have broken any rules of good typographic design. Any feedback would be truly appreciated.   \n   \nNote: Please be patient if it takes some time for me to reply to your response.

      "content": "Do you really want to convey such a conservative attitude? If you do, I think Baskerville is a great choice. But you might consider livening it up, maybe by doing something with the descender of the \"g\" (noting that it's the only descender).

Try making it taper, thinner on the left, and (optically) matching the normal head serif shape on the right.   \n   \nThe dot(s) on the \"i\"(s) are too high, and maybe slightly too small.   \n   \nI think I like the \"k\", but I'm not sure.   \n   \nSpacing: Looks OK.

The image below incorporates most of your suggestions... ![mattiklogo2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12534.jpg)  \nThe result is very pleasing to me, and I just may go with this as my logotype, for I think it conveys sophistication, and the ability to use traditional elements in contemporary ways.   \n   \nI don't want to appear boring or uncreative, however, so I tried a multitude of approaches to liven it up, including many variations on the descender of the \"g\" (avoiding swashes). Everything looked contrived, and any additional element detracted from the beauty of the letterforms.   \n   \nFinally, I tried merely moving one element: the dot on the 2nd \"i\":   \n ![mattiklogo-eye](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12535.jpg)   \nThis definitely adds playfulness and interest, but I wonder if it's too cute, or if it too closely resembles another logo. I think it implies an examining eye, which is foundational to good design. It would also lend itself to a Flash treatment, which is appropriate for a designer seeking to specialize in Flash websites. But does it look good? Forgive me if this diverges too much from typography to graphic design and other considerations...   \n   \nAnyway, I'd be grateful for any additional feedback or suggestions--from you or from any others in the forums--regarding either of the above logotypes, or alternate suggestions for adding interest/distinction to my basic logotype.

A possible solution could be to move the dot slightly to the right, but I am not sure if there is enough place to do that (the dot in the centre of the counter probably wouldn't work so well). Another solution: Make the dot black. This solution makes some troubles too: what will happpen at B&W reproduction...   \n   \nA suggestion: maybe the dot could just \"jump\" towards the \"g\" but remain above it.

Yes, the very literal representation of animation in my previous version was annoying, but I thought it might lead somewhere better.   \n   \nAnd please forgive me for not catching on (lack of sleep?), but I don't think I understood Hrant's suggestion (which Tanya and Matjaz seemed to like) to leave both dots off, or the meaning of \"a secondary animated effect.\" Maybe it's to keep the \"straight\" form for print, and save playing with the dots for online animation? Or was it really to take all the dots off for print, like this?:   \n ![mattiklogo - no dots](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12588.jpg)   \nOr was something altogether different being suggested?   \n   \nI did try the \"slightly off\" idea of Matjaz, but the results of that irritated me too. (Though maybe in more skilled hands...?)   \n   \nPerhaps I'm being indulgent messing with these dots; my original intent was for a clean, simple, appealing logotype, and now I'm trying to get it to do too much. If I really want to imply animation in print, I should probably design a logo from scratch for that purpose.   \n   \nSo, unless there's a good idea I haven't explored, it seems I should just stop messing with the dots for print, and go with the straightforward version. If I can find an appropriate way online to introduce animation (and I now see several possibilities), I can do that later, and can change it more easily than the printed stuff. (But if anyone still wants to give/clarify dot suggestions, I'll of course consider them.)   \n   \nWhat I'd finally like to ask--and this is actually why I originally started this forum, so pardon the dot sidetracking--is if anyone sees any \\*typographic\\* problems remaining with the logotype. Hrant and a few friends have helped me get some of my major problems fixed, so from a purely typographic standpoint, is it good to go?   \n   \nDavid Hamuel wondered why I did the \"tti\" ligature. Maybe for any of you to evaluate what I've done, it would be good for me to show the \"raw\" type (1, below) so you can compare it with what I've done (2, below). The raw type is ITC New Baskerville, set in Illustrator with reduced tracking, but no hand kerning.

At this point I've decided to go with the design of the previously posted version 7, so all I need now is to finish the fine tuning, which I still seem to need help with. (But thanks p.j. and Emir for trying the variations.)   \n   \nHere are versions 8a and 8b, which only differ in the spacing of the \"ti\":   \n   \n ![mattiklogos 8a & 8b](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12752.jpg)   \nNow I'll address some of your points individually (but others please feel free to comment on what follows):   \n   \nHrant-- I added that hair of space to the \"ig,\" and then I reduced the foot curls on the \"t\"s (and the bottom curled serif on the \"a\" to match), and added a bit of space between the \"ti.\" 8a shows the increased space, and 8b has just a bit more space there. Which do you think is better, or do I need even more space yet? And did I create any new problems in the process?   \n   \nAlex-- I tried raising the tops of the \"t\"s, but it looked odd no matter how I did it. And I appreciate you pointing out the \"empty space\" above the second i; my clients usually say they want designs with lots of white space, so I think it's good that my logo suggests a sense of empty space.   \n   \nMatjaz-- It's really good that you spotted that fat descender on the g. When I did my initial work before my first post, I made several modifications to reduce the onscreen distortion caused by antialiasing my vector art, which was the worst in Flash. These mods were the things I felt the most insecure about presenting to typographers, and I wondered if anyone would notice. I think you're the first (in 34 posts) to mention any of this! I actually imaged that this topic of modifying type to look good onscreen with antialiasing (not a pixel font) might generate the most discussion in my thread.   \n   \nI mentioned right up front that I had changed the baseline serifs (removing their bottom \"dimples\"). The g (my more open version as well as the Baskerville) was tending to get a flat section on the bottom of the descender, and thickening it seemed to counteract this. But if it's bad typography, I want to change it. I tried to compromise with the g in version 8 (a & b) above. How does that look?   \n   \nI had the same \"flattening\" problem with the top of the \"a,\" and did a similar fattening of the stroke. But after the scrutiny inspired by your observation, I tried to thin that back up in this last version (above), although the letterform is still somewhat different in an attempt to reduce its antialias mess.   \n   \nHere's a comparison of how Flash rendered the outlines of the raw Baskerville \"a\" and my new compromise \"a\":   \n ![\"a\"s in Flash](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12753.jpg)   \nBut the logo will also appear in print, so I don't want to do anything too weird in compensating for antialias distortion. So, I'm hoping my new \"a\" stands on its own as a halfway decent letterform. Please look at the two \"a\"s enlarged (below), and let me know what you think:   \n ![enlarged \"a\"s](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12754.jpg)   \n   \nWell, everyone, thanks again for your help.

So try importing your logo into Fontogapher or FontLab (preferably the latter) and outputting a TT font. Even though it won't be a \"native\" TT font (something that can only be done manually), from my experience it still renders better.   \n   \n\\> How can I avoid the distorting consequences of antialising?   \n   \nJust to be clear, anti-aliasing isn't your problem. Anti-aliasing is good for you! :-) The problem is how Flash distorts outlines, especially cubic beziers.   \n   \n\\> I've already devoted so much time to it, that at this point I'll just settle for something that isn't ugly   \n   \nHeh heh heh. Now try making a whole font. :-\\>   \n   \nBut really, I think you're doing very well! It's nice to see such nit-picking.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Here're 3 tweaks of version 9, each with an increasingly larger s (original not shown):   \n ![mattiklogo-9abc](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417165545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/12798.jpg)   \nDo any of these seem right on? If not please direct as to larger/smaller. This was my first-ever attempt at reproportioning an entire letter, so I hope I did okay.   \n   \nOnce the s is fixed, it should be about done, don't you think?   \n   \nAs for the distortion of outlines: Wow, quadratic beziers? I think I missed that math class. To try your suggestion, I downloaded a trial version of Fontlab, but a half hour of tinkering in this unfamiliar interface got me nowhere. Just so I know I'm aiming at the right result, please clarify: Were you suggesting that I cut and paste the complete outlined Illustrator logotype right into a Fontlab character/glyph workspace window, and then export the whole thing as a TrueType font? ...And then in Flash (Fireworks, etc.) when I type the appropriate key in my new font, the whole logo would appear? This is so new and bizarre to me. (And if I can't do it with the trial version, I'll have to skip it altogether.) I may have to save this for down the road.   \n   \nWell, as soon as I get these final tweaks done, I can move on to deciding on a color. In your opinion, is it appropriate to ask for feedback on color in this forum/thread?   \n   \nGratefully,   \nJim M\n\n"

Anyway, I was impressed not only by your effort on my behalf (must have taken some time!), but also by the interesting evolution you fleshed out.

(And incidentally, when I previously tried the \"ik\" serif linking, which seemed like a natural, it unfortunately produced some undesirable side effects.)   \n   \nNext, Ly responded to Dmitry's suggested changes to _version 1_ by writing that \"Now it feels like a logo.\" Compared to which version, and why?   \n   \nAny clarification from either of you would be appreciated, especially if it can be applied to the final version.
