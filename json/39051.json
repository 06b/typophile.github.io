  "content": "Hello,  \nI have a client who is looking to redesign their collateral. Currently they use Gill Sans as a text face and a modified version of [Ottomat](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109034121/http:/www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?POttBk.html) (set at a loose tracking of 50+). The current design is sparce and polite, safe and conservative.\n\nRecently, my client realised that they need to appeal to a younger market, and so have requested a redesign. Trouble is, the organisation is a part of a larger state government body, which has just gone through a design process and allocated Palatino LT as body copy (very office-like).\n\nSo with Palatino LT as a starting point, I need to develop a typography that achieves the following:  \n1. Allows the expression of emotions - tourism is motivational  \n2. Is attention grabbing and has an interesting cut  \n3. Is slightly feminine (but not girly)  \n4. Is sophisticated to reflect a sense of style  \n5. Is legible  \n6. Has the ability to work in complex tables and cartography  \n7. Works as a display face to introduce sections\n\nThe typography can be made up of a series of typefaces with a similar theme, not just a large single family (ala Clan).\n\nFonts I have been looking at to date include:  \nPriva, Parry & Parry Grotesque, Dolly, Stag, Fling.\n\nI am going blind, racking up a great font library and not really getting any closer to a solution. I'd love to get something designed, but budget and time don't allow it.\n\nAny suggestions???  \nThanks in advance.  \nJason.\n\n",
