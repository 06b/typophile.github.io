I have the Image Club Letterpress 5.0 and 6.0 Collections, bought before Image Club was acquired by Adobe, then sold to Getty Images/Eyewire, then acquired by Agfa-Monotype.   \n   \nAs for you being a 'newbie' Adriano, this is a field were the old-timers have maybe only been here for 15 years, things change so fast. I got my first Image Club catalog back about then, and bought my first fonts in 1993 starting with one of the earlier Letterpress CD's (3.0, I think). Just like so many other trendy things, 'everything old is new again' with fonts too. When House Industries gets to digitizing the Photo-Lettering typefaces they recently acquired, we'll all get to see how true that saying is.\n\n"

Here's a bit of historical information about the first Letterpress (and ICG type library) - when it was first released, it consisted of twice the number of fonts that currently existed in the Adobe Type Library at the time. Mind you, they were all type three PostScript format, but....   \n   \nI know I've only been hanging around the type business for 15 years or so, but I definitely feel like an old-timer.\n\n"
