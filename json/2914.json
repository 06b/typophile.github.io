The original Bookman Italic had a slanted roman lowercase, not the cursive italic of the ITC version. This is the biggest difference between the two. There are also a lot of other less obvious differences.\n\n"

(Supposedly, Castcrafters did one, but it's apparently no longer available. Bitstream has a version, but no swashes and no Bold or Bold Italic.) It's not exactly fashionable, but it's an historically significant face.\n\n"
