The sample on the left is the second-class marking on Polish railway carriages. On the right is a building number in London. I can see these are different faces from the different way the down stroke meets the bottom stroke, something which cannot be seen in Jenna’s sample. I’m imagining a lot of customising work has been done to that, if it isn’t in fact drawn from scratch. I’m hoping mine might be more recognisable.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406025820im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2two_5462.jpg)\n\n"
