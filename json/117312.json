  "content": "I have encountered an anomaly in a PDF generated through the ExamView (8.1) application software: the font, Times New Roman MT Pro has \"00\" appended to the beginning of the Postscript name (id '6') as in the picture.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414232827im_/http:/typophile.com/files/samplePDF_3822.jpg)\n\nThe fonts were subset by default in the application software.\n\nThere does not appear to be any negative impact on the files but I would like to know if this is likely to have a knock-on effect in our production workflow using these files. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
