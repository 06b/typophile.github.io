  "content": "Hi peeps, I've put together a small TextMate bundle ( [TextMate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420210020/http:/macromates.com/) is a text editor for Mac OSX). This should give some syntax highlighting and a couple of snippets to make editing .fea files a bit more pleasurable.\n\nYou can grab it here: [Typeface development Bundle for TextMate](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420210020/http:/www.lowest-common-denominator.com/2007/03/typeface_development_bundle_fo.php)\n\nLet me know if it makes your computer explode or if I've missed something obvious.\n\n",
