Nobody and i mean NOBODY has ever bought a single weight. am i completely off my game here or something?\n\nnot really looking for tactical tips, such as \"i would do this,\" just wondring what folks' general feeling might be.\n\nthanks!\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pretty/commodity/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419081718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/pretty/commodity/)\n\n",

At least you finished and released yours!\n\nThat said, one thing about minimalist, geometric faces is that there are many, many variations out there at this point... Saturation might be one reason no one has purchased a copy so far... Or maybe this collection is not different enough, to the untrained eye, from other, similar faces, such as (to give but one example) Die Typonauten's [Nautilo Font System](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419081718/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typonauten/nautilo-font-system/).\n\n"

So the release timing wasn't ideal in that sense. Did you promote it? Also, what has been said about it being a crowded market for this kind of thing is true. Nautilo Font System is a solid example. I like yours a bit better but the point is valid all the same. Ricardo, Nice one.\n\nAt the risk of being insensitive myself - in some ways though - either it sells or not. You can work on it some more I suppose, or make the next font. Surely making the next one is sweeter. No?\n\nMy 1st reaction is some of it is tastier than other bits - that is to say it isn't equally good all the way through I think. Similarly I think the italic is more neat-o than the roman. But, do you just want a general reaction sort of thing or...? I have to admit I am not sure what you want to get out of this.\n\nBut maybe I am missing the point.\n\n"

Patrick are you serious?  \nYou asked for an opinion, Clauses gave you an honest one- a well thought out opinion free of sarcasm.\n\nMy opinion is just as well thought out, but much more to the point:  \nThe fonts you've designed are ugly and expensive for what they are. Tho, the metrics look far better than a 'free font'.\n\nI find it telling that even less successful or novice designers come to typophile asking \"give me your toughest\" or \"let me have it\" whereas polite but direct criticism sets you off. Your being so quick to be offended is counterproductive to your growth as a type designer. I think you know what good design is. The Pentagram website is certainly very good. I also had a gander at the PDF of the House of Pretty portfolio- very well done. Interestingly, I did not see any of your fonts in use there. And why is that Patrick?...\n\nI know you are not asking for a specific course of action but I'm gonna give it to you anyway:\n\n-drop the price of all your fonts to 9.99 or less\n\n-make a pdf showing the repertoire and usage examples (like house industries does with their fonts in their print catalogs). Use colorful and playful graphics so we can see the potential.\n\n- change the icon/preview on myfonts site to reflect that- it will spark more interest\n\n- put the fonts on sale too and you _will_ get customers fast\n\nBefore you let _me_ have it, I understand your work is personal to you and should be but, use our honesty to your advantage.

      "content": "Patric: Whether you agree with what's been posted or not, you are receiving some extremely valuable feedback here.\n\nI can't really say I find Commodity appealing, but then again I don't find any fonts in this classification/genre appealing so I do not count. I can see how those who appreciate this kind of type would find it attractive so I don't believe you created the e-coli of the typography world. However, after reading your posts carefully I was able to pick up on a few things which I'll run past you now and let you determine what they are worth. And these things have nothing to do with the actual font itself.\n\n1.) Stripped to its core, selling is all about convincing. However, the bottom line is I'd neither seen nor even heard of \"Commodity\" until now. That said, I really couldn't be convinced to buy it then now could I? It's your job to both alert me of the font's existence AND convince me to buy it somehow. (By 'me' I mean ordinary people in general). I'd previously heard of \"House of Pretty,\" a name I actually like very much. It's just not a name I've heard on a routine basis, if more than once or twice in my life. PROMOTE!\n\n2.) All of your flags on myfonts.com are left-hook red (view: [http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/pretty/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419081718/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/pretty/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/pretty/\")). Not only is red a color you want to avoid when attempting to win people over, in one's initial, 1.3-second glance it makes all your fonts look exactly the same. Which then means a person's immediate (and perhaps subconscious) impression is you lack a capacity or desire to be flexible. So not only has red turned \"me\" off, you better hope I liked something about whatever font I did look at first because I'm almost immediately going to assign my initial impression to the remaining four I did not peruse. Sadly, that also goes for if I didn't like the first one I saw. In this case, three of the five require more than just a casual glance to realize they're not identical. Obviously this is not the be-all and end-all of your stated problem, but I can't imagine it being an advantage.\n\nOn the other hand, if you mix up the view of the flags a bit, use some blues and transparencies and treat it as though you are using your font to promote something other than your font, you will win more of those critical initial moments of impression than you'll lose. And I thought Mike Diaz's suggestions, specifically his second one, were outstanding.\n\n3.) What struck me most in your posts was something with which I also have extreme difficulty; that being, just because you \"love\" your font doesn't mean everyone will, or should. To me it sounds as though you designed at least this font - if not more - solely for what YOU find appealing. When it comes to living life, it's the only way to go. Making money, on the other hand, is quite different.\n\nIs this approach a crime? Of course not. However, when you unload on someone providing an honest opinion on your work, your interest in pleasing yourself rather than making money resounds like a cannon. Design of all kinds, regardless of the arena, is a see-saw struggle between remaining 100 percent true to your own appreciations and principles and receiving a consistent stream of financial reward.\n\nWhile I admire and appreciate self-confidence and self-assurance, I find self-awareness to be a far more valuable trait.\n\nFor whatever this was worth ...\n\n"

I have zero guess of the ACTUAL reason this font has yet to be purchased; in fact no one ever will know for certain. However, there seem to be all kinds of little things you could do to improve the chances of it being sold at this price, and in this same version.\n\nFor example, I mentioned those blinding red flags displaying your fonts on the myfonts.com site, which you used for Commodity as well.\n\nI must say I have looked far and wide and still have not encountered a single rule or law preventing you from taking a digital camera out to the more trendy, populated spots where you live and taking a picture of the biggest billboard you can find. After which you could - via Photoshop - erase the entire contents of the billboard and come up with your own fictional company . . . which just so happens to use your typeface as the center of its image. Once finished you then could size, display and/or distribute the finished product in the manner you find most appropriate or effective.\n\nWhile such a thing probably wouldn't be striking being displayed in the size of a myfonts.com flag, I think you get the idea I'm trying to get across here. Perhaps you could use an especially striking store window, or whatever . . . anything that would not cross infringement lines. For that matter you could find an empty billboard or window of a failed business somewhere and use those.\n\nObviously this would require some functional knowledge of Photoshop or other similar program, but not an obscene amount. What I think this does is places your typeface in a more recognizable, impressive light because, for all intents and purposes, \"Commodity\" - to many people - actually would be a typeface businesses use on billboards, etc. . . . which to them automatically makes it great. There are tons of people out there who don't buy things because they don't trust their own assessment abilities or even their own taste; confirmation for them could come easy just by seeing someone really important likes your font too.\n\nThe truth is there aren't an overflow of people who would go check out whether or not your pseudo-business existed, especially if it's a billboard in Europe or the front of some insanely expensive technology store, etc. And even if someone did cry foul, you simply explain that you display these images to give potential clients the best view possible of how your typeface would look in situations that client may one day face. I just don't believe it would be fair to consider such a tactic unethical under any circumstances barring any potential copyright violations; it's actually done all the time with proposals for corporate stationery and so forth . . . you'd just be doing it in a little different way.\n\nBesides, it wouldn't surprise me in the least to learn that some of the industry's larger and more ff-famous vendors are similarly creative in various ways. But this is just one of countless little tweaks that you could consider not just for this font, but anything really. I know at least in my case, had your font been presented in a way similar to that described above, my initial interest in it would have been much greater.\n\n"

Just because it doesn’t sell is no reason to yank it entirely. Try dropping the price so that at least you’re competing with other designs of the style; if nothing else you could sell the fonts for $10 and the family at a steep discount and it might be a nice option for students who want to explore Dutch geometric type designs. Even that would be better than just burying it.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that you can think of plenty of uses, so why not put together some nice specimens, make a PDF, and give it a web site?

Under most circumstances, it’s considered unethical to lie.\"\n\nThere is absolutely nothing untrue about such a thing; it isn't like you're saying you HAVE done the typography for the law firm \"Dewey, Cheatham and Howe,\" or even that it exists. All you'd be doing is giving potential clients and buyers a view of how their particular project might look on a billboard, in a brochure, whatever. Anything a potential client or buyer might assume on his or her own is his or her own problem. And like I said, if one were to inquire about something, what you've created solely was to provide visual possibilities. There's simply no need to say all of your visual samples are of fictional businesses or places unless someone asks. In the meantime, those who only need that extra little push into buying something and don't care about anything but how the typeface will work for them have in whatever strange way had their tastes confirmed. Again, this is speaking in nothing but general terms.\n\nAs for having an agenda . . . do I really? Wow, I better get started on that agenda right away. Now if you could only tell me what that agenda is (since you seem to know), I'll certainly give it my very best effort.\n\nPatric earlier asked about the color red. In most design settings, the color red is a dominant, aggressive color and usually only works well when you use is to magnify the color itself and not anything it might be enhancing, be it words or anything else for that matter. In fact, when I first looked at your groups of flags on myfonts.com, I didn't even see the fonts for what they were, I just saw a boatload of red ... the color itself had consumed my initial attention and made the fonts secondary. Red - especially such a vibrant shade of it - is a dangerous color for design.\n\nAnd in human terms, colors like blue, grey, and even most greens, when worn or used in homes, etc., are considered far more friendly and inviting than is red. Rarely will you ever see anyone employing lots of dominant reds on much of anything because almost immediately just the sight of it will take away much wanted attention from everything around it - whether it be clothes on your body or curtains in your home. This all goes back to what reactive human eye interprets first and how much attention the mind gives it. It's pretty much a universal mantra ... you know, kind of like \"painting the town red.\" You never hear of anyone painting the town blue or some dark eggshell tone.\n\n"

I always thought the circle with the arrow represented female but I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nOne of the great things about typography also is perhaps the very best thing about newspaper design: if you have a bad night, you almost always get another chance tomorrow. This is your typeface and you can make whatever improvements you want for the rest of your life. Maybe setting it aside for a few months and working on that Christmas script right now would be beneficial.

It kind of traces back to the old chicken and egg debate, really.\n\nIn order for a potential client to know what kind of image would be projected of their business by using your typeface (generally speaking, not necessarily Commodity), presenting images such as the one above is the most effective way of doing so. Otherwise you're talking about a lot of people spending lots of money to use a typeface without having any idea of what it might look like on a billboard. Well, if I've never had one of my typefaces on a billboard, that client almost would be forced to rely on God's good humor because he or she certainly wouldn't have had any form of visual representation on which to rely . . . other than some spec sheets perhaps. And if they make specific inquiries about the billboard itself, then by all means a designer could and likely must explain it was just a visual example of the font's possibilities.\n\nKeep in mind this is merely one of literally thousands of promotional techniques, and isn't something a designer should rely on exclusively - or even very often. I was just providing an example of various angles and approaches you could take to framing and presenting your work a bit differently.\n\n"

While perhaps not being the most forthcoming thing on Earth, I certainly didn't feel like some sort of devious schemer when I wrote it.\n\nBeyond dropping a not-so-subtle hint, I cannot think of a single other thing you could believe I was trying to accomplish. Seriously, if I really was attempting to be cryptic in an effective way, it would have been a lousy attempt because you seemed to pick up on it right away. If I ever do have some sort of \"agenda,\" I assure you I would never make it quite so easy to detect, much less even suspect. I'm starting to wonder if I need to take myself behind the woodshed and give myself a whippin' or something.\n\n"

Commodity does not surprise me, does not excite me. and by its selling history, it might not be exciting others as well.\n\nRevenant has personality, reminds me of Eurostile, but rather bolder, more streamlined, you can almost see a defined aggressive character in it. Fast Girls has it with its slashed computer-savvy roundness (a rounded sister to that old Chicago font for the first macs, which was a lovely mistake of a font), Smile has it with its geometrically-disturbed guts brings memories of Buro Destruct typeness. Commodity lacks that character your other fonts have.\n\nthis is not a harsh critic, it is an opinion. you have very good intense fonts. kudos and keep it going.\n\n--  \nargonaut | sans faux pas\n\n"
