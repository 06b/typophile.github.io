Starting out with typographic  \nprintmaking and the making of artists’ books, his open-minded  \napproach to what the field of graphics might involve has since led  \nhim through the construction of three-dimensional typographic  \ninterior spaces and now into the area of moving image and the  \ndevelopment of television title sequences.\n\nAs well as commercial projects for clients including Moschino, BBC  \nand the European Union, Peter Anderson’s work can be found in the  \nTate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Museum of Modern  \nArt, New York.\n\nHis work has also branched out into grand scale commissions,  \nincluding an installation of poles around the perimeter of the island  \nof St Lucia for the St Lucia Fine Art gallery; a series of  \ninstallations for Puma Sportswear in London; and both interior design  \nand installations for Paul and Jeanne Rankin’s series of Belfast  \nrestaurants. He is currently exploring the graphic use of large scale  \nlight sculptures in the branding for Altnagelvin Hospital in  \nLondonderry, Northern Ireland.\n\nCurrent television projects (mainly for title sequences) include: The  \nWhistleblowers (ITV1), The Castleford Project (Channel 4), Five Days  \n( BBC 1) and Primeval (ITV1). He contributed to The new hand made  \ngraphics (Rotovision), a publication which significantly increased  \npublic awareness of his work and for which is he is still best known.  \nFinally, for his sins, he is preferred design partner at EMI records;  \nweb projects range from Genesis and Pink Floyd to the current Spice  \nGirls reunion site.  \nImage by Peter Anderson\n\nPeter Anderson is the Director of the art/design studio Peter  \nAnderson Studio Ltd.
