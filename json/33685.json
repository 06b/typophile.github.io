  "content": "I am a design student currently writting a paper on Howard Gardiner and his multiple intelligences theory. While information regarding this theories usage in academic education is abundent, information on its influence on art and design education is not so plentifull.  \nHopefully this paper will build into my final year project in which I hope to design several booklets detailling each intelligence. I am not sure what audience this will be aimed at as of yet, ideally the design community.  \nWhat I really need are sources containing alternative treatments of the seven intelligences (spatial, linguistic, musical, mathematical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, bodily kinesthetic, and perhaps the eight alternative, naturalistic.) Have any other designers attempted to visually communicate this information?  \nAny help is greatly appreciated,  \nsara\n\n [‹ comma sutra](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180019/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33691 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [{ ? } - How to make a 'one-click-installs-all' fontfamily ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007180019/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30370 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
