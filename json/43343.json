Since the media kits won’t be here in time we want to just buy around 25-50 nice boxes online for a temporary solution. Does anyone know where to buy a “cool” box online?\n\nThanks!  \nMike\n\n [‹ Design and type conventions](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828113955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43346 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Interstate -vs- FHWA ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828113955/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14244 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
