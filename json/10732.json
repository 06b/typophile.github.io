I have a photocopy of the article somewhere in my \"type closet\"... Those little dots are basically very crude traps. But apparently they worked well at a certain size, on 70s TV (blurrier than today's TV). Anyway, it's nice to have an on-line reference.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Looks like they took a slightly   \ncondensed Helvetica and subjected it to some primitive   \nform of ink/light trapping with the same trap shape used   \non any problem area, no matter the angle.
