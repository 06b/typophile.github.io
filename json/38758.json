  "content": "I thought this would probably be the most logical place to post this.\n\nI'm looking for typefaces, preferably sans serifs, which have (in your opinion) nice/beautiful numbers. I need to typeset a project which will consist mainly of large (i.e. display sizes) pairs of numbers on the page, supported by minimal graphics. It's basically going to be a typographically based infographic.\n\nSo, sans serif, oldstyle, lining or both, all welcome.  \nI was thinking about numbers like Akzidenz Grotesk has, those have a pleasant quirky feel to them, without getting too playful. I could use those, but I always like to see some alternatives before I decide. Especially since the numbers are going to be playing the lead role.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

Any typeface designed for use in really small sizes is bound to have nifty numerals as well, like [Doric](http://web.archive.org/web/20141124153111/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/doric_std_ot_virtual/?sample_text=0%201%202%203%204%205%206%207%208%209&sample_size=24) for example.\n\n"
