The center of activity for TypeCon2008, the Hyatt is in a terrific central location near to the main workshop venue, dining, and nightlife.\n\nThe Buffalo Hyatt Regency has just installed the wonderful Grand Beds we enjoyed so much in Boston. The Hyatt has plenty of space for us, an inviting restaurant and lounge in the atrium, an award-winning steakhouse on the premises, fitness center, and many other amenities.\n\nThe Hyatt Regency is offering TypeCon2008 attendees an incredible rate on rooms! Instead of the $124 per night rate previously announced, we have negotiated an even better deal for TypeCon2008 attendees - just $109 (plus taxes) per night for single/double rooms. This is an amazing bargain in Buffalo during the height of summer, and the hotel will be completely sold out during TypeCon2008.\n\nBook your room ASAP - the special TypeCon2008 attendee rate is available until June 18, 2008, or until our room block fills, whichever comes first. We always fill our room block fast, and demand is higher than ever this year. Book now to avoid disappointment.\n\nTo book online with your credit card, please visit this link:\n\n[http://buffalo.hyatt.com/groupbooking/buffasota2008](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055132/http:/buffalo.hyatt.com/groupbooking/buffasota2008 \"http://buffalo.hyatt.com/groupbooking/buffasota2008\")\n\nEnter your travel dates in the “Find Rooms and Rates” section, and enter G-SOTA in the field calling for Group/Corporate #.
