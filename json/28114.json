Some close matches have been Concorde and Century.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [the\\_bollocks.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140121011953/http:/typophile.com/files/the_bollocks.jpg) | 64.69 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Miss Tiffany, I don't think that E&F CBC is really too close, but Keith, Jamie Reid designed all the Pistols stuff and he did a lot of it with Letterpress work too. I think more than font matching in this instance, what you need is the ability to transform the idea to your situation and that is why it worked for Mr. Reid. Jamie Reid allegedly wrote most of the Lyrics for them too!  \nMy goodness 30 years and I am no longer who I was then, thank God(:!  \nThe best song they ever did was \"Satalite\", which did not make it on that album, but I had the bootleg for years!\n\nThe Truth shall set you free\n\n"
