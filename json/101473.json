I am curently working on a type project that requires technical knowledge that I currently lack. Maybe some of you guys can enlighten me.\n\nI'm in the process of creating a typeface but I'd like to find a way for the typeface to react to the content.\n\nFor example, the 5th occurences of each letter in a text or sentence will have a differently drawn glyph then other letters, so if the user writes this sentence : \"Are those shy Eurasian footwear, cowboy chaps, or jolly earthmoving headgear?\" the ''a'' from ''chaps'' and the second ''o'' from ''cowboy'' will use a different glyph then the stantard one because they appeared at the 5th occurences.\n\nI though something like that could be done with the opentype feature that detect if glyphs requires ligatures or not.  \nI searched on several others typographic ressources over the web and on softwares such as Fontographer or Glyph but I could'nt find anything relevant.\n\nIf anyone knows a way to do something like this or can propose a software that could help me produce such a thing that would be really awesome.\n\nThanks\n\nCharles\n\n( please forgive my bad grammar, english is not my native language)\n\n",
