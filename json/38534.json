  "content": "\"Font embedding\" is coming back to the web! The latest build of WebKit (used by Safari) has it, Opera is expected to follow. But the way they use it is by just linking a regular font file, which has to be placed somewhere on the internet, so everyone can download it.  \nOf course that doesn't go well with commercial fonts.\n\nSo I set up a Proof of Concept to show a way to secure\\* a font used with the font-face command. Just download the [latest version](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/nightly.webkit.org/builds/overview/feature-branch) of Safari and open this page:  \n [http://www.fonts.info/webfonts/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/www.fonts.info/webfonts/ \"http://www.fonts.info/webfonts/\")\n\nYou should see two \"embedded\" fonts. The first is protected\\*, the second is not. Feel free to try to download Kaffeesatz. I won't explain how the protection works, but it uses several layers of protection. It is set up in a way, where the font would reside on the foundry's server and a remote, licensed website can use the font by adding a little snippet of code to its template.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bild3_4933.jpg)\n\n\\* So it's absolutely safe? No! Everything you see in your browser window was already downloaded to you machine. There is no real protection for anything that is on the web.\n\n",

      "content": "<cite>Yea, it’s really easy to download the font: visit page in firefox</cite>\n\nTrue. But it's an easy fix to prevent this in a future version. The point of this script is to have a system where a licensed website would get access to the font on the foundry's server, but access from other sites and direct downloads would be prevented. This can be done. I just don't have all the neccessary features and levels of protections in it yet.\n\nBut 4thfebruary is also right. Once you access a licensed site the font will end up in your browser cache where it can extracted. And this will always be the case.  \nBut still: Should we stop the iTunes music store because people know how to rip an DRM-protected song?\n\n"

The people viewing the page on the web which utilizes the font, who are not the people who licensed the font, are not prevented from seeing the font at all. If the technique required site visitors to have an account or type in a password or some other nonsense, I could see your point.\n\nIn any case, what legitimate reason would anyone have to extract fonts from a cache (other than to demonstrate that there's a security hole)?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for this Ralf.\n\nI also was wondering if you could somehow secure a css file that contains information about a font to be safe on an EULA's side (e.g. <cite>\"Embedding of the XXX Font-Software into electronic documents or internet pages is only permitted in a secured read-only mode. The Licensee must ensure that recipients of electronic documents or internet pages cannot extract the XXX Font-Software from such documents or use the embedded XXX Font-Software for editing purposes or for the creation of new documents.\"</cite>).\n\nCan anyone actually ensure that no one will eventually extract anything from even a super-protected file? I don't think so. Why such a statement then?\n\nBack to the topic, your solution seems enough \"protection\" for most users who browse websites. As stated many times before, one shouldn't really count in pirates who would steal/wouldn't buy anyway. The question is if font vendors see it as an enough secure embedding on the internet?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [AL](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/www.lenart.pl/) [▪](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/www.lenart.pl/news) [▪](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/www.lenart.pl/work) [▪](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/www.lenart.pl/about) [▪](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420094053/http:/www.lenart.pl/contact)\n\n"
