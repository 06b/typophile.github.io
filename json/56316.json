Even though many browsers still do not support @font-face AND many foundries won't allow it, I think it would be useful. And I hate to get complicated, but can you copy/paste the information from the foundries EULA which states the accord?\n\nI'll start:\n\nFoundry: exljbris  \nQuote: You may use this font for Font-Face embedding, but only if you put a link to [www.exljbris.nl](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228172107/http:/www.exljbris.nl/ \"www.exljbris.nl\") on your page and/or put this notice /\\* A font by Jos Buivenga (exljbris) -\\> [www.exljbris.nl](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228172107/http:/www.exljbris.nl/ \"www.exljbris.nl\") \\*/ in your CSS file as near as possible to the piece of code that declares the Font-Face embedding of this font.\n\n",

      "content": "Great idea...\n\nAre you only interested in foundries that support both, or is this an either/or question. Also licenses may be hard to understand - but FAQ's not so much.\n\nH&FJ case in point (for both points)...\n\n<cite>What's involved in using fonts on websites?</cite>\n\nHTML doesn't offer any way to force a web page to render itself in a typeface that the viewer doesn't have, but fonts can be used to create different kinds of images:\n\n— Bitmap graphics (gif, jpg, png) There's no difference between using a font to create a printed page and using it to create a pixellated image. As long as the person creating the images has licensed the fonts, no additional license is needed.\n\n— Vector art (swf) Because Flash files embed actual portions of a font's sourcecode within themselves, our font licenses require that designers observe some basic safety precautions when publishing Flash files. Text in Flash files must be static (not dynamic), the files must embed only a subset of the character set, and the \"Protect from Import\" option must be enabled when the files are generated.\n\n— sIFR (Scalable Inman Flash Replacement) sIFR is a great technology that brings rich typography to the web through a combination of Javascript, CSS and Flash. To use an H&FJ font with sIFR, purchase an additional single-computer font license for the webserver itself, and then configure sIFR's customize\\_me.as file in two ways to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the system: first, set the allowedDomains array to include only the domain of your website (instead of \"\\*\"), and then set allowlocal to \"false\" before publishing the .swf to the web.\n\nThe emerging @font-face tag within Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) will hopefully lead to a secure technology that allows fonts to be used in web pages. But at this time, no such security measures exist, so the use of this tag with our fonts constitutes the illegal distribution of the font software. This type of use is therefore specifically prohibited under our End-User License Agreement.\n\nIf you are exploring other technologies that aren't covered here, please contact us at [info@typography.com](mailto:info@typography.com).\n\nVia [http://www.typography.com/ask/faq.php?faqID=15#Faq\\_15](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228172107/http:/www.typography.com/ask/faq.php?faqID=15#Faq_15 \"http://www.typography.com/ask/faq.php?faqID=15#Faq\\_15\")\n\n"

Phinney): <cite>Our current license terms allow for EOT usage (with a URL binding). Our license terms do not allow font linking to original format font files. </cite>\n\n**Alternative technologies (like Typeface.js, Cufón)**  \nWould be interesting to hear about those from the foundries, but current EULAs don't mention any of those technologies.

That means fonts with a foundry’s names trademarks on the outside and a bunch of degraded letters, bad OT code, and bad naming tables on the inside (similar to the bad pirate fonts that appear to have come from Flash files).
