We always get a HUGE spike on hits supposedly from here because both UUNET and AOL are here in Fairfax County Virginia (5 miles from me). The trouble is, there are boatloads of people from all over the USA using AOL and generating an Eastern Timezone IP even if they are from Alaska. I'll bet if you totalled all the Eastern Time hits and subtracted non-eastern AOL and UUNET IPs, you would get a much smaller number.   \n   \nChrisL   \nPS: Either that or us easterners spend too much time online:-)\n\n"
