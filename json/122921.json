  "content": "Our company owns licenses for the Frutiger family through Monotype. We would like to convert our Frutiger font files to the .fnt file format. The .fnt file format can be used by an engraving machine we've purchased to produce facility signage.\n\nWe've come to an agreement with Monotype for a custom license that allows the conversion.\n\nHowever, Monotype no longer has the capability to complete the conversion to .fnt. We need a separate font company to assist in the file conversions and any necessary font adjustments.\n\nAny suggestions for groups that we might approach for this effort?\n\nI've reached out to some of the more well-known foundries. So far the responses are not good. No one is equipped for .fnt creation.\n\nI understand that the .fnt format is archaic, but it's the only format the engraver will support.\n\nI would appreciate any insight on this topic!\n\n",

Could it be the Windows 3.0 \"bitmapped\" type, as used as a rendering cache to quickly display monochrome fonts? (I know -- the latter doesn't really rhyme with 'engraving', but perhaps the machine's manufacturor chose this file format because it's a fairly simple one.)\n\n"
