  "content": "Hi,\n\nI have been drawing sketches of typefaces for a long time and I would like to learn to turn my ideas into digital fonts. I currently own a laptop running Ubuntu. I haven’t searched seriously, but I doubt there a lot of interesting tools for typographical design on Linux. (Prove me wrong if you wish!)\n\nSo I am considering getting a new mac. My question is this: what components of the computer should I consider for the specific task of designing typography? For example,\n\n- Does designing a typeface on a laptop somehow affects the working habits of a designer?  \n- Is a large screen essential to perform this task? Can you get away with a 15” or 12” screen?  \n- Are the type-design softwares typically hungry for RAM or processor speed?\n\nSo basically, I am asking for advice to put together a nice and effective workstation for type design.\n\nThanks!\n\nCh.\n\n [‹ I hate computers](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202192545/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37156 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Calgary: September meeting ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202192545/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36895 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m a laptop user for lyfe because I spend most of my waking hours on the computer and like to have the freedom to move around.\n\n- I use a 15” macbook. I have a large dual monitor setup but rarely use it for type design work.\n\n- My macbook only has 512mb of RAM right now and it’s perfectly fine for running the 2 programs I use - illustrator and fontlab studio.\n\nIf you do get a mac for the love of all things holy, GET THE 3 YEAR APPLECARE!\n\n"

      "content": "Like Dan, I keep my Macbook plugged into a 19” LCD most of the time. I feel like no matter what kind of design I’m doing, it’s just a lot easier on a big, hi-res screen.\n\nAs far as performance goes, none of the popular font applications need too much RAM, and with all of Apple’s systems selling with at least a gigabyte of RAM, so you should be fine there. Of course, if you want to simultaneously rock out in Indesign and Photoshop, you might want more.\n\nIf you already have a good external monitor there’s no reason that the $600 Mac Mini won’t be all you need.\n\n"

I hadn’t thought about the Mac Mini at all.\n\nChristian\n\nPS: Is there a directory of classic Typophile threads somewhere? I have stumbled on the FAQ for posting guidelines, but I was wondering if there is a shortcut to frequently asked subjects or highly informative threads, apart from the search box above.\n\n"

I used to have a TiBook and ’upgraded’ to a Plain-Jane Macbook for half the price 2 years later.\n\n"

It is also good for previews, and I and can rotate it to portrait orientation for really big previews. I also have a smaller screen with the tools on it and a text file open.\n\n"
