Specifically I'm thinking about [Design Observer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417094959/http:/www.designobserver.com/) and [Speak Up](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417094959/http:/www.underconsideration.com/speakup/).\n\n"

It's a pity that it costs so much, but that's one of the results of not flooding the inside with advertising.\n\nBaseline is excellent for typography:  \n [http://www.baselinemagazine.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417094959/http:/www.baselinemagazine.com/ \"http://www.baselinemagazine.com/\")\n\n"
