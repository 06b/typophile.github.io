I think you graciously succeed in giving the right retro feel.</cite>\n\nFor me that is the most difficult thing in those projects.\n\nWith regard to the rooster and the \"The\". It takes a bit of the asymmetry of the ampersand back. Without it, the asymmetry would drag attention in a negative way. That’s good. If Bello drags to much attention, may be dependent from the size in this case. And in the example with the background pattern, I think Bello drags less attention.\n\n"
