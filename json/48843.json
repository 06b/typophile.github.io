Its not really fair to pick on the work of a fellow scribe who can't defend him/herself. But it is not what I would have done in 1975, and it certainly is nothing like what I would do today.\n\nI am not sure what you have in mind nor what point you are trying to make with this. There is nothing overtly strange to it that I can see. My take of the \"The Art of the Scribe\" is that the pen angle is all wrong from the start and is not correct at any point. It's too small to tell and I would need a much closer look, but if the entire poster is calligraphy as you say, then it does not look to be written entirely by the same hand-can't be sure of this from the jpg.\n\n"

That's more difficult than doing it vertically which is probably why the top side of that stroke is not as steady looking as the bottom.

Most pen strokes are either vertical or horizontal, but the A crossbar, Cap T and rt horizontals deviate from this.\n\nI'm still a bit puzzled here expecting that there would be some kind of real mystery revealed.
