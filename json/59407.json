Unfortunately, I think that thread had a title like this one, and now I have no idea where to find it. Maybe someone else who sees this will remember it.\n\nPlease help the IDers by using a descriptive title that we might have a chance to find again. \"Round Bauhaus style with serifs\" would be a good title for this thread, and you could edit your post to change it, I think.\n\nThis font resembles a font called [Horatio](http://web.archive.org/web/20110519025818/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/horatio/), but with added serifs. I suspect it is new (possibly a freebie).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
