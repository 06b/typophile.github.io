Enjoying my last days off and looking forward to my return on my favourite Typophile Board. I can actually waterski now! And guess what? After all those years I finally managed to read a [serious book](http://web.archive.org/web/20060905190056/http:/www.nologo.org/), like, with real paper pages ‘n’ stuff! :^D\n\nDavid, I’ve learned one thing here: IDing Greek type is twice as hard as the usual key glyphs (e.g. ‘a’, ‘g’, ‘G’ etc.) are absent in the Greek alphabet. Hard work! ;^P\n\n"
