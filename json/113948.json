The original font is most likely German Jugendstil from about 1910.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317120724im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KalenderblattBySteffmann_3995.jpg)\n  \n [http://www.dafont.com/kalenderblatt-grote.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317120724/http:/www.dafont.com/kalenderblatt-grote.font \"http://www.dafont.com/kalenderblatt-grote.font\")  \nDon\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Calender \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317120724/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

      "content": "Many thanks Fivos for finding the Jackaman and Harvey fonts, and for the information that the digital fonts are based on the Players typeface designed by by Adrian Williams in the 1970s.  \nAfter checking the three fonts I find that both Steve Jackaman and Thomas E. Harvey created generally similar but independent digitizations of the players typeface. The Steffmann version, when sizes are adjusted to enable comparison, and allowing for accumulated conversion errors, is a point for point digital match with Thomas E. Harvey's font, although some tinkering was done.  \nI see that Nick Curtis digitized, as Stoney Island NF, a 1930s design by Alf Becker named Chicago Modern Thick and Thin.  \nThe Players typeface looks somewhat similar to Becker's design.  \nDon\n\n"

I've always liked this original version more than the Players typeface it inspired - perhaps because it was a hand drawn alphabet I see as masterful artwork.\n\n"
