  "content": "Here's something that always troubled me: Wheneaver I export a PDF from Illustrator or InDesign, that uses Myruad Pro, some of the letters (I and l's) would always display rather awkwardly (though they'd print fine afterward). This is mainly noticeable when the type is outlined. I also found that some older versions of acrobat would display and print the I and l glyphs as dashed lines.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130709095551im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Myriard_3729.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "There's nothing wrong with the font per se. I'm sure you'll observe the same \"issue\" when using a sans serif other than Myriad.\n\nWhat happens is that the Reader (or whatever app you're using for viewing the PDF) takes advantage of the hinting data present in the font to improve the rasterization. When the glyphs are converted to outlines, that hinting data is no longer available, so the Reader defaults to a different rasterization mode that is good for general artwork, but not ideal for outlined text.\n\n"

Apparently the recent Adobe display algorithms treat a plain rectangle differently from other vector shapes and apply some special \"optimization\" on it. Not very useful with type.\n\nA.\n\n"
