  "content": "hey guys i need help with something. I'm currently making a childrens schoolbook and i need to change the text typeface that we currently use for a new one. untill this point we where using a combination between Bliss @ 11,5pt for the exercices with Minion @ 12pt for the large texts. Do you have any sugestion? I would like one that combins well with bliss, that has good legebility for the 16 year old kids to read, and if it saves space... better, that way we can have bigger illustrations :)\n\nthanks alot and keep it up.\n\n",
