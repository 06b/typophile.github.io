I am not too sure what you mean by mechanics, but I'll try to explain. Christian proposed the idea of working together on Meta Serif, and I agreed. He had Erik's blessing to go ahead. I think Christian did the first sketches (in Fontlab) and gave the file to me, it was passed back and forth until we were both happy with it. Then, based on the Roman, I proceeded to flesh out the italic & blacks, with Christian marking the proof .pdf's and sometimes tweaking the .vfb's if the changes were minute. All the way along Erik is asked to check to make sure he is happy with how it is looking, and also makes suggestions.\n\nSo, as you can see, it is a truly collaborative approach. I have to admit it is much easier than trying to make a typeface solo, as certain decisions are made more much quickly!\n\nIs that what you mean by mechanics?\n\n—K\n\n"

I am just translating all of this through the weights &amp; into the italics!</cite>\n\nKris is being overly modest here, but I'll go back to the beginning first. The idea of Meta Serif has been floating around since 2002 or so, and after a several false starts, Erik and I finally figured out the basic look for the Roman at ATypI last fall. I forget how Kris and I first got in touch with each other, but we had worked together on a few small things and gotten to know each other when I asked him to draw Meta Serif with me. I don't remember the specific circumstances, I just had a gut feeling that it would work out. I thought there was a good chance the typeface would turn out better and be finished faster if we drew it together. He thought I was joking at first, but the rest will be history soon enough.\n\nI probably could have drawn the family myself (even that would have been a collaboration between me and Erik), but Kris brings his own sensibility to the mix, and he's doing a lot more than translating the basic design into a full family - he's really helped to shape the design. To be honest, the trickiest part is managing the files and knowing what the most current version is at any given moment, not working together. In the end, it won't be what he or I or Erik would have done on our own.\n\nIt was a similar scenario with Guardian Egyptian, Guardian Sans, Publico, and the other projects Paul Barnes and I have worked on together - I don't think he or I would have come up with any of these typefaces on our own, but together the work (sometimes quickly, sometimes eventually) came pretty naturally. When Paul and I work together, the division of labor is really unclear. One or both of us draws some characters, then we pass files back and forth until we're both happy with what we've got. Then one of us does the kerning, and I generally do the Superpolating. Not a very exciting story, I'm afraid.\n\nA shared design sensiblity is important for collaboration, but I think the rest is just chemistry. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I've been pretty lucky in finding people to work with, and have various projects in the works with Kris, Erik, Paul, and others right now, plus a few things of my own. I think it keeps my work fresh, and each of my collaborators knows things that I don't, which keeps things interesting.\n\n"

Of course, a little bit of art direction can go a long way, as the proverbial sketch on the table napkin demonstrates.\n\nMy retail fonts have no outside input, which is fine by me, that's the main reason I started the foundry. But it's also very valuable to get direction in commissioned work, whether it's from a client who is a designer/art director, or \"just\" a client. For instance, many times I've prepared alternate directions for a project, and the client has picked what at the time I considered the least promising option. And then it was a struggle to develop it into something that pleased the client _and_ myself. But often, despite the headaches, that produces the most interesting results.\n\n"

The interesting, and quite broad and deep, question here is: if you're making a \"conventional\" Latin text face, are the norms of what instances of letterspacing \"simply work\" perhaps reliable enough not to require any discussion beyond things like \"I think it should be looser\"?

When you're too close to something it's hard to see it clearly (like how one typically sees many things to fix in one's own design after a while of not looking at it).
