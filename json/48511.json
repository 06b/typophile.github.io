Any other good font forums out there? Any sites or books on 70s typefaces? Any persons I can contact?\n\nAnyone seen this font being used other places?\n\nThanks again..\n\n-pookey\n\n"

I see nothing to suggest that both use the same \"font\". They only have the pointed tops/bottoms in common and that is simply a style -- ala Fette Fraktur, Bradley, Becker and others.\n\n"
