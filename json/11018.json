Kudos.   \n   \nFlipping lc 'a' and 'e' as part of the exploration, reworking the uc 'R' and notching the lc 'e' is nice.   \n   \nOne letter pair that I liked that didn't make the cut was the original lc 'am' pairing. Very fluid.   \n   \nusing a '+' in cutz + buzz works well, too.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "One problem with the \"S\", especially in the versions where the top arm stretches across above the other characters, is that (to my eye) the resulting design reads as \"CREAM\" with a frame-like flourish rather than as the intended \"SCREAM\".   \n   \nThe rest of the design looks great, though. I especially like the font used for \"cutz+buzz\".   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
