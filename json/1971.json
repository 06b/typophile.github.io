It's a long story but we have been getting a major runaround from them on their major use of the Cezanne font with no apparent purchase ..and don't get me started on Team-One's use of Cezanne for a Lexus Campaign... They bought a single copy from myfonts AFTER we asked about their flash animation on the Lexus site.   \n   \nPerhaps I can should steal all of my groceries and then pay them IF they ask me for it....\n\n"

Such high minded people at Starbucks wanting to protect you from second hand smoke, I bet they don't know their ad agency is using a pirated font for their promotions. I think an email to the corporate office will fix this problem. They do want to sell more franchises and don't want negative publicity, Dan\n\n"

Many E-mails, letters,   \nphone calls to the corporate office and their lawyers have alerted them to   \nthe problem and it has not fixed this problem. They do want to sell more   \nfranchises but possibly don't care about negative publicity.\n\n"
