      "content": "here is the larger explanation, from an email i have sent to Dan Reinolds:  \n---\n\nlately i have been studying an extra course, (having finished my design college studies in MINSHAR college in israel) of package design. i designed and presented a packaging and book covers for something that in hebrew called \"K'fitzat Haderech\". this might be femiliar to you from the book Dune by frank herbert. it's a term originaly taken from the jewish misticism, and also appears on other religions folklore as well (like in islam, maybe when muhammad has transferred from medina or mecca to jerusalem).\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kefitzat\\_Haderech\n\nthe \"kfitzat haderech\" i designed, is a packaging related to an imagined art event taking place once or twice a year, in which there is an exhibition that takes place in several different galleries across tel aviv. one can \"jump\" from one gallery to another on a thematic route - for instance - an exhibition regarding a theme called \"my body my self\" which belongs to a group of different israeli artists from the 70's, using their body as canvas. the spectator can start in a specific gallery, and then go on to another gallery which shows a main artist, then the route splits to his pupils (his students affected by him), and so on and so on. the path may be chronologic, may be thematic.\n\nwhen dotting the map in search for galleries in tel aviv, i immediately noticed the option of routing or \"wiring\" one dot to another, creating an imaginary \"web of art\" across the city, in which art lovers could hang around. it resembles diagrams of wiring of the internet or any social arragement. the wirings create compositions.\n\nin these links, you can see the work yet unpublished - three designed and self-bound (japanese binding) books printed on canvas with cloth handles (to carry the catalogue across town), a hardback canvas packaging, and a poster.  \nhere are the images:\n\nwork process:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107233929im_/http:/typophile.com/files/work%20process_5771.jpg)\n\npresentation and packaging:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107233929im_/http:/typophile.com/files/HAGASHA%20STRIP_5691.jpg)\n\nand the poster, showing the \"kfitzat haderech\" logo typograhy made from stitched cotton threads, plus a main vector wiring composition:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107233929im_/http:/typophile.com/files/poster%20print-FINAL%20small_4106.jpg)\n\nthe poster advertises the \"my body my self\" 70's artists exhibition, and i did a hommage to a 70's artist called Yocheved Vinefeld who stitched threads over her own images:\n\n[www.most.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/3C463066-2A7A-4249-BA17-EE5BB0D94489/0/%D7%...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107233929/http:/www.most.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/3C463066-2A7A-4249-BA17-EE5BB0D94489/0/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%93%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%93.JPG \"www.most.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/3C463066-2A7A-4249-BA17-EE5BB0D94489/0/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%93%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%93.JPG\")\n\n(more pics here: [www.most.gov.il/%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107233929/http:/www.most.gov.il/%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%9C+%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8+%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA/%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A9+%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C/%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95+%D7%A2%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%95+%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%9470+%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9F+%D7%AA%D7%9C+%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%91/%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%97%D7%A8+%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%9E%D7%9F+%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%94.htm \"www.most.gov.il/%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%9C+%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8+%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA/%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%A9+%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C/%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95+%D7%A2%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%95+%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%9470+%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9F+%D7%AA%D7%9C+%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%91/%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%97%D7%A8+%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%9E%D7%9F+%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%94.htm\"))\n\n----  \nso, you see, i need some font which is very interesting in typography but (or and) also is very geometric, so i can sow it with threads and use it as a font too.\n\n"
