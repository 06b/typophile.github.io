  "content": "Hi!  \nI am currently in my third and final year at university studying advertising and I am preparing to write a report on typography. It is an open brief and so I can choose to write about anything within typography which I feel makes it all the harder to decide with such an interesting and wide variety of options.\n\nI am relatively new to typography and have spent the last few weeks looking into its general history. Now I feel I have a better understanding about what typography is and where it all began, I am ready to put an angle on my report and was looking at perhaps incorporating brands and how typography can affect a brand image - This is just one idea I have had and have found myself so overwhelmed that I am struggling to nail an actual idea. It seems the more I read the less able I feel to write a successful report!\n\nBest wishes\n\nKim\n\n",

The opposite approach might be more effective.\n\nMight I suggest the topic of political candidates? You might find the research easier if the branding is just for one person with clearly stated positions, rather than products with more nuanced messages. Plus, with politicians, you can definitively show which typeface \"won.\"\n\nThere is a wealth of information analyzing Barack Obama's smart choice of Gotham for his political campaign. McCain chose more safe, traditional (dull!) branding with a somewhat military-looking logo.\n\nJust a thought!\n\n"
