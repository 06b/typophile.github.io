      "content": "This is an interesting looking font. It would be nice to see a pdf; that way we can judge the shapes, contrast and smoothness better. It looks quite well crafted.\n\nAt first glance, it looks like you're not quite decided whether this should be narrow or wide. The caps are wide but the lowercase (especially e and g) is narrow. I think that could work very interestingly as a concept, but then there are still discrepancies like the wide lowercase a or narrow uppercase J.\n\nIt looks like the stems of the uppercase could be a bit heavier.\n\nComma is not in tune with the other glyphs, style-wise. It needs squaring off. The period too. Asterisk needs to be monoline I think.\n\nUphill stroke of X and x needs a bit of offset.\n\nLowercase j should have a flatter tail.\n\nThe @ sign has a bit too much white space. Put the ring nearer the a?\n\nKeep going, this could turn out very interesting!\n\n"

      "content": "This looks awesome, please finish it.  \nWhat if the bottom-left corner of the lower case b looked like the upper-left corner of g.  \nI found the terminal of lowercase e a little awkward but it could be just me.  \nMaybe also reduced the contrast between the thicks and thins in the uppercase, AXKYN.  \nIn my opinion a close loop P may work better with this typeface (mainly because I don't like open loop ones :P) I love the R though.  \nIt could be that the high contrast Uppercase makes the capitals a little thicker than the lowercase at times but it's really hard to tell from a PNG.\n\nBen said:\"At first glance, it looks like you're not quite decided whether this should be narrow or wide.\"\n\nPlease don't fix that by making the whole thing narrower.\n\n"

I personally don't like it, it makes it to much \"fun\" (see \"bibaboerderij\").
