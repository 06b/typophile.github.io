      "content": "Since reading on TV is non-immersive (at least if we're talking about short captions here) and the lo-res and interlacing cause of a lot of fuzz, well-spaced sans forms (with a generous x-height) work best I think. One of my most favorite fonts for this kind of work is Poppl-Laudatio (which also has a lot of character at large sizes).   \n   \nBTW, check out Tiresias too:   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/tiresias/](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126073108/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/tiresias/)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Legibility doesn't seem to be a major consideration - it's about branding.   \n   \nYour paper might be better if you focus on captioning, subtitles and other forms of small text on TV rather than titles. screenfont.ca is a good starting point if you're after some juicy quotes.   \n   \nCheers, Si\n\n"

Unless the type is large, any typeface with fine details will get lost in both the low-res of traditional TV and the inerit blurring that is added.   \n   \nThat said, the parents just got a new HD-wide screen TV that I spent most of my saturday afternoon wasting away in front of and I must say that type looks absolutely stunning on it.\n\n"

      "content": "BBC TV use Gill Sans for most of their captions, programme lists, interactive menus which works very well at most sizes (they also use Helvetica Thin for some full screen work). On Digital (a now defunct UK digital tv provider) used Tiresias for their interactive services and it was very efficient (ie my Mum could read it). I think if you take the worst case � low definition TV receiving analogue signals � many serif faces are losing so much quality that unless it is taking a large proportion of the screen it is better to use sans.   \nTim\n\n"

You could write a whole paper on the subject of that one font. The process by which it was created and how it became a TV standard are quite well documented. And the people involved are probably quite approachable.   \n   \nCheers, Si\n\n"
