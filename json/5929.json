It bears similarities to various faces, but there's an unevenness that I think either speaks to the original design or a bad digitization of the original. Either way I don't know what would match it.\n\n"

If you do, could you perhaps scan that and send me an e-mail? I only need the \"1\" and \"0\" letters actually. Others are already available from the eps file.\n\n"
