      "content": "Hi Omar, thanks for linking to my article.\n\nMost typefaces used for airport signage is indeed **Frutiger** , first designed for Charles de Gaulle, Paris. Other typefaces that can be used for airport signage are eg. **FF Info** (Spiekermann), **FF DIN** (Albert Jan Pool), **FF Transit** (MetaDesign). I have seen uses of Helvetica and Gill Sans, although I find those typefaces not very suitable for airport signage. Good luck.\n\n"
