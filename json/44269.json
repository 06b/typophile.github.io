  "content": "I use Font Bureau's Californian Text for a magazine. It's a Type 1 font and the roman face has only lining figures. We purchased the expert font as well. How does one best put an expert font to use? Ive never used one and I've always been curious. I work in InDesign and I'm considering talking to my art director about using text figures in place of lining figures from this point forward. I know I can do a Find/Change and replace all digits with a Character Style set to use the expert font which includes text figures. Is this the best way to go about it in this case?\n\n",
