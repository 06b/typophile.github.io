  "content": "Can anyone help me locate the superultra heavy face that showed up in the forums within the last year. It might have been reminiscent of Black Slabbath, but I can't remember if it had slabs or not.\n\nMaybe it was done by a student or novice, not sure.\n\nIt seemed to have something clever happening with negative space, if I remember correctly.\n\nI thought it was in the critique forum, but I can't seem to find it there or anywhere else. :/\n\nthanks\n\n",

The stem width of the ultra-light weight was equal to the counter width of the ultra-black. Furthermore, most of the glyphs had the same width in both weights.\n\nDoes anyone else remember this?\n\n"
