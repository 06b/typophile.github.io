What really killed was the illustrations of works by fine artists and illustrators that seemed to have a resonance with the subject matter. For instance, a review of a book on Chomky’s linguistic theories and how his work had been replaced by more contemporary theories. To illustrate this concept a Mark Tansey painting was permmisioned that features Rothko and Rauschenburg tossing a painting frame into the abyss of a cave. The magazine design was clean and utility minded. The mixing of art with subject matter was brilliant.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011507im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/_3291016_6097.jpg)\n\n<cite>EAT </cite>is Bob Pollard’s collage art. In typical form, a friend of his handles the layout and uses an oversized Futura Caps for the work titles/captions. It is indulgent and boring at worst, but the conceptual content of the work is very good. I like that this is so personal for better and worse.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011507im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/_3281014_5152.jpg)\n\n<cite>Newtype </cite> is an odd mix of busy J-Pop layout, but includes Photoshop how-to sections and great studies of character design. I love that it has all these different elements together. Why wouldn’t a fan also know how the production was handled and have skills?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709011507im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/_3291017_6461.jpg)\n\n"
