So it was ubiquitous, to say the least.\n\nThe most info I’ve ever seen on this face in a single place would be in ATF’s 1923 Specimen Book - see if you can hunt down a copy - there’ll be about 4 or 5 pages of very handsome specimen setting and some background blurb about legibility testing, schoolbooks and the like…\n\nOf course it was later the basis for ITC Clearface - but I suspect that it was a victim of the ITC house-style mangling when it got recut.\n\n"
