The attached pic is giving me errors, I tried diff combinations with ’ l i by li’ ’li by l i ’ ’l\\_i by li’ etc. But when I compile it errors out saying\n\n’ aborting because of errors...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808125129im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OTerrors.jpg)\n\nAny ideas.\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ No OpenType font file icon after generating font](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808125129/http:/typophile.com/node/18412 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Problems with Quark file / PDF ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808125129/http:/typophile.com/node/18329 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If your ligature is called f\\_l (bottom of your image), this is the name to be put after the “by”, so: “sub f l by f\\_l;”\n\nBut I am surprised about aborting because of errors. Normally FL would just say: glyphs don’t exist, shall I create them ... Do you have other features already defined in the leftside column but without content yet?\n\nKarsten\n\n"
