The first time they put a STENT in one of my coronary arteries and sent me home 2 days later. 2 days after that I was back in the hospital with chest pain. This time, they put 3 more STENTS in different arteries. They sent me home 2 days later and a day after that, I had serious chest pain again. My wife Ruth called the ambulance and back I went. they did another Thallium stress test and blood enzymes and found out that I had a very minor heart attack so back I went to the Cath lab for a third poke in the groin. This time, they just changed my medications. At least now I am home again and looking forward to a hospital free week.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
