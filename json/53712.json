We were asked to design a visual identity for Hillary Clinton to be used in the United States democratic election campaign, but I chose to design a font based on the Stars & Stripes instead. I did make the font strong yet feminine so that it would fit her, but it is primarily designed using the flag as a grid. I am not finished designing the font, but given the challenge I couldn't resist posting it here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104005905im_/http:/typophile.com/files/starsandstripes_3679.jpg)\n  \nMore on [www.nystrom-hansen.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20131104005905/http:/www.nystrom-hansen.net/ \"www.nystrom-hansen.net\")\n"

The concept is that all the full caps will feature the star somewhere in their design. I think the star could be bigger. Small caps for lower case looks OK but it might be worth trying true lower case too. Any other suggestions gratefully accepted.\n\nAlso, this is my first post on Typophile. Hello everyone!\n\n"
