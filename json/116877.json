Nick Curtis mentions the Central Typefoundry. This is also correct as Central and Cleveland often sold each others fonts.  \nEuclid would be the correct name to use for all the digital versions.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "According to an article by Loy in the \\_Inland Printer\\_ April 1900 on Schuenemann, he worked for Central before Cleveland and while at Cleveland also cut some fonts for Central. Which may or may not clarify the Central vs. Cleveland origin of Euclid.  \nThe fancy swash alternate capitals shown in the Dharma Type version are based on the original mortised alternate capitals cut by Schuenemann. They have also been independently digitized by Claude Pelletier as Euclid CP [http://www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font?text=E+U+C+L+I+D+C+P](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831060126/http:/www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font?text=E+U+C+L+I+D+C+P \"http://www.dafont.com/euclidcp.font?text=E+U+C+L+I+D+C+P\")  \nDon\n\n"
