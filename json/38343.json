I’ve seen the lettering for ’BUTTER’ on other grocer house butters, and I just realized it was originally Darigold. Wondering from the type experts around here if this is a custom face (i’m assuming) or if this is derived from anything else. I’d like to create an alphabet from the lettering on the pre-80s packages, I think it’s wonderful.\n\nThanks!\n\nMore on Darigold labels:  \n [http://www.darigold.com/butterlabels.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20071225163526/http:/www.darigold.com/butterlabels.asp \"http://www.darigold.com/butterlabels.asp\")\n\n [‹ (x) Distressed grotesque from Tazo Teas website - Faxfont {Sean Glenn}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071225163526/http:/typophile.com/node/38251 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Flow\" classic caps w/ large serifs - Stetson {Mike E} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071225163526/http:/typophile.com/node/38334 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Maybe this brand is just a NW thing, I might take a drive out to Yakima (2hrs east of Seattle) to see the cheese factory and investigate.\n\n"
