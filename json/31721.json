I just looked in the booklet for a more than 12-year old ClickArt collection of fonts, and there is one called ’Gaston’, which looks exactly like your sample — upright ’s’ and tilted ’e’ and all. It was apparently a common practice to revamp one or two characters when ’borrowing’ an existing design, and that seems to be the case here. Often these old fonts have a way of floating around on the web too.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The nine is correct too.\n\nYou’re spot on though Mike. There sure is a bunch of copycat fonts! We found three that would have worked in this thread alone.\n\nRegardless, you fellas are lifesavers — and thanks again for the help and suggestions.\n\n"
