[...]  \nTo get to the other side.\"_\n\nA normal ellipsis doesn't seem to convey enough and emphasizing it (using brackets here) looks a bit much. And it's confusing, like the intent is to remove text.  \nIs there a more eloquent way to represent this?\n\n",

A long pause could be indicated by your choice of words.\n\nDon't think most fiction has lots of pauses in it, but if you're writing instructions (like how to tell a joke) you could just say \"pause here\".\n\n"
