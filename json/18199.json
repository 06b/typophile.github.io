You send them out with great rapidity, but no helpful information.\n\nWhere did these come from? How old are they? Do you have any other samples showing the same typefaces?\n\nPlease consider the amount of work you are having done for you, and see if there is anything you can do to make our searches easier. Don't you think that's a fair request?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
