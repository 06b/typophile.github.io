Now i’ve just come across it again and i just have to know what it is... Can anyone pin it down? I’m hoping this one is going to be really easy for one of you :)\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152238im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/vo_ct_bbk2.jpg)\n\n [‹ Old type i-d desperation](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152238/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16417 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Westlife Logo font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705152238/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16408 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

So thank you all.\n\nI think Hannes is right, Vaughn i think, did resist the introduction of computers, and that would probably explain the funky t... I guess what your saying was that it was blown up from a smaller sample than the rest of the type...\n\nWould Jaspert’s book be a good investment for a budding typophile? - I have been waiting for the new fontbook to come out, if it ever will... Is there one referance book to rule them all so to speak?\n\nMany thanks again...\n\n"
