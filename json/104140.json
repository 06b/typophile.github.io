  "content": "KARACHI - Industrialisation is a process of social and economic changes whereby a human society is transformed from a pre-industrial to an industrial state. It is a part of a wider modernisation process, where social change and economic development is closely related with technological innovation, particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production.\n\nThe major technological, socioeconomic, and cultural change in the late 18th and early 19th century resulting from the replacement of an economy based on manual labour with one dominated by industry and machine manufacture while our economy grows stronger and our environment becomes weaker as a result. There is only one cause of environmental destruction - industrialisation. Overpopulation and over consumerism are only consequences/by-products of the industrialisation. Moreover, the environment has been destroyed by industrialization and consumerism but not the population/ overpopulation. The industrialisation has loaded tremendous pressure on environment. The industrialisation runs hand in glove with environment.\n\n",
