Either I let posts built up for a while and go through them when I feel like it, or if I don't feel like it I just press 'mark all as read'. ;)\n\n"

It is part of my daily work flow, mostly for trend monitoring, but when I see relevant articles, I will read them. After a while, you can scan sites quite quickly and pass on the stuff that doesn't interest/apply to what you are after.\n\n"

Many sites now send their updates through it, and many individual designers that I follow also share links to really awesome stuff. I usually take 30 minutes to an hour a day just following links from my Twitter feed.\n\nBut besides that, I usually just check out [http://www.formfiftyfive.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426200426/http:/www.formfiftyfive.com/ \"http://www.formfiftyfive.com\") and... that's the only one I regularly check manually. Hm. Twitter has really spoiled me.\n\nI also highly recommend checking out the Featured Websites on Cargo Collective [http://cargocollective.com/#/featured](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426200426/http:/cargocollective.com/#/featured \"http://cargocollective.com/#/featured\") — amazing source of inspiration, all of the featured sites are the portfolios of designers, illustrators, photographers (et cetera) that are updated frequently when they finish new projects. There's also real nice finds like [http://unurth.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426200426/http:/unurth.com/ \"http://unurth.com/\") and [http://elasticnovice.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120426200426/http:/elasticnovice.com/ \"http://elasticnovice.com/\") in there, which are more or less art blogs.\n\n"
