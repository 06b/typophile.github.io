  "content": "Today's subject of expertise is the American West.\n\nI am looking for examples of American typography between 1836 (Battle of the Alamo) and 1890 (Wounded Knee).\n\n(The backdrops to the first and last 'Western' movies, according to Wikipedia).\n\nWhich typefaces were used in American books and newspapers at this time? A lot of material I have seen looks like it is, or is very similar to Bodoni. Was type imported from Europe?\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "in one way it was imported from Europe since typography started in Europe.  \nAbout American types i must say that Slab Serif are the american typefaces, the so called egyptians (the inventors of the egyptians were the british, not the americans). I can give you a brief of what is slab and how it started if you really are interested on that.  \nAbout typefaces from that period of time i can say to you Ziggurat HTF (a good passage to digital from a typeface from xix century), the western style can be found too on fonts like Zebrawood, Rosewood, Madame...  \nTell me if it is that that you want, that you're searching for...\n\nJoel Santos // youremin  \nsound & visual\n\n"

      "content": "As far as text faces, most of the American fonts in use at this time were in the \"modern\" classification, but more likely to be the Scotch Roman variety than Bodoni. The individuality in design that one associates with this period shows up in display faces, both metal fonts and woodtype. These can be found in the specimen books of the era. This period was also the heydey of piracy through stereotyping, so while there were enough American type foundries by this time to make importing fonts from Europe unnecessary, designs may have been \"imported\" by this method of copying.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Joel and Juliet\n\nI will do some reading on Scotch Roman!  \nImporting/copying is great. The typeface is for a book called 'Here once again'. It is about film & art and interpretation is one of the recurrent themes. Therefore revisiting ideas, interpretation and copying are actually quite relevant!\n\nThe book is bilingual, Korean and English. As a joke we decided to make the Western part 'Western', an homage to the Western genre of film. Scotch Roman type is probably a nice way to cool down any stereotypes of this genre.\n\nJuliet do you know of any digitizations of said style?\n\nMany thanks to both your answers\n\nAndy\n\n"
