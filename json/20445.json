I often get a page where italics is used, and not turned off and every following message is in hard to read italics.\n\nIf a \\</i\\> and \\</em\\> was inserted at the end of every message by the forum software, it would prevent this from going beyond a single thread.\n\n"

But anything to get it working i suppose!!\n\nAlso what about getting rid of the annoying click to activates? Pretty easy to use another embedding method and you can get great search engine rankings with the replacement content!\n\n"

On PCs the first post is the same text size as the reply thread.\n\nThe larger text size on Macs is fine for just a few sentences, but on long copy it’s unwieldly. I’ve been reluctant to start off a topic with long copy. Instead, I’ve posted the main idea and followed it up my own reply adding the longer copy.\n\n"
