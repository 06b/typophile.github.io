There are two fonts in the family: Maryam Regular and Maryam Alternate. Because of moderate contrast, these fonts have ellegant and very legible forms even in small x-height sizes. There are more than 70 ligatures in each font,providing a lot of letterform variations that can make this type family look like real handwriting on a page.\n\nMaryam are avaliable to purchase at [MyFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001734/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/outras/maryam) for only $16,80 USD per font (until the end of March).
