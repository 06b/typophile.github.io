Kindersley's work in this area formed the basis of an artist's project by his former assistant the calligrapher Owen Williams called Testing David.[10] In 1952 he submitted a design, MoT Serif, to the British Ministry of Transport, who required new lettering to use on United Kingdom road signs. Although the Road Research Laboratory found Kindersley's design more legible, the all-capitals design with serifs was passed over in favour of that of Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert. Many of the street signs in England, especially in Cambridge use Kindersley fonts.\n\nAlso, there is a whole chapter on this in the book \"Type: The Secret History of Letters\", a great book by the way...\n\n"
