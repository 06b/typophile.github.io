  "content": "Many people are aware that online writing jobs do not offer income stability. Although online writing can definitely give much higher payment than a regular salary, this kind of “extra work” should not be taken for granted. Once a person commits one mistake, he or she may lose the job, the clients, and the source of living.\n\nAn online writing job may come just once in a blue moon so expect a bumpy road. One may argue that self-employed individuals – [freelancers](http://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer) – can commit errors and can easily get away with it because they do not have a boss to supervise them as they work. In reality, the tiniest mistake one can make in one project can be the last of his or her writing career.\n\nWhat are the most common mistakes any freelance writer can commit?\n\n**_1. Failing to do [Research](http://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research)_**  \nEven online writing jobs need background research and it is not just about looking for information over the internet. Extend your research skills by looking at sources unavailable in most websites. Impress clients by putting a great deal of effort in writing an initial assignment or a continuing project for an online writing job. Do not trust one’s own knowledge – look for data and evidences – because submitting false reports can ruin one’s reputation.\n\n**_2. Failing to meet [Deadlines](http://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline)_**  \nBusinesses online need write ups from freelance writers. They outsource online writing jobs so they can immediately have written contents that their regular employees cannot accomplish. Since businesses run 24/7, it is only appropriate to send article copies on time.\n\n**_3. Failing to [Negotiate](http://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation)_**  \nNever accept online writing jobs that pay only a fraction of one’s talent. Anybody can be trained to write but there are born writers who can deliver better results. Never accept cheap offers.\n\n**_About Myself:_**\n\nMichael Foster started writing scripts for a television series when he was in New York. After three years of working for a TV network, he decided to do freelance work and was able to start his own magazine company by accepting [online writing jobs](http://web.archive.org/web/20090702064554/http:/www.essaywriters.net/) and finding clients over the internet. Michael is a Film and Television Studies Major from Bates College.\n\n",
