  "content": "Hi all,\n\nSome time ago I remember reading in a thread about a multiple layer font, with various styles that could be combined (stacked) in various combinations. It was quite experimental, but looked really nice. My problem: I forgot the name and I don't know where to begin to look... Does anyone know what typeface I'm talking about? Please give me a name, and if possible a link.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n",
