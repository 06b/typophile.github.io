  "content": "Heya!\n\nA bit of an odd question, but what is the correct terminology for the exceptions in a typeface that contains no serifs at all, except for the problematic ones: `i,l,I,` and `1`.\n\nThis kind of typeface is normally found in screen-space areas (non-print). Most known example for this would be the Verdana family.  \nThis would mean that Verdana is not a pure grotesque font, but neither is it a full grown serif font as well. What is this \"kind\" of typeface called? Are there special terms that these odd-ones-out are called?\n\n",
