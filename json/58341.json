  "content": "Hi!\n\nI have to make a brochure for a necklace that is supposed to come from medieval times and so they’ve asked me to use an appropiate font. But, the fonts I’ve found are nice for maybe the name of the product or just an important sentence but not for explaining the one page long legend that is related to it. Any suggestions on a couple of fonts that can have nice capital letters but are readable without getting tired of them?\n\nThanks a lot!!!\n\n",

My first thought was a font that is probably not technically Medieval, but [P22 Aragon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225002904/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/sherwood/p22-aragon/) has a nice old style with legible lower case.\n\nI'm sure you will get other suggestions, but this was something I've used and liked.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
