The best way to estimate and invoice clients, it’s saved me a ton of time and it’s pretty amazing.\n\nAlthough, I am still unorganized with my expenses, accounting, etc.\n\nIs there an online software similar to Freshbooks that you’re happy with?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ yelp!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201145036/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49152 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Origin of the \"pot hook\" italic ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201145036/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49096 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

We had similar issues with Freshbooks and decided to make an online accounting software to track income and expenses.\n\nYou can view a free live demo of Clarity Accounting — our online accounting software, please go to:\n\n[https://www.clarityaccounting.com/demo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201145036/https:/www.clarityaccounting.com/demo \"https://www.clarityaccounting.com/demo\")\n\nThe service only costs $10 / month to use and we provide a free trial and excel export in case you want to leave with all your data.\n\nI would love to hear some feedback from you after you’ve viewed the demo :)\n\nWe are considering the possibily of integrating with Freshbooks using their API. Do you think that would be a good idea?\n\n"

But none met my requirements, which include being able to invoice in multiple currencies (namely CAD and USD, for me). Ultimately, I’ve found that none of these systems is up to snuff so I went old school and hired a bookkeeper. Oh, and I use [Billings](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201145036/http:/www.billings2.com/) (which, like Freshbooks, is a Canadian product) for basic invoicing; it’s likable enough.\n\n"
