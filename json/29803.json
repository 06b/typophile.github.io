After installing the suit font, when I type some text in freeHand (fe.: “AV”) , The kernings are not adusted, and this is really desapointing. Maybe i am not creating the font file properly.\n\nSomeone please help me with this.\n\nThanks.\n\nThis is how i am generating the font file.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821144551im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/P2_5531.gif)\n\n [‹ Golive online tutorials or help?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821144551/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29755 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font dimensions - generate problem ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821144551/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29662 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

With Postscript fonts, the kerning is stored in the bitmap font. Perhaps Fontographer does not expect this to be set to “None” when generating Mac fonts—even TrueType fonts—and is not including the kerning for this reason. Just a guess.\n\n"
