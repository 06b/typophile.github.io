  "content": "I need some type that looks like it is from a 1950s-1960s space program. Not like the Jetsons or boomerang-table-hepcat stuff, but something that might actually appear on the side of a rocket or test-plane in the early supersonic jet propulsion era.\n\nThere is one in particular that I saw, but I forgot what it was called. I think the name of it was a near-meaningless, short mix of letters and numbers, and it looked like what you would see painted on the side of a bomber, a bit naïve and engineered-looking, the typographic equivalent to a telephone pole. It had an tall octagonal shape and was quite stark.\n\nI am sure there are others, but I am stumped as display type is not my specialty. Please help if you can. Thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Albeit off topic, but I can't resist... The \"worm\" logo was also called the \"spaghetti\" mark. After seeing several shuttle launches from the press center in my earlier journalist days, I have a great affinity for NASA and actually prefer the historical \"meatball\" logo.\n\nHere's a page from NASA's site about the history of the \"meatball\" logo ( [http://history.nasa.gov/meatball.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015130427/http:/history.nasa.gov/meatball.htm \"http://history.nasa.gov/meatball.htm\")), with this priceless quote:\n\n<cite>When the meatball was reinstated in 1992, Greg Patt, then Graphics Manager for [the Glenn Research Center's] Publishing Services contractor, remarked \"It's a design nightmare. It doesn't print well on laser printers because of the gradations on the airfoil, and it can't be used at less than 5/8 inch because the stars disappear and the type becomes illegible.\" </cite>\n\nOh, and this one, too:\n\n<cite>\"Meatball\" has also been used for a dull, unattractive person and for a penant for battle efficiency or an athletic scholarship. </cite>\n\nI love their honesty on both counts.\n\nMore about NASA's logos at their Graphics Standards Website: [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/insignia/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015130427/http:/www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/insignia/ \"http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/insignia/\")\n\n"
