      "content": "The T is almost dropping of the shelf… The F twins should be every so slightly closer to each other (as twins usually are).  \nThe bowl of the U could be smoother where it connects to the verticals. The J overshoots — maybe a rendering issue.\n\nMinor problems, easily solved. (BTW: check your designs by holding the print upside down, scrutinize it in a mirror. This really helps you notice stuff.)\n\n"
