  "content": "Hey everyone, at the risk of ridicule and being thought a madman, I was trolling a UFO site and came across some documents. These represent script from a supposed extra-terrestrial craft the government is in possession of. I have seen the main \"alien\" type someplace, but it has been more than a few years ago. It looks like a faux kanji or some other fake script.\n\n[http://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/pacl-lang-analysis-p119-fullsize.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417103258/http:/isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/pacl-lang-analysis-p119-fullsize.jpg \"http://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/pacl-lang-analysis-p119-fullsize.jpg\")\n\nThis is one of the better pages, but there are several at:\n\n[http://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417103258/http:/isaaccaret.fortunecity.com/ \"http://isaaccaret.fortunecity.com\")\n\nI am currently looking through my library and will update if I find it.\n\n-Mike\n\nUPDATE: It looks like flipped Katakana i.e. Matrix rain... there are a few pics online... I actually am going to link a new image.  \n(rotated 180°)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417103258im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Alienscript_5975.jpg)\n\nand the matrix-esque sample:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417103258im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MatrixCodeCloseUp_4308.jpg)\n\nFrom the wikipedia... thanks.\n\n",
