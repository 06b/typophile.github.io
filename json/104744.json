On another note, I cannot find any history on Patrician, does anyone know who designed it. I love the Ms and N's in the logo but am guessing they may have it customised. Any help is greatly appreciated.  \n [http://saturday-london.com/clients/dominic-jones/dominic-jones-packaging/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/saturday-london.com/clients/dominic-jones/dominic-jones-packaging/ \"http://saturday-london.com/clients/dominic-jones/dominic-jones-packaging/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Saturday_DominicJones_AW09-logo1_5187.jpg)\n\n",

It looks to mix influences from [Big Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/www.fonts.com/font/carter-and-cone/big-caslon) (former font on which [Industria is based](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/www.typophile.com/node/77367#comment-444953)) and [Tiffany](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiffany) (mainly on / [M](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiffany/std/glyphs.html#glyphs/538425/46) and / [N](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiffany/std/glyphs.html#glyphs/538425/47))/Big Caslon /A top.  \nDon't know too much about [Patrician](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/patrician) part of it looks very close to (Big) Caslon... There are also some [rip-off accusations on some Scriptorium David Nalle's fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20140805095649/http:/typophile.com/node/51142?page=1#comment-310076) so better avoid Patrician...\n\n"

Expanded somewhat and with Tiffany style diagonal stroke ends added to M and N, and cross stroke serifs on E also adjusted.  \nDon\n\ndisplay.\n\n"
