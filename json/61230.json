  "content": "I am beginning to generate new weights for a typeface I'm designing. I've tried using the Blend Fonts tool, but noticed FLS added points on several glyphs, so looked for alternative. Naturally, I searched the forums and found the \"Assign Font Mask \\> Define New Axis \\> Mask to Master\" method. It seems to be working well, with one potential caveat. When I assign a new font mask I notice that FLS switched nodes with smooth connections to sharp ones. The BCP and nodes positions are identical, just the connection type is switched. My questions are: is this normal?, and will it have any deleterious effects as I generate new instances?\n\nThanks for any insights?\n\n",
