The closest there is is <cite>FOOT, SQUARE</cite>; it's defined in the <cite>Miscellaneous Technical Range</cite> and it looks like a prime hanging inside an opening at the top of a square box.\n\nThe [Unicode Character Names Index](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818043904/http:/www.unicode.org/charts/charindex.html) does have entries for <cite>feet</cite> and <cite>inches</cite>, but they are simple cross-references to the entries for <cite>PRIME</cite> and <cite>PRIME, DOUBLE</cite>, respectively.\n\nThe [Wikipedia article on the prime symbol](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818043904/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)) supports this.\n\nPerhaps the confusion stems from the fact that on typewriters, feet and inches were represented using the same upright symbols used to represent apostrophes and quotation marks.\n\n"
