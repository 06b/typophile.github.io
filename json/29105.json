His typeface for the City of Glasgow's festival of architecture made him known outside Germany. He was also involved in the extension of [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) bestsellers [FF Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FF%20Meta) and [FF Info](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FF%20Info) as well as the new weights of [ITC Officina](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ITC%20Officina).\n\nSchäfer now works as an independent type designer and teacher for type design and typography in Berlin. He launched his own foundry, primetype, in 2003 with new typefaces by himself and other designers.\n\nBesides Schäfer's work, primetype released fonts from other designers, including [Andrea Tinnes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Andrea%20Tinnes) and [Verena Gerlach](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Verena%20Gerlach).\n\n**External Links**  \n [Official Site](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/www.primetype.com/)  \n [primetype at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204203640/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?mid=54)\n\n",
