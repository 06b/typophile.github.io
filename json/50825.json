By the way, where can I find this list?\n\nThanks in advance  \nAntónio Fonseca\n\n [‹ Snapshots of typography in Paris](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135753/http:/typophile.com/node/49334 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Best laser printer for text? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135753/http:/typophile.com/node/12745 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But then you also need to draw the other special characters for Polish.\n\nLithuanian uses Aa, Ee, Ii and Uu with ogonek, but likewise to support Lithuanian, you also would need c with acute, c with caron, e with dot, s with caron, u with macron and z with caron.\n\nI don’t know which language uses the o with ogonek and the o with ogonek and macron.\n\n"
