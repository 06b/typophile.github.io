      "content": "These alchemical/astrological and monetarian character sets are actually a part of Andron Mega. I extracted them and put them into extra fonts because sometimes they are needed for specialized editing work. For those who need such characters but do not want to purchase Andron Mega. A few years ago I did the same with [Andron Publix](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112224/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-corpus-publix/).  \nI also consider to release even more character sets out of Andron Mega as seperate fonts, e.g. Runic.\n\n"
