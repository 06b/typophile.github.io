I work in an office where there are 6 artist computers and each computer is accessing fonts from its own folder in the control panel, but the problem is that if one artist installs a new font and then another artist picks up the artwork containing that font it doesnt show up and we have to go through annoying shit to then get the font on all the computers.\n\nI need some way of putting all the fonts for all the computers in one central folder or area that can be accessed via the network.\n\n",
