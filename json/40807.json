The font is his own creation Newt, former called Salamander. The light weight is used here. Newt is yet to be released (arrangements are being made with Veer according to Nathanael), but you can follow its development in the [Typophile critique section](http://web.archive.org/web/20080604063229/http:/typophile.com/Salamander).\n\n"
