  "content": "Hi!\n\nI’m looking for some feedback on this logo that I am creating for a startup company that makes handmade jewelry. The client is seeking a rustic, organic, friendly feel with a bit of country/western/colorado. My biggest struggle has been finding a font suitable for this identity. I’d like something organic, rustic, scripty yet professional. Any recommendations? Her identity is to be based on the horseshoe. She wants to have three staggered horseshoes like in the bottommost example of the attached file. Today, I gave my first attempt at weathering a logo and will certainly continue with this to get a better result.\n\nThanks so much for any input that you can give. Thanks!\n\nJosh\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091124104530im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PippinDesigns.gif)\n\n",

Or [Olduvai](http://web.archive.org/web/20091124104530/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000054) which your flourishes brought to mind. Your horseshoe looks a bit condensed to me and weathering it seems like you are trying to get too much into (or out of) the logo.  \nTim\n\n"

Rosewood is caps only.. What do you think of using MVB Aunt Mildred to compliment Rosewood? I have included the latest version of this design. Basically, the client is now looking for a folky, dreamy, friendly and westerny look that includes a horse, mountain, river, horseshoe scene. I like the progress I have made but want to improve the dimension of the scene that I have created (it seems a bit flat). I attached the latest file with my design. Any input?\n\nThanks so much for the assistance.\n\nJosh\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091124104530im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pippin_1up.gif)\n\n"

In your designs the luck is pouring out.\n\nYour last designs are too dark and heavy and please loose the gradient. The gradient will give you nothing but problems and looks to modern.\n\nI would use a western looking typeface only in the name and use a clean serif or san serif for the information text like phone number and address\n\n"
