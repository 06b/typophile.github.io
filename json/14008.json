  "content": "I think that this is right forum to post this little announcement: we just released new product, named [FogLamp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052053/http:/www.pyrus.com/Font-tools/FogLamp/). It is very simple application which has only one purpose: convert Fontographer database files (versions 3 and 4 are supported) to FontLab files.\n\nFogLamp is available separately (for both platforms) and in bundles with Fontographer and TransType Pro. Combination of Fog, FogLamp and TransType Pro allows to build Fog-based font-editing environment which can generate OpenType fonts in both \"flavors\" as well as any other font format.\n\nMore information is available in [press release](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020052053/http:/www.fontlab.com/The-News/Announcements/FogLamp-for-Fontographer-Users).\n\n",

Useful when making complex ornaments, logos, signatures, Baroque initials._\n\nWill the finished fonts be rendered at 10,000 UPM, or will rounding occur to PS and/or TTF standards when the fonts are generated?\n\n"

      "content": "The finished fonts will be rendered at whatever you specify in the application you do the finishing :)\n\nFrom FontLab, you can output a font with any UPM up to 16,000. For TrueType / OpenType TT, it will work perfectly, for OpenType PS and Type 1, there will be some minor application-specific annoyances e.g. the text cursor in InDesign might shrink to half or quarter size but the font still works.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"
