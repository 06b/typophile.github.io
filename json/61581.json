The basic letters  \nwere originally inspired by an early 1970s instructional filmstrip dealing  \nwith the dangers of glue sniffing. Further inspiration came from other  \nsources of 1960s display lettering. The lower case is almost as tall as the  \nupper case allowing for a mix and match between cases to achieve a more  \nlively display effect. Huffer Pro includes ligatures and Cyrillic and  \nCentral European character sets with a total of over 500 glyphs.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/huffer.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103142145/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/huffer.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/huffer.html\")\n\nIntroductory offer through September 30th.\n\nYou can now follow P22 on Twitter.com:  \n [http://www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103142145/http:/www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry \"http://www.twitter.com/P22TypeFoundry\")  \n————————————————————————  \nBecome a fan of P22 on Facebook:  \n [http://www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103142145/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951 \"http://www.facebook.com/pages/P22-type-foundry/11128622951\")  \n————————————————————————\n\n",
