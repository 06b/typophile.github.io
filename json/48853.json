But perhaps you could look over the spacing a little bit, as this large number of kerning pairs could mean that the spacing is not optimized?

(I take for granted that the font is an OTF with a glyph set larger than in old PST1 fonts.)\n\nIf the question were about strategy, then of course one better try hard to create almost-perfect spacing so it needs as few kerning as possible.\n\nIf the question were about aestetics, then better let the design of the typeface decide, not what anyone said. Some typefaces need more, some need less kerning.\n\n"
