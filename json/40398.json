Most [O](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101043844/http:/typophile.com/wiki/O)s and lowercase bowl letters have an amount of overshoot in proportion to the plot of their curve. Tight curves require more overshoot than flattened and squared curves.\n\n**Discussions:**  \n [per-glyph overshoots?](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101043844/http:/typophile.com/node/45312)\n\n",
