  "content": "Hi,\n\nYou downloaded a handwriting font from Dafont.com which didn't feature the German keyboard character layout, for example: °, §, ², ³, ä, ö, ü, ß, Ä, Ö, Ü, µ and € aren't included. However, you managed to insert the missing glyphs yourself by copying the period character.\n\nThe resulting font works just fine in Tux Paint. But it doesn't work in Word - the characters are missing, a good rectangle appears instead. What are you doing wrong?\n\n",
