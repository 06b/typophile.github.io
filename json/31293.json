Vipp looks rounder, blacker than the zetta sample shown...may its just the low quality flash interface at playtype that is obfuscating the design.\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"

She’s got the following to say about the Vipp typeface:_\n\n»Thanks for your interest in our typeface. - I’ll be happy to elaborate on it: My colleague Jonas Hecksher (partner in e-Types) has made it and it is called Vipp. We made it for the company Vipp in 06 (danish company who have been selling metal bins since 1939 - you probably know it) as a part of a larger re-design -brushing up layout in ads, packaging etc. At the same time the vipp-logo was taken out of a elipse, where it was always placed beforehand, and now just used as it is - written ’vipp’ - which of course influenced the letter design (logo/the four letters had to be recognizable and clearly visible). The shape of Vipp was inspired by especially the bin itself (very characteristic square/round 50’s - steady, sturdy, functional, hard, industrial).«\n\n"
