      "content": "Hrant,   \n   \nYour criticism of the tooling bit is based on a supposition I do not support. It is your problem, not mine or theirs.   \n   \nRehak certainly has knowledge of ATF hot metal practices but little of Lanston's although technologies were similar the objectives were not. What I can guarantee is that the work you have shown would not match the requirements of mechanical typesetting. Those technologies go hand in hand in any discussion. To ignore such \"realities\" in infantile.   \n   \nIf you wish to view problems in technologies just take a close look at the example you have shown and show someone who has not subscribed to hocus pocus and he will tell you the examples are badly flawed. The printed results tell the same.   \n   \nWhat Jim is saying is much different than what you are saying he is saying. One has to learn how to listen in order to learn. He is telling you it does not matter and that is why they did not bother.   \n   \nSo you should take the Caslon Challenge and see for yourself.   \n   \nThat will separate the men from the boys. Few find it necessary to have to read with a microscope. If they need to their problems are such that this discussion is the least of their worries.   \n   \nBut your example does not require one. You could drive a truck through the hole.   \n   \nMy advice to your designer is to leave for the moment his interest, which I assume is actually only your interest, alone. He should focus his efforts on avoiding the obvious criticism he has attracted in this discussion.   \n   \nIt is hard to be critical and suggest \"the subtle\" when the obvious is \"so obvious.   \n   \nGerald Giampa\n\n"

It was an Abarth, so man did it fly, but the steering wheel had like 45 degrees of play... One summer I crashed it three times in three weeks.   \n   \n\\> What is your source material for this?   \n   \nA while back on Typo-L (or Type Design, I forget) I was complaining that the pantograph (well, its use) ruined type design, and somebody pointed out that so-called \"cutting slips\" actually helped adapt drawings to different sizes (beyond just primitive scaling). Then I read Rehak's book as well as that Cost article (which is available as a free download on the APHA site), and it turned out that was true. (The point remains, however, that people ended up not using them, instead just doing a straight scale, _at most_ from three master drawings.)   \n   \nHere's some mysterious cutting slip data from Rehak's book, which he himself apparently couldn't figure out:   \n   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/atf\\_tabl.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803025926/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/atf_tabl.gif)   \n   \nThe red decimal points (as well as those two reddish zeros) are mine.   \n   \n\\> our methods of optical scaling would be a great contribution to digital typography.   \n   \nSo let's see them!   \n   \n\\> Hinting could be achieved strictly with optical scaling.   \n   \nI have no idea what you're talking about!   \n   \n\\> He is telling you it does not matter   \n   \nWhat _does_ matter? Smallcaps for example? You'd think so, since everybody and their mother includes them in their fonts now, but... nobody uses them!   \n   \nSo what do you -and Jim- really think matters in type design?   \nAnd why does it have to be the same for everybody?   \nLastly, what about the reader? Is your Art too high to bother with them?   \n   \n\\> that is why they did not bother.   \n   \nSo why does DTL for example -one of the most prestigious font houses out there, with good reason- bother including traps?   \n   \nIs it not possible to improve on Monotype and their contemporaries? Far from impossible, it's pretty easy.   \n   \n\\> Few find it necessary to have to read with a microscope.   \n   \nWhat exactly do you know about human perception?   \nDo you know for example that the fovea can pick up thin cables hanging in the air that no camera any of us can own today can? There is a famous court case where the defense attorney simply couldn't show the evidence: he had to drag the judge and jury to the scene - and they all saw the problem clearly.   \n   \n\\> My advice to your designer   \n   \nHuh?   \nThe traps in Pascal are older than me! And they're certainly too large, but they're not aberrations. I'll show you some other samples soon, at which point you might find yourself having to call Zapf \"infantile\"...   \n   \nMonotype spacing: aren't these the people who duplexed the widths of the italics with the roman? Gimme a break. But I can never figure out if that's worse than Linotype's inability to kern. Hello?!   \n   \n\\> Has he told you of his intentions?   \n   \nI have his phone number, but it's in France.   \n   \nPlus it's possible he wouldn't have had traps in his drawing: it's a technical improvement that the \"house\" would do. Just like Monotype even did Gill's spacing for him (poor guy).   \n   \n\\> Hrant believes bad presswork improves type   \n   \nNot at all. But I do believe that bad presswork _exists_, and happens more than 50% of the time. Not including traps (in a text face) is a form of artistic denial.   \n   \n\\> I am wasting my time in sharing my knowledge.   \n   \nExactly what knowledge is that? All you've shared is your _faith_ that traps aren't just useless (that would indeed be something open to debate), but they didn't and don't _exist_.   \n   \nAs for bad presswork, I highly doubt that you have ever produced anything half as fine as Gerald does with one hand tied behind his back.

That's not infantile, that's _pragmatic_. Just like my willingness to drive a beat up car to work (which I don't do in _any_ car anymore, happily) instead of staying home - which is what the car thing was actually about.   \n   \n\\> perhaps their type can always look good?   \n   \nNo, never say always! For example the way Gerald (maybe both of them) ideally likes to print, traps should be much smaller than the way most people like to print (or more like: end up printing).   \n   \nThe more you know about your user, the more focused you can be about fine-tuning your work. If you're making a font for a phone book for example, you put very large traps. But usually, the only vague thing you know about your user is that he has little idea what gain is, and will introduce a fair amount of it when printing. The reason is that too-light printing is more objectionable to your average printer than too-dark. But that results in deformed type outlines. Hence, moderate trapping (not to mention use of a lighter weight, as explained in Lange's book).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I think it is safe to say that traps, while useful in instances mentioned previously, can also be a reason that some designer's don't buy them as they might be seen as an \"ugly defect\". Before I knew what traps were, and before I stopped trying to use Futura X-Black Condensed on everything, I would remove the traps in the N and the Z because I thought they were ugly. Although I still do find them to be ugly.   \n   \nHrant, you have also pointed to me instances when some designer's are using them as an effect and not utility.   \n   \nCouldn't it be said that most type is printed on decent paper or rather most type is not printed on newsprint.

One of the most popular fonts out there. And Speikermann's highly-popular stuff has trapping too. And -like you say- they can even double as aesthetic devices. Maybe not in a Garalde, but certainly in something like Proforma for example. And then there's Amplitude of course!   \n   \n\\> So most type does not need traps.   \n   \nConsidering that most type is printed [well] in offset, that would be true... but really the trick becomes to balance any aesthetic negatives of traps that are too large against their functional benefits in lower fidelity printing. Since it doesn't seem to me that too many people mind small traps even in very large point sizes, I think small traps do have a place in almost any text design.   \n   \nAnd there's something else: traps aren't just for fighting gain, they also help optically, in small sizes.   \n   \nSo my basic conclusions are that:   \n1) A good text face generally has some light trapping.   \n2) In some cases (letterpress, bad paper, very small sizes) you need substancial trapping.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

But I maintain that you can be useful, even though it increasingly seems that your only real reason for being here is to \"celebrate\" what might be seen as your former self, and lambast anything that might show any shortcomings of your Glorious Past. It's like a religious festival for you. But not for anybody else here. Few people really care about your past - I certainly don't - I don't even care much about mine. The past is only relevant to the extent that it helps make a better future - the rest is merely nostalgia. And for you to participate well in creating the future, you have to be capable of _learning_. There is no teaching without learning. You need to do both, but have done neither so far, at least not here.   \n   \nKnow that my role isn't to correct your behavior here - I am not your mother (and no, I don't like poetry). But if you resist the urge to submerge yourself in this quicksand of your making, you can be useful not just to yourself, but more importantly, to the craft of type design. To be useful, you have to maintain a certain objectivity, a certain cool analytical attitude that's borne of fairness. When you:   \n- Completely distort what I say (eg: gain is good; optical spacing is bad)   \n- Leave important questions hanging (eg: that quote from your site)   \n- Totally contradict accepted facts (eg: the well-known limitations of Monotype and Linotype)   \n- Flip-flop your position (eg: the pantograph's precision)   \nthen you don't help anybody or anything - you hinder.   \n   \nI will not let you distract me from making this discussion useful. The questions (many of which are thinly veiled attacks) you have asked that I have decided to ignore simply don't deserve [direct] answers. And when you say things like \"Hrant likes imitating ink smear\", I have to simply gawk in amazement and wonder how somebody with a brain could claim the opposite of the truth and expect people to take him seriously.   \n   \nWith that out of the way, let me try to separate the wheat from the chaff.   \n   \n--   \n   \nThere is increasing confusion about what we're really discussing. That's typical of discussion lists, and once in a while -but not too often- it's best to reign things in and focus a bit.   \n   \nSome of the questions -directed at anybody- might be:   \n1) When did trapping start?   \n2) In what circumstances is trapping useful?   \n3) Is it useful just for fighting gain, or optical aberration, or both?   \n4) Did the pantograph have a limitation when cutting inside corners?   \n5) What are those things in the Pascal 60 scan?   \n   \nPlease choose any/all of those questions, and answer them as carefully and as elaboratively as you can.   \n   \n--   \n   \nAs for Jim Rimmer, I appreciate his generous attitude. But I also note a trace -fortunately only a trace- of the smug self-celebration in him too. It's OK, pride is important. But really, nobody is being \"fooled\", and if that's what it is, then indeed people _are_ being \"fooled\"! So please, let's approach this with enough self-confidence of character, but not too much of [past] practice. First, one must realize that there is more trapping these days than there has been for decades.   \n   \nAlso, I wish Jim would stop participating by proxy. Once is OK, but more is damaging, especially when the editing is so poor that one can't tell where Jim stops and Giampa resumes.   \n   \nBTW, I'm not hiding anything about the limited nature of my experience with metal type. I have spent a total of only about 60 hours working with foundry (not hot) metal and letterpress, but since they've been spent under the guidance of Gerald Lange, they've been productive hours, and have involved getting a feel for the relationship of inking and pressure, as well as looking very closely at quality types from all over the world. I have a lot to learn, but I'm very happy to have started with a clean slate: it helps me avoid hand-me-down \"religions\" that cloud the objectivity of otherwise intelligent people.   \n   \n--   \n   \n\\> But do you think Hudson is a hack too?   \n   \nNot at all.

      "content": "For those of genuine interest in hot metal knowledge.   \n   \nBelow is written by Jim Rimmer.   \n   \nThe first time I became aware of the principle of ink-trapping was in the late sixties, where in lithography, it was applied to a few situations, not especially typefaces. It was something that never seemed to catch on; it was simply though of as having no particular merit. In those days of crude (by today's standards) technology and processes, many things were tried to improve the quality and sharpness of type. One thing was to ADD mass to letters in certain spots. With my lack of ability to scan something and show you I will have to verbalize: On the corners of letters (particularly things like big blocky stuff like Helvetica Extra Bold, lettering artists (I was one of them) were paid good money to blow up the stats of the type and actually brush in spurs onto all of the corners. The feeling was that the camera was guilty of burning off the corners of all the angles, and in an attempt to counter that, the spurs (added matter) were painted on.   \n   \nIf the type went down in size from the 288 point size to 18 or 24, the corners looked great, and you couldn't really see the little spurs. However, if the same art was used larger, it used to completely piss off the unfortunate client. Well meaning art director and account execs had to spend a lot of time convincing the client that weird was good for them.   \n   \nI think that this a little like ink trapping: If it works at ten point . . . great . . . but you can't use the same font at 36 pt. or bigger because the behind-the-scenes bits start to show up.   \n   \nRegarding my comment that the pantographs at Lanston left a small radius that Lanston did not see fit to nick out with a graver, let me qualify that.   \n   \nThe radius we are considering is no more than .003\". Just so were are on the same page, that\n\n"

But you also -if to a lesser degree- can't use a 10-point font at 36 point anyway! Or vice versa. Optical scaling rules.   \n   \nAnd of course in metal, you _physically_ can't do any scaling, so it's even safer to use traps.   \n   \n\\> that\n\n"

But I can never figure out if that's worse than Linotype's inability to kern. Hello?!</cite>\n\nNo, it was Linotype that duplexed the widths of the italics with the Roman.\n\nMonotype spacing divides the em into 18 units. However, a Monotype machine is routinely adjusted for the em width and the actual point size of the character separately. So a 12 point typeface can be 11 3/4 set, which means that 18 units will equal an 11 3/4 point em.\n\nATF foundry type, on the other hand, is designed so that the width of every character in every point size is an exact multiple of 1/4 of a point.\n\nSo Monotype divides the point into 72 equal parts, although the characters of any given typeface in any given size must be multiples of a larger unit. Typically, that unit will be larger than 1/4 of a point - but the good thing is that characters divide the set width into 18 parts whatever you set that width to, so they scale properly.\n\nThe 9-unit system of the Selectric Composer (achieved by squeezing the M and W; it's equivalent to 11 units in a Monotype em) isn't visibly coarse, so 18 units to the em is likely quite adequate.\n\n"
