The other store is in North Beach, about a block from the [Transamerica Pyramid](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608182143/http:/www.tapyramid.com/). There's more info on Stout's [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608182143/http:/www.stoutbooks.com/).   \n   \nIf you are looking for just interesting neighborhoods with lots of type there's always some great stuff on the streets in the Mission district. Haight Ashbury is pretty good as well.\n\n"

Best to call ahead. You should also check out Green Apple Books [http://www.greenapplebooks.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608182143/http:/www.greenapplebooks.com/). Arguably the best bookstore in the City. If you can make it to Berkely, then you should check out Seredipity Books [http://www.serendipitybooks.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608182143/http:/www.serendipitybooks.com/) by some accounts the best bookstore in the nation. Very knowledgeable about type. Enjoy your visit!\n\n"
