  "content": "Hi,\n\nI have around 2000 glyphs which needs to be renamed totally as most of them are more than 32 chars and truncated to 32 chars automatically by FontForge. This has created duplicate entries i think.\n\nWhat I need to do is give them a friendly name like GLYPH0001 - GLYPH2000.\n\nIs there any script which can do this. I will select the glyphs which i want to change and run the script in order todo so.\n\nPlease help.\n\nThanks & Regards\n\nNOTE: I am a newbie in fonts and fontforge.\n\n",

      "content": "> I ran the scripts\n\nWhat I wrote needs to be completed according to the way you use the code. I use such code in python scripts I call from bash shells. Above, Grzegorz wrote the script so as to call it from the GUI, using the \"Execute script\" window. Let me just add his lines to get a complete script to use that way:\n\n    ---\n    fnt=fontforge.activeFont()\n    for g in fnt.selection.byGlyphs:\n      if g.unicode != -1:\n         g.glyphname= fontforge.nameFromUnicode(g.unicode)\n    ---\n\nYou first select the glyphs to rename and then, in the \"Execute script\" window with that script in it you click ok. That script renames according to the unicode value, not to the hex digits that follow the uniXXXX name; it does not look at the name at all.\n\nNow here is a script that looks at the uniXXXX name. It will rename only glyphs with a name of the form uniXXXX and it assumes glyph names that start with uni are followed by a valid hex number, nothing else; it does not check that what follows uni is a valid hex number.\n\n    ---\n    import string\n    fnt=fontforge.activeFont()\n    for g in fnt.selection.byGlyphs:\n      name=g.glyphname\n      if string.find(name,'uni') == 0:\n        g.glyphname=fontforge.nameFromUnicode(int(name[3:],16))\n    ---\n\nAgain, you select the glyphs to rename, and click ok in the \"Execute script\" window.\n\nWhen you have many scripts, it is not handy to copy them all the time in the \"Execute script\" window. What you can do is save them in some file, say `unicode2name.py` and `uniname2name.py`. You then click \"File \\> Preferences \\> Script menu\" and give a name for the menu name, say \"Unicode to name\"; then you click on the three dots, go to the folder containing the script, put \"\\*.py\" in the the line just above \"Filter\" and click \"Filter\"; you will see the files .py appear. You select the one you want to associate to the given menu name.\n\nAfter, you can execute the script on the selected glyphs by clicking on \"File \\> Script Menu\" and the appropriate name associated to the script. You can also execute with some key combination (it is control alt digit on my mac).\n\nA script that checks that the hex values are valid and that handles alternates (.sc, .alt, .ss02 etc) and also glyph names separated by an underscore requires splitting the glyph name and handling piecewise. Here is one that checks that the hex is valid and that can handle names of the form uniXXXXX.sc.ss02 i.e. alternames of uniXX...X\n\n    ---\n    import string\n    ff=fontforge\n    fnt=ff.activeFont()\n    \n    def ishex(h):\n      return all(c in string.hexdigits for c in h)\n    \n    def gname(altname):\n      l = string.split(altname,'.')\n      name=l[0]\n      if string.find(name,'uni') == 0:\n        hexd=name[3:]\n        if ishex(hexd):\n          l[0]= ff.nameFromUnicode(int(hexd,16))\n          return '.'.join(l)\n      return altname\n     \n    for g in fnt.selection.byGlyphs:\n      g.glyphname=gname(g.glyphname)\n    ---\n\n"

For example first script:\n\n    import fontforge;\n    \n    def rename_unival(arg1,font):\n      for g in font.selection.byGlyphs:\n        if g.unicode != -1:\n          g.glyphname= fontforge.nameFromUnicode(g.unicode);\n    \n    def EnableSel(arg1,font):\n       for g in font.selection.byGlyphs:\n          return True;\n       return False;\n    \n    fontforge.registerMenuItem(rename_unival,EnableSel,None,\n    \"Font\",None,\"Glyph_names\",\"Rename to unicode value\");\n\nSave them in change2uni.py in .Fontforge/python/ directory, and now You have new menu item 'Rename to unicode value' in a submenu 'Glyph\\_names' of the 'Tools' menu (of the Font window).\n\n"
