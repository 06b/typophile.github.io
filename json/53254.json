  "content": "Is there something like a print proofing before release of a typeface needed? I have created a sans-serif for general use in short texts and wonder if printing it in a few places would help me in better adjusting the outlines (ink traps etc).  \nI know that Mr José Scaglione had a speech of such stuff at ATypI. Maybe it is not necessary and I am just too nervous?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

      "content": "I don't know much about low-quality printing, but I'd say the same is true if you are going to use high-quality offset printing, between 2,400-3,600 dpi. This is especially important if there is any contrast in the letterforms. You are apt to find that fine lines are too fine. Probably less of an issue with a sans, but maybe not. For instance, new designers sometimes specify a .25-point rule, because it looks fine on the output of a laser printer. They are usually disappointed when the book comes out. It takes a .33-point rule to work with high-resolution offset printing, esp. on uncoated paper.\n\n"

And, as I understand, the only \"non-deceptive\" solution is a high-quality offset print. (Because below there is a plenty of devices generating more and more odd effects like \"it's good to see you, but I won't depend on you\").\n\n"

Another reality is that putting pixels on the screen is an equally important feature of \"type.\" Or even words on an old-fashion TV set, as with advertising.\n\nHigh-resolution offset printing is only one of these. What to test for -- and what weights & details of a font you decide to offer -- depends on where you perceive a market for it's use.\n\n"

But since I discovered my home printers produce unrepetitable effects (once a stem is too thin, once - thick), I started to use them for checking glyph outlines in big magnifications only. I am sure I could \"dedicate\" the typeface for my printers, anyway ;)\n\nWill it be a mistake: to print the typeface on a variety of popular devices, to test the details, angles and weights; if any wrong effect appears frequently - check it; then try printing it on a silkscreen or offset to see how it behaves in better quality?\n\n"

If something shows up really weird on laserprint or high-quality inkjet, they will probably also be weird on offset -- even if that is much higher quality.\n\n"
