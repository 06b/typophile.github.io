Now \"boring\" can be taken as an emotional response; all I can add is that there is a difference between \"boring\" and \"unobtrusive.\" Unobtrusive is good for long academics texts, boring is not.\n\nAs to the weight (lightness) -- it is hard to tell on the screen, at the size shown. Here is a trick: Gentium is also a free font, and because of the extended character set, quite useful for texts where only the word processor is used (laser printout). In my experience, Gentium prints well enough on a laser printer, but is too thin to print well on an offset press, where the plates are made from the computer files (direct to plate offset printing). If that is your intended use, download Gentium & compare it. If they have generally the same weight, it is too light for offset.\n\n"

At your request, I did go to the website, but the downloaded PDF shows only boxes, not characters here at home, on my wife's Mac. I'll have to wait until I get into the office to see what's what.\n\nBut based on the small sample above, the bowl of the \"a\" doesn't fit other letters, the top & terminal of the \"f\" doesn't know where it is going, the descender of the \"y\" doesn't balance quite right, and the serif on the upper arm of the \"z\" (which probably reminded the original poster of Caslon) seems out of place. I get the impression, again from the small sample, that the font doesn't quite know whether it is suppose to be slightly condensed or slightly expanded.\n\nI fully grant that the sample is small, & if I saw the full character set it might seem to have better balance.

      "content": "I've spent the last 25 years setting long academic texts (usually in the humanities), and have a couple of observations that may apply.\n\nThe first is, if you are setting material that will be printed offset, you need to see how the font prints that way, not on a laser printer. Generally, the font will appear rather lighter when printed offset.\n\nThe second is to avoid any fonts with a EULA that prohibits modifying them for your own use, as do all the NEW Monotype & Linotype OT fonts. The reason is you will inevitably come across a diacritic or character not in the font. Now from 1980 to 1995 (when we started using PostScript fonts), we also couldn't get inside the font to make up special sorts (glyphs). For diacriticals, you can work around this, but it helps greatly to use what is now called a \"layout engine\" that lets you program things, like TeX. Imagine setting 400 \"emacrons\" with a font that didn't have this character, where you couldn't program it.\n\nThen there are special characters, which you sometimes just can't properly render from existing characters. The \"eng\" comes to mind. So you either borrow one from another font, or pay the foundry to make one up. The foundry's special sorts will be both expensive & slow to come.\n\nI, for one, rejoiced at PostScript Type 1 fonts. Yes, they printed too thin, esp. with direct-to-plate offset lithography, but you could fix them. That was the beauty of them, with a weeks worth of work, you could make something that printed well, and you could add characters as you needed them. Nothing much has changed with OT, except those licenses (EULAs) which with one stroke take away the advantage of truly \"Open\" type.\n\nThere are enough foundries out there who permit modifying a font for your own use, that permit embedding, etc. that you should pick one of those. After 25 years, I don't have a \"favorite\" font, I like 10-12 for text, but part of that appreciation is how they work for the text, and part of \"working for the text\" is the ability to make up special sorts.\n\nFWIW\n\n"

But I'll confess it helps a lot when the foundry offers something other than legalese -- Like Adobe's FAQ's on licenses.\n\nThere was a Harvard (Yale?) law professor who was, shall we say, down on Credit Cards. In one of her senior law classes, a student came in & showed her an offering where you got money back. As an exercise, she had the class try to determine under just what conditions they'd get money back. At the end, after hours of work, they could not reach common agreement.\n\nNow, not all Harvard (Yale?) law students are dumb. And these were seniors, about to head out into the world. So what chance do you think you or I would have?\n\nIn a way, I prefer the EULA's which say, right in the font on the copyright page in FontLab \"You can't do a damn thing with this font.\" At least I'm sure about what they're saying.\n\nOne of the interesting things about Adobe's license is it seems to forbid modifying the font, but when you read the FAQ, it's clear that modifying under certain conditions is permitted. The interesting thing is, according to Thomas Phinney, that the same lawyers wrote both the EULA and the FAQ.

      "content": "Charles\\_e, thanks for your comments. I find that there is an underlying issue here which I have not expressed.\n\nIn a production environment where there are several layers of service, everything has to be kosher, no modification means no modification (one could be sued, or worse, moralized at). Eulas allowing for modification make for much more efficient workflow, bringing us closer to typographical nirvāṇa. Also with digital texts increasingly being associated with the printed text, it is important to have proper unicode encoding rather than manually combining diacritical marks with letters in TeX/InDesign.\n\nInterestingly, it is the free fonts which are working hardest to provide full diacritical complements: Gentium, Linux Libertine, Junicode, Cardo, DejaVu Sans, and others. These fonts are appearing because there is genuine frustration among scholars, which includes graduate students, who need to use diacritical characters not found in the standard fonts. For example, I know of a Buddhist Studies mailing list for scholars only, with several hundred members, and I guarantee that each one of them has some sort of non-commercial solution for writing the \"n-dot-under\" (in the word nirvana, above) and the other Sanskrit and Pali diacritics. This is because there are no commercial fonts available that include a full complement of diacritics. (Gentium would be a good reference point for what to include.) Scholars are not software pirates; they are generally willing to purchase things that meet their research needs. Scholars are also vain, and so there is a certain pride when the laser-printed manuscript or conference paper is printed in a nice font with all of the proper diacritics. Publishers with are increasingly asking for manuscripts in unicode. There is a definite market for reasonably priced fonts with extended diacritics.\n\nMany software companies have academic licenses. Why not for fonts? The stipulation for educational and not commercial use would justify the necessarily low price while preventing its use by publishers and presses. A commercially licensed version could include small caps, figures, superior numbers (for footnotes, of course), etc. and be sold for a normal price.\n\nA single good quality serif font, with the diacritics of gentium, in the standard 4 faces would be enough. It doesn't have to be the latest Sabon, but it should be a serious text font. A matched sans would be a nice option too. A tt/ot font is preferable because ms word 97, 2000, and xp have problems accessing extended character ranges in ps/ot fonts.\n\n"

      "content": "wizz -- just to get a bit back on topic, (for Typical), The situation with free fonts and academics can still be confusing. I'm at home & away from everything but a computer hooked to the net & almost no other software. But as I remember, Gentium's EULA forbids modification. Less sure about Junicode.\n\nAnd the problem, at least in the states, is deeper than finding one good font. Academicians, if they teach in the States, want tenure. To get tenure, you usually need a couple journal publications and a book. Now a journal, if it is printed, will have a set of fonts which are always used. And a book will be designed by either an in-house or freelance designer at a university press. Will they have time (a cynic would say have the interest) to see if the font they choose for the text has the needed diacriticals or special characters? Perhaps, but don't place a heavy bet. The number of fonts suitable for a book interior containing the characters needed for transliterated Arabic or IAST is real small. I can't think of any offhand. Some of the work we get is due to this very situation.\n\nMy point is, how a manuscript appears is is valuable only for the manuscript, not for typesetting. But you are quite right -- for the author's files to be useful, Unicode should be used.\n\nI wonder if Adobe would be interested in making up, say Minion, with the needed glyphs. Now Minion may be viewed by the designers-whose-primary-aim-is-to-impress-other-designers as \"boring,\" but it is more than serviceable for book interiors. I have over 1,000 fonts at work, but when I design, I specify Minion reasonably often, because it fits the author's work and my understanding of the intended audience.\n\nThings may be different along the Pacific Rim, but in much of the world, there is usually a difference between a <cite>manuscript</cite> and a finished product -- not that this is necessarily a good thing.\n\nFWIW\n\n"

      "content": "I would definitely agree with Miss Tiffany here, although my heart sometimes bleeds, and temptations crawls through my arteries - when I get a license for a software, it is generally prohibited to modify the software without the constent of the person who made it. When I get a design, it is usually not allowed to modify it without the consent of the designer. Period. Unless the programmer or designer explicitly says otherwise. I know it. You all know it. I don't really care about laws here. It is common sense, it's good behaviour. We all hate other people messing with our work. Okay, I think we do. I, at least, hate it.\n\nI sometimes pay good money for software that I my hands are just itching to re-write it. I sometimes buy fonts where I simply yearn to get in there and correct the characters, because a few of them are just BAD, spoiling the whole damn typeface.\n\nBut that's just the way it is. When people do not like something I did, I also like to tell them that they are wrong, that they have no sense for art, and that they can go to... well. I hate to find out that these people then simply \"steal\" the software and modify it without my consent. I hate to see them change my designs although I told them not to. It is rude. I don't want it. So I respect other people who do not want it either. Although it.... really... tempts me sometimes :-) But I resist. Go away, Darth :-)\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>When I get a design, it is usually not allowed to modify it without the consent of the designer.</cite>\n\nAs an occasional designer -- and somebody who knows many graphic designers -- I'd say that doesn't fit. The customer/art director/senior editor etc. will make some changes. I don't know how to say it in German, but the English word \"Art\" has several uses. It is sort of like art for it's own sake is art, and can be accepted or rejected (bought or not). On the other hand, something that has an aesthetic element, but where the intended purpose is something other than art, doesn't have the \"don't change it\" aspect of fine art.\n\nIt is that \"other purpose\" at issue here. So, if you don't like a typeface, don't buy it -- unless a customer insists on its use, in which case you can decline the commission, or accept it & hold your nose. But if a typeface is generally what is wanted by all, but in some small detail fails to perform its intended purpose (it is incomplete, had one really bad character, etc.), I would view that as different.\n\nGentium, proposed above as a solution for certain kinds of academic texts, has no ligatures, no old-style numbers, no small caps, and no kerning. That it lack a bold doesn't bother me, but would bother some. Now these aren't \"small details,\" they move the font from once category to another. Additionally, the overall aesthetic of Gentium is less than ideal for some texts, good for others, as with any single typeface. So, Gentium solves one kind of problem for academic authors, generating a manuscript which anyone can follow. That was its purpose. It does not solve another problem, namely publishing. Having the freedom to \"modify\" other fonts solves this problem.\n\nThis is just one example,there are many, since it would be absurd to insist the font designer anticipates all the uses of his/her product. It doesn't even make sense to say the painter \"didn't foresee the uses of their painting\" -- unless you get political, where nothing make sense.\n\n"

I am primarily a scholar but I have done the layout for a very limited number of publications and recognize that a nice page involves more considerations than I will probably ever be aware of. My main concerns come in two areas: 1. the manuscript to print transition could be a little smoother if there were more fonts with more diacritics; 2. I am still looking for a font that will fulfill my research needs with Sanskrit diacritical letters and satisfy me aesthetically. (It looks like I will purchase one and then add the diacritics.)\n\nOn the topic of eulas, I read through a bunch of old threads on eulas (and there are many). Too bad we can't send our own eula with payment--\"By accepting this payment you agree to the following terms: 1...\"\n\nAlso, there was a thread a couple years ago about changing the font licensing system to pay per use.

After opening 8 layers of superb packaging, we pop the CD in only to realize the stock art is nothing but scanned in BMP files, which we found useless, so asked for our money back if we returned it. I then got to see the absurd wrath of Chuck explaining that as a powerful graphic design firm, us opening the packaging forever bound us to their EULA which prohibits returns.\n\nIn otherwords, by purchasing said product, we waived all rights to customer service in their mind...and how DARE we question it.\n\nNow, I'm sure Chuck isn't as insane as he was in those emails, but for some reason, folks go into insane mode when it comes to issues of their own IP and EULAs.
