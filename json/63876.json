So instead of it saying Futura and then having the weights on the right each weight bold, light, ect. has their own name.\n\nIs there any way I could take those fonts like that and some how make photoshop recognize them as a family and not different fonts?\n\nI posted this in general too I will remove that one.\n\n",
