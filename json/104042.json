I'm making this logo for the swimwear brand (men and women) that I am doing.\n\nI'm not satisfied with the B, and when I look at it all together it just doesnt feel right. I'd like to hear your suggestions and ideas to improve it.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821232938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bainlogo%20typophile_4752.jpg)\n\n",
