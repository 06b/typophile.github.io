Close, but not it — the mystery font’s diagonal legs of the K and R curve up.\n\nI just saw this and 20 other choice title sequences at the Mill Valley Film Festival’s presentation, “Typecast,” with designer David Peters. He couldn’t recall the name of this typeface.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ Digital alternative to hand-painted type on boat](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006194954/http:/typophile.com/node/50069 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [modern serif font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006194954/http:/typophile.com/node/50193 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
