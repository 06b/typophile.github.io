The play controls or whatever they are are odd - what does the plus mean? There were no tooltips to let me know.\n\nIt's still a lot more usable than most design flash sites, and looks a lot nicer. :)\n\n"

His site loaded in less than 3 seconds on my computer, and while the \"full screen\" doesn't work in the best way, the site did work just fine in FireFox.\n\nOh, and in my experience, the plus sign always means \"click the plus sign for more\".\n\nJoe - I wouldn't tell people your age in your bio. Too much information, and it's more likely to work against you than for you.\n\nAK\n\n"

( that's a joke btw, it's about experience and knowledge of our industry imo.)  \nRegardless I think I heard this statement enough that I should remove it.\n\nBut I will be updating my site a bit further with a Blog about stuff I see here and there to contextualize my personality to the work I do. And I will be fixing what I can on that slideshowpro flash swf. I think their are some gizmos I can turn on and off including the + and the full screen options. I think if I remove the full screen and either remove the + option or include a bit of a project description when you click on the + that would be a nice feature.\n\nIt's still a work in progress and I wish you all thanks and for taking a second for the comments, critiques, and praise. I'll link you all to a personal wall paper illustration I created feel free to download it!  \n [http://www.sisudesigns.com/submission/beginning.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015154912/http:/www.sisudesigns.com/submission/beginning.jpg \"http://www.sisudesigns.com/submission/beginning.jpg\")\n\nSincerely,  \nJoseph Maguire  \njoemaguiredesign.com\n\n"

That said, I'm not sure you really need flash. The one thing that I miss mostly on all-flash sites is the ability to bookmark specific pieces of work to show others.\n\n"

It's not flash that takes page bookmarking away, it's the site owners who don't write their own code.\n\nSorry if I sound snippy, but I have clients all the time that say \"no flash\" because they believe the two top myths; it can't be bookmarked, and it can't be spidered by search engines. Neither has been true since about 2003.\n\n"

I have a flickr account as well as a behance.net account. I get a tremendous amount of traffic from my subpages like that.

Just saying that's something I look at. Not a make it or break it issue.\n\nAs for Flickr...be careful...I know they've been (or were, at least) cracking down on NON-photographic work being posted in there.

Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement - that good stuff. But that turns out not to be the issue anyway (FF, latest flash, fast connection)! It's just a very bizarrely slow slideshow. I expected a movie... or something, and the first time I visited, I didn't stay on the homepage long enough for the second img, just long enough to see:\n\n-Loading circle  \n-Static image  \n-Loading circ-  \n \\*click on a link I am bored\\*\n\nAnyways, it's obviously not a problem for anyone else.\n\n"
