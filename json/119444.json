  "content": "Greetings, fellow type enthusiasts!  \nA couple of years ago, I came across [a thread on Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416033627/http:/typophile.com/node/31682) about the \"Spice Girls font\", a typeface I've been intrigued by ever since I first saw it in 1998. This font has been searched for by many, _many_ people many, _many_ times, but has never been found. The Typophile thread I mentioned did, however, yield a possible lead: the pre-digital typeface called Tempor. (Thanks, Mike F!) According to my (admittedly limited) research, a specimen of sorts was published in _The Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces_ (on page 157 according to Solopedia -- though I might be wildly off there). Unfortunately I am unable to obtain a copy of this book at the moment, so I ask: if any of you could please be so kind to upload a scan of this specimen of Tempor, I would sincerely appreciate it. It's a mystery I would _love_ to help solve.  \nOh, also, if anyone has _any_ information on it, such as the name/s of its designer/s, foundry, known digitizations, I will love you forever!  \nThanks for reading. :)\n\n",

Sigh.  \nI know the typeface I'm looking for is not custom because I've seen it used a few times over the years on a wide range of things. For example, [the logo of the French charity AIDES](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416033627/http:/media.meltybuzz.fr/article-839395-ajust_930/logo-aides.jpg) and a video cassette titled [_Secretos de la Trilogia de Regreso al Futuro_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416033627/http:/pictures2.todocoleccion.net/tc/2012/12/29/DSCN7505.JPG), which I assume is a documentary about the _Back to the Future_ films.  \nThe latter item tells me that the typeface has been in use since at least 1990. Gosh, I wish I could figure this out!\n\n"

From what I can tell, Spice Girls fans have been trying to figure out the origin of this particular typeface for ages. For that reason, I can't be sure if the typeface was ever widely known or distributed. It might have came on a type CD-ROM package (a very 90's way of distributing digital typefaces).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416033627im_/http:/typophile.com/files/spice_6302.png)\n  \nI lifted this from a Spice Girls autograph sheet. A lot of later samples are horizontally stretched out of this world. \n"

But since it's stumped all type ID communities across the world, maybe it is time to definitely close and accept the evidence... SPICE GIRLS will never return and even if we identify the font.  \nTo me, from what I could see from this CD covers is they're at least 2 different fonts (or 1 font and 1 lettering). /S from 'SPICE' woodmark has a horizontal transition not the one for text.  \nThe text one looks like [Europa Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416033627/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/europa-grotesque-rr) (less is [California Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416033627/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/california-grotesk) mainly because of /a spur). That said it could be not so hazardous to accept the idea 'SPICE' would be a custom lettering, derived from Europa Grotesk (and very easy to recreate actually).\n\n"

Yeah, I'll admit it (although I'm pretty sure it's painfully obvious): I'm a Spice Girls fan, have been since I was 13, and yeah, the Spice Girls are definitely _not_ coming back. I'm happy with the fact that they're done, actually; their new material on their _Greatest Hits_ release proved that they're no longer the success that they were back in the late '90s. (Just between us: the new songs were AWFUL. There, I've said it!)  \nThank you again for your contributions, ralphsmouse. Appreciated. I, too, have wondered about it being some obscure early digital type, the product of a long-defunct foundry, or simply a face that was offered for a time and then taken off the market (it's downright painful when that happens!).  \nThe closest I've come across is House Gothic -- particularly its Bold Alternate Caps -- by House Industries; the 'S' is remarkably similar -- the other letters ... eh, not quite.  \nOh, and thank you too for your input, Riccardo. I love being around knowledgeable type peeps.\n\n"

Note the diagonal on \\_S\\_ and sloped center strokes on \\_s\\_ and \\_a\\_ which are in the style of Europa.  \nThe appropriate lowercase for a font matching the logo is pure speculation. IMO the Tempor model is more appropriate than Europa for letters such as \\_s\\_ and \\_a\\_.  \nDon\n\n"
