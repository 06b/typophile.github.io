  "content": "Hello everybody!\n\nI could use some font inspiration, and since I've been a ghost reader for some while I thought I'd come out of the closet. I really admire how such a great number of users in here can give great advice, so I would be very grateful to get the same.\n\nIn short: I need an awfully sleezy, kitch, ironic corporate font. I'm looking for the kind of commercial aesthetic, that just yells: \"Save big, buy now, get 2 for the price of one, 100% satisfaction or your money back\" etc.\n\nI doesn't matter if it's a really low quality free ware font. In fact, it might help.\n\nThink about your worst branding nightmare basically...\n\nAnd then why do I why want to do this? I'm working on a graphic project in collaboration with a researcher in critical sociological theory, so the theoretical background of the project may be a bit to long haired just for now (I'd be happy to talk about it though). But in short: the project is about the possibility of critique, or lack thereof, in contemporary society.\n\nSo far, our concept is a fictional corporation (no name), that sells \"critique\" in various forms, for example: (1) critical coaches or corporate critics, (2) critical cleaning-cans that make all \"bad employee critique\" vanish etc.\n\nMy specific contribution this time will be a number of posters over this theme, that should work as our corporation's commercial ads.\n\nI'm not sure if this is good enough information, so please ask me what I mean if it's not concrete enough.\n\nCheers,  \nMalte\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks alot for the suggestions. Most of them were exactly what I was looking for. After working a bit more on the project though, I've come to decide that I wanted a bit more realism. I would be too easy and not dangerous enough to just make it ironic. I want to show how our mock-corporation actually could be a future possibility. So I ended up using something slightly different: Eurostile LT Std Bold Oblique. I found that it suited the job, with its round (cf. the comic fonts), yet solid (cf. impact) look.\n\n"
