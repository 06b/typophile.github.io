What I'm looking for is a font I know I've seen recently that mimics this style -- points of light/ink, some of which are brighter/wider than others. A super-simplified bit-map, in other words. Also, I don't recall if this was actually an alphabetic font or not; it may have just been abstract patterns of this style.\n\nIncidentally, this was a kind of display used in very early mainframe computers (EDSAC, in this case), but searching for it along those lines hasn't yielded anything yet.\n\nThis is just right on the tip of my tongue.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n",
