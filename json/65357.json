What would you like to see, what would you visit?\n\nThe reason I'm asking is because that's just happened to me (and some co-workers)! We have been given some money and time to go on a study trip. Preferably Europe, but New York could be an option. The catch is, that it has to be relevant for our work (we're all teaching graphic design, typography, photography) :-)  \nSo, any ideas?  \nThanks!\n\n",

You'll see a lot of it in four days (on foot), and it's a place very into \"visible language\"\\*, with Latin, Armenian, Cyrillic and Arabic (Farsi) all over the place\\*\\*. You'll see how fonts, logos and visuals in general can get distorted\\*\\*\\*, or improved upon. Plus it has good food and cool architecture, it's inexpensive, and most of all very hospitable and safe.\n\n\\* [http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157621930145718/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203414/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157621930145718/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/sets/72157621930145718/\")\n\n\\*\\* [http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130151382/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203414/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130151382/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130151382/\")\n\n\\*\\*\\* [http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3798351518](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203414/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3798351518 \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/3798351518\")\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, the Armenian script seems to stride a very  \nfruitful border between the familiar and the alien to a Latin-scripter:  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130109730/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203414/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130109730/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4130109730/\")  \nIt's exactly the sort of thing that can inspire and liberate a designer.\n\nBut: what time of year?\n\nhhp\n\n"

New York is of course tons of input and crazy, but 4 days might really be too short (mind the jet lag).  \nBut given that you're open to discovering something a bit off the proverbial beaten path, I actually (whole-heartedly) recommend Armenia too! I traveled there last summer, and found it very stimulating in terms of visual input: indeed, familiar (and hospitable) enough to not make one feel out of place, yet foreign enough to be surprising and inspiring. It's an amazing, rich culture to discover; and seriously obsessed with letters too. (Plus your bag of money will definitely last longer than if you come to Switzerland…)\n\n"
