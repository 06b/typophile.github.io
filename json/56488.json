  "content": "The Obama administration today made a move to bolster the communications industry by establishing a new agency that would report to NEA but have direct interaction with the Whitehouse Press Secretary. The new \"Office of Integrated Typography\" would be tasked to clean up the now chaotic use of typefaces in the Federal Government and create standards that would be followed by all agencies. The Public Printer, director of the Government Printing Office (GPO), could not be reached for comment but sources close to the Library of Congress (LoC) revealed that Jonathan Hoefler was seen leaving a meeting with the heads of GPO, LOC,and NEA at an undisclosed location. Hoefler's firm (Hoefler & Frere-Jones) developed \"Gotham\", the typeface used by the Obama campaign in their successful bid for the Whitehouse.  \nA press conference was scheduled to make the announcement but then postponed to allow a background check by the IRS. The President had recently suffered a spate of cabinet candidates who had undisclosed tax reporting issues.\n\n",
