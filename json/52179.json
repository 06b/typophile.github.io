  "content": "In Fontlab Studio, under OpenType Specific Names there's a third field called Mac Name. I usually leave it blank. When I hit Build Open Type Names it fills Mac Name with the contents of Full Name on the previous page.\n\nIf I enter \"Bill Gates Rocks\" in this field, where will it show up in an OTF or a Win TTF? Who will see it? Are there advantages to leaving it blank or not leaving it blank?\n\nI have to generate a few hundred OpenType fonts and was wondering if I need to blank out that field a few hundred times or not.\n\n",
