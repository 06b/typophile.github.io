  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI've been studying type for several years now but haven't sat down to begin designing a full font until recently. I got my hands on Fonts & Logos by Doyald Young and have been working my way through that, and as a compliment to what I've been reading and learning I started designing a font based on lettering I found at local historic locations.\n\nI've sketched a few of the more complex lowercase letters (to get an idea about caps height, diagonals, bowls, widths, etc) but now when I look at them as a group I feel like I'm looking at totally different fonts.\n\nAny advice about what I'm naively missing to tie all these together? Or additional pointers? Any critique is much appreciated.\n\n-Sean\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [photo 1.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416162317/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%201_7.JPG) | 776.25 KB |\n| [photo 2.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416162317/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%202_4.JPG) | 559.17 KB |\n\n",
