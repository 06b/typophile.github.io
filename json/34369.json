  "content": "I thought this would be an interesting variation on the usual type ID.\n\nI often pixel sketch initial design ideas but obviously I will do the finished version of this logotype as vectors. I was wondering if there is already a font with similar letterforms. I thought the R and A would be enough for an ID.\n\nIt seems too obvious not to already exist, but if it does have any originality do you think it would be worth developing into a full typeface or have I just reinvented a wheel?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817010357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RadarLogotypeTypophile_4070.gif)\n\n",

I really like it tracked out like that, it's got a 50's world fair look about it, space travel for civilians, self-cleaning kitchens, optimism, but it still looks contemp. and stylish. Nice work.  \n--N\n\n"

      "content": "I have to second Nicholasgross on not having to worry about any possible similarities to existing fonts. Honoustly, a wheel can only be invented once, but it's what you do with the existing idea that can make all the difference. Your specimen shows a lot of potential & I for one think it's definitely worth further development. I recently wrote a whole text about how innovation is far too overrated in my opinion (pretty much everything has been done at least once somewhere before) & what makes a true artist is how he/she combines all existing elements to a personal & interesting whole. Maybe I wrote the whole thing from a kind of selfdefensive position, but mainly because I hàte it when people only judge things by their originality (and I don't really like being called creative in that view because of a certain connotation the word has gotten by now). But I'm drifting off from what I really wanted to say... My conclusion & advice: GO FOR IT! ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, everyone, for all the feedback and ID suggestions.\n\nBit of a shame it was all so positive :-/ Criticism is often more helpful.\n\nChalet New York 1970 is possibly the most similar ID suggestion and Asvetic's suggestions come close in a few places too. But, yeah, I think there's enough differences to make 'Radar' worth developing. If I can find the time.\n\nNicholasgross - I'm glad you got a retro futurist vibe from it. That's exactly what I was aiming for with this logotype. It's for branding a chair design which has a 50/60's feel about. It's all curves and made from tinted translucent plastic in a range of groovy colours.\n\nAnyone feel like collaborating on this font? I can do the vectors and you can do the tedious font work. I guess I envisage 'Radar' as just an all caps display font; unless someone want's to try a lowercase.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130817010357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RadarFontTypophile_3543.gif)\n\n"
