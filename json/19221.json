  "content": "Hi there!! : )\n\nI'd like your opinions (always valuable) on this new typeface FH After. It's still on development... I would say more on a finalization/fine tuning design step of the process.\n\nMy main objective is to create a very distinctive display, with an \"international style\" quality. To be used by innovative companies, no matter where...\n\nIt's design also provide some nice experimentation on some daring ligatures that I wish to work on a little deep.\n\nAnyway, what's your point of view??\n\ncheck out at:  \n [www.focodesign.art.br/others/After\\_01.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417145012/http:/www.focodesign.art.br/others/After_01.pdf \"www.focodesign.art.br/others/After\\_01.pdf\")  \n [www.focodesign.art.br/others/After\\_02.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417145012/http:/www.focodesign.art.br/others/After_02.pdf \"www.focodesign.art.br/others/After\\_02.pdf\")\n\nMany regards from sunny brazil!!!\n\nFabio Haag\n\n",

      "content": "It's got a lot of character, in a good way!\n\nGetting the spacing seems difficult, it may indeed help to make some of the characters narrower.\n\nThe gamma-like r is a bit odd, but I'd be reluctant to normalize it too much. I don't like the clockwise @-sign. It's extremely bulky and self-conscious. Also, consider getting rid of the serif-like protrusion on the stem of the ß, it seems out of place in this typeface.\n\n"
