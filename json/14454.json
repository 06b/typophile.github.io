  "content": "Help. I’m frustrated. I work for a computer science group who builds model-checking software. I am in the process of redesigning their logo. I have attached a file that shows what their original logo was, and what I have done to redefine it. I need some help and/or feedback. The Santos group has several software projects, and they need one logo that will represent them all. The various individual projects include model-checking, software verification, and construction of high-confidence software systems…if that means anyone to the technical readers out there. I feel that I have improved on what they had before, but I think I can still go further. Let me know what you think.\n\nThanks,  \nBen\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [santos\\_redesign.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522215838/http:/typophile.com/files/santos_redesign.gif) | 12.41 KB |\n\n",

Good or bad, that’s what I see. Beyond that I’m not sure what the S could mean or infer. The leaning “o” doesn’t strike me at all. \\*Shrug\\*\n\nCheers.\n\n"

No, the logo doesn’t need the mark, but I felt it might be nice to create a symbol that would be easily recognized and associated with our group. The concept behind the mark is very abstract…much like the work we do at Santos. I chose the interlocking S for santos(not abstract), and broke it up to show how our model checker makes software complete (more abstract). I guess I need to really sit down and look at what we do here…which is difficult for me. I don’t think like a computer scientist; i think like an artist.

Loosen up the letterspacing and under the name use “software verification” as a division (smaller) and the same your other diciplines, and color code each division. Color coding is not pracitical for print but for your web site it makes sense. In print you could use tints of a color, but make sure they are 20% differences. That is what the eye can see as different.\n\n"

Well, it would seem like a good idea, if it didn’t remind me of IBM.\n\nBut if you want to convey the idea of software becoming complete, it could work, though something else to give it direction would help that along. Something like an arrow could emphasize that the software (or whatever) on one side is making a transition and becoming complete on the other, rather than just being broken. A simple triangle could do the same.\n\n"

The software projects are not commercial yet…in case that makes a difference. Our main audience is the U.S. Dept. of Defense and various University Computing and Information Science Departments around the world. It seems as though we have a very narrow audience. Any other comments? Thank you, in advance.\n\n"

Your strap line is going to fight a losing battle against print technology at smallish sizes you might need to go to two or three lines or abandon the justification and let ir run the full width of the logo and print it in black.  \nTim\n\n"

They all are connected and you could even put them in the right order, if that is apropriate for the corporate communication.  \nYou could colour the separate blocks and use these colours as identification for the divisions. Each division has his own colour and place in the cycle.
