The Bertham Pro family includes 4 fonts: the original roman weight designed by Frederic W. Goudy’s Bertham and three new styles (bold, italic and openface) created by Steve Matteson.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015101955im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bertham_3912.png)\n  \nThe Bertham Pro fonts include a variety of OpenType features including swash capitals, small capitals and old style figures. Bertham Pro has a distinctive quality that is unmistakably American in appearance recalling a day of quality craftsmanship and hard work.\n\nView the fonts at [www.AscenderFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015101955/http:/www.ascenderfonts.com/font/bertham-pro-family-4-fonts.aspx)\n\n",
