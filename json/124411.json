  "content": "I'm not a designer myself, but I am a fan of nice fonts. It's been quite interesting to see how much interesting is being paid to typefaces these days.\n\nBy profession, I'm a programmer, so I need to use monospace fonts for nearly everything. While I've heard people gushing on about Helvetica, I've never seen much discussion of fonts that could replace Lucida and Courier.\n\nCan any of you point me to some excellent, readable, beautiful typefaces that follow the monospace standard?\n\n",

On my screen, at least, its rendering seems crisper. I know little about font rendering, but perhaps its narrow width with tight curves helps with this. Also, compared to the other two, scanning words is easier yet it is still easy to descern crucial details such as punctuation.\n\n"
