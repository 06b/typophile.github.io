  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI would like to ask if someone has a recipe for exploring a content of OpenType font. OK, I know, that the Glyph Panel in InDesign is pretty comprehensive — I can filter the Small Caps, I can filter Oldstyle Figures, I can filter Ornaments, or even Ligatures , but I am looking for some way to get a summary like this:\n\nFontName.otf:  \nThis font contains:  \nExtended Latin A & B  \nGreek  \nDiscretionary Ligatures  \nOldstyle Figures  \nSmall Caps  \n…\n\nThank you.\n\n",

[See here for details](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803170527/http:/answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/32-bit-extensions-for-64-bit-windows-font/1904ca19-d99a-497f-b8b8-56b6341ccc49), plus there's a Dropbox link for 64-bit near the bottom of the page. It's a .dll file; you put it in “C:\\Windows\\System32\\” folder, open command prompt as admin and type the following to activate it:\n\n%windir%\\System32\\regsvr32.exe %windir%\\System32\\TTFExtNT.dll\n\n"
