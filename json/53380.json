      "content": "Luciano, as you probably know, it's a foregone conclusion that you won't find a consensus of opinion about letterspacing -- and it's not just a matter of taste, or variations in the letterspacing sensitivity of various contributors (although both of these are important factors); but there is also the question of whether or not you take into account the interior spacing of the letters as you adjust the spacing between the letters. Some do, some don't.\n\nFor what it’s worth, here are my thoughts: I don't agree that the D needs to be moved to the right. If anything, it needs to move to the left a little. But the main problem for me is that the letters ISU seem to me to be significantly tighter that either the letters at the beginning and end of the word.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_When going from_ A to Z,  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I often end up_ At Oz.\n\n"

      "content": "I think that, from a type design perspective, the cohesion of the letters is so wunky that a different face should be chosen as a starting point. The weight of the heavy serifs (proper term?) on the S vs L are mismatched, the inner counters/arcs between D U and S are inconsistent, and the blunt apexes on the A and V seems out of place to me. Also the S seems to wide.\n\n"
