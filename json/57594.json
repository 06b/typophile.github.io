CURLZ MT: \"Curlz MT is not a font; it's a cry for help.\" + \"Common abusers: Middle-aged ex-cheerleaders trying to hold on to the magic\" + \"Probable famous user: Britney Spears.\"\n\n2. VIVALDI: \"Look! It's like I really signed it! Even though it's on a computer!\"\n\n3. KRISTIN ITC: \"ITC = I Teach Children\" + \"Don't you see how playful these letters look? You are talking to someone who is young inside!\"\n\n",
