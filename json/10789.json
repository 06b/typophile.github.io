Metrolis have few weigths because this work was commission by Wolff Olins (Portgual-Lisbon) to a exclusive use so you will find only the regular, italic, bold and the respective signs. To clearify better the ideia Bliss was design by Jeremy Tankard and he devolopment a special version (PT-Bliss) to the Portuguese Telecom company. Funny every day I take the Lisbon Underground and this typeface is very familiar to me and probably you almost see me making my type correction in side of the train. ;) One more time sorry about the mistake. I just arrived at home and I only now check the information.   \n   \nUm abra\n\n"
