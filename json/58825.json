I am trying to use the [Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20090611090620/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php), and the a, e, J and g are the only key letters in your sample and I’m not finding it with those. Is that the complete J (no truncation of the lower end of the hook?)\n\nMaybe if you have a more complete sample, you could try it too.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
