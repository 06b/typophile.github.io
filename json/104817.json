Don't know when the Hermès Logo was designed, but it seems a good prospect that the designer based it on [Memphis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072619/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/memphis/), designed by Rudopf Wolf for Stempel in 1929.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "More info:  \n---start quote---\n\nHermès font here refers to the font used in the logo of Hermès, which is a French high fashion house specialized in manufacturing leather products, perfumes and apparel.\n\nThe logo of Hermès that has been used since 1950s features a Duc carriage with horse, which represents Hermès’ beginning as a harness workshop. Beneath the carriage with horse is the logotype of Hermès as well as the lettering of “Paris”, where Hermès was established and has been headquartered. The font used for the lettering of Hermè is very similar to a font called Memphis Medium.\n\n---end quote---  \nsource: [http://fontmeme.com/hermes-font/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072619/http:/fontmeme.com/hermes-font/ \"http://fontmeme.com/hermes-font/\")  \nDon\n\n"
