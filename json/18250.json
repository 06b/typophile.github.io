The large x-height? No change in stroke width? Simplicity? Schoolbook ’g’ and ’y’? Typewriter serifed ’i’ and ’l’?\n\n"

Now that you point out some subtleties, I guess it’s really a combination of all those things – plus the fact I like it’s overall ’feel’ and they way it renders on screen. I only wish it had small caps.\n\n"
