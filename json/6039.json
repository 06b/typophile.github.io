  "content": "hello everyone, this is my first time in the forum and I love it! so much helpful info.   \nI guess i thought of this topic because I myself am depressed. this is primarily due to he fact that I have not been able to design my own buisness card (never truly happy with my results). I also find myself to be extremely self critical of my own work. This inturn makes it hard to start design projects. I'm pretty sure this is common among other designers. maybe some feedback on this matter will help me as well as other designers.   \n   \nIM\n\n",

Minorities are often depicted in an unfavorable way, this is due to the fact that minorities have not taken a true interest in promoting a good self-image. Often the image displayed are from people who have no idea what it means to be a minority. This depiction become our an unwanted representation of who we are. example: I find it desturbing to see minorities in movies cast as \"maintenance workers\" or \"waiters\" things like that. I would also like to be able to help design better products for companies who export their goods to the USA. I belive better design promotes economic growth. This is my goal.\n\n"

      "content": "I have designed many business cards and logos for myself over the past 40 or so years. I have never had any of them printed. I look at them a few weeks later and say, \"I can do better.\" What you have to realize is that you grow as a person and a designer every day so you will never design something good enough for the you who will see it a few months from now. There is a place where you have to say, \"This will work for today.\" and just accept your human failings as they are. You cannot ever be perfect but you can be satisfied to know you tried your best in the amount of time you had. Remember, a business card, above all, is just a place to put your name and phone number, not your soul. Take the pressure off of yourself.   \nTake 4 hours only and design a card. Print it on a Laser printer, that way it does not seem so precious or so permanent. If in 6 months, you can't stand it, do another 4 hour maximim card and go about your life.   \n   \nMy family came here to the US from Greece. We are such a small minority that nobody even knows we exist. I have worked sweeping floors in a resturant, as a laborer in a steel mill, and as a laborer in a construction job. It was hard, dirty, tiring work but it was honest work and nothing to be ashamed of. I worked my way through college and now work in an office as a designer but I am the same person I was in the steel mill scraping slag with a pick and shovel.   \n   \nDon't worry what biggotted fools may think of your herritage. You know better. Be proud of who you are inside right now, today. Don't measure your success as a human being by the size of your bank account--certainly not by the comments of fools.   \nThe way you talk about your dreams to make the world a better place tells me you have the soul of a great man. The best thing you can do in this world is help others and love your family. You can do that as a designer as well as anything else.   \n   \nBest of good luck to you,   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"

I feel like this is the front line, as it were. Sometimes I get waverings of depression thinking \"Garrgh, no-one cares!\" but choose to ignore it and get stuck in. I like the challenge of severe time restraints now, quoting and charging accurately are very interesting. I was also afraid that my type desiging time will get eaten into, but have decided to do some of my proofs on small signage jobs! Pretty cheeky, but I reckon it will be effective.\n\n"

I am currently designing a buiseness card for myself. It includes simple yet elegant type letterpressed on 100 percent cotton card stock. Now the design element I want to incorporate is the use of custom made rubber stamps of some of my \"type\" specimens and artwork. Since I will make several rubber stamps I'll have a few unique cards I can distribute to clients. I feel this will give the design a feeling of individuality and imagination. And if I ever get tired of a specific image I can just have new rubbrestamps made. What do you think?\n\n"

My late colleague and fellow member of the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz, suffered from severe depression despite the fact that he made the Forbes list of the richest people in the world. Clinical depression is a medical condition that should be treated. Occasional depression is something else. Perhaps we take ourselves too seriously at times and that we should find ways to lighten up. I'm sure Mr. Lozos, who was in Vietnam would agree, that there are so many more opportunities to enjoy life when one isn't being shot at. Even then, things could always be worse, no matter the present situation. Descartes, a brilliant mind of the enlightened 17th century, said: I think, therefore I am. It may sound trite to you but it works. I hope this helps. Good luck.   \nPG   \n [http://giam.typepad.com/the\\_branding\\_of\\_polaroid\\_/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052545/http:/giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/)\n\n"

Worse still was when the fighting was so bad around our building that we'd have to go down to the bomb shelter. Usually I could convince my parents that we were essentially safe in this central room in our 6th floor apartment\\*, but I remember the time my mother went to the kitchen to get some hot water for tea, and the light from the candle she was holding attracted an RPG straight into the laundry room next to the kitchen. We all ran to her, she was OK, but then a second one hit the division between our floor and the lower floor - basically half a meter higher and we would of all been toast. We were all deaf for a few minutes. Then my father glared at me and said \"We're going down to the shelter now\"... But that was just a bit frightening, not a \"lowpoint\". The major lowpoint was when a close uncle got assasinated. His son recently wrote a great book, though - I highly recommend it:   \n [http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743222830.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052545/http:/images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743222830.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg)   \n   \n\\* Some of my best work painting D&D miniatures was done by candle-light in that room, with Kalashnikovs and mortars raging in the neighborhood, with the beautiful, primordial prayers from the mosques blasting to encourage the fighters.   \n   \nMy theory is that you miss _anything_ that happened during your childhood. And if your childhood was messed up, that simply results in you having a messed up sense of what's healthy.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
