  "content": "Just found this on a resume writing site,   \npet peeve #14 apparently. Surely this   \nconfirms that what we read most we read   \nbest! And that all magazines and newspapers   \nare printed in Times New Roman. HA!   \n   \n# 14 - Poor Font Choice   \n   \nWhen creating your Word Attachment resume, keep your font simple and easy to read on a computer screen. Be kind to your reader. Do not use italics or extremely difficult to read fonts like Edwardian Script. Font size is just as important as style. 8-point fonts are too small to read, even for Superman.   \n   \nMicrosoft seems to have settled on 10 point Arial as their default font in most of their applications. People are accustomed to reading such on their computer screen. For headings, recruiters shared that 12-point bolded is the best choice.   \n   \nRecruiters told us that that second best choice is Times Roman as every newspaper and magazine is printing with such. Once again, people�s eyes are accustomed to reading text in this font. However, 10-point Times Roman, (unlike Arial), is too small for a computer screen. It is recommended if you choose Times Roman, use 11 or 12 point. If a resume is difficult to read, a recruiter will simply move onto the next one.   \n   \n [http://resumedoctor.com/PP\\_Artical15\\_14.htm#14](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525174514/http:/resumedoctor.com/PP_Artical15_14.htm#14)\n\n",
