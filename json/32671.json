When my daughter was one and a half probably half of her vocabulary was brand names, and she could certainly recognize logos well before she could read. She often made this type of ’mistake’ where a sign used, say, a Starbucks or Disney style font to advertise something else.\n\n"

You really don’t quite absorb how pervasive advertising in our culture is until you have a child. Our 5 year old was pointing out brand names almost as soon as they started talking.\n\nWhen he was 3 we were at a gas station and he started saying “Hey! I’ve been there!”. Took me a while to figure out what he was referring to. Turns out he had seen a 2” Lienenkugel logo at the bottom of a poster on the wall and had remembered the brewery tour he had gone on with Grandpa.\n\n"
