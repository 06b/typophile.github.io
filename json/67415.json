Some of the best I can think of are, Esquire, GQ, popular mechanics, GOOD, Monocle and Plastique.\n\nHere are some samples from Anthem magazine's recent redesign\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/feature286_5950.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/feature287_5309.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/feature288_3907.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/feature289_4291.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/feature290_5536.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204529im_/http:/typophile.com/files/feature291_4142.jpg)\n\n",
