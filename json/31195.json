      "content": "From the Fontlab Ltd. perspective:\n\nFontographer is quite simple, easy to use for people who have learned it well, and very reliable (on Mac — the Windows version did not age so well). However, the current version is a bit dated, produces poor-quality TrueType fonts and no OpenType fonts, so it’s only good for making Western Type 1 fonts (but it is really very good at doing that).\n\nFontLab Studio is more complex, a bit less reliable. Version 5 is also reasonable easy to use given its complexity. People who have taken the time to learn the switch from Fontographer to FontLab Studio can work in it as fast, or sometimes even faster. Currently, the great advantage of FontLab Studio is its user community: you will find many tips and tricks here on Typophile or on the [FontLab forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20070217102042/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/), and most of the professional type designers use FontLab Studio. The [Leslie Cabarga](http://web.archive.org/web/20070217102042/http:/www.fontlab.com/Typographic-Resources/Font-Typography-Books/Learn-FontLab-Fast/) book combined with the official FontLab Studio manual give you quite good documentation. And of course, FontLab Studio allows you to produce not only Type 1 fonts, but industry-strong TrueType and OpenType fonts.\n\nFontlab Ltd. is working on new versions of both Fontographer and FontLab Studio, and I cannot at this point tell you much about them, other than that we intend to develop both lines of products.\n\nIf you compare Fontlab Ltd. applications to Apple’s sound editing applications, then TypeTool is GarageBand, Fontographer is Logic Express and FontLab Studio is Logic Pro. Oh, and AsiaFont Studio is Logic Pro with all possible plugins ;)\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

I am doing well with my kerning pairs so far. Not sure when I will check out FontLab. But thanks so much for your help.\n\nRichard\n\n"

It seems when I choose next character the program moves onto the next character inthe order not the next one to kern…\n\nIs there a way to select all and create pairs automatically?\n\nRichard\n\n"
