      "content": "I agree with my time in Ad Agencies. One of the ones I worked for was marginal at best (mid sized), it made its money from pitching. Nationally they would be the third or even fourth agency chosen to pitch an account and would always loose the pitch either coming in second or third. At first I didn’t understand how they stayed in business but it occured to me they got a big fee to pitch for each account. We often spent 20K to 50K per pitch. The agency eventually partnered with another agency from Canada that looked at the business model and pullled out. After that agency went down faster that the Titanic. Another one bites the dust.\n\n"
