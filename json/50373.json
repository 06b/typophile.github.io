Everything is working correctly except for some entries that are in ALL CAPS (because they are in all caps in the catalog as well).\n\nNow, is there anywhere in any style (TOC styles or paragraph styles) where I can set the case to “Sentence case”? Like I do now manually by going to Type - Change Case - Sentence Case.\n\nThe only options I see there for case are Normal, All Caps, Small Caps and OpenType All Small Caps. I really want to set the TOC to Sentece Case. But how?\n\nThanks in advance.  \nPedro Peixoto\n\n [‹ Lost link – FOUND!!!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050626/http:/typophile.com/node/50376 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Serrano: a custom typeface for Bank of New Zealand ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013050626/http:/typophile.com/node/50053 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
