I asked the main musician behind the band but he wasn't totally sure. He said it was based of old english, but thats the only clue I've got.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [000-ayreon-01011001-advance-2cd-proof-2008.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419141203/http:/typophile.com/files/000-ayreon-01011001-advance-2cd-proof-2008.jpg) | 46.35 KB |\n\n",

It's probably not a straightforward font either way.\n\n"
