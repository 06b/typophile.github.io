Please go to [www.bacardi.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130323145538/http:/www.bacardi.com/ \"www.bacardi.com\") and on the very first page you come to, look at the welcome line in gold. I need to know what font 'BACARDI' is written in as a client has seen it and likes it. I'm sure I've used this before for something else but can't put my finger on it! Any help - greatly appreciated.\n\nA.\n\n",
