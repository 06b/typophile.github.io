The .reg text file covers all available options — they are the same for scripting.\n\nTo find out which is which (sometimes, names are a bit cryptic) do this:  \n(1)  \n— in the Options/Preferences Panel, save the current set of options  \n— switch on/off the option that you are looking for  \n— save this new set of options by different name  \n— open both text files e.g. in BBEdit and use “compare front documents”  \nThis will show you which entry was altered.  \n(2)  \nIn a next step, set the desired option to the desired state, again save options, and check the .ref file for the value of this option. Or “print” the value of this option by script.\n\n"
