  "content": "Hello, this is the second typeface I've designed so far (I'm a graphic design student). I set out to create a contemporary grotesk. Initially I added much more characteristics, like angled strokes (as in the lowercase e), etc. I've kept the extreme x-height. But now I've stripped it down, added more contrast and so on. It is not based on any specific typeface, except on personal preferences.\n\nI would like some overall feedback, and especially on:\n\n- Is it original? If you don't think so, please point me to similar types...\n- Legibility\n- Contrast & harmony\n- Numerals & punctuation\n- Style\n- I find a, e, s, g the most difficult, what do you think about those?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414211348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Kyniker-Bold_4532.jpg)\n\nThanks!\n\n/Marius\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Kyniker-Bold.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414211348/http:/typophile.com/files/Kyniker-Bold.pdf) | 16.04 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I like it. And I think it has charakter enough that it doesn’t need the “added” charakteristics. The angled strokes are rather distracting for my taste, especially on the ‘G’. I don’t like the ‘K’ and the ‘T’ is too narrow. The horizontal stroke on the ‘t’ looks like it needs to lean more to the right.\n\n"
