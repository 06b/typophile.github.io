      "content": "Any of several Scotch Romans, including New Caledonia as suggested by Kevin.  \nIn the days of metal typesetting, the character sets of a font were limited. To set special characters such as mathematical symbols the printer had to resort to an additional font of symbols, sometimes called, particularly in the US, a \"Pi\" font because it usually included the letter π.  \nI don't know if this particular page was hand set or in a font that could be used in a Linotype or similar machine.  \nBy 1957 photo-composition was replacing metal. So this is also a possibility for your page.  \nFor a digital substitute there are specialized math fonts or you could use a Scotch Roman with a good math component. You might look at Nick Shin's Scotch Modern [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317193942/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/scotch-modern/\")  \nFor more info on typesetting you might start with this wiki [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317193942/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting\")  \nDon\n\n"
