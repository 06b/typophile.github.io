Arabic fonts bundled with OS X do show Arabic samples by default (and Chinese and Japanese samples for those fonts)   \nHow do you do that?   \nI use FontLab and Apple font tools for OS X.\n\n [‹ Batching OpenType/features generation](http://web.archive.org/web/20070706062157/http:/typophile.com/node/10476 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [TT to MAC PS &#40;Or OpenType&#41; Conversion... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070706062157/http:/typophile.com/node/10574 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I hope to design an AAT Arabic font once I know more about Arabic.   \n   \nMaybe if no one here has an answer, asking on an official Apple mailing list would help.

This language identification of the font is not necessarily related to AAT but maybe to other issues more general in fonts or at least common in TTF fonts. I doubt that MS Arial which inludes Arabic range has any AAT but it still shows Arabic samples in Font Book.   \n   \nI'll post here if the Arabic AAT font I'm working on was successful.\n\n"
