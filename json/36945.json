  "content": "Ok, so, brilliant Typophiles, you’ve convinced me to invest in personal business cards. I believe my design is strong enough to warrant somehow finding the money for the custom die cut. Plus, I figure if I have a card I truly love, it alone can boost my confidence enough to get it out there more often.\n\nSo now I’m looking for the right vendor to produce the card. I’ve never sourced a custom die cut with low price as a priority before. Any advice? Google hasn’t been very helpful thus far.\n\nAK\n\nPS In the spirit of sharing, here’s my favorite printer - they have this AMAZING new machine that can print on any substrate with extraordinary beyond-photographic quality (plastic, glass, cork, a door ...!) It uses UV curable inks, which makes it the most environmental printer in the country.

All the ones I know about are in the SF bay area.</cite>\n\nThere’s a great green printer just outside of Washington DC—and they take it seriously, not just marketing gimmicks and lip service. Of course, with the newer restrictions on printing inks and the trend toward selling bales of waste paper for recycling, the whole industry will be green soon.\n\n"

Light-Works is great, but they do primarily large format printing, so I’m always looking for green sources for smaller media.\n\nLight-Works takes it really seriously, too, they sourced their new UV Ink printer from Austria, and I think they’re the first in the US to have both environmentally sound substrates AND printing processes.\n\nI had NO IDEA how toxic ink was until I read their website - and I didn’t know chlorine bleached paper produced dioxin (which is apparently second only to radioactive waste in toxicity - ick!)\n\nAK\n\n"
