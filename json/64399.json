With three widths, six weights, an extensive pan-European character set (Latin-Extended plus Cyrillic) and a set of glyphs designed to create “virtual ligatures” (accessible through the OpenType “dlig” feature), Łukasz has created a versatile, powerful display family. Unlike many constructivist typefaces, FF Mach does include a true lowercase, which makes it also suitable for setting shorter texts.\n\nFF Mach shows its decorative potential in a small [_graphic book “Machloye”_](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103090616/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/lukas834/sets/72157622440799276/) by Cracow-based graphic designer Łukasz Dąbrowski that has been featured on “Lettra – Sign and Letter” exhibition as a part of the International Print Triennial in Cracow. FF Mach has also been recently used in the identity of an exhibition [_“Added value.
