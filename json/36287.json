  "content": "I recently blogged about [typography in comics](http://web.archive.org/web/20090826045054/http:/rondomingue.com/2007/08/18/designcomics/) on my site. It was however brief and I like to go a bit more in depth with the concept on this forum. I worked in production/design at two comic book companies and the insistence of doing the word balloons and hand-lettered look always annoyed me. However, little has changed in typography for comics over the years, save perhaps the use of Adobe Illustrator to recreate the same dated look. Comics seem to suffer a permanent retrograde cycle when it comes to lettering when other aspects of it has evolved such as the art, coloring and paper quality.\n\nI cite two examples of books that break the boundary for comic book lettering. Both [Punks](http://web.archive.org/web/20090826045054/http:/www.punksthecomic.com/) and [The Nightly News](http://web.archive.org/web/20090826045054/http:/www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview.php?image=previews/imagecomics/nightlynews/01/cbrpage4-5_FINAL.jpg) do a terrific job at achieving some level of professionalism with the typography. I was curious if anybody else interested in comics can provide other examples. I know this has been under discussion here before I think its worth revisiting.\n\n[Comiccraft](http://web.archive.org/web/20090826045054/http:/www.comicraft.com/) is regarded as comics premiere font foundry although I’m concerned that they perpetuate the current style and rarely step outside of the established type styles. No slight to Comiccraft but its more of what the major publishers are looking for, than what they are willing to innovate with their typefaces. I would very much like to see other foundry’s be involved and help innovate an industry thats badly in need of a typographic overhaul.\n\n",

Even the most skilled comic artist have been challenged with illustrating a scene and then some character reading the Preamble. I think it requires a well thought out idea of layout combined with copy that fits the story.

      "content": "Ron, I absolutely agree that there’s a dirth of typographic experimentation. I think part of it has to do with the separation of tasks within the industry. Most comics have writers and artists. It’s rare when they do both, and most production schedules don’t accommodate it.\n\nHowever, we’re discussing non-mainstream books as well, where more collaborative work or single-artist works are more common. I think part of it is that comics are artist-centric, so their use of type tends towards that understanding. Often the subtle art of typography is too...different from the typical forms of visual expression, such as painting and drawing. Letters, words, and paragraphs carry an odd payload with them that can frighten away some from touching them at all. Others treat them as separate from the art, and their noodling just ends up widening that divide. Worst is when it makes the words harder to read. Word balloons are just safer, even with some typeface futzing/coloration.\n\nThis is a fasinating topic and I think there’s a great deal of unexplored territory. I wish I had more time now to get into it. Perhaps I can dig around for some better examples later this evening.\n\n"

The type they use is often too small or too dense to be appropriate. I like the aesthetic of _Punks_, but it’s hardly Swiss modernist except that it uses sans serif typefaces. Other times, the type and art is so gorgeous on one spread and then just terrible on the next, as in Ashley Wood’s _Lore_; beautiful painting and interesting type interspersed with pages and pages of poorly set Times New Roman. Ugh.\n\nI admit that I love hand-lettering in comics, so I do have a bias. _Jimmy Corrigan_ by Chris Ware and _Hellboy_ by Mike Mignola are two of my favorites, though there are others that do just as well that I can’t think of at the moment. [Here’s a nice Hellboy moment](http://web.archive.org/web/20090826045054/http:/www.zompist.com/bob43.html).\n\nGenerally, I find set type to be overly rigid for the format, and often too detailed and dense, unless it’s got some other element counter-balancing it. It feels out of place for me unless it’s incorporated in a more ’graphic design-y’ manner, rather than for dialogue. Brian Wood’s _Channel Zero_ is an example of this.\n\n"

Or even the usability, I know we don’t often think in those terms regarding comics and words with pictures is nothing new, but sequential art is another matter all together. You have different characters speaking all with different emotions and inflections. How do you translate that with typography or lettering?\n\nThis may sound a bit arrogant but I really don’t think a lot of letterers come from a strong typographic background (neither did I) however, I do feel that a lot could be gained from comics if they started exploring some of the modernist or post-modernist style of typography. I mean could you imagine if David Carson lettered the Dark Knight or The Watchmen done in Frutiger?\n\nYou are also correct about the separation of disciplines having a lot to do with the disparaging differences in the final outcome of a comic. If you have one guy penciling, someone else inking, another person coloring and yet another person lettering you will definitely have a book that is not consistent in style regardless how harmonious the working relationship is.\n\nLore,\n\nDave McKean is super cool!\n\nSi,\n\nI missed your comment earlier about if banks and corporations started using Comcicraft fonts—Would that be considered innovative? I guess innovation is the wrong word for what I’m suggesting for comic lettering. I just think there is an overall lack of traditional design in comics and a lot of the reason they fall behind artistically. They are hardly reflective of the contemporary art styles around them and that isn’t always a bad thing, but it also seems to hardly gain any influences from the outside. Again not all books suffer from this stagnation but a majority of them do.\n\n"

I don’t necessarily disagree, but I’d like to hear some people’s thoughts on why this should be the ultimate goal all the time. I was brought up on mainstream US comic books and strips, so my initial reaction is that the lettering should look like it was hand lettered, as this is what I’m used to. But I’m not sure that obeying tradition is enough reason to continue on as was always done before.\n\nTry to take a step back and look at the situation. Sequential art is (usually) a combination of illustration and lettering, and the tradition certainly has been to have an artist hand draw the lettering. However, lots of other media use combinations of illustration and lettering; book jackets, magazine illustration, album covers, just to name a few. Yet the lettering in these cases is sometimes typeset, and sometimes hand lettered. The ultimate goal is to achieve an aesthetically pleasing design, so the lettering needs to work hand in hand with the illustration. I’m not sure if sequential art is any different (may Eisner’s spirit forgive me!) In many cases hand lettering would be appropriate, but in other cases it may not. Certainly in the field of sequential art there is an expansive range of illustration styles, so I expect that differing illustration (and layout) will call for different lettering solutions. Shouldn’t each case be evaluated independently on the merits of the overall aesthetics?\n\nJason C\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t think it should be the “gold standard” either, however there should be some cohesion between the lettering and the art. A few comics are slowly departing from the “assembly line” tradition. Inking was born out of the inability to photostat pencils. Now we are seeing “digital inking”, where the pencils are sharpened and darkened in Photoshop. Some artist are coloring their own work and a few are lettering as well. Some of these practices will lead to some amateurish processes but I thinks its all part of a larger growing pain for American comics. Hand lettering will always be around as well as the word balloon, I’m not denying that. There is a lot of room for better typography is all I’m suggesting.\n\nA lot of the “norms” for comics was born out of the old press methods and has changed very little. Comics have been stuck in a lot of traditional processes for quite some time. The fact that we have a blue uniform Batman is simply because inkers didn’t want to fill in the blacks, so tradition stuck and solid blue was used often to translate as black. New artist didn’t know Batman’s uniform was black and just assumed it was intended to be blue.\n\nThe Japanese have indeed leap-frogged the Americans in terms of publication quality and format. Their hardcover books must be some of the finest design I’ve seen, even outside the comic genre. The Europeans have also took the lead in terms of story quality but that’s another discussion altogether.\n\n"

The goal really is to intertwine the text and art such that the reader can read the text in the story while simultaneously paying just as much attention to the action and feeling in the artwork. If this balance is off, you end up either just reading the dialogue and not really paying attention to the art, or you have trouble reading it at all and just end up looking at the art (I have that problem especially reading bill sienkewicz comics)\n\ni think the words should appear as if they are existing in the world of the art - within the frame of the panel, not on top of it. Digital bubbles floating on top of ink and watercolor always looks funny to me, and from a design standpoint, it is distracting. But like you said, there are many different techniques - When it is all start-to-finish digital you don’t have the same seperation, so its ok.\n\n"

It’s been ages since I’ve even glanced at Pogo.\n\nI think there’s something very valuable and unique about the hand lettering in comics that has developed with the form, and type seems too rigid in most cases. I find that most uses of type in comics separate the voice from the character, which can be an effective visual characterization technique, but is usually just jarring. Narrative voice is usually my preferred use of type in comics.\n\nThough I’m sure much of this is reading best what you’re most accustomed to.\n\n"
