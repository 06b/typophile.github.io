      "content": "Hi there,\n\nStrange that you have to supply a seperate file with the embossing, I usually just set the embossing area in a certain colour and then include a little 'Read me' file with the doc, explaining that this colour represents the embossing.\n\nAnyway, back to your question. WHen you say embossing outwards, its call de-bossing, just for future reference. You shouldnt have to make the embossing area bigger. With embossing it is a case of getting wet proofs done, each type of paper has different quilities, different embossing qualitites and so only viewing the actual print will be the only real way of certifying this.\n\nYou can always talk to your printer, and explain your situation, I am sure they can adcise you on what is best, they should know what to do.\n\nMatt\n\n"
