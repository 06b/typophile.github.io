A crystal goblet, to use Beatrice Warde's famous metaphor, isn't invisible, only transparant. Like good typography, it doesn't obscure the contents, but it can also delight with its own shape.\n\n"

In this case, the shape not only tells you what kind of wine you are about the drink, but also affects the bouquet and flavour.\n\n"
