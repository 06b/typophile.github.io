If anyone could comment on these logotype ideas I would be very grateful.   \n   \nThe logotype is for Pulse, a spatial design company (interiors, exhibitions etc) ...   \n   \n ![Pulse Logotype v.1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013032833im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40310.jpg)\n\n",

However, I like the exploration you're doing with the type and think that you could be on to something. Taking the idea of the word \"pulse\" could offer up some interesting solutions. What about establishing a rhythm in the design that helps distinguish one letter from the next. You could play with varying baselines or the idea of alternating letters getting closer and further away. I should also say that I like the way the \"s\" and \"e\" are connected in your 2nd example.\n\n"

      "content": "The first logo is too cryptic, I agree with Sally, that it is very hard to read, especially for an untrained eye. The latest post is much more legible, but still takes a bit too much effort to read for the avarage person. Imagine this logo in use on say a delivery truck, driving at 40mph and people trying to read it in a busy street. Consider all uses from web, signage, catalogs, b/w, color reproduction, etc... and think about this from the userbility   \naspect of the design versus the creative/artistic aspect.   \nI did design for a similar type of client last year. Simplicity is   \nsometimes the best approach. Like all work it is important to consider end user/consumer instead of just delivering something client/company likes. You are in the business of solving communication issues and not an artist. Consider how this company would grow with the identity you create. Test it   \nin black and white. small and large scale, blur it a bit to see how it would be recognized by someone with poor eyesight, dyslexia, etc...You can charge more money with this approach and make you business more profit, ands serve your client's needs better.   \nAs for what you have done so far. It is very nice and artistic and I personally like it, even though that really doesn't matter.\n\n"
