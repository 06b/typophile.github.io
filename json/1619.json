  "content": "I was walking to a movie theatre when i found a \"HIGH VOLTAGE\" sign on the ground. The sign was made to look like a stencil so they could attach it to a wooden phone pole and it would stand out. Anyway it looked cool so i made it into a font. Later i changed the curved lines to straight and added the original stencil tabs. this is the result.\n\n<center><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131017071905im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_gif.gif\" align=\"LEFT\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">voltage67<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131017071905/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/voltage67.swf\"><b>voltage67.swf</b></a> (1 k)</td></tr></table></center>!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",
