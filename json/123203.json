      "content": "Edited:  \nToday's Trivia -- addressed mainly to English speaking readers.  \nBerlin Alexanderplatz is an amazing novel by Alfred Döblin, published in 1929. It relates the story of Franz Biberkopf, an ex-convict, who has to deal with misery, lack of opportunities, crime and the imminent Nazism lived in Germany during the 1920s. During his struggle to survive against all odds, life rewards him with an unsuspected surprise but his happiness will not last as the story continues. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\\_Alexanderplatz](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219021720/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Alexanderplatz \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\\_Alexanderplatz\").  \nI have no information on the 1931 movie.  \nBerlin Alexanderplatz was made into a film mini-series for West German TV in 1980. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\\_Alexanderplatz\\_%28miniseries%29](http://web.archive.org/web/20150219021720/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Alexanderplatz_%28miniseries%29 \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin\\_Alexanderplatz\\_%28miniseries%29\")  \nI first saw in it the 1980s as a film art house series running about 16 hours. Its now available on DVD and includes English subtitles. I highly recommend it as a compelling story and character study.  \nRegrettably, The publicity for the mini-series did not use this period appropriate lettering.  \nDon\n\n"
