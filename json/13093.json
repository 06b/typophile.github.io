I can believe that it is customized, like flipping the a/e letters, or using an upper case i for the l (’el’). I don’t think this is the font, but see how close [Leger (T-26)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208135240/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/leger/regular/testdrive.html?s=paIgrave&p=48) would be if you flipped the a and used the u.c. i for the l.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
