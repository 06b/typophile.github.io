  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm posting two images that I would great appreciate help with identifying typefaces or finding similar ones:\n\n1.) A photo of vaudeville world wrestling champion Ernst Roeber's cafe in NYC in 1908. Can anyone recognize typefaces or know any that are very close to ANY of the type in this picture. It can be the prominent ones you see on the marquee or something from the window or smaller signage in the background.\n\n2.) This is a poster also related to Ernst Roeber from 1898. I posted recently to see if anyone could recognize the typeface(s) in it or something very close. People were kind enough to give suggestions but nothing has really come close yet so I thought I would give it another shot.\n\nThanks very much!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823223631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/roeber_cafe_5777.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823223631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/704px-Roeber_and_Crane_Bros_4355._Vaudeville_Athletic_Co.,_Ernst_Roeber,_champion_of_the_world,_wrestling_poster,_1898.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "On closer inspection, I have to conclude this is hand-lettered.\n\nAt the top, the letter 'R' in 'Roeber and Crane Bros' has four 'R's. Each is just slightly different from all the others. The same is true for the letter 'O' in 'Roeber' and in 'Bros'.\n\nExamine 'Champion Of The World', with emphasis on the lower-case 'o's. None of them are alike. Very similar, but each instance is just slightly different from all the others.\n\nWhen this poster was designed, hand-lettering was a big part of the illustrator's bag o' tricks. Today, that skill is almost a 'lost art', and that's a shame. The suggestions that have already been made are excellent, and will be your best starting point if you're planning to modify them to create similar letterforms.\n\n"
