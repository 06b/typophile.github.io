  "content": "I just found an old lettering guide from Pratt that was my grandfather's. It consists of a greenish paper folio heavy white cardboard printed with black. The Author is William Longyear. The publishers are Bridgman Publishers Inc. Pelham NY. It has 13 plates plus an explanation sheet. There is no date on it but I am guessing it was made in the 1920's or 1930's based on what I know of my Gpa. It's not in super fantastic shape - but it isn't ruined either. Is this interesting to anyone? If you have seen it, or know it, is there anything you think that is useful to study in it? Thanks!\n\nHere are some samples\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [000.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121208045613/http:/typophile.com/files/000.jpg) | 108.47 KB |\n| [001.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121208045613/http:/typophile.com/files/001_0.jpg) | 107.83 KB |\n| [003.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121208045613/http:/typophile.com/files/003_0.jpg) | 101.05 KB |\n| [002.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20121208045613/http:/typophile.com/files/002_0.jpg) | 100.07 KB |\n\n",

I picked up my copy just after college. First published in 1906 by Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons Ltd. My version is the 1969 reprint by Pitman Publishing Corp., New York.\n\nAnother Pitman book I've used is _Roman Lettering_ by L.C. Evetts (original printing 1938, my version reprint 1960). It has a long subtitle -- \"A Study of the Letters of the Inscription at the Base of the Trajan Column, with an Outline of the History of Lettering in Britain.\"\n\nMy personal favorite is just a tiny little book:  \n_A Book of Scripts_, by Alfred Fairbank. Originally published in 1949 by T_he_ K_ing_ P_enguin_ B_ooks_, my version revised and reprinted 1960. This was our textbook used in Paul Standard's calligraphy class at The Cooper Union.\n\n"
