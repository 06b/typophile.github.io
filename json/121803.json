  "content": "Hello there! This is my font called FUSION SANS. The idea behind it was to pair up with the font called Sharik Sans (which is the font I used to write out Fusion Sans). It's main purpose is to be in body copy on packaging for the Fusion brand. I wanted it to look simple, readable, but still pleasing to the eye.\n\nDo you think it pairs well with Sharik Sans? If not, do you have any suggestions?\n\nWhat do you think about the spacing on my test words and do my letters work well together?\n\nThank you all!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317183447im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FusionFont1_6428.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Since this kind of typeface emulates a pen stroke of some sort, it could be expected a modulation in thickness inside a single letter (here most visible in the uppercase). However, looking at your images, the strokes of |p| and |i| are overall darker than those of |a| and |n|, for example.\n\n"
