Is there any limit? Can I add more than one Liga feature in the same font (Liga1, Liga2...)?\n\nKonstantinos Siskakis  \nAnagrafi  \nGreece\n\n",

There is no practical limit on the number of substitutions you can associate with a feature (a feature is just a tag), but there are limits on the number of substitutions you can put into a single lookup table.\n\nWhat software are you using for the OpenType Layout?\n\n"

I mean that lookups have a maximum size, and hence multiple lookups might be necessary for a very large number of e.g. ligature substitutions.\n\nI don't use FontLab for OpenType Layout work, so someone else will have to explain the syntax to separate lookups.\n\n"

      "content": "As I understand it, the limit is 64K per lookup. The issue most often crops up with the `kern` feature, which can become quite large even in modest-sized fonts. You'll usually know you've hit the limit when your feature fails to compile and the error mentions something like \"offset overflow.\" (The `kern` feature is easier to deal with since it supports subtable breaks, so you can divide it into subtables with simple \"`subtable;`\" statements.)\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the order of lookup subtables does matter, just as with the order of statements and features. There's actually a flaw in my example code above; the lookups should be in the opposite order. If \"`sub f i by fi`\" runs first, then \"`sub f f i by ffi`\" won't do anything since every instance of \"`f i`\" has already been substituted by \"`fi`\". (Sure, \"`sub f fi by ffi`\" would work, but feels less elegant.) Be careful to keep potential conflicts such as this in mind when organizing your code.\n\n"
