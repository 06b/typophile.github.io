  "content": "Alrighty, I am wondering if there is word-processing software that allow this functionality, and what operating system it runs on.\n\nSuppose a company has custom stationery. They simply type up their documents in a word processor and print it on their paper and it's done. Branding applied!\n\nBut, if they were to try to save their file digitally for an email attachment or a PDF, the file would not have the branding of the letterhead because the page would be blank.\n\nIs there software besides indesign (I want consumer level word processing software) that has the functionality to have a template with branding that would be visible digitally in that file, or an exported format like PDF, but would be a no-print layer automatically?\n\n",

Ah wait I see a fly in the ointment - to have it not print automatically? That's a problem.\n\nHow about make two templates? One for printing on pre-printed material and the other template for other uses?\n\n"
