For example something like a word where every letter is from a different font can be made to work I think, it's just very hard to pull off without looking ransom-note-ish (or just plain bad).  \nIt might be an interesting alternative to look at font systems that combine multiple stylistic variants, like [FF Polymorph](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116144341/http:/fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_polymorph_ot/), or [the conceptual work that Letterror did for the Twin Cities](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116144341/http:/www.letterror.com/portfolio/twin/index.html) (the latter, I think, is not available as a font?

For one thing, really good logos don't use any type, and those that do only use a few letters.\n\nIf you have so many words in a logo that you can start using that many different faces, then you really aren't building a logo, but an advertisement.
