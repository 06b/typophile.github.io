  "content": "Suomi Type Foundry is a company dedicated to creating high quality typefaces. The company was founded by Tomi Haaparanta, who has been designing typefaces since 1990. Tomi Haaparanta's fonts are already distributed by Linotype, Monotype, ITC, T-26 and Psy/Ops, and in January 2004 he decided to set up his own font foundry.\n\nSuomi Type Foundry philosophy is to make extensive type families, so the user has more to choose from; too often you find a great typeface, but the weight is not just right. Our fonts often come with an average of seven weights, so it is likely that you will find the right weight. Also we do not want to exclude any users, so we try to keep the range of our type library as versatile as possible, from comfortable types for text setting to signage type families to evocative headline fonts for advertising.\n\n",
