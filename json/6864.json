      "content": "I like hummingbirds, and I like wood, but I don't see the connection. Do they already have a   \nhummingbird in their logo that you are preserving?   \n   \nAlso, you'll get alot more useful suggestions from the folks here if you tell a little about the company.   \nFor instance, does Woodnet serve wood suppliers or buyers? Raw materials like lumber or finished   \n woodworking pieces?   \n   \nThe dn ligature looks a little more like dh.   \n   \nNot sure about the font. It doesn't feel very \"woody\" to me.\n\n"
