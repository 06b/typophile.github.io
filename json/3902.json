      "content": "FontLab 4.5 for the Mac was just released yesterday. [Grab the latest demo.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102011251/http:/www.pyrus.com/downloads/FL45MacDemo.hqx) It runs on OS X and costs only $200 if you're a registered Fog user. The trial version runs fully featured for three days, so find three consecutive days you can set aside for testing before you install it. Mind you, the trial version of ScanFont made me decide to buy after just one day.   \n   \nThis software is a total dream. The Python integration will make it even more extensible. I have a number of scripts for it already, and a few big commercial Python add-ons in the works.   \n   \nYou need Mac OS 9.1 or later for the latest version. You can also run it on Windows, though I recommend either Win2000 or Win XP Pro. Good luck, and I hope it works for you.\n\n"
