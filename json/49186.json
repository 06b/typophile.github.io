I expect that there will be many that I can't ID, so I am going to use this board as a resource. If this gets annoying, just ask me to cool it.\n\nMy first movie puzzler is Federico Fellini's 8 1/2. The title itself is probably custom but based on a typeface, and the credits are some type of Clarendon/Egyptian/\\*Italienne\\* that I can't find. Anyone know better?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110416162158im_/http:/typophile.com/files/8_1-2_TitlePic_6522.png)\n\n",

It doesn't look like any typeface that I know, plus the \"D\" and \"I\" are noticeably different in the smaller and larger sizes. Notice that the serifs are about the same size, even though the letters aren't. The two \"F\"s look different, too.\n\n"
