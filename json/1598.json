So, i drew out the type treatment here, and would love a professional opinion. this is my first poster for critique, and im terrible nervous. please be kind. :D   \n   \n [http://www.kraftie.net/aloha.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725014919/http:/www.kraftie.net/aloha.jpg)\n\n",

(hehe)   \n   \nWith that outta the way heres what I would do with the bottom text since it seems to be a concert poster and you want people to get the info as quickly and clearly as possible. I'd also maybe work on the illustration a little to fill in the top more.   \n   \n ![sample image](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725014919im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1853.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Neh boo ... I dunno if i like dat'kine. :D   \n   \nkay, now first off ... yeah i see some of your points about the text on the bottom. I thought it was a little more dynamic than putting all of the venue info on a horizontal baseline at the bottom of the page. I was looking to do something a little more creative, but i see your point about it being a bit distracting.   \n   \n\\>\\> i'm seeing a slightly agitated face (the 'a's as eyes, the flower as nose, and the type below as mouth).   \n   \nhehe not agitated, the bottom curve is the chin, and the flowers a dimple, making it a smiley butt-chin.   \n   \nanyhow, thanks for all of the comments, this was just a fun experiment for two guys from hawaii. the screens have already been burned, no going back at this point :D\n\n"
