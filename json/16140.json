This newer style, which was popular throughout the 19th century, especially in the US, is what we now term \"Scotch\" roman, or Modern (as in Modern 20). DeVinne and Torino are further examples. And certain display weights of Century.\n\nIt seems to me that the first \"moderns\" of Didot and Bodoni showed a classical restraint and simplicity of design logic, whereas the Scotch moderns are romantic in their quest for the awesome, by exaggerating formal qualities: More contrast! Finer hairlines! Bigger serifs!\n\n"

But these did not affect the basic form of roman text type. What Morris did was like introducing a flashback into a movie or novel, disrupting the narrative sequence. His version of Jenson was not a revival, but a caricature; and a little later we find Cheltenham has become the most popular new typeface -- a post-Modern design that applies an industrial finish to old-style proportions.\n\n"

The stroke manipulation model of the split nib heavily influeces 'letterform-construction protocols'. Indeed, I'm not sure what protocols exist that are not dictated or informed by the stroke manipulation as combined with the ductus angle. The way bowls join to stems, for example, is very different in Baskerville's types from that employed in oldstyle types from Jenson to Caslon. This is precisely what I think of as 'letterform-construction'. The only shared protocols of the oldstyle types and the neo-classical are conventions of Italian humanist letter shape that precede both, and which are so general as to be uninteresting to contrastive analysis. Yes, both Jenson's a and Baskerville's a look like the humanist letter a, but it is everything that makes them different that is important. The relationship between them is not linear: Baskerville takes a step sideways, drawing on his experience as an engraver and responding to the stroke manipulation common in the handwriting of his day. There is no more a linear relationship between Jenson and Baskerville than there is between Arrighi's chancery hand and Bickham's round hand.\n\n"

William Morris and his kindred spirits are an exception. Even the nineteenth century sans serifs that are currently modern are derived, by contrast reduction, from expansion.\"\n\nWhat by the way do you mean by 'non-pen stress'?

The stress transition is too abrupt for a flexible nib -- it still carries a large blob of ink from the thick down stroke, and easing up the pressure abuptly will still leave a rounded terminal. If the stroke is eased off into the (right) serif, the shape takes the form of a bracket. The perpendicularity of main and serif strokes is a typographic form originally taken from ancient lapidary capitals, and applied to both typographic upper and lower case. The more constructed (ie built up by multiple strokes) forms of engraving and stone carved lettering don't have as much difficulty in rendering the \"modern\" serif.\n\nSo in the 18th Century you have the archetypal lapidary-derived serif being pushed technically by stone carving and engraving into a region that the pen cannot write, and type will not be able to match until Didot and Bodoni.\n\n"

The modification of letter forms for type, as opposed to hand writing, takes into account optical illusions and the goal of evenness of color.

      "content": "\\>same way that the ptolemaic way of describing celestial mechanics is mathematically ‘equivalent’ to the copernican way.\n\nUnfair temptation to an historian of science!\n\nOk, I give in. This is a revealing analogy. First, the Ptolemaic way--circular epicycles--never got the orbits as accurate as the when Kepler put elliptical orbits into the Copernican system. Then he hit it much more accurately. In addition you have to do the epicycles 'ad hoc', meaning that you have to insert them in different ways for each orbit after the fact. The ellipses give you the right thing for the whole orbit, right away. Then there is the matter that Newton came along and showed you could get the ellipses from an inverse square law and his laws of mechanics, which also worked terrestrially. Game over.\n\nThe way the ellipses in a Copernican system are not ad hoc I think also may point to the limitation of the utility of the moving front description. If you restrict the moving front to translation and rotation, then you get the 'ductus' (am I using it in the right sense John?) of pen drawn letters--the physics is right, following the analogy. But once you have unrestricted expansion and contraction, you can describe any shape ad hoc, which makes the model less interesting, as it is disconnected from any underlying physics.\n\nI think if you put rules on how the expansion or contraction takes place, then it stays interesting. For example, if you could specify a restriction on what kind of expansion can take place, and get Baskerville or Bodoni--or better yet one and not the other--then you would really have something.\n\nNoordzij's idea is already very revealing that the 'baroque' faces, as Bringhurst calls them, have rotation, whereas Jenson etc did not. But to get as much insight on later developments I think you have to put more constraints on the expansion and get it to match the facts. If no restrictions, then it becomes ad hoc and has less explanatory power.\n\n"

It would rather seem that the flexble pen should be the instrument _par excellance_ of the Rococo.\n\nBringhurst talks of both Neoclassical and Romantic types as having a rationalist axis. This seems to fit. It is as if, after the _romain du roi_, which rationalized the type surface, opportunistic use of expansion and the contrast it provides was able to happen.\n\nBut the question also arises how to think of romanticism in terms of a rationalist axis. (In the history of philosophy Kant is sometimes thought of in classical idealist terms, and Hegel in romantic idealist terms. Descartes and Hume, meanwhile epitomize two subcurrents with rationalism)\n\nI think there's still some work to do in aligning typographical history with cultural history.\n\nBringurst wants to use terms like Neoclassical and Romantic as 'genus' descriptors, by anology with biological classification. While I think the principle of genus / species thinking in type classification terms is fertile,I've wondered about the aptness of the terms.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>expansion underlies bodoni\n\nExpansion (stroke contrast) is a quality of broad and split nibbed pens. It is also pleasing at the most basic level, as an example of comparative proportion, found in the golden section. But the exaggeration of this basic quality (prior to the 19th century) of type did not come from the impetus of writing instruments.\n\nIt's extremely unlikely that type founders would have been inspired by calligraphers to produce the Didone style. In the first place, Calligraphers did not do vertical roman, because it is counter-intuitive. Stilted and wooden. You would need to use two pens to write a \"Bodoni\" -- a broad nib for the straight verticals and a split-nib for the curves. Secondly, it simply would not occur to a calligrapher to have any shape other than an oval for the heartline of a humanist (as opposed to blackletter) \"o\". The kinked \"heartline\" diagram you've linked to is theoretically possible, but physically impractical, if not impossible -- there's no leeway for even the slightest deviation without it looking cack-handed. Thirdly, calligraphers had been doing high-contrast lettering for centuries.\n\nThe spur to the Baskerville style was engraving, a form of printed reproduction in direct competition with typography. Consider the 18th century illustrated pattern books of Robert Adam, Thomas Chippendale, etc., where the exquisitely engraved lettering on the plates is directly comparable with the much cruder letterpress typography on the text pages. It must have been galling.\n\nAnd the famous example, Pine's Horace from the 1730s, where the whole book was engraved, after it had been typeset \"for position\".\n\nThe conceptualization behind Baskerville's rationalization is towards one end -- achieving maximum finesse on a par with the engraved letter.\n\nThe schema behind the didone 'o\" is not a written heartline, but this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110508024631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ohoh.jpg)\n\n"

I think your observations about the structure of heartline in the bodoniesque 'o' are valid and bring us to the kind of point Williams questions brought us to as well.\n\nYou say: _But the exaggeration of this basic quality [...] of type did not come from the impetus of writing instruments._\n\nI think this might very well be the case. However, this suggests you think the basic quality _ **is** _ nevertheless there. That's all I wanted to assert. I don't think Noordzij wanted to make any assertion about the structure of the heartline, just that expansion about one and the same heartline can produce results that very markedly in appearance, ressembling those we see in Baskerville as opposed to Bodoni, but have a common denominator.\n\nAfter he is finished talking about _types_ of contrast Noordzij begins to talk about _changes_ in contrast (increase / decrease). His schematisms for this are very different from his schematisms of types of contrast. (Chapter 8 of _The stroke_) So the sources for the _type_ of contrast used can vary from the provocations for it's _exaggeration_.\n\nAside from that, Noordzij's \"The Frankilin Letter\" in _Letterletter_ does present compelling evidence that Bodoni's efforts had something to do with the 'standard of handwriting' at the time.\n\nI'd expect that what you see and what Noordzij sees can be made part of a larger picture. Let me try:  \nThe didoni 'o' is a special case of systematic exaggerative contrast manipulation on an broadly expansion-based frame, valued because it approaches a rational geometrical ideal (your schema). Contemporary engraving provided prototypes of how this might be pursued. The romanticism in it is the faith or illusion that text letterforms can approximate such an ideal and still be viable in functional terms.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110508024631im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n"

Expansion is a particular kind of stroke contrast, and is contrasted with translation, which is the kind of stroke contrast one gets from broad nibbed pen. The third kind of contrast is produced by rotation. None of these are 'pure': in practice some amount of rotation is almost always present in all writing, even if it is not the dominant and intentional method, and if you press really hard with a broad nib pen you can produce a kind of expansion. Again, what Noordzij is providing is an analytical tool: a way of looking at strokes and determining what is happening within them. The practical usefulness of this analysis is e.g. in determining the degree and kind of consistency across a collection of letters.\n\nThe Didot and Bodoni types, of course, represent a rationalist exaggeration of 'the swelling line' -- to use the term James Mosley adopted to describe Cresci's influential calligraphy --, but the point is that it is describable in terms of the expansion model of stroke construction.\n\n"

Proceeding towards the bottom the thicker stroke becomes thicker, so that every horizontal cross-section shows a greater contrast than the top. An end of increases in contrast is reached when the thin stroke no longer has a meaning: at the bottom of the block the cross has turned into a rectangle.)\n\nGerrit Noordzij's schema for contrast reduction is this:  \n [www.enneson.com/public\\_downloads/pe/typophile/contrast\\_change\\_decr.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110508024631/http:/www.enneson.com/public_downloads/pe/typophile/contrast_change_decr.jpg \"www.enneson.com/public\\_downloads/pe/typophile/contrast\\_change\\_decr.jpg\")\n\n(Noordzij: The thin stroke becomes thicker towards the bottom. The effect is a decrease in contrast. The endpoint of this decrease is reached when the strokes are equally thick.)\n\nThe basic scheme for the contrast in most Bodini romans is contrast exaggeration on an expansion frame following the model of Paillason's \"Premiere Position\"  \nThe basic scheme for the letter \"T\" in the title page to Bodoni's _Essai des caracteres de l'imprimerie_ (discussed in \"The Franklin Letter\") is shown in Paillason's \"Seconde\".\n\nThe basic scheme for the traditional sans serif is contrast reduction on an expansion frame (contrast reduction makes serifs superfluous: it eats them up). The expansion base accounts for the vertical stress Bloemsma emphasizes as characteristic of univers and Helvetica.\n\nBloemsma's _Balance_ is contrast reduction on the contrast type shown in Paillason's \"Seconde\"\n\nIn _Legato_ Bloemsma has found his way onto the back row in the base of Gerrit Noordzij's cube (top row of the 5 x 5 \"cube\\_underside\" grid). This row represents contrast reduction on a translation base (with the caveat that some rotation has been added--making the face neo-mannerist). And he has done this not by starting from translation, but from an introduction of inner form / outer form counter-rotations in an expansion based context.\n\nOn inspection, the tension caused by Bloemsma's rotation seems to make the white of the word more active or salient vis a vis the black. Here he is in a line that includes W. A. Dwiggins. If I am right (in my understanding of perceptual processing in reading) about the place of 'the map of salient whites' in reading (see the \"bouma as bounded map thread\") we can see why Bloemsma is justified in thinking he is reconnecting (optically, 'after-helvetica') the single units of our scripts, or restoring and extending the optical integrity of the wordform.\n\nBecause Bloemsma's achievement circles back around to meet translation plus rotation, we learn something about mannerist and neo-mannerist (Bringhurst says: Lyrical Modernist) form. That is, we learn something about what's (mostly) boring, and what is to be gained by reading.\n\n"
