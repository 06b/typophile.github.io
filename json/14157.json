Thanks for any info/insights\n\nStephanie\n\n",

That way you see what they see. It also makes it possible to do remote color correction conferences as well.\n\n—————————————————————————-  \nYes, I’m old, but I’m back in style!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks very much to all for this information. The unfortunate fact is, we don’t really have a trusted print house to turn to for advice largely because it’s only recently that we’ve begun doing a significant amount of print. Moreover we haven’t had a lot of luck with the vendors we’ve been using of late—some quality and service issues. So I have to turn to other avenues for insight I’m afraid.\n\nGood point about the monitor calibration software; we do have a PANTONE set up for that so I’ll keep that in mind.\n\nThanks again! I really appreciate having this web site to turn to for stuff like this. I am letting as many people know about it as I can.\n\nStephanie\n\n"
