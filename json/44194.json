Best guess I've had so far is Avant Gare Gothic in bold...  \nAlso, does anyone know if this actually is the corporate font of Mobil or whether it's just one of those knockoffs?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n/H\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Bild 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424023454/http:/typophile.com/files/Bild%202_1.png) | 60.63 KB |\n\n",
