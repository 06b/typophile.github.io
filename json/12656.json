One thing I tried to do was to divide “Garamonds” into “based on Claude Garamond”, “based on Jean Jannon”. On the authority of Bringhurst and Morison I had [LTC Garamont](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051136/http:/www.p22.com/lanston/products/garamont.html) as Goudy out of Jannon, and have so classified it. But P22’s Lanston website (linked above) says it was based on Garamond’s types of 1540 ... which would make it a Claude. I don’t have a decent sample, but my inclination would be to say that the Jannon attribution looks right, as well as being historically plausible.\n\nHave I got it wrong? Or have P22/Lanston? I don’t want to “correct” the Wiki and make it worse.\n\n [‹ Freeware to convert Type1 fonts for Mac??](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051136/http:/typophile.com/node/12711 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Preserving emotions and inspiration (taking pictures that last) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051136/http:/typophile.com/node/12580 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I made the drawings from this type.... I suggested the name “Garamont” instead of “Garamond,” as that name would show at once that it was a Monotype face, not to be confused with the faces of othes concerns also following the same source. The name was found by me in \\_Notice sur les Types Etrangers du Specimen de l’Imprimerie Royale\\_ about the type “attribuait a Garamont.....”\n\nBut thanks for bringing this up. I have to reprint a book I published in 1986 from repros of the metal Garamont, which I no longer have. I didn’t realize this face was part of the P22 Lanston offerings. My experience with digital Lanston Type is that they are right on the money replications of the Lanston Monotype offerings.\n\nGerald\n\n"

[Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051136/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frederick%252BGoudy) could have in good faith believed that the letters he based his type on were by [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014051136/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garamond) and yet they could have actually been based on Jannon’s designs. I just cracked _Elements_, and there is a comparison between the actual Garamond style and the Jannon style and Lanston Garamont definately seems to follow the Jannon vein.\n\n"

Original sources, from the horse’s mouth, so to speak, are often more reliable than that coming from folks known to have an “agenda.” Other than that, don’t know.\n\nGerald\n\n"

So it seems clear: Garamont is a Jannon, though Goudy would have thought when he made it (and probably afterwards, I don’t get the feeling he was vastly concerned about these points) that it was Garamond 1540 ... In fact it is Jannon, 1620s or so.\n\n"
