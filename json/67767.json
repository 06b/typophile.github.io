The message above is what happened.  \nI then made a copy of the file and one-by-one deleted each feature and attempted to recompile between each removal to no avail. It seems as though it may be something in the classes but I am going nuts for 2 days now trying to find it!\n\nI am hoping someone can clue me in on my malfunction.\n\nDesperately seeking help,\n\nChrisL\n\n",

Luckilly, I won't have to try them on this file (so far anyway).\n\nThe MAN, THE MASTER, Karsten Luecke, has shined a big light on my problem. He told me that glyph names containing a hyphen make FontLab very unhappy! After I corrected that, my font compiled quite happily. It seems the cryptic 'Syntax error at \"-63\"' referred to the hyphen which was followed by a 63 in the glyph name. Not that this was apparent to me before--I had been looking through my code pasted in Excel so that the lines would be numbered and I could find \"Line 63\"--wrong line of thinking on my part. I sure wish FontLab would write error messages that don't require so much detective work to figure out. It would be niceer to be prompted while typing the glyph name with a hyphen to get an alert sound and a message saying \"hyphens are not proper syntax for glyph names\".\n\nAt any rate, THANK YOU KARSTEN!!!\n\nChrisL\n\n"
