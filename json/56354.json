This would probably be the very, very first PC I would choose over a Mac. It almost seems like someone left the Apple Design Team to work on the Adamo design. ;) Niiice.\n\nSo, If anyone at Dell reads this — Come on, sponsor me with one of those, you know you want it. ;)\n\n_(\\* I am not getting paid for this. Of course I am not. Actually, I wish I would. Even better yet, I would accept an Adamo as payment. ;) So consider this, Dell.)_\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dell\\_adamo\\_onyx.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416054952/http:/typophile.com/files/dell_adamo_onyx.jpg) | 14.29 KB |\n\n",

A nice-looking machine running Windows is still running Windows. Sure, Apple hardware is attractive, too, but for most Mac users it's the experience on the whole, not just a pretty computer.\n\nAnd before this turns into the inevitable computer war that always ensues, please consider keeping it relevant to the original post (see above).\n\n"

And don't get me wrong, I really, really like Apple as a brand — well, mostly, Apple as a hardware manufacturer and Mac as an operating system and the whole design aspect of all of these. But, as I noted, this is the first really nicely designed PC 'thing' I've seen/noticed, yet. (And it could run some Linux as well, doesn't have to be Windows, I guess.)\n\n"
