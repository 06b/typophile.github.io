There was so much on display to take in and enjoy.\n\nPerhaps after seeing the Veer presentation, you are inspired to do a massive display script project ALA [Alejandro Paul](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007160643/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Alejandro%252BPaul)? Or was it the next gen text faces coming out of Mexico that really rocked your boat?\n\nI do know one thing, for some reason I don’t think I’m too interested in doing a “grunge” typeface anytime soon...\n\nAfter speaking with [Eben Sorkin](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007160643/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Eben%252BSorkin), [Nick Shinn](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007160643/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Nick%252BShinn), [Kent Lew](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007160643/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Kent%252BLew) and others, I finally decided to sit down last night to start fleshing out the drawings I’ve had about an upright semi-italic text face I’ve been doodling about for the past two years.\n\nWhat’s your inspiration and/or new project?\n\n [‹ Studying typography as an undergraduate?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007160643/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36092 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Clearview (Highway Signage) Article From the New York Times ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007160643/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36091 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’ve also been inspired to selling my extra iPod (they’re giving them away with laptops again) and my Intuos 3 (I never use it) so I can buy FontLab. And of course talking to everyone—especially Nick and Delve—gave me food for thought regarding my thesis.\n\nBut what was really inspiring was coming back to town and finding out that my awful type professor quit and been replaced by one of my favorite professors. I have quite literally been dreaming about that happening, so these events coinciding with Typecon is so awesome that I’m tempted to find religion.\n\n"

It’s a really exciting time to be involved with type, as the tools and formats have really opened up a seemingly endless world of possibility to a wide range of people....\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

First the Modern Dog, then Pete McCracken, then Art Chantry, then that annoying PBS guy, THEN a panel with the three worst of the bunch.\n\nI could have lived with just Art Chantry because he was talking about type and his approach to type.
