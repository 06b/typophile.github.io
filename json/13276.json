(Unfortunately, it's difficult to precisely date P-L faces, so I can't say for sure there was no Univers connection.) VGC had a whole series of fonts that only had a letter-number designation--no name--mostly casual scripts and such, but also sort of generic looking sans serifs, like the B series.\n\n"

Each font had a different name that started with a G--Giant, Gaucho, Grant, Gazette, etc. VGC knocked these off in the 1960s (a common practice at the time) as the \"B\" fonts. In fact, most (if not all) of the unnamed fonts in VGC's catalog originated at Filmotype. P-L had similar fonts, but not quite the same design.\n\nFYI: [The Filmotype library is being digitized.](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027182004/http:/typophile.com/node/29561)\n\nEdit: I see that some similar information was provided in this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/node/10616](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027182004/http:/www.typophile.com/node/10616 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/10616\")\n\n"
