  "content": "Today I was sitting at a red light. There’s a lot of new neighborhoods around, so lots of landscapers’ trucks in the mornings. Their logos are challenging, it seems, because it’s just so tempting to use a tree in the logo. But along comes a truck, and while it did have a tree in the logo, it used this nice, crisp typeface. The c curled over at the top naturally and it ever-so-subtly implied a leaf, without even being modified. Just the natural characteristics of the typeface. Ahhhh. But then the light turned green and I snapped out of it.\n\n",
