  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m about to design a training certificate for a company in Middle East region. I’d like to incorporate a symbol of knowledge as part of the artwork. But the problem is the meaning of symbols might be very different in different parts of the world.\n\nFor example a popular symbol of knowledge/wisdom in Poland (Europe) is an owl but who knows what it means in Kuwait?\n\n[http://www.wpodkowie.osdw.pl/custom/\\_3/img/logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025044243/http:/www.wpodkowie.osdw.pl/custom/_3/img/logo.png \"http://www.wpodkowie.osdw.pl/custom/\\_3/img/logo.png\")\n\nA kind of safe symbol might be a book but maybe there is something different and more specific for Middle East culture?\n\nOh, also any references to Middle East ornaments would be much appreciated.\n\nAL\n\n [‹ Let it not be said](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025044243/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33061 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type embellishments/ornaments designer ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025044243/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33036 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
