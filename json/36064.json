I couldn’t make it to TypeCon, and every time a TypeCon discussion item came up in an other Typophile thread (I avoided all the explicitly TypeCon-related topics), I had to hide under my desk. Now I can think about brighter things, like, err… Brighton, where I will be.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the hotel in Brighton where I’ll be staying. It is near the pier, but it seems that every hotel in Brighton is near the pier. I’ll be in the UK from the 10th of September, but will be spending the first few days in Reading, trying to find an apartment for the next academic year.\n\nI’ll eat whatever there is to eat; I’m going to Brighton for the type, and for the type types, not for the food. But if anyone can offer up any culinary surprises (I mean good surprises), I would be quite happy about those, too.\n\n"

First of all, we are all dorks, whether we have released typefaces or not ;-) Secondly, the event has always seemed newcomer-friendly. I had a delightful time in 2004, when I didn’t really know anyone there (at least personally). It has been a blast ever since, too.\n\n"
