Essentially, I had difficulty—if not with what Tschichold wrote, then—the way it is sometimes implemented. Also worth noting is that he renounced some things from that book later on. I’m told that a better book of his to read is The Form of the Book. But, as it’s a series of essays and not all of them are written by Tschichold, I can’t say for myself yet. I’m hoping to make it a birthday or Christmas gift to myself, since it appears to be a bit price, over $62 on Amazon.\n\nBut them’s some of my thoughts.\n\n"

      "content": "_The New Typography_ is not especially helpful when it comes to stationary. The stationary section is dominated by promotion of the DIN letterhead standards. Business cards get only a tiny section because they were just breaking away from simple calling cards at the time, and what’s there is pretty rudimentary modernist stuff. There have been a few good books about business card and stationary design in the last few years, I would recommend just flipping through them to see which of those designs still hold up after a few years.\n\n"
