      "content": "OK ... some dissenting points.   \n   \n1) I certainly agree with the desire to have posters be honest about their   \nintentions. However, requiring every poster to show a respect for type is   \njust not realistic or even, IMO, reasonable. The vast majority of people out   \nthere just don't know enough about typography to have respect for it. As a   \nresult, we see plenty of posts from people who ignorantly believe that one   \ncan get a freeware/shareware font comparable to Verdigris. It seems to me   \nthat education would be more appropriate (and effective) than scolding.   \n   \n1a) This type of font request is, IMO, very different from those occasionally   \nseen on the MyFonts forum, where one poster actually stated, \"I'm not going   \nto pay money for fonts!\". That type of post goes well beyond ignorance and   \nreflects a relatively recent, largely generational attitude that it's not necessary   \nto pay for fonts, music, software, etc. Those people (and they're legion)   \ndefinitely need verbal spankings.   \n   \n2) Mr. van Bronkhorst's creations are truly splendid and he does indeed   \ndeserve whatever price he asks. However, he rigidly offers his fonts as a   \npackage only. Certainly there are many situations in which paying $159   \nto obtain a single desired font is out of the question. I can think of two fairly   \nrecent posts here by well respected mainstays of this forum asking for   \nalternatives in (I believe) similar situations. I can't find those posts just now,   \nbut I remember them verbally \"walking on eggshells\" for fear of condemnation.   \n   \nIn the case of the home hobbyist, noncommercial user or even small firm,   \nposters desiring a font they cannot reasonably afford have two choices: They   \ncan ask that someone e-mail them the font (in which case they need a verbal   \nwhacking) or they can seek a cheaper alternative. I see no reason why we   \ncannot help out the latter poster, educating them along the way. Fonts bundled   \nwith applications (wihch the poster may even already have) can be a great option.   \nAnd most of those fonts supplied with MS apps (mostly Monotype) are of very   \nhigh quality.\n\n"

After much education (beatings), he explained his situation. Married, child in a deadend job and a cheap boss. It made me think that there are lots of poor people out there that can't afford font licences. So I now just direct them to a site like DaFont and let them discover what going through a junk yard looking for a Mercedes is like.\n\n"

      "content": "Daniel,   \nI strongly disagree with the \"junk yard\" analogy, as that would infer   \ncrappy near-uselessness of the merchandise.   \n   \nThere are very many freeware/shareware fonts that are extremely   \nuseful to a niche that I sometimes think the professional designers   \nand font makers here can not relate to at all (and sometimes, dare   \nI say, resent greatly).   \n   \nThis niche doesn't in any way NEED top quality. And once they are   \nshown what their zero dollars will buy, I find that many of these   \npeople are perfectly [willing](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516050817/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27621.html?1078316148) to settle for \"good enough\". This occurs   \nregularly on the MyFonts forum.   \n   \nThe fellow wanting to make a flyer for his local club is quite willing to   \nuse the closest free font for his project. I submit that he shouldn't have   \nto phrase his request just so and show a respect for type in order to   \npost here.   \n   \nSo, a better analogy, IMO, would be a car sales lot. The prospective   \ncustomer seeking a _much_ cheaper alternative to that Mercedes   \nmight be shown a Kia instead. If he accepts that the Kia is the best   \nhe can afford and states that the Kia will meet his lowly needs just   \nfine, why should he denigrated?\n\n"

      "content": "I might as well put in my two cents here too, since this is an issue I am pretty opinionated about, like many of you who have commented earlier.   \n   \nI find myself most in agreement with Mike Freiman, although in the right circumstances I feel like Yves too. The difference is in the purpose or intent of the user, and unfortunately we are usually only able to take their word for it about those things.   \n   \nIf someone is willing to take a near-match because they can't afford the real thing for the purpose at hand, or if they are just looking for something with certain similar qualities, I think we can refer them to places where that can be found.   \n   \nIf they want to get the real fonts for free they can go somewhere else, and I think we ought to refer them to a special FAQ page about why that sort of question is improper, unethical and unfair (and whatever other terms Yves used above).   \n   \nMy 'gray area' happens when the font they want is only available as a 'clone' version, as far as we know. I will usually recommend those fonts. The FontBank fonts are a good example, because I think often the font the posters are trying to duplicate came from that collection in the first place.   \n   \nI am all for education, and promotion of original, quality fonts. That's why I like to credit the designers -- so people realize this was someone's creative work. However, I realize, as Mike said, that there are situations when that expense can't be justified. Those are times when we should suggest alternatives, but I don't mean rip-offs of the same font. We should explain that if you aren't willing to pay for it, then you must be willing to settle for something else, but here are some things that might be similar that come with applications you may have, etc. I think it's a challenge, because most of us don't spend much time looking for cheap approximations, but if we have ideas for them, that would be the place for it.   \n   \nThe last thing we need to try to be doing is guessing at their motives, because there is no assurance that they will tell us the truth. You either want the original,and will pay for it, or you are willing to take something similar that we might suggest.\n\n"

For example with Vertigris, I would like to see a reason on the site why it is better than Minion or Adobe Garamond for some purposes. This doesn't have to be necessarily a head to head comparison, but leaving it all to the buyer to figure out is maybe not the best way.\n\n"
