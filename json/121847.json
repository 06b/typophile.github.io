  "content": "I just finished two typefaces of 3 fonts each but for some reason in Illustrator it only shows the regular weights. When I select Light or Bold, all text disappears. In InDesign everything works as it should. I believe I actually experienced this before and if so, the problem might go away on its own. However, I'm wondering what this could be. Do any of you have experience with an error like this?\n\n",
