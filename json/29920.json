      "content": "Local job eh Duncan?\n\nI quite like them in that they’re sufficiently different from each other; IMHO, Stempel Garamond is the best of the Garamonds that actually carry the name. I can see from reading the first few lines why you picked Maple for the headings – it looks like a grotesque that’s been made with a pair of tin snips.\n\nBTW, Bringhurst recommends pairing Syntax with Stempel Garamond (p.106, paragraph two, of the second edition of ’The Elements of Typographic Style’) but apparently the new Syntax Next is a _lot_ more calligraphic than the old cut.\n\nGood luck with it.\n\n"
