  "content": "So I totally have this plan to be the ultra-niche Nick Denton. Unfortunately my name has far more syllables but I'll try to live up to his example.   \n   \nThus, some new projects of mine, currently undergoing extensive testing:   \n   \n [www.hewnandhammered.com/pho](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.hewnandhammered.com/pho)   \n [www.hewnandhammered.com/eats](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.hewnandhammered.com/eats)   \n   \nwhich will soon have their own domains, and perhaps more attractive mastheads.   \n   \nMy own skill could not possibly match that of the beautiful & talented Mark van Bronkhorst, who made me a great piece using his own Verdigris, which I find quite useful & have been availing myself of on a daily basis for awhile now:   \n   \n [www.hewnandhammered.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.hewnandhammered.com/)   \n   \nI'm also working on   \n   \n [www.mocosanfrancisco.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.mocosanfrancisco.com/)   \n   \nand of course that old standby, my favorite,   \n   \n [www.typographi.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.typographi.com/)   \n   \nMeanwhile, if anyone has ideas of niches that might warrant a site and fulfill the following criteria:   \n   \na. audience must be own/use personal computer & internet (this is why hewn & hammered is not such a success; i missed this most important rule);   \n   \nb. audience must have disposable income   \n   \nc. audience must have time to contribute - as the entire idea here is to get these things self-sufficient to the point where i don't need to take much time editing, and can leave most of the content creation up to a group of 2-3 dozen individual authors.   \n   \nd. niche must be somewhat approachable and of interest to hobbyists/amateurs outside the professional practice, if there is one.   \n   \ne. each site needs a catchy name & attractive identity or is not worth producing.   \n   \nf. and of course there needs to be some available content on the Internet - hopefully lots of disparate little bits all looking for some glue to hold them together.   \n   \ni was thinking of one for people involved in GIS - cartographers and planners and the like - they spend a lot of time on the 'net, work mostly on computers, professionally network just as much as folks in our own trade.   \n   \nany ideas?\n\n [‹ Typography trends and predictions for 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30271 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Coming up with names for new fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40451 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Also check out this site on [Relief Shading](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121155725/http:/www.reliefshading.com/). I found it via a recent article in _Baseline_. All roads lead to type!\n\n"
