It seems like everything I see in magazines about hate groups, skinheads, etc. always has some version of distressed heavy manual typewriter type, so it's nice that you avoided that.   \n   \nI think the style of the type is good / appropriate but I feel like the type needs to be bolder and stronger -- it seems a little too delicate / feminine now.   \n   \nSince you already have a vaguely tattoo look happening, what about drawing the type by hand (in the same basic style) so that it's obviously hand-drawn?   \n   \nI really like the swirly barbed wire -- you have to look twice to figure out what it is... that's nice.   \n   \nGood luck!\n\n"

Both have potential to be very respectable designs for a universal design community (this is what you want, no?). If you go with a circumfrance of type, then be very articulate with the type selection and try to keep the type very small in relation to the icon/mark. It should appear as a thin solid ring, rather than a spacious airy circle of type. Add more verbage (i.e. descriptors, locations, dates, whatever), if necessary to fill the space. It's looking quite nice�for hate.   \n   \nAloha! (a non-hateful word)   \nScott   \n   \nPS: To support the hating of hate, you need to be extra sensitive to others. Using phrases like \"deep south white trash\" as a descriptor is an unjustified contributor to hateful sentiment. Just say \"hate group(s)\". We know what you mean. Make sure your PR skills are conditioned to support a movement like this.\n\n"

      "content": "I think your idea for an organization of designers against hate is a wonderful idea. However, this name for your organization is a terrible mistake. Let me explain why.   \n   \nIt shows a misunderstanding of the psychology of hate, and will be counter-productive.   \n   \nPsychologist Alfred Adler pointed out that the first step to anti-social behavior is to divide 'us' and 'them'. The next step is that 'they' are less than human and it is ok to hate them and use violence against them.   \n   \nRecently psychologist Steven Stosney - [http://compassionpower.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20050819003719/http:/compassionpower.com/) - who has been one of the most successful in treating wife beaters and road rage, has pointed out that compassion and anger are opposites - and anger is a key component of hatred. Hatred and the accompanying anger impair a person's thinking, so that they no longer think in terms of problem-solving, but only us vs them, and whether to attack, defend, or withdraw. Compassion motivates you to understand the other person and act appropriately. When you understand the other person you can act much more effectively, whether it is to cooperate or oppose them.   \n   \nThis is why 'hate the hate' is a terrible idea. It falls into the trap of perpetuating the stupidity that hate causes, instead of providing the understanding that leads to its cure.   \n   \nEcclesiastes said there is a 'time for love and a time for hate', and I do think that hatred is functional physical self defence. It blocks the compassion that would make you hesitate to harm the other person, and as a resulkt you may be killed yourself. Aside from battle, I see no benefit in real hate.   \n   \nHrant's views on this matter are in my opinion completely wrong, and would lead to a much worse world.   \n   \nI think that your chances of being effective will be greatly if you contact and accept guidance from existing organizations fighting hate groups, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center - [http://www.tolerance.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050819003719/http:/www.tolerance.org/) - and the Anti-Defamation League - [http://www.adl.org/adl.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20050819003719/http:/www.adl.org/adl.asp) .   \n   \nThese have long experience in fighting hate groups, and have had notable successes. I am not saying you should simply be a wing of one of these, but you should certainly talk to them and get benefit of their experience before going forward.   \n   \nBy the way, note the logo for Tolerance.org - not great but not bad.\n\n"

By coming to grips with it, we can control it, and make those whose hate is out of control more human, like us. In this way of showing compassion to them, we have a better chance of converting them to a \"control mode\".

This is an identity, so I could see the current symbols interacting with more contemporary typography (as opposed to the expected circle badge). I think that this would more clearly portray the concept (as I understand it) and the body of people who will presumably fall in and support it.   \n   \nAnd support it they will, if it's done well. True hate is a terrible thing, and never ends well. People hating sin can be just as bad for humanity as people hating minorities. \"Hate the hate\" to me takes advantage of today's ironic culture. I say hate on a regular basis; \"I HATE it when they don't have Swiss cheese!\" I'm not deeply angered and full of animosity towards the sub shop. In this case I feel like it can be a great call to action. I don't see the purpose of this as attacking groups of people violently, but reaching people in a way that both says \"hating is not acceptable by your peers\" and also \"here's what we can do.\"   \n   \nI think assuming off the cuff that Ben's hate group will be burning things and hunting people is a bit hasty.

      "content": "\\<font class=\"dontLookLikeCrap\"\\>Both anger and hatred are Godly qualities.   \n   \nPaul writes: For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate.   \n   \nThat is, he hates doing evil.   \n   \nAnd in Rev. 2:   \n`Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.   \n   \nGod speaking to one of the 7 churches, commending them for their 'hatred' of wrongdoings.   \n   \nAs for anger, Jesus was angry at the moneychangers he found in the temple. Rather than making it a house of prayer, it was turned into an arena for profit.   \n   \nAs Hrant stated and as the Bible shows, it's a matter of how you deal with your hatred and anger. It is a righteous quality to hate what is evil. The key after that though, is to not take vengeance into your own hands, which is what most people do. Rather, \"be at peace with all men, as much as it is possible.\"   \n   \nTwo other quick notes. Hatred of a person is not the same as hating what someone has done or does. Also, because most people deal incorrectly with their anger and hatred, it makes anger and hatred seem wrong. If the anger can be used to start something good, then that is the correct kind of anger.   \n   \nBut with that said, the logo &/or name itself seems too ironic for me. I think a possible problem with a logo against something that it very closely associates with is the initial confusion, and even confusion after people find out what it means. It's smart to be able to find similarities with your opposition, but maybe this is too close? Ultimately, it's your call. However, it's not a logo I would be proud of displaying, if I were in the group, no matter how well it's aesthetically designed. It has lots of baggage that you probably won't be able to overcome.   \n   \n   \n   \n  \n\\</font\\>\n\n"

With that example then you could say that Hitler followed a righteous path or any of the groups that hatethehate would target and it becomes a mute point. But somehow I don't think that's what the holy ones had in mind when its written that they \"hated\" - to become hate inc. and shower it on everyone you don't like hoping that they'd smarten up. For some reason I think that maybe god or paul had a bit more power to persuade. See, if I were a religious person and god just told me he hated something we were doing I would probably freak out and do what-ever he said. Will hatethehate have that power - nah.\n\n"

While it might be fine for something truly wrong to make you angry, having that anger and acting upon the anger negatively are two different things.
