Yet, as not too sure whether it is indeed Normande (particularly the \"L\", the \"E\" and the \"P\" keep me in doubt) or actually may perhaps be an other font, I would appreciate the opinion of you... (Then again, could it be that those which appear to me as being differences between those letters in the pic and in the [test-drive](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124042/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/normande/normande/testdrive.html?s=SOUL%2BDEEP&p=36) may just result from the quality of the scan itself, and maybe I'm paying too much attention to such details?...)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124042im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/28178.gif)\n\n",

The version in my old Formatt (cut-out type) catalog, for example, looks closer to your sample than the Bitstream version in your link. I'm not sure which foundry's version it is, though. The Bitstream version may be as close as you're going to get without drawing it yourself.\n\n"

Sometimes Bitstream's versions may be a bit different. I think this looks very much like the sample, and I think you need to allow for the fact that black on white looks different than the reverse.\n\n"
