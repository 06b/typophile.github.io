  "content": "hi people,\n\njust bought the typographic matchmaking book so i'm pointing this question to the people here whom own this book also...when going trough the fonts on the disk i noticed that 'TheMix Arabic\" folder only contains 0kb TTF files, so they can't be opened, only thing that works in that folder is the readme pdf file.\n\nshouldn't this font normaly be included and working?....just asking to make sure :)\n\nthe book looks superb, can't wait to start reading!!\n\n",
