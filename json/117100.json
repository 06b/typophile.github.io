  "content": "Dunno if this is a General Discussion question or more Design, but here goes. I'd love to lay my eyes on a typeface that's quite close to Times New Roman in its skeletal structure, but with the following differences: (1) optically monolinear; failing that, then having a very low stroke contrast, (2) serifs more slab-like than standard TNR.\n\nMetric equivalence to TNR not relevant.\n\nIs there such a face? What, to your eye, comes close? And are there any like this that are any _good_?\n\n",

One thought was the tiny little almost-serifs such as you made. This too will need a closer look.\n\nBoth Concorde and Plantin are also great directions for me to look. I'll include them in my close-looks.\n\nNone of these are quite the \"monolinear slab Times-variant\" I imagined, but most are just what I was hoping to see. So, fantastic suggestions as always, folks. Thanks again.\n\nI really don't know Life at all.\n\n"
