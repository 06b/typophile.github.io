  "content": ". . . I wanted to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and (or \\_insert appropriate holiday\\_) Happy New Year. (I can't believe another year has blown past so quickly!) We all might not share the same traditions, but this time of year represents a special renewal of spirit for all of us, I think. We can agree that it is good to share of ourselves and allow all positivity to thrive within us. I wish for all of you to feel of that spirit.\n\n",
