Must have been working on it too fanatically, really thought it was small but legible.\n\nThe idea was that all horizontal and vertical parts should not meet each other, in order to keep the shapes thin. That's why some letters are broken up.\n\nBut, following your remarks, breaking up the shapes DOES break up legibility.\n\nIt's a shame, now I have to leave my principles. ;-)\n\n(there will be an update)\n\n"

Why not use the standards already readable?\n\nNo offence, Ad3m, but can't the same be said for vectorfonts or pretty much everything? We're already spoiled for choice when it comes to vectorfonts, music, art, books, movies,...\n\n\\> Afterall, it is not an artistic venture. It is a minimal venture\n\nPixelfonts are a great way of learning about type in a simplified way. Besides, simplifying things & bringing them back to a minimum of pixels is an artform in itself. The power of suggestion & fooling the eyes is a big part of designing pixelfonts. Not everyone can do it.\n\n"
