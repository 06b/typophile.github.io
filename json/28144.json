I'm not assuming a radical position, I believe it is possible to use it in very specific occasions, but with serif fonts titling texts, or even with names and identity it looks like it makes no sense, and I can't find a convention that backs this sort of usage. Was it possible to do in the old days of lead typesetting? Or it is just one of those features that everyone uses only because it is possible to do?\n\n",

It just seems strange, I mean, there's no lower case with small lower case style.\n\nI don't know why CwSC looks odd, but it may be to do with the awkward fit between the two, especially involving the T. if you look at the words \"Type Crime\" above, the TY fit is actually quite nice compared to CwSC in many faces, but the way they reach out to each other seems mannered. This is not a criticism of this particular face, but the alphabet.\n\n"

For example, in every Adobe Original typeface with small caps, the small caps are designed for use at the same size as the caps. In many of those cases, that may specifically be subhead or display size.\n\nPersonally, I think the caps-with-small-caps is most likely to look ungainly when the small-cap-height is relatively low, as in the example at the beginning of this thread. I am not against it in principle, myself.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "_Small caps are optimized for use at text size._\n\nOK. Let me have another go at that: what I meant to say is that small caps are optimized for use _in_ text, with lower case.\n\nIt's true that display size small caps are available, but as can be seen in this example, the small caps are beefed up to hold their own against the lower case, with the result that they are slightly too heavy, and too wide, to fully harmonize with the capitals. This is not a criticism of Robert Slimbach's elegant design and draftsmanship, but the recognition of what is perhaps an impossible situation -- to design a small cap that perfectly matches both cap and lower case. But perhaps it is more feasible with certain type genres than others.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130404032029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MinSC_6458.jpg)\n\n"

He does not censure them at all, but only has a few cautions: to take care about adequate spacing, to evenly space the transition from the full to small caps, and to avoid hyphens in titles.\n\nSome small caps look better than others of course. I was intrigued to hear Matthew Carter mention at the TypeCon critique session that he thinks that the small caps are the 'best part of every font.'\n\n"

It was set in caps with small caps by the way.\n\nI use that combination frequently and like it. I can see how kerning issues can come up with certain glyph and font combinations--a serifed cap T might look uncomfortable nearly striking the smallcap Y when a large height smallcap font is used. This would be a case-by-case issue though.\n\nI have no idea what Ellen Lupton meant. Perhaps you might look back at her book and see the context, even capture a large enough chunk of the text to show us what you mean. I don't have the book so I can't check.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Also let's not forget about font choice. Using a font intended for long passages of text for display is a big no-no! For example using Hoefler Text in display setting when really you should be using the Hoefler Titling. (Yes there are caveats to this... and yes there are ways to make Hoefler Text look good for Titling but generally speaking its not advisable... its for TEXT!!!) Filosofia, pictured above, is a member of a choice group type designs where text/book faces scale well all the way to headline/display. When I go font 'shopping' I try to look for fonts that have this characteristic or they have 'optical' set like Adobe does.\n\nAll my best,\n\nMike Diaz\n\n"
