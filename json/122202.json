If you know what I'm talking about a link would be cool, but since I have no other details, that's not the point of this post.\n\nWhat style of lettering is this? The super-elongated, overly ornamented letterforms that intertwine with each other are so beautiful. I would love to learn more about it but have no information - anything would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-12-26 at 6.04.55 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417065307/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-12-26%20at%206.04.55%20PM.png) | 413.54 KB |\n\n",
