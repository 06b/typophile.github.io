M. Barrie</cite>, I’ve noticed an odd convention: where a contraction happens in middle of a word (e.g., “don’t” for “do n(o)t”), the apostrophe has the usual appearance. But when the contraction removes the entire first part of the word (e.g., “it’s” for “it (i)s” or “I’ll” for “I (wi)ll”), the typesetters consistently left the inter-word space there: not “it’s” or “I’ll” but “it␣’s” or “I␣’ll” (using ‘␣’ to represent a space):  \n ![Illustrative example](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421203843im_/http:/i.stack.imgur.com/12TQh.png)\n\nIn the comments someone mentioned seeing a book from that era with “y’all” written as “y’␣all”. The idea is the same: if the apostrophe indicates elision of part of only one word, the words aren’t run together.\n\n• Was this a reasonably widespread practice, or merely an idiosyncratic house style? or  \n• Was this perhaps an idiosyncratic _authorial_ style, like A. A. Milne’s use of “sha’n’t” in <cite>Winnie the Pooh</cite>, and should therefore be preserved in reproductions?\n\n",

All contractions are spaced: \"ca n't\", \"do n't\", \"it 's\". I can't remember if I saw a \"won't\" – not sure what would have been done with that.\n\nThe editorial decisions made in this book were a bit odd – they wanted to present the novels in their initial forms, though multiple revisions exist of most of them – and the spaced contractions are probably part of that.\n\nIt is decidedly jarring to a modern reader & seems out of place in a reading edition – though I think an argument could be made for it for a scholarly edition (which the Library of America isn't).\n\n"
