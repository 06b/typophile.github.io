Futura was the official font for the Apollo program, used internally on much of the concept artwork and graphics created to illustrate the numerous key moments in the moon journey, as well as concept art illustrating the launch vehicles and spacecraft.\n\nFutura was first major Latin font to become mainstream type on the surface of the moon. Other Latin fonts got there ahead of it aboard other NASA and JPL spacecraft, and Cyrillic fonts made it aboard Russian spacecraft.\n\nSource—NASA.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
