I'm asking about this particular image on behalf of someone else, so wasn't aware that Franklin & Marshall (in this case) is a fashion brand, so I'm guessing in this case it could well be a font. I've got something close for my friend, so hopefully as they're usually quite generic, it'll be ok.\n\nSimon.\n\n"
