Each glyph has an alternate on the same baseline but with a different weight stress or attitude.\n\nWith so many possible combinations, I couldn't figure out how to set up the code for a contextual alternate OT feature. So you have to go in and hand tune the thing.\n\nIt's a bit of work but I have found that process fun to play around with.\n\n[Check it out at P22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823130442/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/nudgewink.html)  \nHere is the [PDF User Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823130442/http:/www.woodardworks.com/Nudgewink_Guide.pdf).\n\n",
