  "content": "Friends,\n\nI have a small situation and need help.  \nI received a label layout in microsoft Excel (?!). I want to re-do it in illustrator.  \nIts a simple label only with latin and arabic text.  \nWhen I open the excel file the label presents the fonts correctly, but if I do a copy and paste it in illustrator the characters disappear.  \nHow do I set Arabic text in illustrator? The font is Calibri.\n\nAntónio\n\n",

      "content": "Illustrator does not support Arabic layout unless you get the Middle East version from WinSoft. Probably what you will need to do, once you've figured out what Arabic font to use, is to set the Arabic text in e.g. Word (Windows, not Mac), print to PDF, and embed the PDF as a graphic in Illustrator.\n\n"
