      "content": "Maybe... I'm not an expert in the lettering from that period, though I am enough aged to remenber it. Perhaps is because the memory is so selective...   \n   \nAnyway, I think Drone is inspired in \\_bad\\_ lettering, hispanic or not. I don't see nothing specifically hispanic or, at least, Spanish in those letters. It reminds you the Arco del Triunfo (symptomatic name...) because you hate it. I'd never been at the Valle de los Ca�dos.   \n   \nProbably the best aproach to those \\_hispanic\\_ letters, strange but strong, is the Andreu Balius and Joan Carles Casas�n project for the University of Salamanca.   \n   \nJust for those who don't know it:   \n   \n [http://www.andreubalius.com/andreubalius/type02\\_01.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524130349/http:/www.andreubalius.com/andreubalius/type02_01.html)\n\n"
