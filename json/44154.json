My high school in Korea, Kyungbock High School, was a big hockey school as well.\n\nCongratulations to Boston College, by the way, on the Frozen Four title. The balance of power in college hockey may be west-leaning, but BC are the closest thing to a dynasty these days.\n\nMy alma mater, Harvard, just missed out on making the NCAAs this year after turning around a disappointing season (and pushing BC to extra periods in the Beanpot title game, too). It’s sad to think that this year’s team was the last to include guys that were there when I was still a student.\n\n"
