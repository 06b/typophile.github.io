      "content": "\\> $1500 is low-ball hobbyist pricing.   \n   \nWell, few of us already have a foothold in the custom type design business...   \nYou gotta start somewhere, especially in this economy.   \n   \nAlso note that a lot of times fonts that sell in retail aren't as polished as a big client would need.   \nFor one thing, they might pay a bit more for bringing their version up to par.   \n   \n\\> The fact that the fonts have already been sold eliminates the exclusivity.   \n   \nBut in the case of Revolution for example, that apparently didn't stop them! Were they deceived?   \n   \nIf the font in question is selling briskly:   \n1) Nobody would want any imaginary exclusivity on it.   \n2) Yes, you wouldn't give it up cheaply!   \n   \nBut most of us don't make $1500 per font per year. And this is exactly why the client _can_ get de facto exclusivity even after sales have been made. It's just another phenomenon of what might in fact be called \"hobbyist\" type design, where a person has another day job, but still has the talent/skill/determination to make fonts that some clients love. This client might see a nice font that hasn't been distributed very much and decide to buy it off the market, to halt (more like reduce\\*) distribution. It makes sense, no?   \n   \n\\* Plus it's not like a \"real\" exclusive font never leaves the company's computers... For example the British Airways font that Monotype custom-made isn't exceptionally hard to come by, and they paid an arm and a leg for it.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
