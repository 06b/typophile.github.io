  "content": "I have hit an issue I have never had before with InDesign CS3. I have imported a Word document and am setting it now. The client had set up his own styles in Word which I asked InDesign to ignore. However, I am still hitting this problem; **when I select a list and delete his bullets InDesign places a space at the start of the line**. This in essence means when I apply my bullets style the alignment is off.\n\nHas anyone any idea? If you need any more info to diagnose let me know. Thanks in advance.\n\n[edited] I have also just realised that it is doing it when I copy and paste a selection - for instance I was selecting two numbers only, no space before or after, and when pasted InDesign was inserting a space before. It is doing it across all documents and is obviously not document specific.\n\n [‹ What would you classify as 'fun' design particularly in visual communication?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010003741/http:/typophile.com/node/50205 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logotype Critic ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010003741/http:/typophile.com/node/49008 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
