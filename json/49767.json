      "content": "Jordan, et al\n\nVery interesting and fun programs. I came away with two thoughts.\n\n1)By the time that the demos finished several letters most calligraphers would have been finished with \"the piece.\" 2) As an origination program it definitely has its pluses, but would fall short when it came to the subtle nuances that can be achieved with pen manipulation. In the \"n\" example below (FB Pouty) the black dots represent attitudinal (angle) shifts and in most cases an addition of pressure on the pen to create waisting.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420170500im_/http:/typophile.com/files/italic_3431.png)\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that they are wonderfully basic tools (or just a starting point), so why not do it with ink and pen and get the whole enchilada at one time. Don't get me wrong... I embrace technology, I just prefer the human touch.  \nMichael\n\n"

      "content": "I've been looking for such a software too.\n\nI have tested Inkscape and CorelDraw and there are some things that differentiate them.  \nWhile in Inkscape, using the Wacom Intuos tablet, is getting closer to the traditional way of writing calligraphic texts, in CorelDraw things can be more precisely controlled but less of a gesture.\n\nIn CorelDraw there is an \"export to TTF\" option.  \nIn Inkscape (the latest build, not yet 0.47) there is the possibility of saving brush settings. And spiro.\n\nHere are some of the tests I did in Inkscape.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420170500im_/http:/typophile.com/files/800%20inkscape_6450.jpg)\n\nOne advantage of digital calligraphy is that kerning can be adjusted. One disadvantage is the lack of texture like in epixs works from behance gallery.\n\nI haven't tested Illustrator yet.\n\nI think working with traditional tools and then scanning, tracing and adjusting is much easier and better for now.\n\n"
