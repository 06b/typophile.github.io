  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am trying to find these two fonts. The first is a 70s style script, from a car spray paint touch up paint can. I thought it was Banana Split, but it's not. The second is a heavy italic font. The brand is Spanish if that helps at all.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417225417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/touch-up_5621.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417225417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mtn-mtn_3841.jpg)\n\n",
