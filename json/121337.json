  "content": "\\_Secret Of The Incas\\_ a Paramount movie released in 1954 has a main title lettered in 3-D faux building stones that evoke the spirit of the Inca monumental buildings.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317105914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SecretOfTheIncasSM_5111.jpg)\n  \nI wonder if a fan, or anyone else, has used this as model for a font, either flat or 3-D.  \nI can't recall any similar fonts that are particularly close. I would be interested to learn what might exist in this rather unusual genre.  \nA larger scale image is attached.  \nThanks for your attention.  \nDon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [SecretOfTheIncasMED.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317105914/http:/typophile.com/files/SecretOfTheIncasMED.jpg) | 122.79 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I would bet somewhere in one of Dan X. Solo’s exotic alphabets there is something like that.  \nIn my cursory search, decorative typefaces visually inspired by stone tend to presents each letter as carved from a single piece (albeit often crumbling) instead of composed by blocks, while those composed by bricks tend to have a very flat and clean cut.  \nRegarding the 3D aspect, one I found, not at all similar, but somewhat as much monumental, is [http://www.fontspace.com/manfred-klein/mk-typobricks-rough](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317105914/http:/www.fontspace.com/manfred-klein/mk-typobricks-rough \"http://www.fontspace.com/manfred-klein/mk-typobricks-rough\")  \nAnother search term could be “block”, example: [http://www.fontspace.com/crolrene/wodenbloks](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317105914/http:/www.fontspace.com/crolrene/wodenbloks \"http://www.fontspace.com/crolrene/wodenbloks\")  \nLastly, a place where the concept has been explored is certainly Fontstruct.

      "content": "Thanks Riccardo and Ryuk for the interesting answers.  \nThe concrete blocks photos are good. Could be the basis of an interesting font.  \nSame for The Incredible Hulk lettering.  \nAs for the existing scalable fonts:  \nRock Steady by the excellent comic book lettering artist, Nate Piekos, has an appropriate treatment for the face. Could be applied to other face designs, including the polygonal stones used by the Incas. Could be extended to the 3D treatment. I agree that his company, Blambot, and the other comic book company, ComicCraft are the most likely places for finding something in this genre. Perhaps also PizzaDude.  \nMegalithic has some promise. Unfortunately the author, Daniel Ortega, did not refine the Dan Zadorozny's Hulkbuster design so that the structure works as well in basic black and white as it does in the version showing shades of grey.  \nThe other suggested fonts also give hints as to what is feasible. For example MAWNS Rock shows what can be done with a simplified graphic treatment of wear and tear, but would be much more useful in a version without all the loose rubble.  \nYou have both been most helpful. Shows its worth digging further.  \nDon\n\n"
