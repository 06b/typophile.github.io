  "content": "Hello,  \nDoes anyone know the origin and source for the font Tykewriter? It seems to be a free handwriting font that is widely used in childrens books, but the source is mystery. It comes in Regular and Bold Bobbing. There is a kids software product with the same name, but doesn't seem to be the source. Thanks for any suggestions.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114141104im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tykewriter_4614.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the input. It's a font that's been around publishing houses a long time, and is frequently requested or supplied to designers for producing kid's books. We use it a lot. However it's creator and original source is unknown. Perhaps it's a custom font that \"escaped\" from one of the publishers. It's definitely called Tykewriter. Here's a link to the myFont forum about it. Anyway, thanks again. Best.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=28372](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114141104/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=28372 \"http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=28372\")\n\n"
