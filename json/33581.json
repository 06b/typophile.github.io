  "content": "Hi Folks,  \nThis serif has baffled me. It reminds me of [Americana](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906161142/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/americana/), but the x-height is quite different. The ’T’, ’k’ and ’g’ seem pretty distinctive, and do not match Americana.\n\nAnyone recognize this?\n\nThanks,  \n- Mike\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [SoundThinking.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906161142/http:/typophile.com/files/SoundThinking.jpg) | 37.18 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Voodoo Doll logo - Vantasyhouse {Angel}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906161142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33633 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Courier-like sans in Tate Etc. magazine - Everson Mono {Angel} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906161142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33609 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Do you have a link to show it?\n\nFor some reason I think I have seen this as a display font, from a small foundry, or maybe a freebie font, but I have not found it in Larabie’s stuff or Nick Curtis’s freebies.\n\nAny other ideas?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

That’s not too far off, but as you said Paul-Kenji, the serifs aren’t quite right.\n\nThe way the letters disconnect suggests adding negative stroke to the letters to erode them, but I still can’t place the font. I thought [’Carlton’](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906161142/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/carlton/) had some similarities, especially in x-height, but I don’t think that’s it either.\n\nAny more ideas?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
