It only gives this uninformative notice about permission bits...\n\nCan I check later in Adobe Reader if fonts are embedded, and if so, how?\n\nThank you for helping.\n\n",

In the box \"subset fonts when percent of characters used is less then\" put in: 100%  \nThe informative notice you're talking about is a hint for the user to check if the font policy allows embedding, so if that's ok, just click \"ok\", that is: go on with exporting. If there is no appropriate permission, the pdf exporting will stop anyway. So generally it's recommendable to check permission issues **before** using a font in a publication.\n\n2. In Adobe Acrobat uncheck \"use local fonts\" (Cmd + Shift + Y), you'll find this option under \"Advanced\". Possibly there is a similar option in Acrobat Reader.\n\n"

I always have it set to 0% so that all characters are included, not only used characters.\n\nAccording to your answer, \"use local fonts\" means local fonts on your computer, right? Or could it mean \"local to the opened document\"?\n\n"

      "content": "Hi\n\nThis is \\*apparently\\* clear. I say \"apparently\" because in fact this does not always work. I use InDesign CS2 on PC and find that I cannot fully embed all fonts. When I create a PDF from the InDesign file, even if I select Embed All Fonts and Subset ... 0%, what I actually get is a file with embedded \\*subsets\\* only. This causes untold problems with my service bureau who say that they need to remove all the multiple instances of the subsets before the file will print correctly on their Docutech digital printer.\n\nDoes anyone know what causes this problem and what is the solution? Help needed urgently, please!\n\nDavid Bray\n\n"

Nonetheless, it's possible to check if a given font is embedded or not, by analysing the Fonts panel in Document Properties.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223155954im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ms_pdfembed_4764.png)\n  \nIn this case the fonts are all embedded and subset. \n"

We just got a note from a printer that a lot of our customers use, indicating that they have a new proofing system. One of the changes they require is that all fonts be (fully) embedded.\n\nBTW, we created an InDesign CS2 document on the PC, specified 0% in the subsetting block, and generaed a PDF.The text was simply \"Hello world\" (using Warnock Pro Regular). On opening the PDF, we were able to edit it, to add the characters \"iu\", which I believe would not be possible if the font had been subsetted. And in looking at the PDF file, Preferences \\> fonts showed \"embedded.\"\n\nSo I too am confused about David Brey's post.\n\n"
