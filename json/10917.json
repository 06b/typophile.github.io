I suppose if you're a FOG user (unless   \nyou've switched) then you're using OS 9 for some apps and   \nOS X for others...   \n  \nIf that's the case, you will see your Classic apps bog down   \nunder OS X. I'll try to explain. When you launch an OS 9   \napplication from inside OS X, you are launching another   \noperating system that runs in tandem with OS X. In other   \nwords, OS X and OS 9 are both taxing your processor. Even   \nsimple things like the clipboard occasionally get hung up   \nwhen switching between the two OSs. (Sorry if I'm telling   \nyou stuff you already know.)   \n  \nI became a happier camper when I quit using OS 9   \napps altogether.\n\n"
