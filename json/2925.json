The English is perfect.   \n   \nOne thing I can suggest is that it would also be good to have them tell us whatever they know about the backgound of the sample that might be useful. Information such as the country and age of the sample, and whether it is from a web site, or from a scan of printed material. (For example, if we know something comes from an advertisement published in the 50's it would rule out a lot of possibilities.)   \n   \nWhere will you have this so that new posters are very aware of it?\n\n"

Since you asked, I notice one very very very very small english error (of course, I just made 4).   \n   \nUnder **My sample was ID'd in less than 1 minute, how is this possible?**   \n\\*competitivity of this board\\* _could read_ \\*competition on this board\\*   \n   \nI don't think competitivity is a word. I could be soooooo wrong though.   \nThis is so nitpicky I debated hard before pressing post.   \n   \nEnglish is my only real language (shamed American that I am).   \nWait, wait. There _is_ Pig Latin and a bit of Anishspay.   \n   \nAndyray.\n\n"
