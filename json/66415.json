It was just beautiful, and gave me a better perspective, when I went to visit Enschedé Type Museum a week after.\n\nI had a chance to hold in my hands the original punches of Didot Non Plus Ultra, and also the matrices made with them, and the final product: a catechismus printed in that font. The book was the size of a matchbox. I think that the type was between 2 and 3 points. Matrices were not individual, but instead they were made in single lines of text. Most impressive was the fact that I could easily recognize Didot even in that size and the rough paper.\n\nIt was made by Henry Didot somewhere after 1860, and was one his last works. It's too bad, that I could not bring my camera in the museum, because Enschedé is still printing money, so they are pretty pernickety about the rules…\n\n",

Even more memorable was my 5-hour visit to Jim Rimmer's place in 2008\\*, where the highlight for me was cutting a punch and striking it into brass. Jim was so gracious.\n\n\\* [http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157622668087871/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120820055003/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157622668087871/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157622668087871/\")\n\nhhp\n\n"
