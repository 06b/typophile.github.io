Holding up the mirror to your shoppers and letting them know what most of them (I assume) bought does in fact reshape the mindset for the next purchase. Some will jump on the bandwagon and buy a script, some will jump off and try another typestyle next time.\n\nRemember, _Top_ doesn’t necessarily mean _best_ when merchandising, and it’s ALWAYS nice to have some top sellers.\n\n",

      "content": "_But then how does that jive with the top-N lists of some  \nother font houses consisting mostly of neutral sans faces?_\n\nIt depends how you calculate a sale, I think.\n\nFor instance, say that Foundry X has a standard EULA, which is good for 10 workstations. Foundry X only has two fonts in its library, Script Face 123 and Grotesque 567. Foundry X sells 100 transactions of Script Face 123 and 50 transactions of Grotesque 567 per month via its online store.\n\nTechnically, Script Face 123 is the foundry’s best seller, right? Not necessarily. Lets say that all of the Script Face 123 transactions were with the standard, 10 user license. But half of the Grotesque 567 transactions were for more workstations… anywhere from 11 to 11,000.\n\nNow Grotesk 567 is the foundry’s best seller, because it licensed the most workstations in a single month, even though it had less single transactions via the store.\n\nYou should always ask yourself which numbers you’re looking at in top-N lists.\n\n"

Do customers who frequent Veer go there because they are looking for display or script faces more than customers of LinoType go there for text or sans faces? I am not saying that this is true, I am just posing the question. Personally, if I were looking for a sans, I would be more likely to look at FF than Veer or P22. If I am looking for something pushing the envelope, I would more likely look at Storm than at LinoType. Maybe size ane age of foundry matters too. It would be interesting to see breakdowns by foundry and how they measure (taking in Dan’s comments).\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "Here are Linotype’s current top sellers.  \n [http://www.linotype.com/8-37-8/fontcharts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20091105050504/http:/www.linotype.com/8-37-8/fontcharts.html)  \nThese lists are based on real data. There are two categories of 20, text and headline. At least 16 of the headline fonts are scripts (and if Papyrus and Old English can be considered script fonts, that 18 of 20 are scripts). I wouldn’t say that Linotype’s customers visit the website only looking for sans serif fonts, or even for serious fonts at all. How different is the headline top 20 from a list at Veer? Maybe Veer’s fonts were designed more recently, and maybe Veer’s customers go in for a more grungy look. I’d be interested to know where Veer’s customers come from, too, i.e., what percentage of the customer base is North American versus other continents and countries. I’d bet the the “rough look” is more in at certain places than others.\n\nCompare the current top seller list with another Linotype Feature: 2005’s favorites  \n [http://www.linotype.com/8-2628-8/favouritefonts2005.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20091105050504/http:/www.linotype.com/8-2628-8/favouritefonts2005.html)  \nYear round rather than up-to-the minute. The “business fonts” don’t differ too much, but the “casual” ones do. Not as many scripts here. At other parts of the year, it seems that other types of display type were popular, too. Which fonts sell most when might have something to do with what fonts are marketed when. I bet that MyFonts.com would witness similar trends.\n\nSpeaking of MyFonts.com, here is their best seller list, which is updated daily:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/bestsellers.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20091105050504/http:/www.myfonts.com/bestsellers.html)  \nWhat better way to get instant feedback on who is buying which fonts. Like Linotype.com, two Linotype fonts top this list as well, Zapfino and Neue Helvetica. From today’s top-50, 22 are scripts, 18 are sans serifs, 5 are serif faces, 3 are “other” (sorry for the over-generalization here), and two are ornaments/symbol fonts. The sans serifs licensed here are not so different from the sans serifs licensed at Linotype.com\n\nFontShop keeps charts as well. I like these, because FontShops operate locally. It isn’t easy to visit another country’s FontShop, i.e., if you are in Germany, you have to enter in a FontShop USA’s URL twice before the site will even open, because of automatic re-direct.  \nHere is FontShop Germany’s Top 25:  \n [http://www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Fprodtips.php3%3Fns%3D10%26sns%3D1%3Cbr%20/%3E](http://web.archive.org/web/20091105050504/http:/www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Fprodtips.php3%3Fns%3D10%26sns%3D1%3Cbr%20/%3E)  \nOf the 25, only four are scripts—exactly the bottom four (the best, P22 Cezanne, comes in at place 22). Only 2 serif faces on this list. Of the top 25, 7 come from FontShop Internation or Font Shop (one is only labeled “FontShop”; I thought that all FontShop fonts were from FontShop Internation (FSI)?). 17 are from other foundry’s. Like I already said, I really like this list, because it seems to say a lot. Namely, Germans who license fonts from FontShop like sans serifs. They don’t necessarially prefer FSI’s own typefaces, but they still buy from FontShop, rather than going to another site like Linotype’s or Monotype’s or MyFonts, where many fonts are even cheaper because of exchange rates and taxes and other things. Does the lack of script strength say anything about German tastes? Maybe Germans don’t like script fonts as much as Americans do? Maybe they do like them, but get them at Veer, or for free from Free Font download sites?\n\nDoes the SF site, FontShop.com, have a top seller list, too? They have really pretty e-mail newsletters.\n\nMonotype’s Fonts.com website has a Top Ten:  \n [http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Top10.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20091105050504/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Top10.htm)  \nOf these 10, there are no scripts, just 9 sans serifs and 1 serif.\n\n"

It makes for a tidier presentation. I suppose we could have bumped it up to the top 24 faces, but then it would open up the discussion to ’what happened to number 25?’\n\n\\> _They don’t account for any multiplicity in the licensing when they do the stats?_\n\nOur stats do not include additional licensing numbers.
