This is for an art piece and I’m using Helvetica because I want the copy to have a very corporate advertise-y look, something that people will definintely associate with advertising. I want the text around the copy to look like it was from a book. So it should look “familiar,” again, like from a book, but not contrast to much with the copy. Right now I’m using Adobe Caslon because it seems ’neutral’, or generic enough, and it’s OK, but I feel it could be better and can’t exactly put my finger on it. That’s why I thought I’d ask the experts.\n\nHrant\\> You’re probably right about lower contrast. I can not find Unica, even with a Google search.\n\nScott\\> Akkurat is nice, but I want a heavier weight then they offer, and their fonts are very expensive. Corrundum could be possibility, but maybe a bit too “slabby.”\n\n"

But Univers just might add that something I felt was missing. I think I was too fixated on Helvetica just because it seemed like the obvious thing to use.\n\nI’m not so much looking for a good sans/serif combination as a “message” done with type, although I do want them to balance well.\n\nBut I have to say, your idea of using Arial Black and Times New Roman is enticing. I don’t know how ironic it would be, but it sure would be humorous.\n\n"

(Shudder...)\n\nI’m now getting the feeling that the other font should be Bookman.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bookman](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907003024/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bookman \"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=bookman\") \\_  \nFor one thing it has that out-of-scale atmosphere about it (I mean  \nit would look like a book font, magnified) plus it has low contrast.\n\nhhp\n\n"

At this point I’m liking it better, especially the Extra Black, it actually has a more “advertisey” feel. Which led to think of Helvetica Inserat, which I’m also going to try.\n\nBookman, that’s an excellent suggestion, I would never have thought of that. I don’t have it, but it’s pretty cheap, and I only need one weight. Speaking of weight, it’s also a little heavier which is good. I found at the size I’m using, and with the heavy copy, the regular weight looked a little thin, I was using the semibold of Adobe Caslon.\n\n"
