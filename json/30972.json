Generally considered to be a more \"civilized\" way of dealing with people who post annoying or misleading content, stretch the truth to breaking, attempt to impose their system of politics or religion on others, or just don't (in your opinion) have a clue.\n\nA previous candidate was sativo: potential ones include Uli and missgiggles.\n\nAnyone is welcome to invoke The Silence Brigade, either personally without fanfare, or publicly, with appropriate notice.\\*\n\n\\* \"Appropriate notice\" is the use of this sentence: _I hereby officially invoke The Silence Brigade._\n\n(T-shirts may be available at TypeCon: ask for [Ricardo Cordoba](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017022408/http:/typophile.com/user/7716).)\n\n",
