Thanks Mike,   \n   \nIts a really nice loose slab.   \n   \nI found this on their site:   \n_- Our \"Severance\" font was originally hand drawn by our former Design Director (and named after her). As the company grew, she couldn't keep up with all the writing, so her hand lettering was converted to a computer format so we could type in the lettering rather than keep her up 24 hours a day. It is a proprietary font, owned by Ben & Jerry's and is **not available for sale or downloading**._   \n   \nboo-hoo...   \n   \nBren\n\n"
