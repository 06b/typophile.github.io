They want something simple, clean, and somewhat \"tech\"-y since their tagline at the moment is Wired for Service. Any suggestions for improvement/comments/etc. would be much appreciated.\n\n",

None of these logos carry much of a sense of warmth, which would seem appropriate for a volunteer organization. The tagline should provide additional sense about the group, not simply echo the logo (and vice versa).\n\n"

What about the university's regular logo but drawn loosely with a squiggly line to represent the wire?\n\n- Lex\n\n"
