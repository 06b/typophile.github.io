  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm tweaking a logo for a church and looking for the perfect sans-serif. Ideally it would be something pretty geometric -- I'm looking for a round \"O\" to complement the mark. Also, I would prefer something with a single-story lowercase \"a.\" Right now I'm actually considering using Futura. It's definitely geometric, but it doesn't come off as very warm or personable.\n\nThanks for your help!  \nMatt\n\n",

Although, I must admit I wasn't aware Museo had a complementing sans-serif! I'll definitely keep that in mind for future projects. And Frode, thank you for your generous reply. Your willingness to open up a custom type to me is really, really kind. It looks spectacular.\n\nI almost feel like I'm letting you guys down… our team just came together behind Avenir today. I really appreciate the input, though!\n\nThanks,  \nMatt\n\n"
