How can a typeface convey meaning and message? Is there a place for illustration within typography? And what is the value of legibility and readability in determining creation and use of type?   \n  \n With the constant mode of change and innovation going on, graphic design, typography and type design, will move along in fashion. The basic ingredient of written language, the alphabet, stays very much the same, but the way it looks, smells, tastes or feels, changes by the urgent need for new and different experiences.   \n   \nDATE: Wednesday, October 1   \nTIME: 7:00 pm   \nLOCATION: Academy of Art College, Morgan Auditorium. 491 Post Street, San Francisco   \n   \nAlso, Indie Fonts 2 will be on sale at the event for $20 (that's a savings of $19).\n\n",
