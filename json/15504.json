  "content": "Many logotypes seem to use characters derived from Handel Gothic. But, Hadel Gothic would be much better if it had a complete set of uppercase characters at the lowercase size and a complete set of lowercase characters at the uppercase size, I think.\n\nThis Omron logo seems to use the lowercase \"m\"s and the uppercase \"R\" (modified a bit); but, whenever I reduce an uppercase character to a lowercase size, the weight is too thin.\n\nDo you think the designers of this logo used a combination of a regular weighht and a bold weight of Handel (with slight modifications); or, is there a font that more closely resembles these letters?\n\nThank you...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Typeface.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140708015638/http:/typophile.com/files/Typeface.jpg) | 36.39 KB |\n\n",
