I repeat: it is a very interesting and herculean work you've got there. I once read a book called \"Diseño.com\" by Nestor Sexe, I remember he mentioned the mutability and immutability of a sign. This is, as you said in the magazine's article, the letterforms do change but we will never notice maybe. The mutation of a form or the signification of a sign is a change that comes along with sociological changes (such as sumerian or egyptian script) or technological changes (such as the invention of the printing by Gutenberg).\n\nI think it's great that you lead and improve this changes to legibility and easy writing. I did an investigation on the characteristics of the typefaces and the aesthetics movements of the time they were created. It was very interesting to see how the form of the writing keeps changing according to the culture, art, technologies, and even religion.\n\nI would love to keep talking and learning about this, but I think we went off the topic of this thread...\n\n"

It was an invitation by David  \nGoldstein to banter about which fonts one might find sexually attractive,  \nif one caricatured oneself as a typeface.\n\nI suggested that I was the auto-erotic Thesis, a typeface with both serif  \nand sans serif varieties--riffing on the previous poster's mention of Gill  \nSans' attraction to Perpetua, which is to all intents and purposes \"Gill  \nSerif\", both designed by the sexually notorious Eric Gill.\n\nWhen Andy Clymer said, \"I'm Akzidenz Grotesk, only more optimistic,\" well,  \nthat wasn't about anything other than the horrific name of that particular  \ntypeface.\n\nSo I don't think that thread addressed the issue of whether personality  \ntype/typeface correspondence is stupid or not. There are no doubt other  \nTypophile threads which do, but searching Typophile archives is difficult.\n\n\\_Nick\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI would imagine that Mr Allemang's article was also edited, and that a third party wrote the headline and deck.\n\nAlthough I think this stuff is trivial and the topic worthy of more than \"a few minutes to share your thoughts\", I feel obliged to participate from a business perspective, to keep myself in the public eye and on the usual suspects list when it comes to type design commissions. So I am slightly peeved that after spending quite a few minutes corresponding with Mr Allemang, I was mentioned as a \"designer\", not a type designer, and that the word \"designing\" was removed from my statement \"I believe in designing typefaces that defy categorization\", without, even, the substitution of an ellipsis.\n\n"
