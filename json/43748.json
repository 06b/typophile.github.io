I was handed this by a client who likes this, all I can see is “Giddyup”, but hey, it’s her money. Ed Script is a much better face IMHO, but I’d like to show her this as an option if it exists.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404180315im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sprinkles_5941.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sprinkles.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404180315/http:/typophile.com/files/sprinkles_0.jpg) | 33.84 KB |\n\n [‹ I need this cool font please help!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404180315/http:/typophile.com/node/43384 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What is this? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080404180315/http:/typophile.com/node/43728 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Unfortunately, the client has a “thing” for the cupcakes, and this is their logo, so I am forced to offer this up as an option and try to talk her out of it.\n\n"
