I'd checked his blog a bunch of times in the last three months, and actually <cite>been</cite> to the BPL about a week before this, and somehow stayed oblivious of it.\n\nI don't think I did anything that night either. Depressing.\n\nEdit: Apparently this is a lecture that happens annually, and it was [mentioned right here on Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020201314/http:/typophile.com/node/44038). I have no excuse.\n\n",

I'm right at North Station, but I was so swamped with overtime. There's always great stuff at the BPL (and ICA too). We need to keep our eyes peeled little better i guess.\n\n"
