  "content": "I've got a Blogspot account for one of my blogs and it's time to find a new template for it. Ideally, I'd like to move up to Wordpress but I don't have the means to do that at the moment. So I'm looking for a new Blogger template - problem is, all of the templates that I've seen online for Blogger are pretty bad. The layouts are usually awful, with too much focus on flashy graphics and not enough on good design or typography. I'm a fan of Allan Cole's Wordpress templates - alas, none of his are available for Blogger.\n\nSo I thought I'd throw this question out there - does anyone know of some well-designed Blogger templates? Many thanks in advance.\n\n",
