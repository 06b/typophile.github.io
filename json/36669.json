Many samples of all their signature fonts, including the \"Garamont\" (Jannon), the Jaugeon, and more. Plus, it has a _stunning_ range of samples of their foreign language fonts.\n\nYou can buy a copy for as little as $25 if you don't care about the condition. Well worth it for any scholar of fine old printing.\n\n"

You can buy <cite>Debuts de l’imprimerie en France</cite> from many vendors: some are listed in the Google Books page linked by Raph, although a character encoding problem prevents the links from actually working. Apparently [Abebooks seems to list the widest number of sources](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018234402/http:/www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=2&sts=t&tn=D%E9buts+de+l%27imprimerie+en+France&x=0&y=0), that’s probably where the $25 copy Raph was mentioning comes from. Unfortunately I’ll have to restrain from buying it now unless I want to go bankrupt.\n\nAs for the Garamont type: it’s a very successful and beautiful design, but I am not quite fond of its K, R, and T at the moment, they look somewhat unbalanced. But I’m surely missing something, I can’t claim any authority in this critique at all.\n\n"

I've made an interim release, but they're still too rough edged to be used by anyone other than their creator. I'm reluctant to release any outlines for the Zeno, because I don't want to irritate Martino Mardersteig, who I feel has some moral claim to the font. However, my digitizations from the Centaur originals ( [Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018234402/http:/www.levien.com/type/myfonts/museum.html)) come with full Spiro plate files and processed images of the letterforms from the high-res 2400 dpi scans. I'm not at my main font computer now, but I'll try to make png images of both the scan and the screenshot this evening after dinner.\n\nThe reason that my design techniques are so secret has more to do with people not paying them much attention than me trying to hide them. People generally seem happy with their existing Bezier tools, but I personally can't imagine going back to them after tasting the Spiro curves.\n\n"

      "content": "Bingo!\n\nWow Raph,\n\nvery fastly a comment, even if I have to read your comments a few times again before getting everything (English problem;-):  \nI AM THE ONE in the world who understands what you mean (at least hope so to understand you well) according to beziér curves. I am convinced that they change natural organic forms into something new and different and NOT DESIRABLE. I design typefaces now for more than 15 years and still I can’t rid of my feeling that these curves don’t really work with analogic forms. I mean maybe there is a difference between an oval and a mathematical ellipse. I often feel forced to introduce more and more points into a curve when I wish to make it soft and natural which I know in fact weakens every beziér design, I think also because the choice that the computer has to do, actually setting the points into the rough grid, is too unprecise and therefore curves become shaky. And to draw the tangents more to the outside from the maximum point distorts the area next to the point.  \nAND WHY THE HELL NOBODY DISCCUSSES THINGS LIKE THAT??  \nSeems that everyone in the world works fine with Beziér and look what they have done to the classics as Jenson for example!  \nThey changed even our own way today of seeing forms. It’s my believe at least.  \nAm I totally wrong? Crazy? Foolish?\n\nI have seen that in your types there is something different. I felt it.  \nTo me they look more “passive” in its curves which is a great compliment because this means you did catch the nature of the forms of the original form without changing them!! Maybe I am wrong and didn’t understand you well.  \nBut if you have something different please go out and tell it to the world even if noone seems to hear you!!!\n\nthanks  \nStefan\n\n"

Because you showed Beziér curves, too, in the (beautiful) designs you made from Zeno. I am confused.  \nI did understand that you made an average image of more than one scan of the same letter, right? But then, is there something different in actually translating them digitally? Is it in FontLab you did the work?  \nNext time I will wait before answering too quick ;-)  \nBut still there is some truth in what I say, isn’t it? But maybe its only my personal design problem.  \nAnyhow love your fonts!  \nAnd you are probably right with Mardersteig.  \nDid you get the originals for the scan from him? I am astonished then.  \nFor what I heard he wasn’t keen on translating digitally Officina stuff.  \nDo you know Jane Patterson and Sebastiano Castiglioni, by the way?\n\nStefan\n\n"

      "content": "Stefan: Spiro curves are indeed different from beziers, they are called Cornu curves and they make it easier to get smooth connections. Spiro is also able to convert from its own Cornu plate format to beziers, so you can draw glyphs in Spiro then import then into your font editor for complete font production. Raph made an [initial release of Spiro, 0.01](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018234402/http:/levien.com/spiro/). It’s very rough around the edges but gives you a feel for how Cornu curves work.\n\nIn the [Typophile thread announcing the first release](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018234402/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33531) Raph and others discussed Spiro at length, including future plans and how it can be used _today_ to get work done (because that’s what Raph uses, actually).\n\nHope this helps.\n\n"

For many Roman alphabets, plain old conic sections are what one would like. And there's Melior, a typeface by Hermann Zapf which is based on Piet Hein's superellipse.\n\n"
