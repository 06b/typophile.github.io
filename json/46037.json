  "content": "Hello,\n\nI just had a brainstormy idea and wanted to ask people about how they feel about it. I have no direct plans to use it immediately, but if I get rather positive answers I might at some point.\n\nNow, there are a lot of serif fonts that have a  \nlike Regent II, ITC Anima, Fritz Quadrata, Gill Facia, Hiroshige, etc. of which the capital U has a \"descender\", the second stroke hits the bottom, sometimes with a half serif there as well.\n\nMost other serif fonts don't have this feature.\n\nNow, starting from such a font (i.e. \"regular\" U without the foot), the idea was, that instead of attaching the [ogonek](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043613/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ogonek) at the middle, one could take an footed alternate of U to attach it. Considering that for a,e,i,u,A,E,I the ogonek is attached at the last stroke, at the right side of the glyph, this could bring in harmony:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043613im_/http:/typophile.com/files/uogonek_6101.png)\n\nThe image shows in the center the original U from Junicode (I like that font for experimental tweakings). to the left of it is the conventional, built-in Uogonek. To the right my proposal (roughly; this was just a quick patch-up).\n\nThe base form of the U would not be altered, so the first U's basic shape would look different from the second less the ogonek in LIETUVIŲ.\n\nDoes this make sense? How does it feel? Is it a nice idea, or would this detail distract too much while reading? Lithuanian input appreciated :-)  \nAlso, I see that while the brings Uogonek nearer to its AEI counterparts, this also makes O a standalone exception. Then again, as I figured, o-ogonek is only used in transcribing Old Norse (and there the other ogenecked letters are not) and in some Native American orthographies, but there in complementery distribution to u-ogonek (either u-ogonek is used OR o-ogonek)\\*). If there is no text containing both o-ogonek and u-ogonek, that's not a problem (no visual inconsistency between right-palced and center-placed ogonek between O and U), and for languages containing both i-ogonek and u-ogonek (Lithuanian, some Native American) we have achieved a consistency among the ogonecked capitals (and also between lc and uc).\n\nOr does that design look awkward?  \nAnd most important: did you understand this post at all, or did I — as usually — overcomplicate my description?\n\nSzabolcs\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\\* According to Wikipedia.\n\n",

      "content": "Szabolcs,\n\nThe problem with the ogonek positioning in the Junicode font is that somebody thought they are centered, with of course isn't true. The top of the ogonek has been positioned at the geometric centre of the base glyph, but of course \\_optically\\_ the ogoneks are positioned in the left part of the letter, which looks absurd. And it's the optical impression that counts.\n\nIt is quite easily fixed and does not require redrawing the U, and also solves the O problem (my changes are on the right):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043613im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Oogonek_Uogonek_4407.png)\n\nNow, the ogoneks are slightly to the right. One could also try attaching them really in the optical centre if one wants (i.e. just slightly more to the left than what I did, but definitely not as far to the left as in the original glyph which is shown in the middle):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043613im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Oogonek_Uogonek1_4958.png)\n\nBut the most important thing is that you \\_cannot\\_ just stick a composite ogonek onto O or U or e or even a, for that matter.

The German \"w\" `[v]` and the English \"w\" `[w]` don't describe the same sound. The German \"z\" `[t͡s]` and the English \"z\" `[z]` don't describe the same sound. The Spanish \"r\" `[r]` and the French \"r\" `[ʀ]` or `[ʁ]` don't describe the same sound. Damn, even within the same language one letter can describe different sounds (\"u\" in English words \"luck\", \"put\", \"mule\" and \"fur\" certainly describes different sounds each time).\n\nBut this does not have any influence on the fact that those different sounds can be written using the same letters.\n\nAdam\n\n"

You need to redraw the junctions every time.\"\n\n\\_That\\_ was clear :-) This goes for most good diacritics, (I prefer different (mostly: different wide) circumflexes (circumflices ;-) ) on i (e.g. Turkish) and w (e.g. in Welsh language). It is however twice as true for attached diacritcs: ogoneks, cedillas and horns (in Thai).\n\nWhile looking at it, I'm mysself less and less convinced of a legged variant of U for attaching an ogonek, you did circumvened directly addressing the question regarding its viability by merely pointing out (completely right) that it was unnecessary.\n\nBruzs's \"centered\" ogonek on E in the Lithuanian-govt.-sponsored font was insightful as an alternative, maybe less traditional, more avantegarde solution.\n\nClearly, the sound value of a letter is completely unimportant for glyph design. The complementary distribution of oogonek and uogonek, however, were important for my above considerations, if both were to appear in the same language, my suggestion would have lost validity immediately.\n\nA last question to the explicitly Lithuanians here: do words start with uogonek? I have only met them at the end of words. Would capital Uogoneks appear e.g. in names (not necessarily personal), or capitalised due to the beginning of a sentence, or only in all-caps settings (e.g. if they only happen to appear in medial and final positions)?\n\nSzabolcs\n\n"

      "content": "A legged U is historically correct in some lettering styles but not in others. I think in principle, it would be possible to mix a round U and a legged Uogonek in one typeface, but this would need to be done carefully. Some readers may get confused as they might think that the alternate shape signifies some additional difference. Also, the legged U would need to be drawn properly, with appropriate weight distribution on the stems, and with a complete redrawing of the curve. I realize that your own sketch for Junicode is just a rough illustration of the concept, but at the same time it clearly demonstrates that this is not a quick-and-dirty job. This brings us to a final point: in many cases, it would be uneconomic to redraw the base letter so drastically for the sake of Uogonek. I fear that it would often be done incompetently, as diacritic extensions are often done by people other than the original designers. One for sure — I do not see the legged Uogonek to be the default approach to solve the problem. I think it can be considered a valid alternate approach for some, very specific, typeface classes.\n\nA.\n\n"

      "content": "The ę character is certainly the oldest among the letters with an \"ogonek\". E caudata was the only such glyph used in medieval Latin (interchangibly with æ for the same sound).\n\nPolish adopted the letter ę for the nasalized \"e\" sound, probably because it just \"was there\" and was not used for anything else. Then, Polish borrowed the ogonek shape to form the letter for the nasalized \"o\" sound, which became \"ą\". From Polish, the shape was borrowed by the Lithuanian, which in addition to ą and ę also have an i and a u with the ogonek (Lithuania was in union with Poland for several centuries; Poland was mostly the dominant part in that union).\n\nMy guess is that the o with ogonek as used in Old Norse is an independent development. However, Decodeunicode's description of \"the Polish ogonek, which goes all the way down to the bottom line (like “p”)\" is not correct. Depending on the structure of the typeface, the ogonek can be quite large or small. The larger the intended size for a typeface, the smaller the diacritics (that is a general rule). In typefaces intended for small sizes, the ogonek needs to be quite large so it remains legible. In typefaces intended for display sizes, the ogonek and the other diacritcal marks are usually much less pronounced.\n\nThere are some images on my  \n [http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/ogonek.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043613/http:/www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/ogonek.html \"http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/ogonek.html\")  \nbut I hope to update this page with lots of newer material in some near future.\n\nCheers,  \nAdam\n\n"
