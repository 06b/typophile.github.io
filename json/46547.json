  "content": "Hey guys, I thought your collective expertise might help me on this:  \nI'm trying to implement an experimental writing system as an opentype font. It uses devanagari-style glyph combination, that is:\n\nconsonant + vowel -\\> 'cv' ligature  \nbut ALSO  \n vowel + vowel -\\> 'vv' lig  \nAND  \n 'cv' lig + vowel -\\> 'cvv'\n\nand there are some fina features for good measure.\n\n23 consonants and 6 vowels obviously makes hundreds of glyphs. I realise I can sub them ALL but I would rather find an elegant way of programming them. So I have a few questions:\n\n1)  \nIn fontlab, I can do \"sub cons vowel by combi\", and \"sub @consonant by @combined\", but sub won't take a class as the out stream on a context substitution, like \"sub @cons a by @acons\". Is there a way around this? (my glyphs are named appropriately (by fontlab standards) if this were to theoretically be possible)\n\n2)  \nFont doesnt support multisubstitutions; if I were to use software like VOLT which does, would it accept a class as an out stream in a contextual sub, like the functionality I desire which I described above?\n\n3)  \nI have tried to experiment using VOLT, but when I load in my .ttf, my meticulously named glyphs are reset to 'glyph001', 'glyph002' etc, which makes them impractical to me to create classes with, because there's HUNDREDS and I dont want to name them all a second time. Is there option in either fontlab or VOLT I am missing. It would be great.\n\nThanks for reading, please respond if you can, even if it's just to tell me I have to sub them all one by one... :)\n\nLak\n\n",
