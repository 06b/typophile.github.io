  "content": "In the design of the (Latin) UC there are two general schemes: the \"classical\" (old-style) one where the widths diverge a lot (like \"B\" is narrow while \"C\" is wide); and the \"modern\" style where the widths converge a lot. When it comes to numerals, it just hit me that even in the old-style scheme there's a lot of convergence in width (except for the one). Now, it can be said that numbers are inherently \"rationalist\" so they should converge. But there's always the option of making monowidth numerals, and when it comes the old-style (AKA \"text\") numerals it seems to makes sense that their geometric divergence shouldn't be confined to the vertical.\n\nThis idea came to me upon returning to admire Perrin's Augustaux:  \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Elzevir/PerrinNums.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20141202233354/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Elzevir/PerrinNums.gif \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Elzevir/PerrinNums.gif\") \\_  \n(See this old thread: [http://typophile.com/node/7596](http://web.archive.org/web/20141202233354/http:/typophile.com/node/7596 \"http://typophile.com/node/7596\"))\n\nThe main question -assuming you agree that width divergence has a place- I think is this: what might be a good scheme here? I mean, which numerals should be towards the narrow end and which the wide? And does this relate to the given numeral being x-height, ascending or descending? Also, can we greatly diverge the widths even in the design of lining numerals?\n\nIt's not impossible that we might end up with a new numeral scheme that works better in running text... at which point we might start calling what we currently call \"old-style\"... \"transitional\"? :-)\n\nhhp\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [IN\\_table\\_s.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20141202233354/http:/typophile.com/files/IN_table_s.gif) | 120.65 KB |\n\n",

In particular, I like the horizontals of 2, 7 and 4 to be relatively long, and I think the commonest fault is to make 3 and 5 too wide. Especially 3, which often seems to end up much too large. I like the way that in the older typefaces the lower curve on 3 and 5 is distinctly not the same shape as the circular curves on 8, 0, 6 and 9, and the horizontal of the 5 distinctly not the same length as the horizontals on 2, 4 and 7.\n\nPersonally also I like the completely unmodulated 0: the pure circle. I know people find this \"stands out\", and want to give it some modulation. But it seems to me to be perfectly functional and to have a certain satisfactory symbolic quality.\n\n"

Figures like 8 have a lot going on so they can look like a dark spot in a line of text. That is why they should be widened, not just to fit some classification scheme. Three should be narrower because it is not closed. The difference in horizontals of 5 and seven is a question of how much is going on in the rest of the figure. You wouldn't want a wide horizontal on the 5 to make it topple as top heavy where as the 7 needs something to hold that very long diagonal.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I love \"old-style\" numerals and actually have been tossing around the idea of including them with the typeface I'm working on now. After some thought I asked myself (and now I ask of all of you): aside from style or look alone, what purpose do \"old-style\" numerals actually serve?\n\nFunctionally speaking I can't justify using them in heavy text settings and where issues of width proportion are a big concern. I like the way they look though. :)\n\n"

Are you sure? As for the zero, considering text fonts are meant to have numerals that don't distract, I can't agree with the perfect-circle form. BTW, that's one great thing about 3/4 and hybrid nums: the zero can't get confused with an \"O\"/\"o\".\n\nDan: So you're saying that even OS nums should be monospaced?

      "content": "\"...what purpose do “old-style” numerals actually serve?\"\n\nTerry,  \nEach style of figures has a purpose. Monospaced are needed for tabular uses; proportional lining are good in text where you want numbers to be prominent (phone directories, business cards, etc.). So called \"oldstyle\" is best for running text where you don't want figures to pop and become obtrusive. What you have to think about when designing a typeface is what your users/customers will require and see as a plus in their purchase decision making. Even if you feel comfortable not using oldstyle in your work, your users probably will. Remember, people who actually BUY type are more likely to use it at its fullest and want their options open. This assumes you are talking about a text face. It is less true for display and not needed for signage.\n\nBTW, How is life (and work) in San Francisco?\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Although maybe not \"slightly\".\\* Just make it an ascending numeral (hopefully still shorter than cap height though).\n\n\\* Unless we really want to get medieval on our asses and apply that idea to the entire alphabetics - which might indeed rule. The Greeks used to do it, until Porson threw Modernism at them.\n\n\\> as monospace as possible\n\nThere's little point to this.

As far as I'm concerned it's worth reviving (or at least thinking about, which too few designers do, even accomplished ones) actually because they fit better with the Cartesian usage of the lowercase; in the conventional alignment scheme you're more likely to end up with a numeral string that seems to sit too low.\n\n\\> differentiation might be improved if the 3 and 5 were not so similar in width\n\nThat's a good point.  \nAnd making one ascending and the other descending might be ideal.\n\n\\> someone put a couple of 1’s back in the wrong case\n\nGood eyes! What's interesting though is that the tabulation was maintained aligned. Maybe all (or a bunch) of the IN's fonts had all their numerals of the exact same width - smart, since wrong-sort situations (more probable with numerals than alphabetics) wouldn't throw a wrench into composition.\n\nhhp\n\n"
