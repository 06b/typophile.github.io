The concept behind it deals with how society views African American males two different ways (a criminal or a professional) yet it is still the same person.   \n   \nThe style is supposed to be a business casual & more sophisticated look - moving away from the street styles of Phat Farm, Sean John & Rocawear.   \n   \nPlease give me feedback on the legibility & aesthetics of the logo. Thanks   \n   \nMTStanford\n\n",

Right now it looks divided, which kind of contributes to your statement, but I think the joining of the \"G\"s is a stronger statement in relation to your \"still the same person\", as Mitchell identified. Also, I wonder what small cap \"E\"s would look like (about 70% of the vertical height of the \"G\"s). It might create a nice implied frame for the word, not to mention an interestingly strong shape.   \n   \nAloha, or shall I say \"shaka\" in this critique\n\n"
