If you look at the titles of the other threads you’ll see things like\n\nScrambler Marie’s\n\nor\n\nJamie Oliver logo sans typeface\n\nEven something simpler like “Deco Sans” or “Papyrus like font” will help.\n\nThese kinds of titles make it easier to find the thread and distinguish it from the others (including your own). It also saves Yves a little work having to creatively rename it.\n\n"
