Specific courses would be great too, like typography, photography or just graphic design.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be in Dublin, since I’m still planning the trip. Actually it would be interesting to hear about courses um Scotland also. I left England off because it’s too expensive.\n\nI really appreciate your help.\n\n",

Dublin Institute of Technology, [www.dit.ie](http://web.archive.org/web/20060628172948/http:/www.dit.ie/), NCAD National College of Art and Design at [www.ncad.ie](http://web.archive.org/web/20060628172948/http:/www.ncad.ie/) and the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology at [www.iadt.ie](http://web.archive.org/web/20060628172948/http:/www.iadt.ie/). Take a look at all of them, though the last has a very fine reputation. My wife went to NCAD where she learned to be a great weaver, hand-woven fabrics. Good luck.  \nJordan\n\n"
