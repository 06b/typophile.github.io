  "content": "Hi all, I've just found out about this place through looking for some type critism. The standard of type design here is incredible and makes me feel very humble.   \n   \n   \nI've been working on a face for a couple of weeks, on and off. I wanted to produce a graffiti style display font. It started out as graffiti style handwriting which I scanned but became more disciplined as problem and inconsistancies started to emerge. As I began to place the letters side by side, they didn't fit together, so the overall style gradually became more uniform. Any critisms are appreciated.   \n\\<br\\>   \n\\<br\\>   \n   \n\\<img\\>\n\n",

But I don't think I know enough to say whether you should keep it the way it is or modify it a bit... basically, you might want to open up the counter spaces just a wee bit. Same goes for the top of \"C\" and \"G\"... those parts will tend to \"clog up\" at smaller sizes...   \n   \nAnybody else have an opinion on this?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments guys. Ricardo, yes I wanted the look of graffiti for my typeface so I kept the spacing tight on the example, although I haven't properly grappled with spacing yet. I understand the 'E' is different from the other letters in some ways, but I liked the aggressive look it had and decided to keep it. I will try and open up the counter spaces on the 'E', 'C' and 'G'. These were some of the toughest letters for me and I came up with many versions.   \n   \nHrant, I looked up Excoffon as I wasn't familiar with his name, but I'm certainly familiar with his work. I can see quite a few similarities with his 'Banco' typeface, thanks.   \n   \nI'm not very clued up on the technical terms yet, by 'optional alternates', do you mean making for example 3 styles of the letter 'E'? I might have this totally wrong, please bear with me.   \n   \nCheers guys.   \n   \nFrank   \n   \nUK\n\n"

Optional Alternates could be like those fonts that have alternates letters with ex shift + letter or shift + alt + letter. I'm not sure.... guys???   \n   \nCheers and keep up the good work   \n   \nMark // Freelanceren   \n   \nDK\n\n"
