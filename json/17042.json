This is a page with an example.\n\n[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=1454402](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013041632/http:/abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=1454402 \"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=1454402\")\n\nAnd this is the Intel CEO saying \"When Eric asked me if I had any sacred cows, I said no. He asked, what around the dropped \"e\"? And I said if it makes sense, it's time to do it. He was given pretty free rein to change.\n\nAnd when I saw [the new logo], it just jumped out at me. It reflected that change, where we want to go. There's a feeling of movement around [the new logo], and the tag line \"Leap Ahead\" certainly reiterates that.\"\n\n[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06\\_02/b3966009.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013041632/http:/www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_02/b3966009.htm \"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06\\_02/b3966009.htm\")\n\nAnd there you have over 30 years of brand equity and recognition swooped away.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FX11012300224.jpeg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013041632/http:/typophile.com/files/FX11012300224.jpeg) | 4.01 KB |\n\n",

Sort of reminds me of the explosion of high-tech engingeering firms of the '80s when EVERY logo was either in Helvetica or Eurostile/Microgramma.\n\n"

And what is one going to encounter? A leap. What kind of leap? A leap over something? Alarming, but presumably survivable. Or a leap into something? An abyss perhaps.\n\n"

I actually like the new type except for the \"e\" which looks like straight AG and does not marry well with the rest. I do miss the dropped positioning of the e but wonder if it would work in that new configuration.  \nThe big thing is that, branding speak aside, I don't think it shows any \"change in direction\" or any of the tired old \"feeling of movement\".  \nIt seems like in today's world, you \"rebrand\" every 30 days whether you need it or not--kinda makes the Vice President for Marketing feel very important.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
