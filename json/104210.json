Were various photo-composition era versions that could have been used for the logo. Digital versions usually are dumped in various unrelated categories like western, circus, and as in the case of Hessian, biker/motor cycle.So far found nothing closer than Hessian.  \nDon\n\n"

So if you find a pirate copy of a digital file that was originated by Hells Angels be careful not to break the law by using it, or that's not all that might be broken:) However, seems to be no LEGAL problem [at least in USA] with creating a new digital design that matches an image provided it has a name that will not infringe.  \nDon\n\n"

Love the explanation:  \n---start quote---  \nWhen I was working on a project one day, I went a-lookin’ for the Hell’s Angels font. Not only did I not find it, but along the way I bumped into the information that they don’t give that font out, it’s in their secret files. Really guys?? I guess now we all know one more thing about the infamously bad ass biker gang…they pilfer cool fonts. Well, I went ahead and made it, that’s how I roll. Last time I checked, no other designers were putting their life on the line making fonts. You’re welcome.  \n---end quote---  \nHow close? decide for yourself:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195858im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bike_5867.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
