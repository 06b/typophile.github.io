Do you like it/hate it? Is it boring or not so?\n\nThanks for your comment and critique in advance!\n\nfab\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414211518im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unalom_sketces_03_all_4895.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "It'd make a nice magazine cover typeface I think. I wouldn't bother so much about not being legible at small sizes. You might want to make it look amazing really big. The roundish, dropish terminal lends itself well for that.\n\nAs far as shapes go, I'd check on the shapes of lowercase A, F (maybe the terminal not so geometrical half circle), R (same as f), S (s being the one I enjoyed the least - pretty hard to get right - spine might not make such steep directional change). Observe what you did with J lowercase, I think r, f should match that, looks good.\n\nThe lower part of uppercase B seems a little too far to the left.  \nIn the numbers, you may try to review 7, for one without the bar on the center.\n\nCheers!  \nRodrigo Saiani\n\n"
