  "content": "Hi all:   \n   \nI'm new here. I'm not a professional typographer and my mother tongue is not English. So, please, be lenient with me. I just love books and typography - I've read a few (about a dozen) books on it and know almost all the classic typefaces and the rudiments on how to plan a book.   \n   \nFrom my youth I was fascinated by two arguably similar typefaces: what I know now is Monotype Bembo (the metal version) and Garamond (I am fortunate my Grandfather had two genuine Plantin books - one published in the 17th Century and another one in the 18th).   \n   \nI am fairly content with Adobe Garamond (which I think is generally closer to the original - I mean in the general way a page looks - than Stempel Garamond) but not with the digital Monotype Bembo.   \n   \nWhen I manage to locate Monotype Bembo I bought it, but the ascenders and descenders were quite reduced. I e-mailed Monotype, they said they were working on a new version, but, quite casually, I found a new digital version that is extremely similar (I mean, it copies it) the original Monotype Bembo.   \n   \nI asked Monotype again (I sent a specimen) and they told me it would probably be a metal font. Now I know it isn't.   \n   \nDoes anyone know what it is and how I can get it?   \n   \nI found it in Stereophile - a magazine dealing with hi-fi matters.   \n   \nAny contribution will be warmly welcome.   \n   \nYours,   \n   \nR de S�\n\n",

There is also [Aldine 401](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826014517/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aldine-401/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=72&PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=Rowland), Bitstream's version of Bembo. The monotype version might well have an alternative R, though. I see that the [titling version](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826014517/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/bembo-titling-mt) has a similar R to your sample.\n\n"

      "content": "To Mister Berkson:   \n   \nWell, I have Monotype, Adobe and Bistream Bembos. They all differ from this one inasmuch the x height is relatively greater; that is, the form of the characters (a, c, e m,and so on) is a faithfull copy (To the extent of having the slightly bent m), but both the ascenders and descenders have been reduced.   \n   \nI think when Monotype digitized the font they tried to reach a sort of compromise - the new versions work well at 11 points, whereas the old book version was made, I think, with 12 points in mind (actually, it was 12 points).   \n   \nTo Mr Serra, dear friend:   \n   \nThank you. Could I second Mr Caston's request for a link - I can't seem able to find it.   \n   \nAnd to all, thank you. I love the old Monotype Bembo - I really can't tell why, by I assume it is because of its extremely elegant proportions and, at the same time, the very slight irregularity and \"bite\" it possesses. Not so pronounced as, for instance, Galliard but far more so than Robert Slimbach's excellent Garamond.\n\n"
