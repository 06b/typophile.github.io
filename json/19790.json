I have an idea, that I’ve seen the font before, but nothing pops up in my mind.\n\nSee it here: [http://www.papermag.com/modules/archive/uploaded\\_images/1307\\_ct\\_kal\\_penn...](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003753/http:/www.papermag.com/modules/archive/uploaded_images/1307_ct_kal_penn.jpg \"http://www.papermag.com/modules/archive/uploaded\\_images/1307\\_ct\\_kal\\_penn.jpg\")\n\nor\n\n[http://www.papermag.com/images/comingsoon.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003753/http:/www.papermag.com/images/comingsoon.gif \"http://www.papermag.com/images/comingsoon.gif\")\n\nRegarding Base-9 (and base-12) I must say I really like the font, when all letters are capitalized, but I don’t quite like it, when it’s lower case. I feel the the upper-cases coould be put together with something else. Something similar but without the pointy/sharp ends. Any ideas on how an alternative lowercase base-nine could look (and what the name of that font would be)?\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [basenine.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003753/http:/typophile.com/files/basenine.jpg) | 58.49 KB |\n\n [‹ Italic font in Hungarian linguistics publications](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003753/http:/typophile.com/node/19764 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [typography on stone or monument ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003753/http:/typophile.com/node/19780 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
