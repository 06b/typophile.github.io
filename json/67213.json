I think a Photoshop (or similar) noise technique was used, and perhaps the 0 was inverted, but the basic letterforms are very close.\n\nThe Script in the middle is completely unreadable to me, and you might as well pick any formal connected script as worry about trying to match something so unrecognizable, in my opinion.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
