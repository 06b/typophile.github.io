  "content": "Hello all,  \nI'm looking for a typeface that will rev off of names on the back of Sports/Basketball Jerseys. I'm looking for a bold, condensed version that is sans serif and preferably geometric in nature. I like the look of H&FJ's Champion and Knockout condensed versions, but they are a bit too rounded for what I'm looking for. If someone could suggest a similar quality typeface it would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",
