  "content": "After noticing a similar font appear in several photos from the 20s-30s Bulgaria, I tried to find its equivalent. It's a font I have not seen used in Cyrillic outside old photos.\n\nYou can see an example on this photo: [http://www.finetuna.com/zdea7v](http://web.archive.org/web/20100518194255/http:/www.finetuna.com/zdea7v \"http://www.finetuna.com/zdea7v\")\n\nNow, I am almost sure that whatever they used back then has not survived past the 40s (due to change of fashion or/and regime) but this typeface has been popular enough before that and I wonder if there is no current digital Latin equivalent? Anyone here have an idea?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

Yes, I was wondering if there is typeface like that. I was thinking about Latin because I haven't seen anything of the kind in Cyrillic. Which, of course, doesn't mean it doesn't exist but I wouldn't expect it.\n\n"
