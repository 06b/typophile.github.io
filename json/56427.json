The closest I have seen to this look was in the Expresiv Photo Lettering Font Collection where there was a Benguiat Charisma Shaded, but it was not a connecting script. I've never seen any shaded script with alternates like this for the start, middle and end of words. Seems to be crying out to be an OpenType font, doesn't it?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
