  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nHere are three pages from my thesis showing my [modified version](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124081509/http:/typophile.com/node/28085) of ITC Mendoza in action, esp. the small caps that Randy discussed with me earlier. I should've posted something like this right away.\n\nI agree that the small caps look too heavy and too small, esp. when used as on p. 155.\n\nEDIT: But I still think that beefing up the serifs, esp. the top serifs (and also the horizontal stem of e.g. T) was an improvement. The original ones look too anemic to me. The small caps of slab-serif faces seem to be a little problematic, though.\n\nBTW, do you think the italics (EDIT: i.e. the ordinary lowercase italics) are too heavy? Their weight I haven't changed, compared to the ITC original.\n\nFeel free to comment on anything on these pages, including the setting!\n\nNote that since setting the thesis, I have changed the fi and fl ligatures (making them wider, among other things) and reduced the sidebearings (esp. the right one) of the numeral 4. The specimen that I posted earlier (see the link above) shows the corrected versions, but I was too lazy to reset the pages I'm posting now.\n\nOlli\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [OM\\_thesis\\_p116.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124081509/http:/typophile.com/files/OM_thesis_p116.pdf) | 90.99 KB |\n| [OM\\_thesis\\_p155.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124081509/http:/typophile.com/files/OM_thesis_p155.pdf) | 67.92 KB |\n| [OM\\_thesis\\_p480.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124081509/http:/typophile.com/files/OM_thesis_p480.pdf) | 96.19 KB |\n\n",

(I may return to that later.)\n\nBut if anyone is interested at looking the whole-page specimens here, it is primarily the punctuation and other unalphabetics as well as the smalls caps that I have changed, relative to the ITC original.\n\n"
