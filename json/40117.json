Judging from the FontHaus-originated samples, FontShop Sweden must be a FontHaus sublicensee. Assuming this is the case, your royalties from FontShop Sweden will show up on your FontHaus checks as a percentage of whatever your royalty is with FontHaus. So, if FontShop Sweden is paying FontHaus 50% to sublicense your fonts, you will get half your normal FontHaus royalty for those sales. If you don’t want this to happen, you should contact FontHaus and renegotiate your contract. Or, you could make an agreement directly with FontShop Sweden and get a better deal than through the sublicense. (FYI, FontShop Sweden is not the only FontHaus sublicensee.)\n\n"
