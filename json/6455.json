I'm going to recreate free of charge just so I don't have to look this peice of garbage. The font is similar to Futura or Century Gothic, but the mid-point of the M doesn't touch the baseline. Anyone recognize it?   \n   \nThanks in advance for sharing your knowledge.   \n   \n ![McNeals' really crappy logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125727im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47917.jpg)\n\n",
