The KLIM studio has been set up to deal specifically with typographic issues within the realm of graphic design. If you need something that is typographic by nature, then I am at your service.\n\n**A thing well made…**  \n…is a song by legendary New Zealand band The Mutton Birds. ‘When a man holds a thing well made, there is a connection, there is completeness…’ This philosophy is at the very heart of my approach to typographic design—for art is long and life is short.\n\nURL: [http://www.klim.co.nz/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004825/http:/www.klim.co.nz/ \"http://www.klim.co.nz/\")\n\n",
