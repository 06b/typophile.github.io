The drippy C and G is a little less drippy. I also expanded it, it felt a little too compressed while I was working with it. Thanks for the critiques and please keep them coming. : ) - Jess\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pomonapdftwob.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418203635/http:/typophile.com/files/pomonapdftwob.pdf) | 460.63 KB |\n\n",

My only concern as far as letterform is concerned are the lower serifs on E, L, Z and z. It's too abrupt.\n\n"

      "content": "Excellent work. I really like the over look. The Kk in particular and also the French ampersand are quite nice. Here some comments. I find the lower bowl of the g too small, that letter should have more “personnality”. At my point of view it's seems too timid. It could be a bit larger. The top of the G could be a bit wider, the S would be more open on the top or the drop is too low, Finally, overall the typeface are slightly condensed, but some letters (B, R, K, S) looks a bit extended compare too other T, M, N, V, W). Keep going.\n\n"

      "content": "I love this! Really elegant and charming! The ampersand and numerals are especially delightful!  \nI'm sorry you've reduced the drippy terminals on the C and G, which I think were really lovely and I think perhaps the balance of the forms is a bit lost (G especially looks a bit bottom heavy).  \nF may be a little wide? And maybe S too?  \nDescender of j could maybe have a tighter curve on the right side?  \n1 looks a little light?  \nDelicious! Looking forward to seeing this continue :)\n\n"
