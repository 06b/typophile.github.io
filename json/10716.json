      "content": "Thank you. This type is a result of a project for class. My intent was to juxtapose classic letterforms with the effects of weathering. I find it interesting how rust works and that it is generally eating forms that were magestic and beautiful. Rust was the texture I was shooting for but I found it difficult to emulate.   \n   \nI appreciate the warnings. I'm fairly sure this won't be released for public use, it is merely my first attempt at type design. Is there anyway to work with what I have to make it more acceptable, or would I have to start from scratch?   \n   \nJen\n\n"

      "content": "Well, in any case it's best to give credit to the source. But if you're going to release it (especially for money), then it gets trickier. Technically you might be OK (like in the US it would be legal for you to work from a scan of the source), but it's not ethical unless the \"owner\" gives an OK. The owner might be the designer, or a client who's already paid for the original, or a bunch of other things. Some people even call for getting permission for anything at all (even just opening up a digital font in Fontographer, believe it or not), but those people are fundamentalists - best simply ignored.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
