The Latin seems kind of like a subtitle to the Chinese. :)  \nAlso, the visual hierarchy is clear: The Chinese is what leads. I wonder if the letterspacing in the Latin, while certainly ugly taken by itself, isn't basically the Latin following/echoing an aspect of the æsthetic of the Chinese text.\n\n"

Size: A given passage in modern Chinese will have about the same character count as the word count of its English translation (and vice versa).

It's very much a Chinese aesthetic as I understand it, quite independent of any Socialist Realism associations.\n\nBefore Chinese began to be written horizontally in imitation of Western scripts, if you found a single horizontal line of Chinese of only a few characters in length (to fit on a horizontally-oriented sign, for example), it would likely be read right to left. This is an analogue of setting a few letters vertically in Latin\n\nL  \nI  \nK  \nE\n\nS  \nO\n\nto fit a vertical space.\n\nBut yes, when you start to have actual running text in Chinese set horizontally, it's always written left to right.\n\n"

Headlines were a challenge as they seemed to run any way but bottom-to-top, and the text often used a dense argot. For Chinese, modern or ancient, context is crucial.\n\nThe modernist aspect of the \"gothic\" type is part of political sub-text, reinforced by the (smaller) sanserif translation. But there's whole lot more to China. Mao's calligraphy used to appear frequently, notably in the phrase 为人民服务 （\"serve the people\") plastered everywhere in the late 70s, when the effects of the Cultural Revolution were still strongly felt. Many of the simplified characters -- three of the five just quoted -- are in fact traditional short-hand forms widely used in hand-writing, a lot of the reason simplified chars. can seem garish in print. Computers now make it vastly easier to type Chinese, but the resolution of small screens -- I think the Chinese passed a billion text messages a day -- means traditional forms blob over.\n\n"
