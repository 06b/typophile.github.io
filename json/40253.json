So, I'm wondering if you know any examples of a ligature combining the two letters.  \nObviously, there is no need for a ligature to spell out the word, but I'm playing with it to achieve a decorative look.\n\n",

They're mostly in Latin American typefaces, as Spanish considers Ch to be one letter, but Porchez incorporated one into [Costa PTF](http://web.archive.org/web/20141026060057/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/CostaPTF) (you can see it in the sample on the page). You can see one in [Chaco](http://web.archive.org/web/20141026060057/http:/www.tipo.net.ar/pdf/chaco_v1.0.pdf), and a really fascinating capital CH lig in [Lineare Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20141026060057/http:/www.tipo.net.ar/pdf/Lineare_Serif_v1.0.pdf).

When I was a kid, back in the early 70s, there were a few two-letter combinations that had the same status as single letters -- in Spanish. **Ch** was one of them. **Ll** was another. In Spanish dictionaries, words beginning with \"Ch\" (\"charco\") or \"Ll\" (\"lluvia\") had their own section following \"C\" and \"L,\" respectively... But in the late 90s, or maybe in 2000, the Real Academia Española demoted these double-letter characters, and they no longer enjoy the same status as the rest of the letters of the alphabet.\n\nSpanish link: [http://www.elcastellano.org/consultas.php?Tag=alfabeto](http://web.archive.org/web/20141026060057/http:/www.elcastellano.org/consultas.php?Tag=alfabeto \"http://www.elcastellano.org/consultas.php?Tag=alfabeto\")\n\n"

That isn't to say it shouldn't be done or can't be done or that I've not seen it and loved it. I'm just saying that it is something to do with caution and attention.

Think also about the heavy serif you sometimes see hanging on a Cap C. It's often there for a good reason - and seeing that reason may translate into a better ligation.\n\nBut to echo Tiff further get the relationships of the letters right. Look at the white spaces. Look at what reads easily and feels natural vs what feel bullied into shape.\n\n"
