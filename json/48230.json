Your next best bet is to look at Handwritten fonts in the free Dafont.com collection, or skim through Part 11 of my Script Font ID Guide.\n\nOur usual advice is find something similar and use that, because this might be a one-off custom font done with someone’s own printing. You can make fonts like this for almost nothing.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
