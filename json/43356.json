Or know anyone in the area?\n\nI’m also going to reach out to the RISD community, but thought I would start here.\n\nThanks!\n\nJeremy\n\n [‹ Hardys: a new custom typeface.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007165216/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44037 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Very low hyphens in a monument ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007165216/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44562 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

On nearby Matthewson Street is the best used bookstore in the state, Cellar Stories, which also has a decent art/graphic design area (IMHO).\n\nFeel free to contact me at [jshallri@cox.net](mailto:jshallri@cox.net) if you like.\n\nCheers,  \nJohnH the Fontaholic\n\n"
