  "content": "Hello all. I am a cartographer (well, cartography grad student) with a keen interest in typography and type design. I was wondering if you knew of typefaces designed specifically for cartography, or at least with an eye to cartographic usage. I know only of [Cisalpin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172306/http:/www.linotype.com/2276/cisalpin.html?PHPSESSID=1298682fc3cee7d2c05788eaa248e93c#bild03) by Felix Arnold. A cool face, but without enough weights/varieties. Many of my fellow map-makers rely heavily on Garamond, Helvetica, Frutiger, Meridien, Sabon, Gill Sans, Univers, and Stone for labeling and annotation. These are great faces and surely sufficient for most map designs – just wondering if any cartography-specific faces are out there. I look forward to continuing my typographic education here on Typophile!\n\n",

Furthermore it has a few more weights than Cisalpin including Smallcaps also the weights differ noticeable from each other.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/parable/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172306/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/parable/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/parable/\")\n\n"

As Fedra is so incredibly well-done, comes in four weights and three widths, and can be serif, sans, small cap, and italic, it might be ideally flexible for cartography.\n\nWhile they're not necessarily made for maps, both [Incognito](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172306/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000074#specimen) and [Zanzibar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172306/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=FOT0000069#specimen) (by Gabor Kothay) come from the spirit of antique, exotic maps. Incognito is especially cartographic, taking its ornaments and swashes from a book of maps. I'm desperately in love with both of them.\n\n"

Not-upright text has to instantly visibly different, hence the sharp incline. Reverse inclines allow you to add a third dimension. I suspect that this is ok on maps because the normal, text-based legibility rules we are accustomed to in books do not apply. Perhaps Zachary could say something about this?\n\nA new typeface that also has some elements for cartography is [Carl Crossgrove](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172306/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Carl%20Crossgrove)'s Beorcana – [http://beorcana.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123172306/http:/beorcana.com/ \"http://beorcana.com/\")\n\n"
