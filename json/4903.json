[Renault](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143613/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/renault/) is also similar. I suspect they were custom designed for the ratings board when they were introduced in the late 1960s. [This poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143613/http:/www.filmratings.com/images/poster5.jpg), which shows all of them together, seems to support this. The ratings that were added later--NC-17 and the 13 in PG-13--don't match the style. In the early years of the system, there was also X, and, for a short time, M and GP.\n\n",

Superficially it looks like Alternate Gothic or Trade Gothic Bold, but the Q and R clearly don't match those. The only face I know that combines that kind of Q with that kind of R is Folio, but I can't seem to find a weight of Folio that matches that sample.\n\n"
