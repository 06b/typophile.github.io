We have families, bills, health insurance, etc. Most of our collections are developed over a period of 18 to 24 months, so we have a huge investment in time and effort in each typeface and each piece of artwork.

And this would wear out, if not from use over a few years, then through obsolence when the machines were updated every four or five years.

It may be possible for reputable independent foundries to develop high volume, low price marketing models, as the industry progresses. After all, as a retail phenomenon, the indie font business only really got started in around 1999, with e-commerce, and is still gathering steam. Note the low price of some impressively stacked Opentype fonts in the Myfonts best-sellers; a lot of value there.\n\n_copyright monopoly_\n\nThat doesn't have much to do with it (see above).  \nHowever, copyright protection is probably a bit too long. William St Clair found that when it was 12-24 years (for literary works), that produced the most dynamic cultural effects (in his book _The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period_).\n\nWith a controlled market and long copyright protection, St Clair found a situation where the dominant businesses produced new material at high prices, allowing them to milk their legacy assets, in various price brackets geared to different levels of purchaser, for long periods of time. I'm not quite sure how that compares with fonts. It's hard to compare intellectual property for physical and digital products, and I haven't finished his book yet, let alone tried to figure out how it fully relates to fonts.\n\n"

If $30 (or the $255 you'll have to pay to actually get Coop Flaired) is too much for you to pay- that's fine. There are alternatives of similar stylization that might interest you.\n\nBrowse this foundrys' listings  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/btn/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090437/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/btn/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/btn/\")\n\nSpecifically:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/grilled-cheese-btn/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090437/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/grilled-cheese-btn/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/grilled-cheese-btn/\")\n\nand\n\nThe bold weight of this font is very close to Coop Flaired  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/hawaiian-aloha-btn/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090437/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/hawaiian-aloha-btn/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/hawaiian-aloha-btn/\")\n\nor\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/roller-world-btn/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141122090437/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/roller-world-btn/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/btn/roller-world-btn/\")\n\nYes these fonts are for-pay, but 12.99 surely beats the 200 plus you have to put out. As for me I would not even spend 2 cents on Coop- its the ugliest thing in the world. That's me. But House Industries- the foundry- makes a quality product. This means that the metrics (letter spacing), glyph design, hinting (how well it looks on screen) is virtually perfect. And that' where the higher price come from.\n\nThat's not to say all quality fonts are well priced- Device Fonts (cute but pricey) , Gary Munch's Really, and everything by Red Rooster is stupidly priced!\n\nBut anyway- I hope I have helped you. And don't listen to the goons in this thread. Typophile can be a great resource- use it to your advantage.\n\nAll my best to you,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"

I think it is far better that the person is making an effort to rightfully license a font that they can afford rather than trolling with the pirates looking for a copy of Coop to use without proper licensing.\n\nAt the end of the day it is what is done with the font that matters not the original cost (or quality) of the font.\n\nLet's keep it above board and not go around insulting anyone.\n\n"

I used an exaggerated number for effect, the point being that with the digital age, there are now a LOT of cooks in the kitchen, and while we many of us deserve to be paid like professionals, we cannot demand it, or whine about it when it doesn't happen. Which is why I work for peanuts within my small rural community (population 4,335), and often give my services away to folks that cannot afford to pay for anything. Please, all, understand that I personally appreciate all of your efforts in making this a more graphically beautiful world.\n\n"

I love you all\n\nJust because you care\n\nthere's a hand-full of you whose comments brought our office to loud Hurrahs (as I read aloud this article in particular)\n\nI'd like to add my own comments on this subject:\n\n1) there was a time when my pay-rate was such that it was worth it to my boss to pay for the 10+ hours of font fixing required with free (usually un-tested) fonts. Incidentally I was recently flattered when I was presented with a company credit card specifically for font buying (whooda thunk it) ... I don't say this to brag (much) only to explain that as far as business models go it matters what's worth more, time or money. At this point in our firm's history, so-called \"luxury high-priced\" fonts are a money now VS money later decision ...\n\n2) the sad truth of the matter is that for every one of _US_ there are forty or so for whom there exists less than a dozen fonts (Arial and TimesNR being the MVP's)and all the others are considered artsy fluff suitable for kindergarten teachers who want to gussy up their classroom. I get depressed just thinking about it.\n\n3)No one will care as much about a font as it's creator (save in certain cases where there's some idol worship involved [helvetica]), but this won't stop people from pouring their hearts into great design even at the risk of having their work summed up as \"such a simple thing\". (personally, going back to the \"IKEA\" model, if I were to have some fantastic, useful, mass-marketed-high-design artifact that I designed referred to as \"such a simple thing\" I believe it would be a point of great pride ... but that's neither here nor there)\n\nthat is all ... thank you for bearing with my verbosity\n\n-Pablo\n\n"

This is especially true for fonts that have heavily been used in the mainstream.\n\nTake Coop Flaired for instance- it's the Hannah Montana logo font. So now you got hundreds of little girls trying to make Hannah Montana banners and fan art and they want the font. At $225 for they Coop briefcase, how many have you sold to them? 0.\n\n"
