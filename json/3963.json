  "content": "Hi   \nThis is a real annoying one, I shall apologise in advance; Im after the font, or something similiar, thats generally used in 50's (I think) American postcards which read 'welcome to...' then the name of the state or city, which in turn, has images within the typeface.   \n   \nUnfortunately I cannot find an example anywhere, can anyone put me out of my misery by assisting with both example and ID?   \n   \nThanks   \nR\n\n",
