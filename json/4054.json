      "content": "If I had a great name such as you have I would not opt for a phony business name, especially for illustrations and design. You want to be taken seriously and there's nothing more convincing than having your God-given name identify you and your work. Furthermore, you don't need a logo that could paint you in a corner some day. Some really impeccable typography will do it so much better for you. For a test, set Adam Stevenson in a number of ITC faces you have on your computer and experiment with escapement between characters to make it as readable as you can get it, and then ask anybody which version they prefer, the simple typographic solution or the logo you posted above.\n\n"
