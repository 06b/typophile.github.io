      "content": "I don't know whether anyone has explored the site. Forgive me if this is common knowledge---I found on Google that there is another old mill, Gomez House, that is located on the same creek on which Deepdene was located. Dard Hunter lived at Gomez House from 1912 until sometime around 1919 or 1920. The house is now owned and operated by a non-profit foundation. I'm wondering whether the folks at the Gomez House know anything. Their website is [http://gomez.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108162651/http:/gomez.org/ \"http://gomez.org/\").\n\n"

      "content": "Marie\n\nThanks for the tip. I'll ask around.\n\nThere is already quite a good number of pieces of Goudy's work that had in the first weeks after the fire geen rescued by FWG's opthamologist. The man was also a hobby printer and was given permission by Goudy to go thrugh the burned-out building to collect whatever he wished from the ashes. He found a number of the cardboard working patterns and some sketches etc, which were scorched, but mostly intact. This collection he later willed to the University of Washington Special Collections. I looked through the work a number of years ago, and was thrilled to see what fine things had been saved.\n\nThanks again\n\nJim\n\n"
