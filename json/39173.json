  "content": "Hi I am working on an Organic Wine label.\n\nI am looking for a font that is clean, understated and contemporary. I want a font that looks soooo good with out screaming look at me. A font that a designer might say “I want to know what that font is. A font the average consumer won’t see anything unique with but they will sense quality. A font for an organic wine consumer who shaves her legs (target market).\n\nAm I asking to much? I thought I’d toss it out there.\n\n",

I did not see the light available that was mentioned in the PDF, perhaps that is only available as part of the family package?\n\nJupiter boy great script.

The only thing that worked on her concept was her type treatment, which was with Optima for the brand name, so they might ask me to incorporate that into the layout. Comparing Optima to your font I see the softness and more organic nature of you font is a better fit for the product. I am hoping they prefer it.\n\nCan you recommend any other fonts that would complement this font?\n\n"
