Bastard was given away as a free font toward the end of 2001 (I have a copy of the User License). If you want to use it commercially, I'd contact them.\n\nIf you simply like the squared, thick n' thin style of Bastard, it seems to have been heavily influenced by [Eden Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150107185459/http:/old.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/eden-pro/).\n\n"
