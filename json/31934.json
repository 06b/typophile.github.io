Digi-offset capabilities as well would be terrific, but I’m really looking for a solid letterpress shop. Well, in my dream world I’d be seeking a letterpress to purchase for my own use, but for now a printshop will have to do.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nerin  \npaperina inc.\n\n",

Someone on the faculties of those schools must be able to answer this one.\n\nAlso, IIRC The Paper Source does all of its letterpress printing in Chicago, and does things like stationary and invitations.\n\n"
