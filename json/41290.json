I think is time to look at the problem and figure out what to do to solve it.  \nI try to edit a forum post in order to attach a pdf file.  \nI do the “Edit” and open the “File attachments”.  \n“Attach new file” and “Attach”. The file is show in the list and selected in “List”.  \nDo the “Submit” and the file disapear and dont show on the post!  \nThis problem is in both Firefox and IE...  \nI have just installed the “last” flash player in case someone tries the “download the last version of....and try again!”\n\nWhy is the upload of a simple file directly connected with flash? Is this really necessary? Wich software is used for this forum?Opensource or developed especially for this purpose (typophile I mean...)?\n\nAntónio Fonseca\n\n [‹ Resources for moods/messages in typefaces?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905212045/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41279 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Flesh Font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905212045/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41284 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
