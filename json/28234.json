  "content": "I have some basic open type (SC, Figs, etc) that work fine within FontLab. It compiles without error. It previews etc. When I go to generate an .OTF, it gives the following error:\n\nERROR: There was a problem while compiling OpenType font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition for errors\n\nCan anyone point me in a direction for this kind of error? How can I debug if the FL compiler isn’t showing errors? I know it’s hard without posting the font, but any ideas would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nRandy\n\n [‹ Safari font problem](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705151751/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28147 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Problem with Apple Font Tools ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705151751/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28238 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think there were multiple problems :-) The main culprit I think were extra (nonsense) small cap accents that were generated by yours truely causing class issues. I also updated the kern feature for good measure (though I think I had done this before).\n\nDavid: couldn’t find the fontlab.fea file from the thread. Turns out that wasn’t the problem though. Thanks for the idea.\n\nCheers,  \nRandy\n\n"
