  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI've inherited a company logo that I feel needs to be updated. It's a software company, and they've had this logo for ten years. I realize there is some equity built into this brand by now, so I don't think I want to make a drastic change, but I do want to evolve it a little:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131131913im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-ni_4742.png)\n\nI think I may need to adjust the typeface. I've personally heard a few reactions from people when encountering our brand along the lines of \"hey - is that the Star Trek font?\"\n\nIt's actually Galaxy, which is not the Star Trek font, but definitely has a distinct sci-fi feel to it.\n\nI'm looking for font suggestions. Something that keeps some of the characteristics of Galaxy, but moves away from sci-fi and more towards a corporate feel. For example, the lowercase t in [Aller](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131131913/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Aller) is similar to the t in Galaxy.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions?\n\nthanks.\n\n",

      "content": "It actually _is_ kind of a Star Trek font. The posters/cover of the Star Trek movies throughout the '80s used a font that is strinkingly similar. [Look at this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131131913/http:/images.themoviedb.org/posters/5373/star_trek3.jpg) Anyway, I don't think you can blame people for making the connection.\n\nThat said, I would be interested to see an updating of this with Aller or some other corporate face like Officina. Another interesting direction might be something like [Shàngó](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131131913/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango-gothic/). It doesn't have a lowercase, but those serifs are interesting. Galaxy has serifs but it also has the sci-fi baggage, so if you want to make a less drastic change of face I would try out something with distinct serifs.\n\n"
