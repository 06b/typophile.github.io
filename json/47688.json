I simply want to add \"Mom\", Grandma, Dad, etc. to them, but I can't seem to get the right font. Any help is greatly appreciated!

Who designed the original logo?\n\nOn a side note, if you want to simply add something, you might go for contrast and use a dynamic, solid script face at the bottom of the logo. Just a suggestion.\n\n"
