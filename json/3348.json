  "content": "Ok guys, the first thing that i tought when i saw the posts of the tee contest is ...   \n   \nMaybe we need a contest of type design, here in Typophile, why not?   \n   \nThe designs in the critique section are in a highest level, enough to take people like Pyrus on the prizes (Fontlab, Bitfonter..), & Myfonts with a nice contract..   \n   \nI Wanna win, dont you ;) ?   \n   \nMiguel H.\n\n",

The most creative future typographers are outhere, the prizes are an important think, for me is not easy to imagine a contest who shows the typophile spirit, there are many experimental fonts under construction here, and many categories, the chance to win is too atractive to any typophiler if ...happens !\n\n"
