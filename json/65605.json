What surprised me, amid an hour and a half of obsessively realised detail, was that the lettering engraved on Scrooge’s gravestone appeared to be ‘set’ in Goudy. That face is used in the publicity material, so they may have been using up something they had lying around already, but could there be an alternative interpretation? Does Scrooge, b. 1786, in fact understand that the Spirit of Typefaces Yet to Come is showing him that he will not die before 1915 at least, and more likely not until the other end of the 20th century when gravestone production can make use of fonts rather than chisels?\n\n",
