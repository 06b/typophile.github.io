I have a notion, though, that it won't be the last time Adobe will try to underminde Macromedia here.. it must irk them to no end that in THIS design area, another company holds a semi-monopol.   \n   \nCorel, as far as I know, has a tool, but that is rather miserable, from what I hear.   \n   \nFreehand can do very simple swfs, but these are only okay for simple animations (which is what some illustrators use it for, as the layer-technique s very similar to Photoshop and traditional animatoion, so they're used to it... also the editing tools are better than in Flash).   \n   \nAnd finally, there is Swish, which started as a simple text-animationtool but has pretty much evolved and nowadays can do some stuff. It's nowhere near as powerful as Flash is, especially when it comes to scripting (which is the key to making solid Flash-websites, without Action Script you don't get anywhere). However, I really like SwishMax as a simple presentation tool or for online banners and all that, as the interface is simpler and the everyday stuff, like fades and so on), is quicker done. It's not a professional tool, at only 99 $ it doesn't have to be, but simpler stuff is quickly done here and the new version actually offers pretty solid typography, alas nowhere near the real typo capabilities of flash (which still are lightyears behind Photoshop or InDesign or even Freehand). you can download a demo at [www.swishzone.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018084710/http:/www.swishzone.com/)\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the suggestions. I did look into Adobe's LiveMotion, but since they discontinued it, I'd rather not trot down that path.   \n   \nThere are several reasons I've grown to dislike Flash (in my limited time using it). One \"for instance\" is it's inability to properly display imported (bitmap) images. I cannot find a way to make it NOT compress them. If I have a 1px white line on a black background, imported into Flash, I want that 1px white line to look like a 1px white line. Flash always seems to want to compress it and make it look antialiased.   \n   \nThat is, perhaps, a clumsy example, since I could just make a line in Flash itself... but what if I don't want to?   \n   \nAnother reason I'd like to find an alternative, is because I've grown used to Adobe AfterEffect's interpolations techniques (since I have a background in video). The way Flash \"tweens\" between keyframes is really clunky. Maybe I just don't know enough, but I've spent hours in this program trying to learn it... you'd think I'da figured it out by now.   \n   \nAnyway... I appreciate the suggestions. I'll have a look. (I have a feeling I'll be waiting for another program to be introduced.)\n\n"

Use the propertiesarea to manually set the bitmap position to a non decimal number. Also make sure that the numbers starts from top-left and not the center. You control that with the square with nine subsquares inside.   \n   \nWell anyway flash has a really really steep learningcurve. I have worked with it since version 2 and there are still things that I learn (if you except the scripting wich I never will learn good enough).   \n   \n/fredde\n\n"
