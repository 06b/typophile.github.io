Lineto's Gravur Condensed comes close as well.\n\nIncidentally the monospace is also a Lineto creation called [Autoscape](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011232016/http:/lineto.com/1.0/cont_des_37.html). I had seen it in use in a degree project, and I managed to track down the guy, who then passed on the name to me. There is an obvious connection to ProFont like you mentioned.\n\n"
