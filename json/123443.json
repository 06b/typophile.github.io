  "content": "Hi all,\n\nhere's a font I found while browsing Spotify. It's a very simple font, but what I like about it is that it's tall, but not too tall.  \nI'm looking for any font similar to this because I wanna use it in one of my projects, and I would prefer it to be free.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317200212im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tO7DkVR_5459.png)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Alternate Gothic \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [DPape](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317200212/http:/typophile.com/user/3945 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
