  "content": "Here is an interesting find.  \nI was leafing through an old Russian font book from 1930, and came across a peculiar attempt at merging [cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803141546/http:/typophile.com/wiki/cyrillic) with a [blackletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803141546/http:/typophile.com/wiki/blackletter) aesthetic. I don't think the idea ever really caught on, as I can't remember any examples prior to the 90's (and no successful ones since)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803141546im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cyrgoth_5450.png)\n\nStill, I wonder if this might be useful to someone attempting one.\n\n",

      "content": "Before the revolution of 1917 many Russian foundries carried both Latin and Cyrillic blackletter. Obviously, there was a demand for those types. I remember contributing a couple of samples to the [exhibit](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803141546/http:/www.cooper.edu/art/lubalin/bletter.html) Peter Bain and Paul Shaw put together in 1997. The fashion for blackletter in Russia started in the first third of the 19th century. Interestingly, the title page (or was that the cover?) of the first edition of Gogol’s _Dead Souls_—designed by Gogol himself—featured blackletter (the words _Н. Гоголя_):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803141546im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1842_Dead_Souls_4530.jpg)\n\nBlackletter was shown in many Russian lettering manuals as late as in the 1920s and 1930s (what Ivan has found is not a type specimen but a lettering guide). Obviously, the demand for Cyrillic blackletter is still there. There are some fonts available for downloading on-line, all of them of questionable quality. Some attempts at Cyrillic blackletter, hand-drawn or hand-written, can be found in the books of Villu Toots.\n\n"
