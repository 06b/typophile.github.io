  "content": "The companion thread to [Glyphs that Gall](http://web.archive.org/web/20120927043434/http:/typophile.com/node/30598), as proposed by Matthew Desmond. I have to say, I can't think of any letter shapes that I'm particularly enchanted by, perhaps because I love letters that blend with the rest in the font. Perhaps I should create a third thread about great fonts in general, but surely that topic's been exhausted in other threads. Can anyone link to them?\n\nAnyway, for this topic, pattyfab suggested the ampersand of Caslon Italic. Quite fab indeed, Patty.\n\n",

I was the only shop in New York City to have Catull. I loved that font. One of the publishing houses (I think it was Carol Publishing or Pinnacle or maybe even Ballantine) had an author who was producing romance books every few months. (Not quite a Barbara Cartland, but direct competition.) I convinced the art director to use Catull for the covers. A few years later (and many art directors later) I received a call asking what the face was -- and how come Cardinal, Photoletter, Haber, etc. didn't have it... it was so nice having an \"exclusive.\"\n\nAnd WTF must have one of Adobe's original fonts. There were so many problems with their releases. I laugh how folks think \"professional\" fonts are so great -- even though I own Adobe fonts -- I keep remembering when I first bought the library in the late 1980s. They told me I could sell the whole library when I was done with it. Nice of them... (I don't know if you remember this, they also gave me all the printer fonts on an 80mg hard disk that fit my Compugraphic imagesetter... making it just a little bit faster at the time.)\n\n"
