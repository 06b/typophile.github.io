Perhaps the world's first commercially-viable typesetting machine, Mergenthaler's invention could cast a line of type on-the-fly, greatly speeding up the process of metal typesetting. Newspapers around the world took advantage of this immediately. Newsppapers would always be the biggest users of Linotype Machines.\n\nThe Linotype Machine sparked a revolution in typesetting. Soon, competitor machines appeared on the market, like the [Monotype Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021191744/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Monotype%20Machine). Linotype Machines were used well into the 60s and 70s. From the late 1950s onward, however, Linotype had begun to produced photo-typesetting equipment, and later would go onto build digital machines. The typefaces that were designed for these various machines would later be sold as [PostScript](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021191744/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PostScript) (and other format) fonts by a company called [Linotype Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021191744/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype%20Library) (since 2005 simply \"Linotype GmbH\").\n\nThe Linotype Machine was in a large part technically possible only because of [Linn Boyd Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021191744/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linn%20Boyd%20Benton)'s pantographic punchcutter.\n\nA two-part film showing in great detail how the Linotype machine works is available online at the Prelinger Archives at [archive.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021191744/http:/www.archive.org/).
