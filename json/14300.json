Clearview is an enormous improvement over the original, engineered faces, but I have an idea that there is more yet to be discovered about which typefaces are most clear, useful, quickly read, etc. in wayfinding situations.

      "content": "David Kindersley was convinced that upper case serif was easier to read on a sign than upper and lower case sans serif. Have a look at this article by Kindersley:\n\n[http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/wartoworboys/4.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106035446/http:/www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/wartoworboys/4.shtml \"http://www.cbrd.co.uk/histories/wartoworboys/4.shtml\")\n\nThe impression I get from Kindersley is that Transport, the sans serif u&lc font, was chosen because it was trendy at the time to use \"Swiss-looking\" sans serifs (hence Transport is an iteration of Akzidenz Gtotesk with occasional alterations to aid legibility) and not because of any inherent legibility qualities in the font itself. However, if you'd just had your font rejected by people who didn't really understand your craft and someone else's work was going to appear on the signs across the nation, you might want to push your point a bit. I guess as an apprentice to Eric Gill, and a lover of stone cutting, he probably thought that a 'grotesque' solution was just that.\n\nFor reference, the Transport fonts (Kinneir/Calvert) used in the United Kingdom can be found here:  \n [http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft\\_control/documents/contentserve...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106035446/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_control/documents/contentservertemplate/dft_index.hcst?n=9430&l=3 \"http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft\\_control/documents/contentservertemplate/dft\\_index.hcst?n=9430&l=3\")\n\nAs far as legibility testing itself is concerned, it can ultimately only solve the problem of finding which of two _existing_ fonts is more legible. It doesn't necessarily point you in the right direction for the optimum. So font _A_ may be more legible than font _B_, but font _C_ (yet to be designed) may _look_ completely different from _A_ and _B_ but perform much better under controlled testing conditions. Unfortunately testing didn't really help your endeavour to devise font _C_. I assume you want to design the optimum font rather than simply establish which is the best existing font. Testing may not help.\n\n"

Otherwise, given responsible typographic handling (as well as an awareness of environmental \"wear and tear\"), most typefaces may be used for signage.\n\n(However, train station names could be done in really long signs with hyperextended fonts, so you can read them when you're whizzing through at high speed. I've never seen this, but surely somewhere in the world has done it?)\n\nOtherwise, I believe it's more important to get some brand differentiation going with your signage. Like, this is a unique place, not just another mall/town full of franchises. And for wayfinding, unless it's on a university campus, signage is going to be competing for eyespace with commercial signage, so why not use a different kind of type to what appears there? This is the same principle that periodical art directors often use, so that their editorial pages don't look like ads.\n\nOne of the pleasures of relocating to Norwich has been the street signs here, which are cast iron, in a Victorian sans serif.\n\n"

Yes, Science, sorry. However, how this affects reading I don't know for sure. But I have a hunch we're not attuned to reading moving things well; I suspect we switch between saccading and tracking, not getting good info to \"process\".\n\nBTW, I'm talking about lateral movement here: driving directly towards a highway sign is saccade-based, although I suspect as parallax increases reading starts breaking down.

Other factors come into play in a train station, or inside a train.\n\nI heard from a friend who visited Japan that they've used those silly blinking LED sticks to good effect in the subway: When the train goes by, the images they generate are stretched out and revealed, not by the viewer's waggling head, but by the speed of the train. So riders get pictures flashed at them.

Finally the rest of the characters in the word are needed if the other two criteria have not proved decisive.

It is an important distinction to make because, on a sign, you are not really concerned with the \"piecing together\" part of the reading process and far more concerned with making the individual words (and occasionally phrases) recognisable to the user.\n\nThe theory that upper and lower case is more helpful is based on the assumption that words are easier to recognise by their shape than by their constituent characters.

And like I was musing above, I doubt we can read properly when parallax increases and speed (forward movement) causes notable lateral movement.\n\nOn the other hand, I think speed **is** a factor to the extent that it affects how long you have to decide if the sign says what you think, right? This is why people often slow down to read a sign... sometimes causing an accident.\n\nhhp\n\n"

In this case, speed of approach does not affect time taken to decipher anywhere near as much as the actual design of the characters on the sign, which is why ClearviewHwy and Transport are so good. You can \"read\" (recognise/scan/whatever...) them from much further away than their predecessors, so you have more time to make your decision.\n\nIn theory, the further away a sign is the less your speed affects the reading process (i.e. if you have a very big sign on the horizon, it's going to be a lot easier to read than a little sign nearby that is moving quickly realtive to your car where your mind has to cope with the speed as well as the deciphering.\n\nSo, if you have to slow down to read a sign, there are several possibilities. Either:  \n- you're not really concentrating  \n- you're breaking the law  \n- the sign was positioned badly  \n- the sign was designed badly (and maybe the typeface used was badly designed)\n\nIn the case of UK roadsigns which are very clear and usually very well positioned, you were probably caning it or napping.\n\n"
