  "content": "Hi guys, I am currently working on a typography project and desperately seeking inspiration. This quote by the great Milton Glaser 'Computers are to design as microwaves are to cooking' is my starting point and I am to create a typeface to enhance the semantic meaning of the words and create emotion. I am to consider the shape and form of each letterform as well as what materials to use to express my chosen quote. The brief encourages to use either/or all hand drawn, hand made, illustrated, painted, scratched, sewn, constructed, three dimensional type. We may combine the type with images but allow the letterforms to focus on the design. Overall broaden the sense of meaning of the words.\n\nSo research has taken me to obvious ideas and food for thought so far, like - radiation as the typeface / use of computer and microwave food related typefaces and symbols / microwave parts and components / Milton Glaser typefaces like stencil / microwave food packaging / circuit boards and computer parts / using the computer desktop or/and icons / using blur-motion to create speed / even microwaving computers and parts!....\n\nI haven't hit the nail on the head yet but would very much welcome any input any one might have on this topic?!\n\n",

Seems microwave cooking is a sort of hands-off, no mess, no fuss way of cooking--sort of like the difference between kneading dough by hand and using an electric mixer instead. I don't think that the difference is as extreme between pencil and paper vs. computer, but there is still a tactile difference.  \nThe computer is a tool, but it's a different kind of tool, there seems more distance between the hand and the letterform.\n\n"

Fonts should be designed by punch-cutting!\n\nThat battle, though, I think, has been lost. The general public, whatever one might think of its standards of taste, is much too used to the slickness of today's typefaces to accept the results of punch-cutting by hand. They will accept that Aldus' Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii was an improvement on what came before, but even while acknowledging its beauty, they will still resolutely prefer, say, Times Roman for normal use.\n\nThat being said, though, it does seem to me that computer type design is in its infancy. I would prefer to draw letters on paper, and then measure them, and locate reference points in the letters I create by number, at least in some cases, than try to design a font by drawing directly on the computer screen with a mouse. And the fact that all the major outline font standards restrict one to using only spline curves rather than (at least for classic Roman fonts) being able to explicitly demand a conic section (never mind Melior, based on Piet Hein's superellipse) is a problem as well.\n\n"
