Just caught the light and shadows at the right time, I guess.\n\nI don't have any full-resolution shots online. My photos on my site are about this size. This one would be too big at full-resolution, anyway. I'm going to print it on canvas at 36\"x24\". I hope it will be a cool abstract.\n\nThanks again.\n\n"
