  "content": "A Japanese designer has released a font, called ‘ [Readymade](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110509/http:/www.flopdesign.com/font3/readymade.html)’.  \nIt is similar to [Giorgio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110509/http:/www.christianschwartz.com/giorgio.shtml) by [Christian Schwartz](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110509/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christian%20Schwartz).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Readymade_4110.jpg)\n  \nOf course, the x-height of Readymade is shorter than the one of Giorgio, and the characters are not the very same as characters of Giorgio. But Readymade seems to be inspired by Giorgio and Corvinus.\n\nThe designer is selling Readymade for commercial use, but it is downloadable freely only in this November for personal use.\n\n",

Don't laugh too hard please.\n\nOnly many years later I learned that the original type was called Corvinus Versailles and it was designed by Dennis Ortiz Lopez.\n\nMy congratulations to both Christian and Flop Design for their more professional work.\n\n"

I do not mean this ethically, of course, (there is plenty of it), I am just talking in terms of design.\n\n@Matteo: Ciao Matteo, come stai? :=)  \nMatteo has been one of the first (and few) designers to use my Ottomat in our native Italy.  \nOn a side note, his cover for the essay \"Impossibilities\" by John D. Barrow shows one of the most conscious and accomplished examples of Barry Deck's \"post-modern\" typeface Template Gothic in use.\n\n"
