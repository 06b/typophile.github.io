      "content": "Is that a standing corporation? As in stationary? It should be <cite>stationery</cite>, as in:  \nMiddle English staciouner, a bookseller, from Medieval Latin statinrius, shopkeeper (as against a peddler), probably from Latin stati, statin-, place of business. ( [http://www.bartleby.com/61/92/S0719200.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060207023300/http:/www.bartleby.com/61/92/S0719200.html))\n\nA frequent mistake, almost as frequent as spelling <cite>seperate</cite>, rather than <cite>separate</cite>. Latin <cite>separare</cite>, to divide (no source, just my memory).\n\nSometimes it is easier to look in from the outside. My native language is German.\n\n"
