I have been working with a partner doing architectural photography and this has expanded into a limited design company.   \n   \nI felt strongly that I needed to expand my type collection. I have the fonts that come with Photoshop CS and other versions and the Adobe Type Classic Collection and have been following your advice to shop around and buy fonts you like and I have bought a lot!   \n   \nBut I wonder if there are some basic, useful fonts you would find indispensible in your collections and also the fonts you like the most.   \n   \nI know I will have to buy some fonts specifically to meet a customer's needs. I will spend another $500-$1,000 (preferably the 500) at this time on my general type collection and want to make sure that what i have is representative of a quality selecion.   \n   \nI'm using Windows.   \n   \nThanks for reading this and for any help you can give me.   \n   \nSharon\n\n",

Includes Helvetica Neue and Bauer Bodoni.   \n [http://www.linotype.com/6-1790-6/linotypeessentials1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1790-6/linotypeessentials1.html)   \n   \nLinotype Essentials 2 is 465 Euro, and has slightly more less common families, like Sabon and Zapfino.   \n [http://www.linotype.com/6-1791-6/linotypeessentials2.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1791-6/linotypeessentials2.html)   \n   \nFresh Cream has Akira Kobayashi's Conrad, which is the best new typeface ever (imho), along with some other durable families. Gerard Unger's Praxis and Demos are here, too, which have recently been selected as the official typefaces of the German government. 365 Euro   \n [http://www.linotype.com/6-1912-6/linotypefreshcream.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1912-6/linotypefreshcream.html)   \n   \nFrutiger's Life has all of the typefaces designed by Adrian Frutiger that have as of yet been digitized. That includes Univers and Frutiger, of course� It is a steal at 240 Euro.   \n [http://www.linotype.com/6-1793-6/frutigerslife.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1793-6/frutigerslife.html)   \n   \nLast, and perhaps least, is the Gundrun & Hermann Zapf collection, which is like Frutiger's Life, but with the two Zapfs' life's work instead. Palatino and Optima, among others, are here. 400 Euro.   \n [http://www.linotype.com/6-1794-6/gudrunhermannzapfcollection.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1794-6/gudrunhermannzapfcollection.html)   \n   \nIn the interest of full disclosure, I'll say that I work for Linotype� but I'm just an intern. I've beought type from them, though, and can attest that everything that our new type director touches _really does_ turn to gold�!   \n   \nDan\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Jim,   \n   \nI bought a font from you when your website had just come online. Your service was wonderful and I have several more of your fonts on my list.   \n   \nDan,   \n   \nI wish I had asked this question earlier. I have some of these fonts, but these packages look good. I agree about Conrad.   \n   \nOur business is based in Nantucket and that name is used a lot in business names. I've tried to find some fonts that show the Nantucket name as well as indicate the history and heritage of the island. I'm considering MVB Chanson d�Amour, ALT and wonder what you think of it. I like Golden Book too.   \n   \nI also want some quirky, even funky fonts and have shopped Chank, Fontdiner and P22.   \n   \nThanks for the good advice. If you or anyone else has some more help, I would appreciate it.   \n   \nSharon\n\n"

Bitstream is in New England, too... and MyFonts... at least they're _headquartered_ in Cambridge.   \n   \nAfter having lived in Providence for four years, I really get a kick out of the Providence Type Foundry ( [http://www.provtype.com/index2.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.provtype.com/index2.html)), too; or at least its font names.   \n   \nUnfortuantely, I can't say that Linotype has anything distinctly \"New England.\" We do sell a lot of typefaces to New Englanders, though.   \n   \nYves, I think that **all** of Linotype's products are reasonalbly priced now (no, I'm not saying this just because I work in the _marketing_ department). I mean, the gold edition will still set you back 10 grand, but it is ENORMOUS.   \n   \nMost of the font collections are very nicely priced. The Take Type Collections [http://www.linotype.com/6-1785-6/taketype.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516051627/http:/www.linotype.com/6-1785-6/taketype.html)   \nare really broad, with a lot of one-off display faces, but they all have a few good text families (including the first appearance of Conrad, on Take Type 3!). Our new special packs sell five or six fonts apiece, at an average of 6 EUR a font, I think.
