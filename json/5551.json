Do you like it.? Why / Why not.? ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n_( Its a 'fun' display type.. Nothing too serious at all.. Its just something I wanted to do for quite some time now.. The original idea and scribbles were created more than two years ago.. Originally for a different font, named 'Play' and this may be the remixed version, then.. 'formlos PlayR'.. )_\n\n"

      "content": "Mr. David Hubner:   \nmy question is about the idea behind the fittings,   \nthe color spots where some strokes meet one another.   \nIt looks so uneven that I might think that it works better   \nprinted at 5 pt. Or then why you didn`t planned this pimple   \nfor all the letters? Now it is aesthetically unpleasant.   \n \\> Are you asking what its usable for? What do you think?   \nNo, but to answer you I think that it could denote certain   \nnew synthetic music styles or cosmetics for pimples :-)   \n(No offence, I am joking). If I like it?   \nI don`t because it is a pity that intending to design a light   \n& delicate typeface you ended up working on the black instead   \nthat on the white, or am I wrong? I mean: \"Write the story.   \nTake out all the good lines, and see if it still works.\"   \nBest,   \nAS\n\n"

I am also working on a few faces, intended for text use..   \nAnd maybe there will really be a ( more usable ) version of 'Play' / 'PlayR' in the near future..   \n_( As I am currently in the 'Think, Scribble & Design' process, this may still take some time.. )_   \n   \nAnd, I am pretty happy and excited about being able to release my type experiments and fonts under my own 'Cellar Type Foundry'.. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125223im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) _( Even if the 'exposure' and the audience may not be as big as being a 'featured' type designer, at other famous font foundries.. )_\n\n"
