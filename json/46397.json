Previous to working here, I had heard about Akzidenz Grotesk and am wondering what the differences/similarites are. Which do you prefer?\n\nAlso, I have paired URW Grotesk with Minion or Caslon (not URW Antiqua, I do not like that face). Is there a better option? Also are there display faces you might recommend paring with them? I want to have some opinions and options before purchasing more of the URW Grotesk family.\n\nThanks for your help!\n\njessi.long\n\n [‹ Typophile on iPhone](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203164437/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46399 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Letterpress Typeface Suggestions Needed ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203164437/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46368 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

That’s just me, and B. If the ID manuals suggest URW, yu might need to go with that.\n\nMinion and Caslon could both work with either, but you should pick one and stick with it.\n\nMinion is more clean and modern looking than Caslon, so that could factor in your decision.\n\n"
