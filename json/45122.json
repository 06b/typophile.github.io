These image come from Cicero & St. Augustine (pre 1465 & 1467) in reproduction ( hence the dots ) taken of the Book \"The Ashendene Press\" by Colin Franklin. This is a marvelous book in many many ways. Highly recommended.\n\nWhat is interesting about these images is that they show plenty of contextual alternates being used, and they are very very obvious. Just to get started have a look at the \"ra\" and \"ta\" and then look at an \"a\" in another context.\n\nThese special sorts stopped being used eventually and the standard a became the one used in the \"ra\" combination with the top pulled way back - a decidedly less good looking if more practical arrangement.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204093833im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Subiaco_5002.jpg)\n\n",
