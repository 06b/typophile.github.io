I have a bunch of logo ideas scribbled down but seeing as I joined this forum a few days ago, I thought maybe I would put it out there and see if anyone can give me some more ideas.

All of the extra crap in the current logo makes it look like the company behind the logo is run by people who were too stupid to let the people paid to design the logo actually design the logo.\n\nAs for typefaces, first you need to figure out what kind of feel you want this logo to have. Sit down with a thesaurus and start creating long lists of words and synonyms until you just can’t do it anymore, then put the whole project away for a day and then refine the list. Once you know what you want to evoke, sit down and start looking at fonts to find some that echo your sentiments. Test the word or words that will go into the logo in every font that fits. Pick the ones that work and look over them again. Keep refining. Then it’s time to start tweaking letters and such.\n\n"

I think it really makes the logo without it. What are your opinions on the 2 lines in the box? Or the type below the “steinbachonline”?\n\n"

Your kerning is off throughout the logo itself- the S is pulling away, and the space between the N and the B is off. The shape of the B is weird, as well. The mark you’ve thrown in there is too low-contrast (and looks like a low-rent version of the Fila logo).  \nIf I were you, I’d kill the mark, then vary the weight between “Steinbach” and “Online”. Make Steinbach heavier, as that’s what’s important.\n\n"

I tightened up the “s” as well as the spacing between the “n and b”. I realized that I was using a file with the “b” that I started editing. If you notice in the first logo, there were no stems on the “n, a, and b”. I added the stem back to the bottom of the “b” which I feel makes it fit in with the rest of the letters again.\n\nI’m having trouble picking out a clean looking serif font, so I was just wondering if anybody has some suggestions what might look clean and modern. The logo does remind me of the “fila” logo now that you mention it. If you have suggestions for the font of the text below, i’ll play with some different weights and upload a new file.\n\nThanks again!  \nChris\n\n"

To use a serif on a line that will often appear small should be avoided. Realize that this use will be even smaller on a business card, for example. Serifs will be lost at that size.\n\n"

Not mixing sans faces is usually a good policy because the similarities between sans faces can create a sort of dissonance in which the viewer can’t figure out why the words don’t seem to work together. But in a case like this, where there is strong contrast in size, form, and the contrast of case, there is no dissonance. In Myriad, the tagline, also feels much more subservient to the rest of the logo, whereas in Avant Garde the all caps seem to be screaming for attention.\n\nI think that you did a very good job with the logo mark—it can stand on its own in places where the wordmark is inappropriate. I would keep it on the right to really anchor things.\n\n"

Such as a Quadraat Sans Black (if such an animal existed). Or a punchy headline sans like Knockout Ultimate Welterweight. Whitney Condensed Black. And then possibly try Online in a light, maybe monoline script. Like a more flowing version of Handsome Pro Light.\n\nMaybe the script idea won’t work. But shoot for contrast that says “bang”\n\nWhatever you do, it should have some personality. This feels like you opened up a font, typed the letters and picked your colors.\n\n"
