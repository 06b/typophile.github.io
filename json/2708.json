I especially like lc \"g\", \"o\", \"r\".   \nsome of the shapes however do not seem to got together in same face. \"f\" is very heavy on top, \"s\" needs some work, although \"a\" and 's\" will properly work well together somehow they look different from the rest.   \nKeep up the good work..look forward to seeing refinements.\n\n"

      "content": "regarding the h and b ascenders, you might consider tapering the tops like the t. that would definitely lighten them, and i don't think it would be inconsistent. but it may make them appear \"pointy\" at small sizes. it may also contribute to an overall \"forward\" motion.   \n   \nyou might want to consider moving the tapering stroke of the a to the bottom, to lighten up that joint near the baseline, and let the upper portion of the bowl remain (optically) monoline.\n\n"
