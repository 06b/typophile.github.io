Looking for some opinions and maybe ideas related to this logo. It‘s about a very new firm, design firm, trying new stuff in graphic design. unusual approach of everything. Something like “we do it as we want not as you want”.\n\ncheers :)\n\n [‹ Logo for German Job Agency](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44307 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Eight Zero ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44042 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And when you know the usual things very well, It becomes really difficult to do something unusual.\n\nKeep playing with visuals, not with Photoshop.\n\n"

Since it looks as a biology lab logo to you i think i hit the target. The second thing i wanted to pursue was to illustrate accomplishment, movement (dynamism) and outcome. And as any designer i thought that something different wouldn‘t be that bad considering that this logo is going to be seen by ordinary people not graphic artists and critiques and so on.\n\nSome one has to admit that the logo fits the “design laboratory”, doesn‘t it? ;)\n\nCheers :)\n\n"

      "content": "“Biology lab” and “organic” are not compatible terms in my mind.\n\nA lab can mean sterile, static, clean, harsh, controlled; even in a biology lab the natural things studied are placed in beakers, dishes and containers. Organic means life, nature, leafy, messy, hairy, spiky - yet subtly and sublimely ordered. There are modern ways of capturing the essence of both concepts, but I don’t think you’ve successfully struck on either in this design.\n\nI’ll speak for myself as to the design’s “cheapness”: the use of the glow and glass effects is very Web 2.0, and the font choice is dull and not at all exciting.\n\nOverall, if you’re going to exploit a lab concept, then you need to communicate the sense of awe and discovery that entails scientific research, not the necessity of sleeping on a cot in the lab because you need to monitor your experiment at 3:30am. Your design is communicating more of the latter at this point. Actually, it’s communicating that your experiment has failed and the last three years of research is out the window and you will never get your PhD.\n\nThat is, of course, if you’re really going for lab, and not organic after all...\n\n—-  \nNick Hladek\n\n"

The smaller type size has two effects; 1) adds dynamism and visual stimulation, 2) creates a sense of refinement and tasteful design.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042526im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/marosi_outcome_3745.gif)\n\n“Output” is a bit obscure as to its implied meaning. Some potential customers will look at that word and wonder what’s meant by it, causing a sense of doubt in their minds.\n\nFor a business logo it’s important to be positive, leaving no room for doubt or indecision. Be optimistic and offer potential clients something they can relate to. The first question a business owner has on their mind when dealing with a design firm is, “What are you going to do for me? How will your design services improve my business and make me more money?”\n\nSo it helps to offer a benefit. The only suitable alternative word I came up with is “Outcome”. In other words, there’s something in it for the customer. An outcome. Some people may find that word inuendo-loaded tho, suggestive of sexual activity. It’s nice and compact as words go, but I recommend finding a better alternative word beginning with ’O’.\n\nReplacement fonts used are Futura regular and some other sans with a double story a. Like it matters. Anything will do as long it’s a reasonable match.\n\nMarosi, I recommend you take the objections people are making here to your use of glow and three dimensional effects with a grain of salt. They’re being needlessly conservative and nitpicky for no good reason other than their personal prejudice against anything outside of dead flat graphic design. I mean really, guys. It’s a matter of highbrow taste and the traditional hard-on most graphic designers seem to have for flat color treatments. It makes me laugh because that attitude is so snooty and elitist, and out of touch with reality. I wave my private parts in their general direction.\n\nI think your circular graphic element looks okay and you should go with what makes sense to you. It isn’t “bad”, nor is there anything inherently “wrong” with it. It is in fact quite creative, and progressive.\n\nBye.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "My initial thoughts are “we do it as we want not as you want” is the wrong approach ... or at least incorrect wording. So depending on how you’re approaching it, a rethink might be in order. I believe “Output” might even miss the mark you’re trying to convey ... to me it says “we output stuff, we’re your monkeys” ... a repetitive/mechanical task, nothing about free thought or inspiring ideas.\n\nThe logo seems pretty generic in my opinion, and doesn’t really express “output”. I also tend to agree that the shiny look should be a treatment rather than the actual mark - i.e, any logo can have a web2.0 look applied ... but that’s your decision.\n\n—————  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Graphic Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042526/http:/www.solid-creative.com/design.htm)\n\n"
