It's hand-lettered in the old-school way, with a relaxed grace that speaks of years of discipline.  \nI like the story it tells, too. I didn't know people could defend their views on such arcane matters as punctuation with physical force. Now that I know, the first person who looks at this _handlettering_ and asks me what _font_ it is will get a knuckle sandwich. \n",
