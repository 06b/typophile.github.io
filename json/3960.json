Running \"ConfigurePythonCarbon\" in the Python folder got it working again....until I restarted.   \n   \nHope someone else has a more durable answer.\n\n"

It can't be Python because it has worked fine before. Is there a known conflict with another program?   \nOr do I have to move something from FL to the Python folder?   \nThe manual doesn't say that much.   \n   \nHaving proiblem installing FL in 9.2.2   \nI rebooted with Jaguar, installed it & then   \nrebooted back to 9.2.2 (no, I don't want to run Classic it's way too slow.).   \nMaybe that's the problem? By installing the software from OSX I automatically told the oftware to go for the OSX version of Python?\n\n"
