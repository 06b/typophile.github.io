The type family is a complete revision of Frutiger's [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Avenir) (1988), and is part of [Linotype Library](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype%20Library)'s [Platinum Collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Platinum%20Collection).\n\nAdrian Frutiger designed the original [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Avenir) for Linotype in 1988. It is based on an amalgamation of [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura) and [Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erbar). Frutiger had never been happy with the cold, modern appearance of Futura, so he \"humanized\" it.\n\nAvenir Next has a better distribution of weight across the family than Avenir did. The fonts also have small caps and old style figures in them. Each weight also has a condensed variant. No true [italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/italic) styles were made though, just [oblique](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/oblique) ones. This seems in keeping with most of Frutiger's other typefaces.\n\n[Avenir Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html)  \n [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/www.linotype.com/72/avenir-family.html).  \n [Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/erbar/lightcondensed/).  \n [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082747/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/neufville/futura-nd/book/).\n\n",
