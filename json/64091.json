What's the point of showing this list to a site visitor if it's guaranteed that it will not show right ?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014213809im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sans-serif-typekit_3855.png)\n\n"

If one does not want to upgrade or poke ones preferences into line, one must read the bright red sign at the top.\n\nNot showing anything is anti-web, and showing a completely different page is probably useless.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

IMHO\n\n"

Not sure why, but there are plenty of subtleties in @font-face implementation, so I don't know that I should gripe too loudly when it doesn't work perfectly all the time, yet.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

It is only the fact that in this case the content is also intended to be a specimen of served fonts that makes it seem peculiar. What you are seeing is normal, expected and a pretty good demonstration of what your browser will do when it encounters served fonts in the wild (only in the wild, you won't get any warning that the text is not displayed as intended).\n\nYour car metaphor doesn't make sense to me. If the content of the text were being changed, then a parallel to a semantic distinction such as a left/right indicator would be appropriate, but the content is not being changed, it is only being displayed with a fallback font. The correct parallel would be an arm waved out the window in place of an indicator, with both the indicator and the arm indicating the same direction.\n\n"

You'll be waiting a long time for that. ;)  \nrich\n\n"
