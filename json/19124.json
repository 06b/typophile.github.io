Mountain has a constructivist base with a blackletter flavor--which does not surprise me considering Dan's affinity for blackletter:-) I quite like the cap D in particular. I think Mountain's italic is quite successful and may find its way into some metal band logos.\n\nExcellent work Dan!\n\nChrisL\n\n",

That is a beautifully book which I can heartily recommend. I just received copy from the designers today.\n\n"

He's designed some beautiful faces that draw on geometric nouveau and deco influences.\n\n[http://www.atelierreneknip.nl/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014124428/http:/www.atelierreneknip.nl/ \"http://www.atelierreneknip.nl/\")\n\nCheck out his book, A.R.K./A.B.C., too.\n\n"

That A.R.K. lettering looks cool the same way that Chris' Weimar Plakat 1923 face looks cool, and seems to share some of the same inspiration, although Chris' letters are darker and less wide.\n\n"
