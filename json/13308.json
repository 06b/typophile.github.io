  "content": "Hi,  \nThere seems to be a problem with IE in implementing 'mirroring' effect to characters such as parenthesis in rtl context. My font has this problem in rtl along many others. However, it seems to be a solution because MS fonts containing rtl scripts (like Times New Roman) don't have this problem with IE.  \nMy font works well with FireFox or Opera. It's definitively an IE shortcoming but I wonder how MS fonts managed to circumvent this and how I can implement it in my font with FontLab (or Apple tools)\n\n",
