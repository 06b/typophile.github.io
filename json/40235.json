  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI am wondering about a problem with one of my fonts I am editing in fontlab: When opening a glyph in metrics window and clicking on it, usually there is a small arrow below the glyph which allows me to copy the metrics to its composites.  \nBut now, this small arrow is only shown for some glyphs (for example c, d, e, h, ...), as for others they are not (like a, g, dotlessi, k, ...). I have checked if the composites i want to apply the metrics to are really composites of that glyps - they are, so I just don’t know what I am doing wrong.\n\nHas anyone encountered the same problem and found a solution?\n\nThanks for your help  \nSebastian\n\nAddition: This is only occuring with one special font. When trying with another, everything is fine.\n\n [‹ Macro - Copy to Composites](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706165326/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40232 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Python Script for FontLab - Copy Metrics/Kerning Across Weights ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706165326/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39498 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
