  "content": "Through the generosity of a gentleman who posts on here, he identified (mostly, anyway) a font for me. Interceptor by Device Fonts. It's essentially a revised version of STOP, by Aldo Novarese.\n\nHowever, \"Interceptor\" is based on some other font (also a redraft of STOP). I'd like to know what that font is. Some photolettering typeface? Or? This earlier source would have been in existence in 1990, and earlier.\n\nSample of Interceptor Italic:  \n [http://devicefonts.co.uk/fontshow-b2/Interceptor-Italic.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419111212/http:/devicefonts.co.uk/fontshow-b2/Interceptor-Italic.png \"http://devicefonts.co.uk/fontshow-b2/Interceptor-Italic.png\")\n\n",

I'm looking for this other variant - similar to Stop, but what was used as 'inspiration' for the Interceptor font.\n\nPerhaps a better question would be to list all the variants based heavily on Stop. I would imagine the one I'm looking for has not yet been digitized, as I have all the current digital variants for reference.\n\nAG End Italic  \nComaro  \nGraymalkin Laser  \nPRASLINISLAND  \n???\n\n"
