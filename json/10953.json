I don't have the ability to boot in Classic mode since I'm at 10.2.5 on my OS X Mac.   \n   \nJoe, can your brother leak that Classic bootable hack that Apple has?   \n   \nMark, any thoughts?   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n",

I was hoping other folks had alternate workarounds for it.   \n   \nSo far I have surmized I could retrofit my machine with the ability to boot in Classic mode by replacing the system software with an older version.   \n   \nOR   \n   \nI could find some way to share the monitor of my new CPU with my old box (ala Remote Desktop) but it's painfully slow.   \n   \nOR   \n   \nDo all my FOG work on my old computer!   \n   \nThe problem is due to my time constraints right now, I don't have the time to meet the learning curve of trying to figure out how to do FOG things in Font Lab. My primary reason to jump to OS X was for Font Lab so I'll eventually make the leap.   \n   \nI should have saved my pennies for a new monitor instead of a new computer . . . Sheesh!   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

As I mentioned earlier, it's not so much that I'm resistant to Font Lab, it's just that I can maneuver in FOG so much quicker and I have my workflow based around that application.   \n   \nPlease post as soon as you find something out!   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

Unless you bought one of the newest machines which were released just this year, you should be able to do it. Just go to System Preferences \\> Startup Disk, select the OS 9 System folder and restart.   \n   \nDon't forget that you should use the PPC version of FOG in OS 9.\n\n"
