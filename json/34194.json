Manfred has generously made most of his fonts available for free at [TypOasis](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201164933/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein/index.htm), and he has helped with some of the [Blackletter revival](http://web.archive.org/) fonts on that site too, but I don’t think this is among them.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
