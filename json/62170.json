The zig-zag pattern is different in the two \"res\" sequences, but that is probably because it was added after the letters were assembled/set/drawn. It's possible this was a film font, but definitely not a wood typeface because of the top of the \"b\". It wouldn't have been designed like that.\n\nI remember listening to this album in college. Really good, as I recall. Better than their later stuff.\n\n"
