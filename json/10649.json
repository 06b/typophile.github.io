A board member, who was very concerned that the company promote the show in a way that was completely respectful to the Asian-American community (she was Chinese-American herself), helped me procure a piece of art that we used for the poster.   \n   \nBut the board member wasn't done yet, since I still had the show logo to design. She took me aside, made sure I was intently listening to her, and then she spoke these immortal words:   \n   \n\"NO CHOP SUEY LETTERING!\"   \n   \nShe didn't mention anything about Skia, however. But just to be on the safe side, I wouldn't use that either.   \n   \nMore seriously: obviously, her intent was to make sure that I, as a white person, wouldn't inadvertently do something that was disrespectful. You, as an Asian or Asian-American, may feel differently than she did about such typefaces. For the record, however, I _never_ even considered using one of them. They should only be used in kitschy contexts, and even so, probably not. [Abercrombie](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055337/http:/www.blackapolis.com/news/images/abercrombie.jpg), anyone?\n\n"

Even if it's a fake company, create a little creative brief for yourself about the company and determine what you'd want the brand to say.   \n  \nRemember that you're not just creating a look for somebody, you're creating a brand that stands for what the company is about. Also, ask yourself if the fonts you've selected and the look you've created really addresses all these things you're tying to accomplish.   \n  \nThink about it this way, if you opened up the phone book and saw the Jade Design logo, would you hire them to design anything for you?   \n  \nIf your answer is no, than you haven't fulfilled the purpose of a logo. In a consumer forum, a logo is to extend the brand visually and connect with the audience who would be inclined to use the product or service you're pitching to them.   \n  \nGood Luck and please post updated versions of the logo for us!   \n  \nStuart :D\n\n"

      "content": "OK, now I feel bad for being so flippant earlier. I agree with Stuart and HD's comments.   \n   \nSo, to be a bit more constructive with my own opinions: as I noted elsewhere in this forum today, I think the best logos are entirely unique to the companies or individuals they represent. The difficulty you have with a company called \"Jade Design\" is that you have a few readily available directions you can go in, but many, many other people have gone those directions before, to the point where they have become cliches.   \n   \nYou have a couple of options:   \n   \n1. Avoid the cliches altogether. Maybe your client (or you, if you're the client) picked the word Jade for an unusual reason. Dig into that inspiration for a compelling image.   \n   \n2. Explode one or more of the cliches, meaning that you knowingly subvert the cliche. I think Abercrombie thought they were doing that, but instead they played right into it. Here's more successful idea that breaks a different cliche:   \n   \n ![canada bread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022055337im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7219.gif)   \n   \nHere the Canadian maple leaf, a way-overdone image, is merely referenced in the happy coincidence that the company's initials could be used to sketch it. It also takes on a sort of wheat imagery as well. I'm not crazy about other aspects of this logo, but I think the approach was creative.\n\n"

A logo, on itself, isn't all... it's how you use it. As most of my logos are very simple, clean and typographic, it often is MORE important to show how they look on a business card or stationery than to present the logogramm itself.   \n   \nAlso, while I think that the type you choose should have a connection with the client or his business or the concept of your logo, sometimes it is important to work AGAINST such connections.

Maybe this is because many clients opt for the most tame, most superficial solution while you as the pro would have preferred the more radical or more pure or more stylized or more neosimplicistic version or whatever, the thing closer to your heart. When I go to a pitch that DEMANDS three designs, I mostly have my heart set on one of those three... mostly the quite different, daring, difficult approach. Many clients prefer the simple tun-of-the-mill , however. So whenever I can I opt to NOT give them a choice. After all, our job is to come up with a solution. Giving the client a choice is just shifting the difficulty of decisionmaking to him. I like to get loads of feedbacjk from the client, my briefing talks and eMails are long and go rather deep. When doing CD I speak to dozens of people from various positions in a company. And in the end I don't wanna see the thought and input of many people that culminates in a specific idea and look&feel go down just because a CEO has a bad day or is suddenly afraid of change.\n\n"

Cliches: I read once about a designer who said that in working on a logo, he first sat down and did all the cliche ideas to get them out of the way. THEN he started working on his client's logo. I've always found that advice helpful in my own work. It takes a look at where we've been with certain ideas (an historical perspective perhaps?) and allows you to take a fresh look at them and at your client.   \n2. How many options to present: I have presented a client with as many as eight different options in order to get them thinking strategically and answering questions like what is my business strategy? what is my marketing strategy? who am I? what do I do? how do I do it? It's surprising how often clients don't relate those answers to an identity design.   \n3. Logos should work in b&w first: This was a basic rule when I went to art college too. Now (hopefully wiser ;-) I think that it relates not so much to application (variation in size and media) as to perception - it is a valuable way to make sure to get the overall shapes right. These are perceived first by the viewer and we often lose sight of that while working on it.\n\n"

I had always thought that one of the biggest \"rules\" in logo design was to take into consideration every possible condition the logo might appear under... does it work big, small, reversed, etc., etc?   \n   \nConcerning showing clients options, what do you do when the client comes to you with something specific in mind?

We tried something along those lines (retro 50s and such stuff), but it always felt wrong, as a pistol for a crime book publisher is like an owl or a book for a book shop, or a pair of glasses for an optician, it's just too flat, even if you stylize it... it's just a one-dimensional, all too simple idea. What we came up with is a completely remodelled flammable-sign I once photographed from a NY gas tank. We completely redesigned the flame, and on the stationery and business cards it was to be foil stamped, and we felt that the danger/hot association was still quite close to the topic at hand, worked very well as a stand-alone sign (without the companies name) and it was nice to use a more or less simple everyday iso-sign in a completely different context and make it work instead of working with an obvious clich\n\n"
