Here is an example of the font:   \n   \n [http://www.alghanim.com/Automotive/images/cadillac%20logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110809062318/http:/www.alghanim.com/Automotive/images/cadillac%20logo.jpg)   \n   \nThanks so much and have a beautiful day.   \n   \nKevo\n\n",

      "content": "This is extremely unlikely to be based on a font. Automobile companies have lettering artists on staff just to do stuff like this (the most famous being Richard Isbell). They don't just go out and buy a font when they design a logo for a $30,000 car. They want something special, something exclusive.   \n   \nThat said, it is possible that a Cadillac fan somewhere has created a free font modeled on this logo. Possible, but not likely, since scripts like this are one of the most difficult kind of fonts to do well.\n\n"

You could tweak [English157](http://web.archive.org/web/20110809062318/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/english-157-bt/english157-bt/testdrive.html?s=Cadillac&p=72). Slant it a bit, cut off the loop on the C, reduce the ascenders. But I'm sure there are others too.\n\n"
