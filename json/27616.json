In my despair I even asked Linotype last October via email and they said they hoped to have it out at the beginning of 2006.\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone here can give me a more definive answer or recommend a compelling alternative for Windows.\n\n",

I don't mean to look a gift horse in the mouth (Linotype's FX being free and all), but, seriously, why not just throw a note on the website saying \"Don't hold your breath.\"\n\n"

While they were probably trying to address the frustration Windows users have felt, waiting and waiting and waiting, this release just screams \"we can't be bothered to make this thing actually _work_, so here's a bungled version for the time being.\"\n\nLinotype didn't have to develop FX at all, and for their part I realize all they're getting out of it is PR and some traffic to their store, but to my mind the PR attempt has backfired in a big way. A couple of years ago I simply thought of Linotype as a big foundry where one can purchase font licenses, and now, simply because this ball has been dropped so badly, they've lost me as a possible consumer of their product.\n\nI'm one person, of course, so who cares what I think, I'm just pissing in the wind here, but if I feel this way I have a feeling others might as well.\n\n"

It's fast and easy to use, but very powerful.  \nThe main thing I like about it is that it doesn't try to 'organise' your fonts for you. If your fonts are already organised how you like, it will work with this.  \nYou can browse your active fonts or fonts in folders elsewhere on your computer. You get to see a sample preview which you can easily type over or revert to a number of presets, plus a full character map. You also get a choice between activating and permanently installing fonts.  \nHope this helps.  \nbtw I don't work for them, just seems that people have a lot of trouble finding decent, stable font managers for Windows!\n\n"
