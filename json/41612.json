Bertieri – made before 1935 for Società Nebiolo – and claims there was also a digital version (‘PS’, next to ‘B’ for Blei = lead and ‘F’ for Fototype).\n\nBy the way, it’s not about [this Paganini](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017112615/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/p/paganini.htm).\n\nFor those who want to take a look at a sample of Paganini: check out [this PDF from Klingspor-Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017112615/http:/www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Butti/AButti.pdf).\n\nF\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Alex. The Paganini typeface is featured on most of the Nebiolo specimens I’ve seen. Giangiorgio Fuga has put online some pictures from one of his copies of said specimens, like [this picture where you can see Paganini quite well](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017112615/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/giofuga/1755025881/in/set-72157602712967666/).\n\nAccording to <cite>20 alfabeti brevemente illustrati</cite> (1933) by Raffaello Bertieri, the typeface was his own creation. He art directed and drew the first preliminar sketches while Alessandro Butti did most of the actual drawing of the typeface itself. It’s a well regarded typeface if you consider that even Giovanni Mardersteig has been known to use it.\n\n"

If the choices ( florid or no ) were in his eyes aimed at better reading then they were craft. If not, artsy as in for personal expression. The modern/Bodoni look is the aesthetic that I have seen Hrant attracted to over time. Fleischmann & Paganini both have it. Hrant, feel free to correct this if it is mistaken.\n\n"

I have the original specimen of Ruano, and although I don't like so much the lowercase it is undoubtedly an original typeface, even more, considered it was designed in 1926.  \nI was incredibly surprised to see some uppercase forms I have incorporated into my old Exegetic are amazingly similar to Ruano (the uppercase R and S, the lowercase S).  \nI think - willingly or not - these forms got in the blood of us Italians, even if the faces were maybe not so extensively used (Ruano was not so ubiquitous as Paganini or Semplicità).\n\n"
