It'll be metallic green and black. Please let me know what you think! Thanks in advance!   \n( [Here's](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023141403/http:/www.riverrep.com/Corcovado.mp3) a ~7MB .mp3, if anyone's interested.)   \nRegards,   \n--Michael.\n\n",

I have the Frank Sinatra with Red Norvo Quientet Live in Australia 11959 CD. Red Norvo didn't need a logo, I don't think you do either.   \n   \nDo you know WBGO 88.3 FM out of Newark, NJ? The best Jazz Station in the east coast of the US.\n\n"

I am thinking on puting ME above the horizontal of the 3, and also i an wondering how it would look with the M3, flipping horizontaly the 3.   \n   \nnice song ;-), i like the variations on the 1:03 min   \n   \nCG\n\n"
