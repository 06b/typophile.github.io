Or for that matter that I know, but didn’t realize lived in the Seattle area. Of course there’s me, and Si. But I’m sure there must be more of you out there....\n\nNote: I would also welcome contact info for type geeks not on the list.  \nOther typographic folks I know in the area include the rest of the Microsoft Typography team, a few typographic folks from Adobe Seattle, the gentlemen from Linguist’s Software (international fonts), John D Berry (writer and typographer), Mamoun Sakkal (Arabic type designer), and Ole Sorenson (local designer and Meetup organizer).\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n [‹ Justified Text in Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907082940/http:/typophile.com/node/16525 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Black Ink ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907082940/http:/typophile.com/node/16650 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Besides John Berry, of those who are still (or again) in Seattle, I remember Andras Furesz (of Very Graphics, book dealer who was once one of the few sources of hard-to-get European type books) and Nick Nussbaum (now at Microsoft). There were others whose names I do not remember, but I bet John would know.\n\nJohn Cornicello is another ex-typesetter. Other Seattle type types (haven’t heard from them in awhile, so don’t know if they are still around) include Ben Bauermeister, typesetter Mike Arst, and Andy Taylor (Japan Pacific Publications) who used to typeset exclusively in Japanese).\n\n—Kathleen\n\n"
