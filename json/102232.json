I guess you do pretty much the same from many wide/extended grotesk., pulling up/downwards some middle crossbars and reworking /R.  \n2 alternatives in the same vein: [Abalda](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/abalda), [Motora Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/motora-sans)  \nCandidates for customization: [Novocento Wide Demi Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento) (probably my choice because /W centre vertex is below the outer strokes), [Engravers Gothic Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/engravers-gothic), [Road Radio](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/glen-jan/road-radio), [Blair Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/blair), [Turnpike](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontdiner/turnpike), [Zeppelin](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/zeppelin), [Doublewide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/betatype/doublewide), [Reservation Wide](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/reservation-wide), [Presicav](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/presicav), [Halogen](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/positype/halogen), [Fashion](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/fashion), [Aero](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.vllg.com/Constellation/Aero), [Idlewid](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100043), [Farmers Co-op](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/fonts.kylewaynebenson.com/farmers-co-op)\n\n"

It's used at the end of this video, and also on other materials that they have [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3csaIbOxXjw](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017120245/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=3csaIbOxXjw \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3csaIbOxXjw\")\n\nBut I'll go the custom way and modify one of the above for what I need.\n\nCheers!\n\n"
