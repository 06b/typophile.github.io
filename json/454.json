I work with InDesign Full-Time now, whenever a client forces me to use QXP, my price goes up because it just takes THAT much longer to get things done right. ID has very few flaws left while Quark more and more feels caught between the weight of old age and the massive lack of innovative ideas. Integration, reliability, creativity, speed... ID is my first choice in Layut and even in smaller stuff I once did in Freehand. What Photoshop has become in terms of Imageediting, ID has become in terms of designing pages...\n\n",

I have always found Adobe to be a   \nreliable and design-focused company. it is encouraging   \nto know that they have been extraordinarily successful   \nas such.   \n   \nthe design community has a fantastic assest in   \nInDesign. I hope that the majority will begin to   \nrecognize this and support Adobe's diligent efforts.   \n   \n(is my distaste for Quark clear?)\n\n"

Although OpenType isn't the most democratic format right now, the upsides of the format are just dandy with me, text-setting hasn't been as much fun in years.   \nAnd as Adobe and URW and Lino and some other companies are making the switch to OTF and others, like House and Emigre sloooowly trying their hands at the extended possibilities of that format as well, I think Quark will either include OTF or involuntary give Adobe a marketing bonus.   \n   \nQuark only survives because people are so used to it. I have worked with both systems and as of ID 1.5 Adobe has far surpassed Quark in my opinion.\n\n"

Since I work with InDesign and on Win-based workstations, I have preferred PDF for well over five years now, when most printersor film-outputters didn't even accept them. Thanks to Computer-to-plate that has changed. PDF is the best way to get your data to the outputter and InDesign+Distiller is a Killer combination.\n\n"

      "content": "I have heard that the pretty big Publicis company in France Switched to Indesign.   \n   \nAs John Hudson pointed out ,couple of months ago, Quark guys came a day to Unicode conference to say they will never support this silly Unicode stuff. How stupid how they are! I really don't know how they will manage xml in the future without Unicode.   \n   \nAt my own little user experience, I have used xml import for dictionnary layout in Indesign, it worked correctly (not perfect, but more because the xml wasn't set up correctly and because I lack of experience), mainly a set up of Style sheet, et voil�.   \n   \nAnyway, as past Adobe Indesign prefered designer two years ago, I'm indeed strongly in favour of Indesign. At everyday level, for fonts, its wonderful tool to test finally complete character sets on booth Mac or Windows with exactly the same file without any problem.   \n   \nIndesign 1, 1.5, 2 work here on the 9, then on X without problems at all. Just too slow on 9, with the 2 when you launch a print out, no problems on X.   \n   \nI have done complex layout for my catalog No 3 in 2001, Ambroise specimen same year, Sabon next specimen last year (as \"assistant\" to Muriel Paris), and some others job with great pleasure.   \n   \nAnd, with Indesign, what is great is that you can open roughly all various version of Xpress files when you can't with Xpress itself.   \n   \nWhat a pain, when I need to test a font on my old Xpress 3.32 on my old grey G3!   \n   \nIts clear also, that when you started to use an OT font and all the features (SC, OsF and so on), its quite difficult to comeback to good old PS fonts.   \n   \nThe only critic I have is that the French localization for all typographic features vocabulary is more than a big \"MERDE.\"\n\n"

      "content": "I finally downloaded a trial copy of inDesign a couple of months back and I've never opened quark since. Aside from being vastly more intuitive than quark, the type setting and style sheet features are top notch. Also, no more bitmapped fonts. Precise letterspacing and kerning were impossible on screen in Quark because of the terrible display of most T1 fonts. ID does a much better job. Finally, the collect for output features of ID are a thousand times better than Quark, though perhaps a topic of disagreement among type designers. ID actually collects your fonts upon your request. (You do get a dialog box warning you that you may be in violation of copyright by doing so) And if you don't want to send your fonts, you can convert them to outlines. Another ID only feature.   \n   \nNeedless to say, I'm sold. I hate to see the market dominated by a goliath such as adobe, but as long as quark keeps developing such an inferior product, adobe it shall be.\n\n"

ID gets the job done better and faster... everything else is just annoying habits. And while I do not think that some piece of software makes you a better or worse designer, I always wonder that sticking to and by standards is exactly NOT what being a designer is all about. Working with the standard machine -- a mac -- and the standard software -- Quark -- not because its best but because its the standard, well... that doesn't feel good to me. If tomorrow a little firm publishes a good alternative to Photoshop, I'm SO there. I even use Photobrush, a 49-bucks-tool for some stuff the Shop cannot do. I somehow feel weird when I stick stick to the road most traveled. :-).   \n   \n   \n\\>everything that Quark can?   \n   \nIt can :-D.   \n   \nI've been working with ID since 1.0 (which was gruesome, okay). I've done everythin from straight literature books, posters, CD-Booklets, a 300-pages art expo catalogue with massive bells and whistles, the soundscapes brochure with has various special inks, partial varnishing, fold out-pages in different directions and was a HELL of a job that would 've driven me crazy in Quark. I've done a whole f\\*\\*\\*ing book of 140 pages with Photos in EIGHT hours overnight. I've done a very photoshop-layer-heavy job that profited from the direct integration of photoshop, I've done leporellos and business cards and stationery and even screen design templates... and.. well, you get it... anything, you can imagine.   \n   \nYou can do everything in Indesign.   \n   \n   \n   \n\\>\\>No one will output InDesign files.   \nTwo words: PDF. (Well, one actually. Not even a word, okay...)   \n   \nAnd Adobe being a monolith -- yeah, I see that problem. But a) they seem to still be flexible even when they are a monpol. Photoshop is an example of that, imo. And b) Print is only a splinter of what the market will be with interactive screen and online tools being there as well. I'm more concerned with what Macromedia does (or rather, does not) do with Flash because they HAVE the monopol in that area.\n\n"

Quark let me down over 5 or 6 years ago and I've been forced to use them because of their stranglehold on the industry, but Adobe InDesign has given me a taste of freedom, and have given page layout the overhaul that Quark has needed since the late 90's.   \n   \nI'm still learning the finer points of InDesign, but nothing will distract me from it. Adobe has proven its commitment to the design community over and over for years. Plus, Adobe most of the other application I use in my print work.

So you experiment more, save less often inbetween, and when it crashes, it's gone for good. No prob with ID, but on Freehand you have no chance of retrieving your designs. FH, even in the MX version, sucks compared to Indesign.   \nPhotoshop could use somthing like this as well, especially as they DO save intermediary files on your harddisk, so restoring them after a crash should be rrrrrelatively simple to program.\n\n"
