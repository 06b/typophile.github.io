      "content": "My initial thought was Bayer Universal, but it doesn't really have that much in common. More just the 'feel.'\n\nThere are definitely some nice things going on. The 'e' is cursive, which might work better in the italic than a roman.\n\nThe second half of your 'm' is too small.\n\nThe r, t, f may be too narrow when used in text.\n\nI really like the 'c,' more so than the circular a, b, d, g, p. q. And the o has a little more charm than the circular ones as well.\n\nThey seem to be in conflict with the c, but the c works nicely with the h, m, n.\n\nThe undulations in the k and x are nice, but might be too subtle. You notice them at this size, but they would disappear at anything smaller.\n\nI have found it interesting that type designs have to be a caricature of themselves. You look at them the size of your screen in order for them to function at 7 pt.\n\nGood start!\n\n"

I tried to share the same style to all the letters now.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124123225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/inofont2_3906.jpg)\n\nYou can see all the tiny details in the PDF [http://typophile.com/files/Inovares%20Font%202.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124123225/http:/typophile.com/files/Inovares%20Font%202.pdf \"http://typophile.com/files/Inovares%20Font%202.pdf\")\n\nAll opinions about the font are more than welcome. Please tell me if this is an improvement in the right way and what else should I be careful about. I'll start with upper case letters if you think this is ready to go forward.\n\n"

      "content": "First off, I like it quite a bit and think the little flexes and the e and c work really well together.\n\nI think it's a step too far from the first version. The undulations that were nice and gentle in the first are overstated in this version (though the v and w are a definite improvement). Some of the characters are looking a bit top-heavy (a g h m n p q), though I think this has to do with changing the design of these characters pretty drastically. I'm not sure which direction I prefer. Can't say the y works for me...\n\nHave you given any thought to ligatures?\n\n"

I'm made another revision to balance undulations on \"k\", \"x\" and \"z\" and I've increased character spacing to make it more even and not squashed.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124123225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/inofont4_5470.jpg)\n\nAnother thing about the \"y\". I think the current \"y\" works best. I tried three additional designs, but to me the original one works best. What would you suggest to base style of the \"y\" on what letter? I based it on \"v\" and \"g/u\".\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124123225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/inofont3_4485.jpg)\n  \n(updated image)\n\nTo my eyes the original right stroke undulated version is the best one. Maybe the right stroke looks a bit heavier but that will be taken care of.\n\nLigatures would be part of the font as well (fi, fj, fl, ffi, ffj, ffl). Do you think there's a need for any additional ligature? I think the font is quite simple and plain and doesn't need anything beyond normal.\n\nOpinions much appreciated.\n\n"

Narrower/lower?\n\nI used to have a narrower \"k\" but I optically adjusted it to \"h\". :(\n\nWhat do you mean by \"w\" being a mess?

Plus you can say it's inspired by the Greek script - people will like that. :-) If you decide not to go with #4, go with #3. If anybody complains that it's too strange, tell them Fleischmann was doing it in the 18th century, and you hope people aren't more closed-minded now. :-\\>\n\nThe descender area of the \"g\" is cramped, and a common trick in fonts with such an issue is to make the head shorter - to lift the bottom of the head above the baseline a bit.\n\nMaybe not a \"mess\", but the \"w\" to me is clearly too elaborate. Here's an idea: if you end up using the fourth \"y\", try making the middle part a vertical line.\n\nThe \"x\" and \"z\" seem just a bit too curvy compared to the whole.\n\nAnd something new, which I should have mentioned  \nfirst: I think the ascenders should be slightly taller.\n\nhhp\n\n"
