  "content": "Good Evening Artists!\n\nI am seeking assistance on a logo redesign for our biggest in-house project: [http://keytosavannah.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821/http:/keytosavannah.com/)\n\nKey to Savannah is basically a tourism website that brings helpful tools and information to both tourists and locals of Savannah, GA.\n\nClosely behind Key To Savannah, came Key To Tybee. Tybee Island is Savannah’s beach, so we launched [http://keytotybee.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821/http:/keytotybee.com/).\n\nOur current logo isn’t translating well across all of our media. On our nametags, you can’t even read the words “KEY TO” and everyone asks if we are from Savannah, so it is time for a change.\n\nHere are the logos as they are now.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-1_6741.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-2_5835.gif)\n\nSo my first attempt at redesign turned out visually pleasing, but they didn’t really communicate much relating the mark, or the brand. I removed the key and the sticker and ended up with just a fancy looking title:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo2-1_4997.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo2-2_3971.jpg)\n\nSo, back to the drawing board I went, and following the advice of some fellow artists, I started with the key, and THEN to the typography, so here is where I’m at:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/keytosavannah-logo_4551.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821im_/http:/typophile.com/files/keytotybee-logo_5561.gif)\n\nCurrently, I am working on some kerning and proportions with these, but I wanted to get them up so I could benefit from as much feedback as possible. Please let me know if you like them, and what would make them better. We plan on releasing many “key to” sites in the future so this one has got to stick. This is my last chance to change it this one time. I feel that the site’s popularity is about to take hold, so the time is now!!\n\nThank you SO much!  \nAll the best,  \nawesome.omen\n\n",

      "content": "the new logos are pretty complex and have an air of being older than the originals (not necessarily a good thing)\n\nmy suggestion is to steer away from the literal key reference - or at the very least have EITHER the word or the icon not both, nor combined into one mark.\n\nperhaps the skylines from the cities could make up the key teeth, or maybe the key mark is a generic (and simple) icon that will work well across most/any collateral.\n\nI really reckon the whole key thing is naff. Maybe take a different spin on a key ... think maps, think map keys/legends, simplification of directions etc.\n\nideas anyway.\n\n—————  \n**Paul Ducco**  \n [Graphic Designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105821/http:/www.solid-creative.com/) - Melbourne\n\n"

The skyline was too much so the city name took the place of the skyline.\n\nMaybe they are just too dark and need something to pull it all together, I’m working on some new ones. Thank you Paul for your feedback and great advice!\n\nAny comments would be SO appreciated, thanks all!\n\n"

You used three different fonts in just one logo. Needless to say they don’t complement each other.\n\nI would concentrate on something simple. What is Savannah like? Try to incorporate that in your logo. Don’t use too many fonts. And don’t use colours at the beginning.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

So I can’t start with “what Savannah is like.” Right?\n\nI keep hearing, start with something simple... is it just the fonts that are bad, or the whole entire concept?\n\nI have to brand the KEY TO.

But if the places the web site is focusing on are somewhat historic “good old mainstreet” type venues, I think it’s quite appropriate.\n\n"

I suggest you first design your “Key to” part, then you’ll work on incorporating other parts.\n\nBy simple I mean, no colours, one or MAYBE two fonts at most (in the whole logo, not in “Key to”), no visual effects etc. KISS principle.\n\nYour logos so far were “Savannah”. KeyTo was just something that was added to it.\n\nAnd when you’ll concentrate on the KeyTo part, don’t think of it as a key. Think of what the key represents? What it does. Get associations, that will lead you to some great clever solution. And think of the purpose of these kites/services...  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
