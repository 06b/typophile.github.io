Do you mean:   \n(a) \"Template\", which is the vector-based drawing, one per font, that is used as reference for each glyph throughout the entire font, or   \n(b) \"Background\", which is the bitmap image, one per glyph, that is used as reference for a given glyph in a font?   \n   \n2. In which application do you use the command \"Copy\"? In which application do you use the command \"Paste\"? (That is, are you copy-pasting from Photoshop to FontLab, or from FontLab to Photoshop?)   \n   \n3. Can you show the original image and a screenshot showing the result in FontLab?   \n   \n4. If you are a registered FontLab user, you're obviously entitled to free technical support. Since this is a FontLab-specific problem, may I ask you to use the FontLab Problem Report Form at [http://www.fontlab.com/html/support.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106164212/http:/www.fontlab.com/html/support.html)  \nso that the personnel at Fontlab Ltd. can review your problem?

      "content": "Oh, now I see what you mean. FontLab only supports monochrome (black-and-white) images in the Background layer. Your original is greyscale, so it gets converted to black-and-white when pasting. The resolution remains the same.   \n   \nYou can covert it manually (e.g. in Photoshop). If the resolution is not sufficient, use a bitmap with higher resolution.   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam Twardoch   \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

      "content": "And if the details get lost, you can interpolate the image to a higher resolution, and use some other method (not threshold) while converting to bitmap.   \nThis will preserve some additional shading detail. Anyway, the best thing, if the sketch is needed in grayscale for better evaluation, is to go back and forth between FreeHand/Illustrator and Fontlab. With the new copying options it's a snap, and Freehand 10/MX works just great.\n\n"
