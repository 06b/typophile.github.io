I particularly like this style, with strong vertical lines, an explicit diagonal in the S and corners like a race track at the top and bottom.\n\nGoogling Modern Gaspipe doesn't yield much besides Tungsten. Does anyone know of some other good examples of this style, preferably with a lighter weight, such as [Bourgeois](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011222658/http:/www.virusfonts.com/fonts/bourgeois#characters-42)?\n\nMany thanks,  \nStephen\n\n",
