(Click on the 'edit' button when viewing the thread)\n\nBecause of this we should ask those who forget to use a descriptive subject to change it so their post is open to search in the future. I say this because many of the requesters post once and are never heard from again.\n\n@ ginagrandiosa: Can you adjust the subject on this post to be more descriptive? Something like 'Rooftop Cinema Slab Serif ID request' Thanks!\n\n"
