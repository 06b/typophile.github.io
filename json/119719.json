Text in question is engraved in a stone slab about halfway down. Sorry about picture quality, I know nothing about typography so it would be great if someone could point me in the right direction with this.\n\nWorst case scenario I go and take my own photo of this thing.\n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [donshottype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317104744/http:/typophile.com/user/205259 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

      "content": "As you say, this is very small image and details are ambiguous.  \nIn 1939 architects still had their own lettering designs which they used for building inscriptions, which were done by hand. The technology of the day did not provide for the direct transfer of fonts to large scale letters.  \nNevertheless, the lettering might have been modeled on a font rather than an architectural lettering design.  \nI don't see any major conflicts with a 1926 design by Rudolf Weiss for the Bauer foundry of Frankfurt, digitized as Weiss by Adobe [https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/weiss/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317104744/https:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/weiss/ \"https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/weiss/\")  \nDon\n\n"

If you or someone else knows of and could post a font similar to this one in style and era, that would be very helpful.\n\n"

      "content": "OK 1929 would fit with a design from 1926. The architects might have wanted lettering with a contemporary feel rather than the traditional Trajan style inscriptions. Weiss reflects the ethos of the 1920s and is perhaps a fair match. Another digital version of it is Weiss Antiqua EF [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/weiss-antiqua/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317104744/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/weiss-antiqua/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/weiss-antiqua/\")  \nDon\n\n"
