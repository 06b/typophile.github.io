  "content": "Hi,\n\nI had a logo designed and now I can't contact the designer. I'd like to know what the font is.\n\nI've tried various tools to try and work it out, but I just can't seem to find one that matches. I think it may be in italics (I'm not sure if it's tilted by default), but I don't know if that affects the tools or not.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.  \nThanks in advance.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Lobster \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132058/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [name\\_postcard.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317132058/http:/typophile.com/files/name_postcard.jpg) | 11.17 KB |\n\n",
