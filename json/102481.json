  "content": "Hi Typophiles,\n\nWondering if you could help me out with IDing the fonts used on this site: [Sous Style](http://web.archive.org/web/20140715002430/http:/www.sousstyle.com/). I've also attached a screen shot.\n\nIt looks like they're using a serif (in the CSS it specifies Baskerville, but I've not known Baskerville to look like that) and an unknown \"Geometric Light\" embedded typeface - but I'm having no luck identifying either.\n\nThanks much!!  \nMichelle\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140715002430im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SousStyleSite_5854.jpg)\n\n",
