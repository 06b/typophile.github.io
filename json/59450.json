But the second try with your stylised letters is better than the first one.\n\nAnd make sure you distort the perfect round bullet inside A.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

      "content": "Your sketches are more powerful and expressive than your digital version of the logo.  \nNone of the two convey the idea of wind (\"aero\" in greek, but I think you knew that) while the last sketch was quite streamlined.  \nTry to keep the swoosh of the R, but give it square edges.  \nAlso pay attention to the thickness of the lines; in the first version the top line of the E and the last one are too different :)\n\n"
