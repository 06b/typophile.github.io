I'd like to give them to my client to use in Illustrator 8 ... they are basically templates. When I export them as legacy files all the type breaks into separate letters. I did try to create a text box thinking that perhaps that would work but it didn't. I'm neither all-knowing nor all-seeing so I'm hoping you might have an idea or suggestion for me.   \n   \n ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105104514im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nThank you.\n\n",
