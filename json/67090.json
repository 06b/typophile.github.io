      "content": "Cześć Jan,  \nthis is one of those special typefaces for cartography. They used to have pretty generic names, like ‘Kartenschrift’ [map type]. Hard to find samples.  \nYour best option might be [Römisch Stehend](http://web.archive.org/web/20100209213018/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/roemisch_com_stehend/?&sample_text=Jungfrau&sample_size=74&update=0). Karten-Augustea is also very close, but it seems to be unavailable.\n\nBy the way, you might enjoy [this g](http://web.archive.org/web/20100209213018/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2524903281/) aswell.  \nF\n\n"
