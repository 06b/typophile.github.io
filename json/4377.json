      "content": "I think this can become a pretty solid font - the idiosyncracies (like the \"f\") keep it from being too generic. One thing I'd worry about though is the vertical proportions: for diagram work you might like a bigger x-height, although that will make it less elegant. The caps are somewhat large, but that might actually be a good thing for display work.   \n   \nIn the UC, the only problem I see is the \"Q\": I agree with it being non-descending, but then you should try having an internal part to the tail. Actually, I'd change the \"I\" as well: for technical labeling serifs would help legibility.   \n   \nIn the lc:   \n- The \"a\" looks... dorky. Not sure how to fix it.   \n- I'd raise the dots on \"i\" and \"j\" (except if you'll be pulling in the extenders).   \n- The \"k\" isn't working.   \n- The beak of the \"r\" is big, but if you keep the spacing loose (since it's a light face) it might work.   \n- The \"s\" can have a small head, but I'd make the whole more circular - like in Futura.   \n- The \"y\" is too small.   \n- The \"z\" is leaning right.   \n   \nNumerals: to me they seem too mannered.   \n   \n--   \n   \nDarker weights: you'll have to do a lot of modulation at the joins.   \nItalics: a sensitive slanted-Roman seems in order, maybe with some shears at the terminals   \n   \nKeep at it!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Of course I hope that this can find _real_ use for _real_ need. The definition of the problem, the whys and the rules helps me get out of my own way and concentrate on the _doing_. I don't just want to say _I want to make a geometric sans_ because it doesn't supply me enough traction.   \n   \nI am definitely going to re-visit 'Q' , UC 'I' ,'k' and 's'. The idea of a more circular whole for the 's' is useful idea and I want to explore that. I see the tipping 'z' now, funny how that kind of thing can disappear on you.   \n   \nThe 'a'... well I don't know if I'd say **dorky** , but I also don't think I am totally happy with it. I want to keep it two-stories though, that's for sure. I have a couple ideas I will explore.   \n   \nHrant, if my numerals are too mannered do I fix it by encouraging them to be ill-mannered? :-) Kidding aside, I suspect this is because when I was a draftsman I prided myself on my numerals. I'm not sure I have an idea or reference point about where to go with them. Any suggestions?   \n   \n_Can't wait to see a text sample_   \n   \nMe too.\n\n"

At the least make the bar longer.   \n- The 6 and 9 seem too big in the bowl.   \n- Like the 5, the 7's point is too much. Plus I might pull in (and maybe flatten) the main stroke.   \n- The 8 is squooshed. I know you don't want to make it too small though.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "There are indeed pros to long descenders, and in some cases it makes great sense. But the \"limited vertical space\" con you mention is sort of an extreme manifestation of a much broader functional requirement leading to the need to make descenders notably shorter than ascenders in any \"real\" text face:   \n   \nSince economy is _always_ a factor (to some extent), and you need the apparent leading to be _just right_ to ease \"linefeeds\" but without waste, optimal usage of the vertical space has a direct bearing on functional merit; it's not really that you want to avoid lines touching (which can only happen with very narrow measure), it's simply that the space you give to the descender zone might be better used elsewhere.   \n   \nAs you say though it's a matter of balance, as always. It seems to me that the pivotal character is the \"g\"; generally it must look _slightly_ cramped for the balance of Cartesian usage versus overall aesthetic integrity to be good for text.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Jon, I tried to imagine what the typeface would look like in the context of a map or library label. All-caps settings tend to be used often (for headings, tables, etc.) and I think the uneven width of your capital letters would look somewhat awkward. Shrinking the W and M would help; make the narrow glyphs (B, P, R, U, V) a little wider so they'll sit nicer next to the wide round letters; but don't compress the round glyphs or you'll kill the geometric quality. The R needs work -- it looks like a B with the bottom chopped off, and a straight leg would suit your intent better.   \n   \nThe number 1 should have a wider \"beak,\" (and maybe a \"foot\") for the same reasons.   \n   \nI like Avenir but it's been getting overused, so I'm interested to see where you take this. I think there is a niche for a font that has the \"flavor\" of Avenir but is tailored for a certain function. (Hmm, I wonder, what's the flavor of Avenir... does it taste like Cool Mint Listerine, chewable vitamin C tablets, a raspberry Stoli & soda?)   \n   \n//john\n\n"

It is very true that all caps is common in labelling on maps and in libraries, and your advice makes a great deal of sense in this respect.   \n   \nWhen I drew the glyphs it was of great concern to me that I not end up with another Futura. I like Avenir a lot, and was making decisions on some of the glyphs like 'f' and 'R' to intenionally diverge from the path.   \n   \nYour suggestions strike a chord with me and I will give them serious thought.   \n   \nTo my thinking Avenir = Cool Mint Listerine (minty with a little hint of medicine).   \n   \nJon\n\n"

Here's the deal:  \n- Narrowed the 'W' and 'M'  \n- redrew the 's' which is more geometric now, but I'm afraid is too narrow  \n- Just noticed that the uc 'S' needs to be redrawn too, especially its tail.  \n- terminated the hook in the 'J' and 'j' earlier and they look nicer now.  \n- K as noted in an earlier post  \n- uc 'i' has bars on it but I got scared and they look knobby. Same with 'J'.  \n- lc 'a' is now a single storey (sigh) which works better.  \n- 'Q' has a new tail.  \n- lc 'L' stroke too thick and 'X' strokes too thin.  \n- also redrew the lc 'y' and shortened its extender.\n\nI took the drawings into TypeTool and generated this font. The sample was made with the newly generated font in Illustrator and converted to outlines for the PDF so I didn't run into any weirdness. I did some ignorant kerning and spacing but I have never used a font editor before so this is obviously crude. No punctuation or numerals have been revised since the earlier drawings and are not in the font at this time.\n\nAre W and M narrow enough now? Should I straighten the leg of the R?
