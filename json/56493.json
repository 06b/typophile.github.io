Metal type was also sold by weight, and in the 1912 ATF catalog the scheme is broken down by the weight in pounds and ounces of each letter included in a 100 lb. font—which suggest that the number of each sort would vary based on individual sort weights.\n\n"

Unfortunately, I don't have any info on fonting schemes here at my office, so I'm no help.\n\nYou might check with some current Monotype shops that still sell fonts. M&H Type in San Francisco or Quaker City Type Foundry in Honey Brook, Pennsylvania. Or Sterling Type in Indiana. Or Bell Type & Rule in Los Angeles. Or Hill & Dale Foundry in West Virginia.\n\nSome Monotype houses would also make custom fonting schemes. Or sell 6-inch lines of individual sorts. Depending on what a printer needed.\n\nFoundries and Monotype houses also sold \"weight fonts,\" extensions of the standard fonting schemes in larger quantities.\n\nLet us know what you find out.\n\npowers\n\n"
