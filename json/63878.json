Although you can only kern one glyph against another, you need the third glyph for context.\n\nThe best program to do kerning in is the one you designed your type in.\n\nDo not automate the process, you will not learn very much if you rely on automatic tools.\n\nBefore you even begin to kern, make sure your glyph metrics are as perfect as they can be.\n\nDon't hesitate to redraw the glyph if you cannot get it spaced or kerned satisfactorily.\n\nUse your eyes.\n\n"
