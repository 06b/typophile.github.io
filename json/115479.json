Some wacky bug. sigh.)\n\nColor fonts are here!  \nUntil recently, computer fonts were digital imitations of traditional monochrome typefaces. However, since 2013, it's been possible to create OpenType fonts with glyphs that have multiple colors. They don't work everywhere yet, but where they do work, they're really spectacular. Think real calligraphy...corporate logos... icons... 3D letterforms or letters with visible brush strokes!\n\nIn this webinar, FontLab's Adam Twardoch will show you how to create color fonts using BitFonter 3, FontLab Studio 5 and TransType 4 - from an alphabet written with a watercolor paint brush on a sheet of paper all the way to an OpenType font that works in Apple Keynote and Pages on Mac OS X!\n\nIn order to get the most from this webinar you will need BitFonter, FontLab Studio, and TransType 4. To make it easy for you Fontlab is offering BitFonter at an unprecedented 80% discount (your cost =US$99) to registrants. In addition if you don't already have FontLab Studio or TransType 4 we'll give you a 50% discount on those products. That's a potential US$773 savings on the whole bundle.\n\nThere are a limited number of seats available for this webinar, so don't be disappointed - register early.\n\nColor Font Webinar  \n22 April 2014  \n9 am PST / 12 noon EST / 20:00 CEST  \nRegister with this link: [https://www.anymeeting.com/AccountManager/RegEv.aspx?PIID=EA52DD89804B3B](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420014642/https:/www.anymeeting.com/AccountManager/RegEv.aspx?PIID=EA52DD89804B3B \"https://www.anymeeting.com/AccountManager/RegEv.aspx?PIID=EA52DD89804B3B\") (Note: don't register using Safari on Mac.

I figured I might as well post in this thread!\n\nI don't see these formats mentioned at BitFonter, and TransType 4 doesn't seem to export these when you use their layering tool to create colored glyphs. (Although TransType converts the layered Microsoft approach to SVG.)\n\nI would like to create a simple one-character font that I can use to check browser support for SBIX and CBDT/CBLC. Anybody interested in helping me out?\n\n**Edit:** I tried Behdad's scripts to create fonts that should be compatible with Google's method (and work on Android and Linux). The script is [on Github](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420014642/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fgithub.com/behdad/color-emoji). I created the FruityGirl and Funkster fonts with the included script, but they don't work on Android. Anybody know what's going on?\n\n**Edit2:** I also tried Jens Kutilek's script to generate fonts with Apple's SBIX table, according to [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420014642/http:/typophile.com/node/103268), but the generated fonts don't show up on test devices through Browserstack :(\n\n"
