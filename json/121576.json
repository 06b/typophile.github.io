In OS X, you need to locate the desired app, which will have a .ipa extension (if you have them visible), then open it with the zip extractor of your choice. You will end with a folder. Inside this folder there will be another, called “Payload”, which contain the app (with a .app extension). Right-click to show the bundle content and somewhere in there you will find regular font files.\n\n"
