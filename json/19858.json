  "content": "Regarding typography and the use of uncommon letter images, I personally do like the (moderate) use of type reflection. Sometimes evidently but also ’undercover’, as they can function as regular types.\n\nLike a mirrored ’z’ (=s) or a mirrored ’w’ (=m). Well, there are several options.\n\nIs this a well-mannered way of creating a nice text image or just a cheap trick from an Illustrator-freak?\n\n [‹ A nice free font at Fontshop: Baskerville Old Face](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422235854/http:/typophile.com/node/19929 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [ambigrams in motion ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080422235854/http:/typophile.com/node/19917 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

So do, for example, w and m, or u and n.\n\nIs there a minimal set of characters which are prerequisite for the completion of a whole alfabet? And if so, which set?\n\nDoes anyone know about similar typographic experiments?\n\n"

It’s got some interesting elements, however, like the rotated ampersand, which has become more of a p than I would have expected. I also like the rotation of h into y.\n\nAnyway, I’ll do some more research. Also on the ambigram; some of them look really attractive.\n\nThx!\n\n"
