It looks like Jim has lots of great ideas to grow exposure to the place.\n\nHere are some photos (alas, I have a crappy camera and was never a great photographer to begin with, but if you thumbnail them all, they don't look too bad...)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105015013im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hamilton_3634.jpg)\n\n",
