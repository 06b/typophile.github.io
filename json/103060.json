  "content": "I am doing a class project for Rolo candy, a counter top Point of Purchase display. I have not been able to find a \"Rolo\" font and I fear that because the product was created so long ago, that the lettering was hand drawn. Is there a Rolo font, or something very close to it. I would prefer free - I am a struggling student - free is always good!\n\n",
