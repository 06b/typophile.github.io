  "content": "Hello,  \nThe french singer Stromae uses amazing backgrounds and Tools of communication to promote and for his covers. Could you tell me what's the font he used ?  \nMaybe it could help : for his first album he used Century Gothic. It seems this font looks like the font i'm looking for.\n\nDo you have any idea of the name of this font ?\n\nThank you for your help !\n\nJ.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Stromae-Papaoutai.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425021659/http:/typophile.com/files/Stromae-Papaoutai.png) | 136.81 KB |\n\n",
