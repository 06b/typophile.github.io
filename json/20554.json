Especially when the little ® also is there on the right to make the optical illusion even more visible.\n\nIt feels like the actual word “Humili” optical really starts a little later then the most left part of the swash, and that you should make the centering position with this in mind.\n\nSee what I mean (my idea is to the right) - I think your original is somewhat off centered, optical that is.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/Humili1_6380_optical_4394.jpg)\n\n"

In some logos a tension can help create interest - but if you have a logo that isn’t readable enough it won’t work. It’s a balance. I think your on the wrong side o’ da fence there with this ‘readability sucks’ stuff. I guess if it’s a logo for a punk band it might be okay. Then your sentiment might match the intent of the logo… yeah: ” Doo doo dah dah legi-bi-lity, sucks sucks sucks..’ . What kind of designer are you? Maybe that punky kind?\n\n"

I would also try aligning the loop of the “l” with the upward stroke of the 1st “i” and moving the dots of the “i’s” to make the spaces either side of the “l” appear equal. A joining spur on the first stroke of the “u” might help, as might making it slightly wider.  \nVery cheerful looking logo.  \nTim\n\n"

I think you might want to address that. What does Humili mean? Is it about ‘Humility’ or is it a name, or a word, or a nonsense word like ‘Camry’?\n\nI wonder if it should be bigger & maybe higher in the circle.\n\nMostly what I wonder is if you are going to re-draw the whole thing to give it more flow & maybe more verve. All the tweaks have combined to give the logo a little bit of a fragmented appearance.\n\n"

The negative space of the “ili” combination bothers me a bit and the whole thing is sitting a little low in the circle—I know that might be intentional, but looks a little wrong—so move it up or down even more.

Maybe not.\n\nRemember that when we get to this really “picky” part, you know it’s really starting to come together.\n\nOkay, that was ten minutes of my professional advice—where’s my five bucks? :)\n\n"

It’s just not as tight as the rest of your letters.\n\nAs a personal Logo, this is definitely high-caliber!\n\n"
