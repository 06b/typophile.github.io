As you can imagine, this results in quite a few of these things. (It’s not just his company, it’s EVERY company he mentions or does business with.)\n\nMy question is what effect, if any, this has on readability and comprehension. I mean, it seems like “Microsoft Windows” is going to be easier to grasp than “Microsoft® Windows™”\n\nAny thoughts? Any studies or actual facts on this matter?\n\nThanks.\n\nsteve\n\n [‹ Contemporary typeface 'equivalents'](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218141020/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13868 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Arabic style text ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218141020/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14012 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

A valid readability concern though is the “textural distraction” that such marks have **before** the reader gets to that point of the text (sometimes from many lines before).\n\nAlso, a big issue in something like this is Familiarity, specifically here how quickly it’s gained with something jarring like this; maybe with a proper name the reader has to learn the bouma **anyway** so again it’s not so bad. Nobody really knows though... So I might work the aesthetics angle (as in, it’s ugly); and/or look for a font with discrete marks, to reduce the textural distraction.\n\nhhp\n\n"

My company’s policy is to bug only the first use of a mark on any given document.\n\nAs for marks not owned by the client, unless there’s some legal requirement between the owner of the marks and the client, they may be able to avoid bugging and just put a standard TM disclaimer on the doc “all TM’s not marked remain blah blah blah”.

In fact in this case if somebody has decided to read the thing, he’ll get through it before getting a headache. The question though becomes: do you want to make reading this thing so unpleasant than the reader just gives up?\n\n\\> Tell me more about this “textural distraction” thing\n\nBasically, when there’s enough of a “spike” in the texture or color of text, the eye wants to jump directly to it to quickly figure out what this “special” thing is. When this happens, the eye then has to go back to where it was; this is wasteful and tiring. When a paragraph is littered with such spikes, it become quite unpleasant to read.\n\n—\n\nBut here’s a possibly stronger argument:  \nSomebody reading such text might think it’s a parody.\n\nhhp\n\n"
