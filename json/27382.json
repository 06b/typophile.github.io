  "content": "I thought this might be an interesting (and fun?) exercise for all you symbologists(?) out there.\n\nI doodled 6 geometric patterns almost by accident. They can't be original and are probably all in a dingbat, crochet pattern book or cave painting somewhere. But anyway, because there are 6 of them and because they look a bit oriental i thought about associating 1 of the 6 elements in chinese philosophy to each of them, which are (in no particular order)...\n\n**earth - air - fire - water - metal - wood**\n\nAfter spending way too long pondering it I've still not totally made my mind up. Patterns within patterns, associations and abstractions etc...\n\nI'm curious to see if there will be any kind of consensus of opinion, or if you will all tell me to sod off and join an occult or theology forum.\n\nIf you are gonna bother posting your matches just don't look at other peoples answers first if you can help it.\n\nBTW each pattern is numbered, just in case you hadn't noticed.\n\nI find them very appealing for some reason and thought about making them available as 6 small canvases (6\"x6\" obviously) maybe screen printed. (hence the photoshop mockup) Anyones thoughts on the matter are most welcome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120730032709im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GeometricElements_5255.jpg)\n\n",

Earth: Reminds me of a cross which reminds me of religion which reminds me of home which reminds me of my mom which reminds me of mother earth.  \n2. Wood: rings of a tree  \n3. Air, the cross flows freely through the window  \n4. Metal: i see facets of a diamond  \n5. Fire: the way it flows outward  \n6. Water: ripples in the water.\n\n"

      "content": "Geometric Elements - The Result\n\nFirstly, thank you Tom, James, Tiffany and Simon for posting your choices.\n\nAfter you guys posted i persuaded 5 of my friends to give their opinions, plus me makes 10.\n\nI had hoped for a greater response, so the larger the sample group the clearer the consensus would be. Anyway, the results were...\n\n1: earth 3 / air 1 / fire 1 / water 0 / metal 5 / wood 0 (majority = metal)  \n2: earth 5 / air 0 / fire 1 / water 1 / metal 0 / wood 3 (majority = earth)  \n3: earth 1 / air 2 / fire 2 / water 1 / metal 1 / wood 3 (majority = wood)  \n4: earth 1 / air 3 / fire 3 / water 0 / metal 1 / wood 2 (majority = air/fire)  \n5: earth 0 / air 4 / fire 3 / water 2 / metal 0 / wood 1 (majority = air)  \n6: earth 0 / air 0 / fire 0 / water 6 / metal 3 / wood 1 (majority = water)\n\nIt's interesting to see, even with such a small sample group, how opinions still frequently corresponded on something (apparently) so abstract.\n\nHere is my choice...\n\n1: metal  \n2: earth  \n3: fire  \n4: wood  \n5: air  \n6: water\n\n...which i don't think i'm being too fascistic in sticking with, as it only breaks from the democratic consensus by switching 2 of the elements which were fairly closely drawn anyway :)\n\nAnd thank you James for the link to the \"Magician's Companion\". I don't think i can resist getting a copy now. I would like to know what symbol and element associations the master, Bill Whitcomb, would make.\n\nLook out for the symbols on a t-shirt in your neighbourhood sometime soon ;)\n\n"

Bill is crazy in a very very good way, as you will notice from his book, which is largely a compendium of archaic glyph systems.\n\nGood to see your take. I was highly influenced by the construction of the I Ching symbols and their portrayal of permeability and motion.\n\n"
