      "content": "James,  \nI have talked with Diane Burns at TechArt before -- they do a lot of Japanese work with InDesign. They also have some templates that provide access to Japanese features from the Roman build of InDesign available for download. I found this [article](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020012433/http:/www.techart.com/downloads/ID&WL-Part2.pdf) using Google that looks pretty useful and contains information about their templates.\n\n"
