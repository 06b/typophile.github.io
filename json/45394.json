It’s unusual for apps to suddenly just fail, but saying that MS Office recently bottomed out on my MacPro for no aparent reason. I’m not so surprised about that though and I can happily live without Office. Good riddance and welcome OpenOffice. If you did install anything (however small) remove it completely and try again.\n\nIf not, set up a new (admin) user on the machine and try to run FontLab logged in as the new user. If it works, then it’s your account that’s to blame. You might like to migrate your account if FontLab’s of utmost importance. Or painstakingly weedle-out the problem process ...\n\nIf that doesn’t work try killing non-essential processes and re-running it. You can see all processes in Terminal with ps -cax. Typing kill [process id] will terminate a process. You can’t do any real damage, but make sure you don’t have any important suff open when you do this.\n\nOther than that, if you’ve tried completely uninstalling/reinstalling FontLab, put it down as a mystery and leap for the OSX DVD. Bit drastic that though.\n\nLet us know how you go.\n\n"

And since I’m too busy to reset everything as it was in my previous account...I will just live with the double-id system, enjoying the rotating cube as I switch from one to the other... at least untill I am done with this thesis! :)\n\nI still have not figured out why this occurred, I remember clearly not installing anything in the past days...but I can finally get back to work, so thanks a lot again!  \na.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705162143im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/fontlab-solution_5849.jpg)\n\n"
