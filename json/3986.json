In the UK, not so readily identified with one person.   \nBut it was also about the \"gridularity\" of the layout, and you can see that in the design and layout of FTF v.1\n\n"

As for Lubalin his work was overly promoted in the design and typophile press, some of which was very good and some -- such as this example -- well, not so good. As for Nick's \"tight but not touching,\" we used to call examples of it \"kiss fit\" and joked that it came about because so many immigrants in New York, to whom English was a foreign language, were the ones composing copy on Staromats in subterranean darkrooms.\n\n"

      "content": "Mark -- It's a judgment, not a rule book call. Personally, I find it -- for want of a better term -- a five-minute solution: stack a lot of type and don't try to work out an image beyond that. You don't get better copy than No More War and I think it deserves more than old wood type reminiscent of the Civil War, not Vietnam. Graphic design is not arithmetic where 2 + 2 always equals 4. That's why we can have fun challenging solutions and learn at the same time. Good luck with your studies.\n\n"

      "content": "I must disagree Paul: What's interesting about this old wood type is the way that Lubalin has taken the hairline space that appears between serifs within letters -- most obviously the W of War -- and repeated it between letters, and vertically between lines. So this layout has some substance.   \n   \n(This is a feature that we find today in Font Bureau's Giza, and House Gothic, and these fonts are designed with the appropriate sidebars to make the effect.)   \n   \nSecondly, this is a poster for an Avant Garde magazine competition, and its branding is spot on, as it is designed in the \"Ultimate Lubalin\" packed and stacked style of that magazine.   \n   \nThirdly, this is an ad for a competition for anti-war posters, so Lubalin has wisely chosen not to make it an anti-war poster -- by confining himself to typography he has left the field of image and concept open to entrants' imaginations.   \n   \nCome on Lynn, put your thinking cap on, get your magnifying glass out, and tell us what your observations and opinions are -- don't let the old guys do all your work for you!\n\n"

      "content": "I also have to disagree with you Paul. The design in question is far from being a \"five-minute solution\" (even if it did take Herb five minutes). There is a lot more substance to the poster that what meets the eye. Firstly the ad/poster should be viewed in color, to fully appreciate it.   \n   \n ![nomorewar](http://web.archive.org/web/20091123164940im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/32695.jpg)   \n   \nThe layout is mimicking the American flag, with a black exclamation point at the end. For all its subtlety it is a very strong message.   \n   \nI agree with Nick that this was entirely in keeping with the Avant Garde magazine style, but I also think that the concept is present. Purely by emphasising the title of the competition, and by using the flag as the reference point Lubalin cleverly turned a call-for-entries poster into an anti-war poster.   \n   \nFor more on Herb Lubalin read Steven Heller's great [article.](http://web.archive.org/web/20091123164940/http:/www.itcfonts.com/ulc/article.asp?sec=ulc&issue=25.1.1&art=lubalin)\n\n"
