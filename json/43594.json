  "content": "It was mentioned that Sumner Stone has reduced his type prices (in another thread) and while on his site I note that he has offered some incredible offers, with site licences available for under $4 per computer (in volume).\n\nStone's library is not wide enough to be a complete collection on its own, but for such a small price it certainly is an effective top-up to Adobe's educational package.\n\n[http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417034454/http:/www.stonetypefoundry.com/ \"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/\")\n\n",
