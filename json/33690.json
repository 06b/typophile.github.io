  "content": "Hello,  \nInteresting in knowing what are your current favorites for contemporary (humanist, geometric, or gothic) san-serif typefaces might be. Usage could be anything, but primarily wondering what faces you've purchased in the last 3 or so years that you like and why.\n\nHere's mine:\n\n• Bryant Pro: Nice contemporary friendly face. Very clean on and off screen\n\n• Galaxy Polaris: Great workhorse for the studio, but a little limited. Basically our helvetica.\n\n• Stratum: Good ultra modern font, that straddles a nice line between ultra-tech but not overly so.\n\nFeel free to broaden the criteria for selection.\n\nCheers,  \nPeter.\n\n",

      "content": "I like, amongst others, in no particular order:\n\n- Klavika - Nice modern squarish sans  \n- Legato - Good for both text and larger use, very large family  \n- Fedra Sans - Especially nice when combined with Fedra Serif.  \n- Locator - No special reason.  \n- Engel - More friendly then Klavika.  \n- Sansa (+ Soft) - Just pure genius, imo. ;)  \n- Fresco Sans - Works well for body text (and then there's the serif that goes with it.)  \n- Quadraat Sans - Same as Fresco Sans.\n\nNot specifically typefaces I bought, but these came to mind right now. There are more that I like of course, but it's too late now to type more. :)\n\n"

Amplitude looks right in almost any setting — clean and readable at text sizes, vibrant and powerful in headlines. With an inktrapless version and italics on the way, soon you'll be able to use Amplitude for anything.\n\n**[FF Strada](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_strada_text/) and [FF Strada Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_strada_condensed/)** by [Albert Pinggera](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Albert%20Pinggera)  \nIts warm curves can make it friendly if it needs to be, but you can use it to set serious text too. Wonderfully readable at small sizes, unique detail when large. One of few contemporary typefaces drawn by an Italian.\n\n**[Maquette](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/arstype/maquette/)** by [Angus Shamal](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Angus%20Shamal)  \nA new large x-heighted alternative in the grotesque style of [Gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gotham) and [Proxima Nova](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123174807/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Proxima%20Nova).\n\n"

I also have a PDF of a spread from a book that uses Legato, but like Stephen I admit that might not be good enough.
