    "uncoated stock/gold sheen/letterpress inks"
  ],
  "content": "We have a letterpress sample in hand. Printed on uncoated stock(highly calibrated smooth stock), Inks used may be magenta or rubine red, or rhodamine. We can print but not match the sample. The sample has a smooth sheen when slightly tilted in light. As if there is gold uniformity sitting on the sample.\n\nHas anyone seen this kind of effect? If so please tell me what I need to do to enhance this smooth gold effect to be shown on our print. We have tried double hits/printing on transparent opaque inks and then print the above inks etc but cannot get the correct result. The pigments in the inks have this gold content but will not settle smoothly. Any help will be appreciated. This is very technical question please.\n\n",
