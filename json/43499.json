      "content": "Hi Arlo! Looking at it, looks very good, sort of gothic tinted with some serifs. I guess it will make a good text face.  \nI would say that the \"N\" needs the diagonal a little bit thinner. The \"W\" also needs thinner inner diagonals. I would enlarge the bowl of the \"b\" to the south a bit, and the \"q\" a bit to the north more or less the same fashion you would do for the \"b\".\n\nCool!\n\nCheers\n\nAndré\n\n"
