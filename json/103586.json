  "content": "Hello,  \nPoli is my second font, it's a 4 font complete sans serif family. It's a display typeface I guess. I wanted something elegant and crisp, something masculine and feminine at the same time. Poli inverses&nbsp;with some letters (c o d l p…)&nbsp;the classical thickness of the font (downstrokes are commonly down, upstrokes are up).  \nAs I'd like to release it - so that I can begin another project - I'd like to ask here some critical advice...  \nThank you,  \nSerge  \n [http://www.serge-paulus.be/docs/poli.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414114735/http:/www.serge-paulus.be/docs/poli.html \"http://www.serge-paulus.be/docs/poli.html\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [test\\_page\\_Poli2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414114735/http:/typophile.com/files/test_page_Poli2_2.png) | 46.28 KB |\n\n",
