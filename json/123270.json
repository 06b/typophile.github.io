It seems very sixties to me (I'm British) since while it's much older Gill Sans totally eclipsed it in the thirties and forties until it came back into fashion around then. The [bold extended weight](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420141420/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/grotesque-mt/bold-extended/) is perhaps the wildest, but it has lots of styles.\n\nStephen Coles' [list of Helvetica alternatives](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420141420/http:/fontfeed.com/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/), which I found it on, is probably worth checking through for other options. [Modernica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420141420/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/modernica/) is also rather lovable, though it lacks condensed/extended versions.\n\n"
