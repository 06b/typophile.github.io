  "content": "Hi all!\n\nYou created your Chrysanthi Unicode Monospace font by Font Creator, but when you try to test it in Scribus, you get excessive spacing.\n\nUnicode range coverage:  \nBasic Latin (complete in both fonts)  \nLatin-1 Supplement (complete in both fonts)  \nLatin Extended-A (complete in both fonts)  \nLatin Extended-B (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0) i  \n(proportional font only) These characters are not part of the Unicode Standard, and have been mapped to private use sectors 0234 – 0237. These characters are used in the Tsœxisca language. I have also mapped a capital and lower-case ezh to 0220 and 0221, respectively.\n\nIPA Extensions (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0)  \nSpacing Modifier Letters (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0)  \nCombining Diacritics (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0) ii\n\n(proportional font only) Because this is not a fixed width font, the combining marks will not line up precisely with all characters. I have tried to make them line up as well as possible with as many characters as possible.\n\nGreek (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0) iii  \n(proportional font only) Missing Variant Letter Forms, Archaic Letters, Coptic-unique letters, and Additions subsets [03D0-03F3]\n\nCyrillic (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace for 5.0)  \nCyrillic Supplement (complete in monospace for 5.0)  \nArmenian (complete in both fonts)  \nHebrew (incomplete in proportional, complete in monospace) \\* iv  \n(proportional font only) Missing Cantillation Marks subset [0590-05AF]\n\nArabic (experiencing technical difficulties in proportional, complete in monospace) \\* v  \n(proportional font only) Missing 060C, 0653, 0654, 0655, 066C, 0680-06FE.
