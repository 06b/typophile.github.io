  "content": "I'm currently trying to figure out whether H&J works with the CJK composer in Adobe InDesign. I have the Chinese version of InDesign CS6, it seems quite problematic when I try to layout CJK text which has a few words in English inside; wondering if H&J in CJK typography is supported by InDesign at all?!\n\nI understand CJK composer works quite differently in InDesign — it uses the monospaced character grid system to place the glyphs. The spacing between Chinese characters (Kanji) cannot be less than zero, and the space between Chinese characters and punctuation marks & Latin letters are done by Mojikumi (compressing the punctuation marks) instead of kerning. And when set justified, you wouldn't see any \\*kerning\\* value of specific glyphs even if their location is shifted/changed for optimal spacing, as opposed to the default Adobe paragraph/single line composer where in the character panel these kerning values are shown/indicated.\n\nDoes anyone on this forum have any idea as to this issue? I appreciate any kind of suggestion and sources of information; and if the above definition is accurate.\n\n",
