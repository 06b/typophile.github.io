  "content": "Looking for a Sans Serif typeface which will be used for a Gardens identity in South East Asia.\n\nThe object of the typography is to reflect:  \n• Clarity (simplicity) for use throughout signage (there will be some areas of the site where the type will be used at a size of three meters in height).  \n• Intrigue through organic elements when used at a interpretative level (to subtly reference the concept of the gardens/plant forms – rounded tips, organic flourishes etc).  \n• Large variation (from thin to bold/black) with the possibility of a slab serif relative; although this is not a requirement.  \n• The type should balance well against the languages of the far east, notably Chinese/Mandarin, Japanese, Malay (all signage will be set in a minimum to two languages)\n\nI have trailed through numerous type foundries sites to find solutions. One suggestion was Stag Sans although this typeface is primarily used in an editorial context ( [http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/StagSans/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201034457/http:/vllg.com/Schwartzco/StagSans/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/StagSans/mudTyper+Weights/\")).\n\nThe other option is Vista Sans (Émigré). Vista has the relevant ‘organic elements’ although feels slightly unrefined and clumsy when used at large type sizes; notably signage.\n\nIt would be great if the family had variations which varied from simplicity (singage) to 'creative' (interpretation/identity).\n\nAny ideas? Help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks D.\n\n",
