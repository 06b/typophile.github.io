The general consensus reached was that the lettering was hand lettered, though a couple of faces (including one of mine) were suggested as the basis of approximating the 'look and feel' of the lettering.\n\nThis is the specimen that was posted in 2007:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416055311im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Svengalis_3729_3937.jpg)\n\nHere is my progress to date at trying to recreate it as a font. So far I've worked on the lower case, or 'small capitals':\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416055311im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Svengali_5482.png)\n\nI'd be pleased to hear suggestions and feedback on this project so far,\n\nPaul.\n\n",

      "content": "This is awesome! The _R_ is fantastic. I'd love to see the tail of the _R_ reach just _a little_ past the baseline (subtly - only the way a bowl would overshoot). Right now it just feels a touch higher than it should be, like it's trying to balance on the stem. Regardless, I think it's the best of the bunch. Other favorites are the _U_, _J_, and _K_. Looking forward to the release.\n\n"
