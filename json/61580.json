But I'm hoping to get some suggestions regarding a sans to pair with as an additional text face. I don't care for any of the Gotham's set small... Thanks so much for your input!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Mario,\n\nI am hesitant to talk about, let alone recommend, my own font, but may I enquire why not one of the two you mention, then? I think not describing this is preventing people from being able to help you further.\n\nGraphik and Neutral are, quite similar, and simultaneously very very different.\n\nWe've obviously used Neutral from time to time, and currently we are using Graphik quite a lot. As a pure text face, both work nicely. I personally prefer Neutral's wider spacing and Basel\\*-like quiet in small and smaller sizes, but if there's a chance you'll use this sans in large sizes too, you should consider Graphik which is just so much Zurich\\*-style cleaner, crisper and more, eh, graphic (May I note that both faces get along astonishingly well with each other if you restrict one to very large, and one to very small sizes).\n\n\\* the Schools, not typefaces.\n\nBest  \nKai\n\n"
