If you just want to talk about the type related things you are working on / thinking about without the intent of starting a discussion thread, Typophile blogs might just be your thing.\n\nLastly, if you don't like the blogs here, don't read them. You certainly don't have to read them to participate in the forums.\n\n"

Many of them are quite boring, but some draw readerships in the thousands. John Nack of Adobe is one I often visit. (Also I seldom missed Thom Phinney when he was there).\n\nA web page is a bit more work to get something posted. A blog takes the technical work out of it, and you only have to worry about content.\n\nMostly, you gain attention to your blog through providing good content, getting some buzz, and hopefully some people posting links to it.\n\nDon\n\n"

And anyone who wants a blog should do that – somewhere that blogs are meant to be set up, like your own server or an existing hosting service. Then at least the rest of the Web will know they’re there and can subscribe via RSS, and ownership won’t be at issue. (At the very least, you can wade through the endless terms of use of hosting sites, or just host your own. Where are the terms of use for blog hosting at Typophile? Found those yet, Christian?)\n\n"
