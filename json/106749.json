  "content": "I am really struggling with the kerning on this logo and this is the best I have been able to do. I would appreciate any help or suggestions to get the spacing perfect optically. I think I got the rino part of Marino. The M seems a little off from the a, but closing it up really messes the whole thing, so I just wanted to see if it was all in my head or not. Also, is the Gr part of Greg looking off to anyone.\n\nPS: I have not done much fine tuned logo work so I dont have much experience to count on. Any pointers are very appreciated.\n\nAmrita\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MarinoLogoforreview.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419180808/http:/typophile.com/files/MarinoLogoforreview.pdf) | 279.32 KB |\n\n",
