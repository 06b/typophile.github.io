The currently existing stand out (once again) too much - formally, aesthetically and ideologically - from the rest of the project. In short: they don't fit into your Father's calligraphy, they destroy it. Take a look at Renaissance numerals, maybe at Garamond...\n\n"

So, He knows very well that which type of dot is used in Nastalique font.\n\neven then I will discuss this matter with my father...!  \nThanks again...!\n\n"
