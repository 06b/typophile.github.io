In the 1990s ITC commissioned several designers to design Cyrillics for their library. Some typefaces were released, but others were not, but that’s another story. According to various sources ITC American Typewriter was designed by Victor Kharyk. I could not find a foundry selling it, but maybe you have more luck than I had.\n\n"
