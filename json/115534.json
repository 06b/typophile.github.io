      "content": "Hi Ryuk, I like your choices. Vafle and Purista both seem good for the letter-forms, but when comparing them with the unedited image, is see Vafle as a heavier weight, while Purista Medium seems pretty close. The best width for a match is tricky because of the slant. To my eye the regular width seems closer than a compressed. A font editor could produce an almost perfect match by sloping Purista Medium to the left by the same amount that Purista Medium Italic is sloped to the right.  \nDon\n\n"
