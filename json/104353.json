Found this example on p136 of the Solotype catalog.\n\nAccording to the Solopedia - [http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-l.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803001656/http:/abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-l.htm \"http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/solopedia-l.htm\") - this font is a match for something called 'Bulldog' I cant find this anywhere, wondering if anyone had another similar typeface?\n\nAs always, may thanks for any assistance...\n\nM\n\n",

The weight of the strokes and serifs for all three is a little lighter than shown in the Solocat image. Jaspert was unable to find a full character set for any of the three.  \nAs for the Solocat entry, the relative thickness is explained by the source. Dan X. Solo scoured the U.S. for used typefaces. The impression of such typefaces could be expected to be heavier than the carefully controlled impression of new type in a foundry's specimen, or even for the material provided to Jaspert.  \nDon\n\n"

Benton, based on a Bodoni model, but with the peculiarity found in a number of modernistic types of making the thicks and thins meet at an angle. This is especially noticeable in the O and the S. The g and y have cursive tails. The italic is the roman inclined, except for a, which has a flat-foot serif, v and w. There are three weights, the light being the colour of a normal book type.\"  \nDon\n\n"

It is an adaptation of Bodoni (the working title was Modern Bodoni), and many of the characters are identical. Only g and y are basically different; otherwise the distinction is in the more abrupt transition from thick to thin strokes in this series. In this respect, Ultra Bodoni has more affinity to Louvaine than to the other Bodoni weights. The three weights of Louvaine correspond to Bodoni Book, regular, and Bold. This series did not last long enough to appear in the 1934 ATF specimen book, the next complete one after its introduction. \"  \nYes, McGrew has full character sets.  \nDon\n\n"
