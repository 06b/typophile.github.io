My point is that no professional designer would ever resort to these pirate tactics... or maybe i am just blue-eyed - so if an amateur type aficionado steals your type, copies it from a friend etc. no sales are lost - he wouldn’t buy any fonts to begin with.

ATF and metal foundries didn’t have online previewers, they had specimen books. We have cultivated good customer relationships where a regular customer can try out fonts upon request. We try to listen to our customers. Most people who offer the loudest criticisms are rarely customers, but people who feel a sense of righteousness about how they think things should be.

I only pointed out that if the foundries find that the previews generate extra business, it might be worth overlooking piracy. This isn’t a radical new idea—the software and fashion industries have been playing these kinds of games for ages.\n\nAs for my own familiarity with the seedier side of the internet, I don’t claim to be a saint, and I’m won’t insult you by offering excuses for my idealogical promiscuities.\n\n"

I appreciate the candor.  \n I would think piracy could be overlooked if the balance of extra business outweighed the prominence a font would find throughout various “sharing” sites and the ease of finding a font once it is propagated. Sadly I think the scales are tipped in the favor of piracy reducing more sales than little or no pdf/flash specimens would reduce sales. I don’t have statistical evidence to back this up, but once a font is released, it tends to sell better when it has not been “shared” vs. font sales that have had piracy right after release. Contrary to a common rationalization, the “non consensual trial version” encouraging sales is a rarity. On the upside (with some trepidation) finding pirated fonts used in major ad campaigns can be a windfall if pursued. That brings up litigation as a revenue source for foundries as a big topic that could be discussed. Not online however :^)\n\n"

You can either a) make it hard for everyone, including your paying customer to use your product or b) just focus on your paying customers and not worry about some kid in Russia.\n\nIt’s really up to each foundry, and there’s no ’right’ answer necessarily.\n\n“It’s like when a fan of a band asks the band to sign a bootleg and burns copies of their music for all of their friends, is it flattering or insulting?”\n\nIt depends on the band.

No one does.\n\nDoes sharing an MP3 directly deny the RIAA income? Or does it directly increase it? It’s next to impossible to accurately measure this and in a lot of cases, it’s probably a wash. Just the times-a-changin.\n\nI’m just speaking for myself, but I’m through with DRMed music. It’s a huge pain. I am more than willing to pay for music and will gladly do so when it’s DRM free (thank goodness for eMusic and Amazon!)\n\nAs for fonts, as a designer, I make a living doing commercial work, so will always pay for fonts...provided I can use them without jumping through hoops (in which case I just won’t use that font and go on to the next foundry).

If foundries want to make a meaningful dent in piracy, making _very_ low cost fonts easily available to design students and schools is the only way to go. Too many students—at least here in the states—can’t even afford textbooks after they’re done paying tuition and room and board, much less software and fonts. I can tell you firsthand that piracy is taught as a necessary evil in some design programs. And when a young designer gets out of school, tens-of-thousands of dollars in debt, and finds that a good job at a good firm that pays less than he or she could make working in retail management, you can bet those old pirate fonts are going into the freelance jobs that keep the student loan companies happy.\n\nThis is why I keep bringing up ideas about very low-cost font licensing for students. For some of them, the difference between using a free font or using a pirated font is the difference between getting a scholarship or not going back to school next fall. Right now tuition is skyrocking, the value of the dollar is dropping like a rock, easy credit is fading, federal and local student aid is getting slashed, and type vendors need to get proactive. Because if you think font piracy is bad now, just wait until a generation of designers who were taught to pirate fonts is running the design industry.\n\n"

Basically, Photofont WebReady will convert an outline font into a bitmap font of a chosen size and then put this bitmap font inside of a Flash file that will include ActionScript that will make this bitmap font work as if it was regular Flash text.\n\nNext week, we will publish a new version of the photofont.com website that will demostrate the technology in use. We hope that some folks who are afraid that fonts can be extracted from Flash files may consider switching to embedded web photofonts for preview purposes.\n\nI’d like to add that — unlike some other solutions on the market — Photofont WebReady will respect the embedding bits in OpenType and TrueType fonts, and will not allow a user to convert a font into an outline Flash font if the embedding bits don’t allow that.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

No argument there.\n\n“What happened? The vast majority downloaded it for free. I am not sure exactly what that means except they probably won’t try it again.”\n\nI dunno. 6 million dollars sounds worthy of doing it again.\n\nBut still, it’s the same gap in logic. Just because half downloaded for free does not mean they lost half of their sales.\n\nA bunch of 14 year olds designing CD covers for their mix CDs using a font from a Russian download site aren’t necessarily a lost sale to the font foundry. This is not excusing them from doing it, just that, IMHO, it doesn’t make a lot of sense for a font foundry to worry about that particular demographic at the expense of their typical paying customer.\n\n"

Sales, unlikely if they took the first ones for free, the sense of “entitlement” and ease of download would be the already established pattern. 2/3 of the radiohead “fans” didn’t even pay 1¢. That was an amazing experiment and in the end likely a worthwhile one. The mindset for most is that all digital IP can and should be free. The harsh reality comes back when they want to make a living with their own IP and find all of their peers hold no value for their music, fonts or graphic design.\n\nIf school instructors are teaching piracy as professional practice, there is a serious problem that will take a major shift to overcome. I went through design school during the transition from analog to digital. No one complained (well, everyone complains) about having to buy press-type at the expense of beer money (both were somehow managed) where now buying fonts is seen as a luxury as opposed to the “art supply” that it is (with a shelf life of...their career).\n\n"

Everyone in the music business knows that the money is no longer in CD sales - it’s in appearances and merchandise, etc… Why is that? Because of downloading. The only catalogue that is making money at EMI/Capitol is reissues. So much for new artists.\n\nI recently had a song released by a major band and I made some decent money. Why? Because the record label is legally required to send me royalties ON THE COPIES THEY SELL. Did I need the extra exposure of downloaded versions of that song? Not at all - the artists who recorded it sell in the millions every time out.\n\nFor all you who are cheering downloading bringing on the demise of the major labels, consider the new business model. Clear Channel has purchased Madonna’s entire career for the next five years. Concerts, merchandise, records, etc…\n\nLet’s see - they own a plethora of radio stations in America - I wonder what they’re going to play on those stations?\n\nThere are consequences all down the line when artists are devalued.\n\npbc\n\n"

Not at all - the artists who recorded it sell in the millions every time out.”\n\nIndeed...the bands that protest the loudest tend to be the ones that benefit most from the current system. Which is understandable. Band like Metallica thrive off of the current music label system.\n\nBut your songs already sells millions. Do you think ’sharing’ of those songs really has hurt those sales? Or perhaps you’ve already hit the saturation mark. As a teen, we’d swap CDs by copying them to tape for each other. This was the norm. Did we cost the bands sales? No. We were broke. I think there’s a belief (or perhaps a wish) that if there was only some way to technically prevent copying (which there isn’t) all of these ’copies’ would immediately translate into sales. Some would. Many wouldn’t.\n\n“There are consequences all down the line when artists are devalued.”\n\nI think Madonna and Metallica are overvalued to begin with. BTW, this is not a ’new’ model. This is how the industry has been working since the 50s. Control the market, and feed the masses a select menu of easily marketable consumables. The market hates diversity.\n\n“If a foundry does a font promotion, by giving away a font free for a limited time, or by issuing a font on a collection CD (eg with Indie Fonts), then that font is more likely to end up on a pirate site.”\n\nIs that bad? Good? Neither?\n\nMaybe I’m naive...do a huge number of professional designers get fonts from Russian pirate sites?\n\n"
