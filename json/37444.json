By setting up my PDF to be reverse, I got my letter-forms in black on transparent. The resolution is insane! It's also very handy for comparing shapes non-digitally, because I can lay multiple transparent sheets over each other.\n\nAnyone tried this or have any other ways to proof that others might want to know about?\n\n",

      "content": "Yeah I'm laying them on a lightboard and using a loupe if I'm checking small text. The film is kind of expensive, but since we do it by the roll we always end up with less than a full broadsheet of film left, which I've started using for my proofs rather than throwing it out. Our laser printers at work suck, and so does the one I have at home, so this is really my only high quality hardproof option.\n\n"
