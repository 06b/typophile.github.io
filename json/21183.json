      "content": "I do not know much about the history of Times New Roman. There seems to be some dispute about how it was really designed, and how much of a design role Morison really played in it. There were certainly many other people in and out of Monotype who were involved on the periphery, at the very least.\n\nTimes, from Linotype, is Times New Roman as it was actually used by the London Times newspaper, if I recall correctly. Monotype made the design, but the newspaper was set using Linotype machines. So Linotype had to adapt the design for its machinery. Since the 1930s, there has been some sort of agreement to its distribution. \"Times New Roman\" is a Monotype trademark, \"Times\" a Linotype one.\n\nWalter Tracy, at Linotype's English office, drew Times Europa later, in the 1960s. This was the typeface that replaced Times New Roman/Times at the Times of London then. But even this face is history by now. The Times of London uses yet another face today for its pages.\n\nThe Monotype Times New Roman, in metal, was a superb book face. The Encyclopaedia Brittanica is a marvelous example of its possibilities.\n\n"

      "content": "The origin of Times New Roman is something of a typographic mystery. What I remember reading:\n\nVersion 1. Morrison sketched out key characters and Victor Lardent carried out his instructions (Morrison version).\n\nVersion 2. Morrison had the general idea of putting Perpetua style serifs on Monotype Plantin (designed before Morrison's arrival at Monotype.) But the whole execution of the concept was Lardent's. (Revisionist version by those who did new edition of Morrison's essays.)\n\nVersion 3: It was originally drawn by an American, [Starling Burgess](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018064906/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Starling%20Burgess), and this fact was covered up. --Mike Parker's version in Printing History 31/32 (1994), pp. 52–108. Mike Parker was typography manager at Merganthaler Linotype and then founder of Bitstream. I believe he mentions the issue in his interview at [www.typeradio.org/loudblog/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018064906/http:/www.typeradio.org/loudblog/ \"www.typeradio.org/loudblog/\"). I see he will be at TypeCon, so if you are attending you can ask him further yourself.\n\n"
