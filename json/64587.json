  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI’ve been designing a font for the 3D environment, where each letterform is able to stand alone, up right in the 3D; even the lowercase letters, numbers, question marks etc.\n\nIt's largely inspired by engineering and building rather than traditional font concepts  \n(i.e. Readability, onscreen adaptability etc.) BUT I have not used massive slab serifs or made overly angular/sharp corners.\n\nI'd love to know what you guys think of it. As I'm more of a typographer than a type designer. . .\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194244im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test-1_4226.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194244im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test-2_6728.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317194244im_/http:/typophile.com/files/test-3_5405.jpg)\n\nany feedback / help would be great. . . cheers.\n\n",
