      "content": "It's an old wood typeface. The one on the sample matches a version from the film font days called Winchester. The closest match I can find is Dennis Ortiz-Lopez's [OL Smokler](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203603/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/ol-smokler/). There are some differences, but it's basically the same. I think he created the lowercase, which didn't exist in the original.\n\n"

As Mark mentions, OL Smokler is just one digital interpretation of this wood type. This album art likely used phototype, such as Winchester or Morgan No. 25.\n\n"
