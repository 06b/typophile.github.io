I’m sure any similarity is unintentional, as Vista Slab comes directly from the very original Vista Sans, but the Slab could be considered a contemporary [Officina](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624020459/http:/typophile.com/wiki/ITC%252BOfficina).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624020459im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vista-slab_6359.png)\n\nVista Slab\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624020459im_/http:/typophile.com/files/officina_3722.png)\n\nITC Officina\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Coles for your observation. I would have not readily correlated a Officina and Vista slab. Nice catch.\n\nPersonally, looking at the two designs here, I would say that Officina is a little bit more well thought out in terms of low-res printing and reader cognition. Notice the inktraps on the r, a, u, and the p. Also, the diacritics seem a little bit more friendly to the designer short on vertical space. Vista Slab looks more like a stylistic expansion as opposed to a learned industrial-strength compact multi-use type system. (Of course, I don’t know what I’m talking about, but anyway)\n\nNevertheless, I’m totally digging it. You like the lowercase italic g, I love the lowercase italic x and k.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you Mickey & Stephen for your accurate comments. I’m fully agreed.  \nThe comparison with Officina is not a surprise because Vista Sans was inspired by [Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624020459/http:/www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=200) shapes - like Meta - and when I added serifs to Vista Sans, I kept in mind Officina but I deliberately didnt oserve it and tried - in vain - to forget it.\n\n"
