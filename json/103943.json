      "content": "Well, I admit it's impossible to be sure. But note the following:  \n- That's actually what a -simplified- curve/curve trap looks like. It's an approach favored by some people (including Carter AFAICT) even for straight/straight traps, for its simple elegance.  \n- Many people put shears at the ends of their traps, especially when they [have to] go too deep.  \n- When I look at the darkness of that area, it seems a bit too light to me, which means the curves _have_ been pulled in (like you would do when trapping).  \n- That \"B\" seems to have gentle thorns (the inverse of a trap) so it seems to be attuned to output degradation (where trapping is most relevant). But I admit that could just be a stylistic thing.\n\nHere's a detail of the Ջ in Ernestine:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718201047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/twotraps_4091.gif)\n  \nAlthough we didn't use shears, note how the curve/curve and curve/straight traps are visibly lightening things up.\n\n--\n\nIf it _is_ filled-in, the reason is probably to avoid super-sharp corners, since they can cause rendering problems. I think Doyald Young recommended that any corner sharper than 30 degrees should have such a shear.\n\nIt would be very helpful to see other glyphs, like the Bold \"v\".\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the answers. The \"B\" in the picture above is from Microsoft's Candara font. I've checked the \"V\" of the regular and bold version of Candara, and their corners are filled too.\n\nI want to add this corner filler thing to my non-Latin font. I don't know how large the fill should be, so i tried to google for more information. Unfortunatelly I don't know what this thing is called among typographers. Perhaps to determine the size of the filler, I'll just look and compare the filler in the professionally made fonts.\n\n"

      "content": "If you look at Candara's \"v\" you will see a clear trap there, even in the Regular. Now look at the \"k\": no shears on those sharp corners... Plus, like I said, Candara even has thorns. So since it's a very \"pointy\" design with at least some trapping, I think the shear in the \"B\" is a classic way to finish off a trap (which might be done to avoid it going too deep). But we can always ask Gary. :-)\n\nBTW whether you want to add a shear to avoid pointiness or not, the Trapping Flower can do it: once you decide how big you want the shear to be (see below) you can figure out which measurement ring it should fall on, and use that ring as the cutoff for all the inside corners. You can even use the Flower to make thorns BTW - in which case it would be a rose... ;-)\n\nTo decide the size of your shear: look at some respectable fonts, but do mind the point size range they're intended for, since fonts for display will have smaller shears than fonts for small text.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "This is best thought of not as an angle that is filled in but as a crotch in which the confluence of two curves or diagonals is spread apart a little. The purpose is, as Frode says, to lighten the join and stop the area becoming too dark where the bowl or stems come together.\n\n[Ink] Trapping is something very particular, which I don't think applies in this case. The purpose of an ink trap is, as the term suggests, to capture ink during printing. It is a special treatment of an internal angle designed to compensate for the phenomenon of inkspread that would otherwise distort the letter shape at this point. As such, ink traps are properly designed relative to output technologies. They are related to but technically distinct from two other phenomenon: similar feature in designs for phototypesetting that compensate for photomechanical softening of corners, and more general, output-independent optical compensations of the kind used in Candara and many other designs.\n\nThis illustration shows how this type of construction enables one to open up the crotch while maintaining the shape of the curves further out. The same curves without the 'spreader' segment is in the background layer.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718201047im_/http:/typophile.com/files/crotch_5458.png)\n\n"
