Something scripty that looks handwritten, but still very clean and readable. Also, it’s essential that the letters connect, because the text itself will be the word “Connect.” Thanks in advance!\n\nMatt\n\nEdit: Nevermind... since I know exactly what I’m going for I think I’m going to roll my own. Let me know if you want to see the end result.\n\n",

It is in a very similar style and is built to connect, as well as use stylistic alternates by default, so your 2 n’s would be different.\n\nMight save you some trouble; have you made a connecting handwriting typeface before? ;)\n\n"
