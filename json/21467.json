      "content": "While the term “legend” seems heroic, it is also pretty murky as well.\n\nTwo questions. What specific geographic region and cultural influence does the type need to reference? What time period does the type need to invoke?\n\nAnswers to both of those questions will narrow down the field of obvious choices to a mere few.\n\nIf the client wants something more non-specific which can work for a variety of time periods and cultural themes, you might consider a good all-caps titling font. Adobe Garamond, Perpetua, Utopia and Goudy Old Style are a few that come to mind.\n\nI would suggest Trajan or Trajan Pro. It is a very attractive typeface. But it has been terribly overused for the past decade, especially on movie poster titles.\n\n"

It is a mélange of ancient inscriptional writing, with visual references to Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, medieval and even a bit of ancient Greek and roman letterforms. It is an all caps font, so there are alternates for every letter in the lowercase position, plus there are a number of alternate letter forms and ligatures [hidden](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706082640/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-yule/heavy/charmap.html) in the font. The heavy weight has an admittadly [Neuland](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706082640/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=neuland) feel, which might also work well for you.\n\nOr maybe [Numismatic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706082640/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/numismatic.html).
