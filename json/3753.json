It would be a great help.   \n   \nI launched MT without enough feedback testing the last time, so this revision is an effort to fix the things that went wrong.   \n   \nHere's the latest draft of the PR I'm preparing for the new launch. Anyone who has experience in writing press releases is welcome to critique it as well:   \n   \nMean Tangerine announces a new, improved font-navigation design. Advantages over the previous design: consolidated font presentation, comparison shopping, extensive typeface previews, and one-click purchasing.   \n   \nBuilding on its initial launch of 82 pixel fonts, Mean Tangerine also proudly announces an additional 18 fonts to its library.
