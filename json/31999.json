  "content": "I was wondering if one of you could recommend a professional calligrapher for an illustration I hope to commission. This will be for silkscreened apparel. I would like to have the same Spencerian style one sees applied to birds, fruit, feathers, etc. applied to a more modern subject such as a tank, bomber, grenade, etc. The effect is intended to be ironic…a beautifully human and fragile depiction of an instrument of death.\n\nI am attaching an image to give you some idea of what I hope to emulate. It is a meager example of the craft, but all I have currently available.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ornament.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20070318050636/http:/typophile.com/files/ornament_0.jpg) | 48.81 KB |\n\n",

Link below. A true spencerian ornament will be much more elegant, and not as bold and graphic. So you may not want a true Spencerian treatment if you’re wanting to match your sample…\n\n[Elvis Swift on AltPick.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070318050636/http:/altpick.com/members.php?id=17873)\n\n"
