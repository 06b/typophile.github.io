I think kos is referring to [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129054731/http:/www.logotypes.ru/gif.get?gif=Oakley%5Flogo2), which looks to be based on [the previous one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129054731/http:/www.logotypes.ru/gif.get?gif=Oakley%5Flogo).\n\nEdit: those links should work if you paste them into a new browser.\n\n"
