      "content": "No worries, I'm not angry. It's a very sensitive subject around here. There are a lot of type designers that feel piracy and similar practices have destroyed a once strong industry. Mentioning an act of copying work would be considered along those lines and it's frowned at here. We're here to teach and inform people of the beautiful world that typography is. And how to enjoy using it without resorting to pilfering it. If you want to learn more about type, you've come to the right place.\n\nAs for your dilemma, I can only suggest purchasing a version of Avant Garde that has alternatives. You'll need a program like Illustrator or InDesign with a glyphs palette (found under windows\\> type\\> glyphs). There you'll find the alternative A you are desperate to use. There should be several other alternatives to there letters there as well.\n\n"

That _would_ be unethical and illegal, but if I understand correctly Jorge just needs to modify a few letters for a job he's working on. Designers tweak and modify letters all the time when creating logos, for example, and that's no crime.\n\n"
