Though the bold version of Super Grotesk was used, its smaller round counters were not--those were enlarged to maintain an even stroke width. The ascender on the d was also truncated to the height of the i.\n\nJoancarles Casasín--the designer of AdiNeue--mentions the \"100% geometrical build\" and the atypical s at the link above.\n\n"
