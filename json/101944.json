My whole future is dependent on my GRE score, which in turn relies on me switching all prep materials into this test font for greater familiarity.\n\nI tried many Serif fonts with Microsoft Word, but to my eyes, they all seem a little chubbier and shorter than this one. I don't know if this has to do with screen resolution or anything else.\n\nThank you again. You'll be my hero.\n\nEric\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150110014044im_/http:/typophile.com/files/NEED%20FONT_6349.jpg)\n\n",
