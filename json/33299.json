  "content": "Futura is one of my trusty most favorite typefaces. However, the question mark makes me want to throw up (crazy backward S). I work in exhibition design and frequently use question marks at large sizes as part of headlines etc. Museums like exhibits that pose questions to visitors. Does anyone know of a good substitute of alternate character? I don't know any font design program or I would design my own.\n\n",
