Even better would be if you could create subsets of fonts to be displayed in the font menu, rather than every font installed.\n\nThere's actually a system-wide facility for this on Mac OS X (\"collections\"), but it's only accessible in apps that use the system font picker (the Fonts window in Cocoa apps).\n\n"
