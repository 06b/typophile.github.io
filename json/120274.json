But, George, Opti \"borrowed\" lots of other foundries fonts and gave them new names. They've been out of business for years. We always caution against using an Opti font commercially.\n\n"

But there is no legitimate way to acquire or use an OPTI font.  \nKevin's suggestion of Liberation could work for making a reasonable facsimile.  \nDon\n\n"
