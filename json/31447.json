Not Margaret, not Greet, but really Greta. We would like to photograph her in our studio, for which we offer a modest fee: cover the costs of transportation to The Hague, NL\\*; offer 2 books of choice, and 2 t-shirts of choice from our collection. Additionally you’ll get a free license of our upcoming font Greta.\n\nPlease let Greta know.\n\nHow to proceed: please contact peter at typotheque dot com, and send your ID with the full name. We’ll then plan the details.\n\n\\* only available for European travel\n\nSee also:  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/site/font\\_in\\_development.php?id=54/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102222256/http:/www.typotheque.com/site/font_in_development.php?id=54/)  \n [http://www.typotheque.com/news/newspaper\\_typeface\\_greta/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102222256/http:/www.typotheque.com/news/newspaper_typeface_greta/)\n\n [‹ Korean type faces needed](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102222256/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33770 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Galaxy Polaris ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102222256/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33773 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
