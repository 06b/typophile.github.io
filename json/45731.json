There are not really ample tools available (Helvetica, the film, was a great start) to help with creating interest in the subject. There are some great websites (here, for instance) and youtube has some wonderful videos, but are there any other films about typography? Tools? If there are any typographers in the Los Angeles area, please drop by our class.\n\n",

      "content": "I have taught typography for four years now and participated in the TypeCon education forum last year. Most of what I personally observed is a common frustration due to the fact that reading skills are no longer emphasized, especially in art schools, and that there are few great models for typographic inspiration.\n\nHere's what I mean; growing up I was surrounded by the American Heritage series of literature. Judging from how worn the books are I would have to say that I spent a long, long time looking at these beautifully crafted books. Typographically, I now know, I got my \"style\" from these sensitively designed volumes. So, I never had to \"learn\" how to set type. I had so much good typographic form memorized that by the time I got out of school it just came naturally. I am not sure that these great type models are common anymore–students grow up with the internet and video games, not gorgeous text.\n\nGo to Typecon, the education forum is great.\n\n"

Could it be that typography isn't subject to a single vision? I've always felt that the best designs came from people who enjoyed reading, but perhaps that doesn't leave enough room for the people who prefer \"just looking.\"\n\n"

Packaging has a crammed set of criteria and too many cooks but a real opportunity as well. Motion typography or new media brings a whole nother thing. We cannot keep teaching typography as if we were still doing early 20th Century books only. If typography teachers don't open their eyes to todays world, today's young students will close their eyes completely to typography.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

To clarify the youtube reference, there are a few videos that deal with the subject of typopgraphy. It's not easy subject to teach. Most people and students think of it as picking a font and it is hopefully way beyond that concept. I agree with the totally mesmerizing Nancy Sharon Collins (whose work is amazing) that it might be generational. I too grew up with literature, books, magazines and films that revealed some great hint of the power of typography. Teaching such an esoteric subject to students today, I am always searching for media, books, websites, etc., that will inform, entertain and educate students. Ironically, the book that we provide students with is a history of typography, and frankly, not easy to read. I am often doubtful that knowing what a rebus is will help students better understand typography.  \nSearching our own past for the sources of inspiration while enjoyable is unfortunately not always pertinent to methods required and needed today. You are right, these students have been raised to \"look\", especially at computer monitors, television and movies. We need to speak a common language, find inspiration in the work of others anywhere, anyway we can.\n\n"

      "content": "I think I've been misunderstood. At a very basic level, typography is the visually aesthetic portion of communicating with the written word; though some would say, handwriting should be ignored. But the machines we use to form the written word have moved in so many diverse ways I'd be prone to include handwriting as well -- why not? Letters generated by machine can now rival letters generated by hand, for good & ill.\n\nHowever, handwriting is just a wrinkle. The problem is one of \\*good\\* typography, and I think what's at play here is books are no longer the gold standard. We're letting all our currencies float. But that's hard to teach. If we generally let any form of written word in the door, what's \\*good\\* will depend on context; on purpose. Grunge is good only if your purpose is to shake people up, not if your purpose is to communicate any other idea. Are typographers then required to defend their purposes? I'd think so. Perhaps that is the other part of the teaching problem.\n\n"

      "content": "I taught typography for 4 years in a masters class in a very well ranked french school. I thought masters student in graphic design, aged 20-24, would be interested in type and carry a good knowledge. No. They just don't give a damn at, say, 90%. And the most amazing is that the last 10% are absolutely crazy about it. It's like, there is no middle class there, all or nothing. When I remember myself, I actually have to say that in art school I wasn't very much interested in it either. It came later, with experience. I think that the love and interest in typography does not come early, unless specific cases. I think it mainly comes late, and grows with experience. But it might come from the teachers too: maybe, just as Chris said above, I would have been much more crazy about type if our teachers showed us nice uses of type in magazine ads... For a sadly big amount of art students, type is just a very small detail in the job as they see it, something they have to use, like a burden. They guess they will find the right font quickly with the use of Fontbook or Typophile.com... Well, anyway, I suppose you can not ask from every student to recognize Helvetica's advantages over Univers, but that's a shame because that's how it should actually be.\n\ndr\n\n"

If you love type and are able to pry open the minds of your students you can fill them with excitement and a new found appreciation for this subject. You have to make it an exciting journey of exploration in each class. It really challenges you as an instructor to keep their interest. Imagine being a student and the subject for the day is kerning... As an instructor I have to train them to really look at everything and this is usually something completely new for them. Ask them to bring in examples of what they like and then retrain them with good examples so they can see quality design with a great use of type. I actually make students hand trace type so they can learn an appreciation for the subtle nuances in different fonts. They have to learn that type is one of the most important tools. Instructors have to teach students what small details in their work will set them apart in their professional life.\n\nAs an instructor I have a responsibility to teach about quality, copyrights, usage, and paying for fonts. I start them early with an understanding of these concepts.\n\nFeelinggrandy - There is an amazing instructor in Los Angeles who teaches at Otis/Parsons (I think) named Joe Molloy/Mondo Typo. He is a graphic designer who opened a type service setting amazing Berthold type (back in the day). I miss his type, I still can't get my Mac to produce quality type that is as good as my photo typeset projects. Maybe that is because I am a designer and was never supposed to be a typesetter!?\n\nHonor the past, embrace the present, teach the future.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the great responses.  \nI have thought a lot about this subject recently. I believe in many ways it is the computer, that best and worst of tools that has pushed typography to the backburner.  \nMany of us, of an age, grew up with Letraset and phototypositors. We had an intimate relationship with type. We rubbed it (literally) on paper, we xeroxed pages and pages of type, concepts which now must seem archaic and they are.  \nThe computer is not just another typewriter.  \nIt's the new television. Students are visual, they have grown up with computer monitors like many of us grew up with televisions.  \nI also teach first year students, which i think explains why many simply don't get it (yet). Some will. I agree Innovati: the first day of class we look out the windows and see all kinds of typography (unfortunately it's Washington Mutual, not the most fascinating font).  \nWhat is extraordinary is this site. It's a bit like joining the crazy farm. How delightful that so many people share this curious and interesting passion.\n\n"

      "content": "I just graduated from a school whose faculty are often obsessed with typography, and I often felt like the biggest problem was that postmodern typography and digital type created too much for many students to grasp in four years. Learning all of the little details is a year of study, figuring out what matters in the real world and whats just a quirky academic notion can suck the life out of internships. Then there’s the layer of grid knowledge, made messy by the tendency of designers to stink at math. Get that right and then comes expressive and experimental typography. Now that web/Flash experience has become a common requirement for entry-level design jobs students must also learn to make type work onscreen, both static and animated. It doesn’t surprise me in the least that many students minds aren’t elastic enough to take it all in—it literally pushed me and other students in the program to the limits of sanity.\n\nLooking back at it all, and knowing that there’s stuff I wish my school hadn’t had to leave out of the curriculum, I can’t really imagine a good solution to teaching typography in the twenty-first century. I think it likely that great design schools will become crucibles in the manner of graduate programs in law or medicine, in which the students who can’t take it all in will just crack.\n\n"

By the time I stopped, there was almost nothing else.  \nI was teaching people to be graphic designers, not type designers, so I wasn't teaching typography _per se_. I taught my students that if you expect people to pay you to select type for them, you have to be able to do more than look at a list and say \"Papyrus looks cool, I think I'll use that,\" because your client/employer can do that for herself.  \nTo help my students learn the factors that distinguish one face from another, and make one face more suitable than another for a specific purpose (weight, contrast, x-height, etc.), I had them draw a layout and render the display type by hand. \"No one will ever pay you to do this, ever,\" I told them, \"but I'm making you do this because I can show you slides and talk about bracketing all night, but it won't teach you half as much as if draw a word in Palatino and then draw the same word in Century.\"\n\n"

My goals for the class are for the students to explore the expressive potential of letterforms, to understand some of the historical forces that have shaped them, and to learn how to use type as a conceptual tool. I also teach a bit of Bringhurstian textcraft, but it's honestly secondary to concept. I figure if I can get them excited about type then they'll pick up the details along the way.\n\nThe curriculum's going to be ironed out more next quarter, but I realized that I unconsciously divided the class into three sections — letters, words, and text — each of which has a major multi-week project corresponding to it, in addition to several smaller exercises.\n\nHere are my major assignments, more or less:  \nLetters: Pick a location or a category (i.e. Home Depot, Central Park, patterns in the soles of shoes) and create a photographic found alphabet using non-alphabetic objects. Trace each letter (BY HAND!) in black-and-white. Pick one of those letters and extrapolate an entire alphabet, A-Z from that letter. Design a magazine cover that would use that typeface for its logo.\n\nWords: Design a cover for your favorite book. [This assignment was stretched out over three weeks — first they had to bring in ten rough conceptual sketches in Sharpie, followed by 10 tighter comps, followed by three very tight comps including spine & back cover, followed by a final cover]\n\nText: Pick an piece of writing with at least 1,000 words. READ THE TEXT and then design a multi-page layout (magazine, iPad, website) for it, including an introductory feature spread, pull quotes, supporting images, etc. [Like the book cover assignment this one is stretched out over several weeks]\n\nI've been really impressed with my students' work so far.\n\n"
