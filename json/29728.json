I've been getting messages to upgrade to version 1.1. I'm quite happy with 1.0.1.\n\nAnyone know if 1.1 is working fine or has any nasty bugs?\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "I rarely run into issues with FEX 1.1. Occasionally the Indesign plugin will beachball and claims to be activating fonts when opening documents, clicking cancel gets it to proceed without any trouble. The only other times FEX causes me trouble are when the memory leaks in Firefox start piling up and I start to run really low on RAM, but at this point I'm about to switch to Safari and fix all of my Firefox issues for good.\n\nRegardless of these little things, it's still about a million times better than any version of Suitcase I ever used.\n\n"
