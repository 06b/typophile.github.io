  "content": "Though I would hit up Typophile and let you all see what we have been up to.\n\nWe have been taking interns in on a semi-regular basis now and one of the first things I try and teach them is how to make a handwritten typeface based on their writing style. It seems like a natural way to get someone into the craft. They start to notice why things like consistency plays a big part in making a font, etc.\n\n[Dapper](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0276) is one of those experiments by Peter Bekke. A very simple but well-drawn alphabet.\n\n[Memoriam](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0275) is a typeface commissioned by the New York Times magazine. It is a headline script and is a solid font through and through.\n\n[Inmate](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0274) is a casual stencil font with the essence of Eurostile black. It comes with 2 styles. Inmate One is a more traditional style stencil, but Inmate Two is the look of future of space military styling.\n\n[Michel](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0273) is an experimental handset font designed by the random, untamed flow of ink carried by water across paper. The letters become removed from their traditional appearance and take on a surrealistic nature that makes each one its own unique form.\n\n[Mousse Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0271) is based on Glenmoy, a 1932 Stephenson Blake typeface. Improved and brought back by the amazing Alejandro Paul.\n\n[Player](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0270) is the official typeface of sports. You can't watch a sporting event without seeing this typeface being used in some way. Essential.\n\nThanks for your time and let us know if you have any suggestions or feedback!\n\n[http://www.youworkforthem.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/ \"http://www.youworkforthem.com\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [T0271\\_01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/typophile.com/files/T0271_01.jpg) | 145.24 KB |\n| [T0270\\_08.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/typophile.com/files/T0270_08.jpg) | 73.33 KB |\n| [T0273\\_08.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/typophile.com/files/T0273_08.jpg) | 144.61 KB |\n| [T0274\\_05.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/typophile.com/files/T0274_05.jpg) | 43.13 KB |\n| [T0275\\_04.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/typophile.com/files/T0275_04.jpg) | 51.25 KB |\n| [T0276\\_00.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013070820/http:/typophile.com/files/T0276_00.jpg) | 66.92 KB |\n\n",
