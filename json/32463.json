It's production work for a small publication - who still uses Quark 4 and PageMaker.\n\nIs the pay really bad? opinions?\n\n",

In Toronto it would be starvation wages, but in rural or small cities it would be a going rate.\n\nIt might be a good thing to do for a year or so as a stepping stone. Some places won't put much value on freelancing on a resume.\n\n"

(There were a few agencies, and a few small design firms...)\n\nThe upside of being in a smaller market is if you can get enough clients, freelancing is way more lucrative, and there's not as much competition up there. If you want to do design work, this is not the job to take. If money is tight, get another part time job to supplement your freelance until it picks up. Good luck...\n\n"

Our local bottle shop pays $11 to start, and the Blockbuster vid kitty-corner from them pays $9.50.\n\nThat being said, I had an errand to run in one of our \"with-it\" neighbourhoods (Inglewood), and where one of the stylish furn shops was looking to hire part-time.\n\n(I'd like something like that these days, to provide a little more steady an income and, more importantly, get me out of the house a bit, as it's one of the few things I do hate about freelancing.)\n\nSo I took a toodle through the shop, attired in a reasonably clean pair of jeans and fairly trendy jacket, discovering that they charge out their designers at $85/hour (with a \"free\" hour if you buy $500 or more in product), but only paying $15 to staff. Did I drop off my résumé? hahahahahahahahaha\n\n(And they even had a dress code of tailored black pants, high heels, and white blouse!)\n\nHow terribly stylish....\n\n"

Anchorage is all stars, northern lights and five-hour long glowing pink sunsets in the winter. Gorgeous.\n\nThanks for the advice, gang.\n\nAK\n\n"
