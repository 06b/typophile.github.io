I have only designed fonts for logo use etc in illustrater. however now I have created a complete font in illustrater in a grid with gridlines every 8 mm and 16 subdivisions. the font is only designed/to be used in kapitals.\n\nMy question is: is it possible to paste this font into fontlab with the grid i have used or has the grid got to be dividable with 10? -which would mean that i would have to make the whole font over again..\n\nAnd how long time would it take if i found someone who could do it??\n\n(i hope i am making sense ´qause i dont really know what I am talking about with Fontlab)\n\nI HAVE ATTACHED THE FONT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FONT4.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105816/http:/typophile.com/files/FONT4.png) | 72.92 KB |\n\n [‹ Need information on AFM file..](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105816/http:/typophile.com/node/16632 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Making shapes of certain sizes in FontLab ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105816/http:/typophile.com/node/16626 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Alternatively, yes, you could get somebody to convert your font for you. Also, Fontlab will support multiple kinds of grids - but is it a bitmap font you want to make? Maybe you should post some images of what you have so you can get better advice.\n\n"

Please read [http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mvie...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009105816/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2675 \"http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mview=0&ID\\_Message=2675\")\n\nYou can set up any grid subdivisions in FontLab you want.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"
