I'm designing a cookbook for vegan soups and the author/illustrator wants to use [Panorama](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823054735/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/panorama-sg/Panorama) for the titles and would like some suggestions for a body type \"that's kind of like Optima but a little more contemporary.\"\n\nI feel like Optima's a bit close to Panorama, and would make more sense to go with serif, but I'm open to suggestions...\n\n(said in your best Linda Richmond voice)..._Optima is neither a serif or a sans-serif...discuss_ ...\n\n",

      "content": "I think your instincts are right-on ... Optima (as well as its bastard cousin, Zapf Humanist - both technically sans serifs, btw) is way too close to Panorama to use them together .. a serif would be a MUCH better choice. I wouldn't get too fancy .. since this is a cookbook, and readability is paramount (like when is it not .. lol) .. try to picture folks running back and forth .. pantry to cookbook .. they need to be able to focus back where they left off quickly and comfortably ..\n\nMaybe Life from Adobe .. [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/life/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823054735/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/life/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/life/\")\n\nPersonally, I always thought Caslon (maybe 224) worked well with Optima, ergo should match with Panorama .. basically a \"chiseled\" sans serif with a \"chiseled\" serif ..\n\n-fQ-\n\n"
