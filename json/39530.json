(This combination I've inherited, not my choosing.)\n\nCan you suggest any fresh fonts? I need something with a squared serif preferably, and if it's available in various weights, that would be great. I've gone through our font library but I'm just not finding what I'm looking for. Undoubtedly you know of something I don't. I guess I kind of like Stymie, but I'm not completely sold on it.\n\nPlease let me know if more information about the project would be helpful/necessary.\n\n",
