  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nwe are asked to design a one dollar bill for promotional purposes (like a \"Disney Dollar\") and after a few hours of researches we still dont know what fonts are used on the original \"One Dollar\" bill. Would be great if you could have a look at the picture and may help us.\n\nThanks, Flo..\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Final1995$1SnB05040302Y.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120117062425/http:/typophile.com/files/Final1995$1SnB05040302Y.jpg) | 129.21 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I don't think that the lettering on the one dollar bill is type. I think that it is all hand-lettered, that is, invented by the engravers. Maybe they looked at some printed specimens to get the letter proportions right, but I don't think that it is based off of any font.\n\nFederal is the only thing available that matches the effect. But a lot of fonts have the same letter-style (without the 3D or hatched effects). Would one of these be ok?\n\n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20120117062425/http:/www.typeoff.de/ \"www.typeoff.de\")\n\n"
