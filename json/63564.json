Or just the history of it, I'm dying here!\n\nThanks in advance\n\nAn image is attached\n\nP.S. whoever figures this out gets cookies. an image, at least.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [katrina.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106063239/http:/typophile.com/files/katrina.jpg) | 50.83 KB |\n\n",

Was it Korinna BT or Softmaker's (\"This is a copyrighted typeface\") Korinth or their Kingston in their Megafont XXL collection?\n\nLet's face it: [The Korinna font was designed by Ed Benguiat, Victor Caruso and others in the 1970s, \"ripping off\" hot-metal type owned by Berthold AG and dating back to 1904](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106063239/http:/www.linotype.com/de/712/itckorinnabyadobe-schriftfamilie.html?viewmode=family&id=712&name=itckorinnabyadobe) (follow the link and click the Über/About tab). The letter shapes have been in the public domain for some time now. So the alleged \"rip-off\" is perfectly legal and should be good enough for a starving college student :-)\n\n"
