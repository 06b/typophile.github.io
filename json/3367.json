But the press release says they're re-designing it, so let's hope they rise to the occasion.   \n   \nI wonder who the domain belonged to before, and how much they paid for it. Since dot-com-land was covered with dot-bombs, squatters have been selling off domains for really cheap. But if a company is spending good money on getting a good domain, that's a good sign for the font business.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
