Well, just wanted to link to fontshop.com. Is it possible that fontshop has NO (in words zero) kabel-typefaces available? Well, at least when I search for “kabel” the search brings nothing, nichts, nada, rien. For me. Hmm. Can’t believe that. What did I do wrong?\n\nEDIT2: Hmm, seems I have difficulties to search at fontshop.com. Is that just me? At [fontshop.at](http://web.archive.org/web/20070402195259/http:/www.fontshop.at/fontdetailc.php3?ns=&sns=&co=&co2=&id=fp-C68-g0102) everything’s fine, but no wonder different site …\n\n"
