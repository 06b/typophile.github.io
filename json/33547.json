  "content": "Hello all, I am new to all this and am in need of identifying three fonts. One seems to be Parsons as a nice fellow assisted me with that ID. Here are the samples:\n\n[http://hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3qs.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3qs.htm \"http://hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3qs.htm\")\n\n[http://hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3du2.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3du2.htm \"http://hamgallery.com/qsl/country/Canada/3du2.htm\")\n\n[http://www.schmarder.com/qsl/wbt.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/www.schmarder.com/qsl/wbt.jpg \"http://www.schmarder.com/qsl/wbt.jpg\")\n\nThe third one here appears extremely close to parsons. At [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/barnhartbrother/parsons/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/barnhartbrother/parsons/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/barnhartbrother/parsons/\") I wonder how “modernized” this version of Parsons is from the sample link above? I know old fonts like cheltenham have been modernized into things like ITC Cheltenham, but are the older original versions available? Also, the kerning today is very different than what they could do with lead, hot or cold.\n\nIn any case, thanks in advance for any help identifying the other two fonts above!  \nMany regards and thanks  \nEugene\n\n",

The large type is a typical wood type grotesque. The word “CANADIAN” is [Copperplate Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/).\n\nSome of the small type near the top in the 3DU sample is DeVinne. The only digital version I could find is [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/de-vinne/), but it’s apparently based on a large wood type cut, not the small metal cut in your sample. I’m pretty sure the rest of the small type is an old metal font called Grasset. “A.R.R.L.” is [Copperplate Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20090904015208/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/).\n\nRegarding the last one, I’m also the one who identified it for you on the [T-D] list. This is about as close as you’re going to get to the original metal Parsons. There doesn’t appear to be any ITC-style design modernization.\n\n"
