It is said that is was created by Mesrop who is known to have also invented the Armenian alphabet. It was almost forgotten for centuries but rediscovered in the 20th century, namely on palimpsest manuscripts kept in the St. Catherine’s monastery on Mount Sinai.  \nIn 2007 I had the honour and the pleasure to make the inauguration font for the edition of that source. This font was also used for the recently launched new Albanian block (10530) of Unicode. The new font now released is based on that encoding.\n\nGo to [Wikipedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110458/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_Albanian_alphabet#Rediscovery) for further reading.\n\n",
