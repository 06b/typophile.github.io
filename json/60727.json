I suppose it just strikes a chord with me -- it's everything I like about Gotham, News Gothic, and Whitney all rolled into one, and the price and EULA are just right. The only reason I haven't purchased a license yet is because I really don't have a reason to -- I just want it!\n\nI drop by typetrust.com every day just to look at it...\n\n"
