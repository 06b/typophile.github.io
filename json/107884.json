      "content": "Hi damn1990,  \nDefinitely not Clarice Black and Don's probably right about it being a custom logotype (registered ®), but pretty simple though - all straight lines and circles.  \nThere is some info and a video about the WWF logo and it's development here:  \n [http://www.logodesignlove.com/world-wildlife-fund](http://web.archive.org/web/20150304194517/http:/www.logodesignlove.com/world-wildlife-fund \"http://www.logodesignlove.com/world-wildlife-fund\")\n\nI also noticed your other request regarding other \"WWF lungs typo\" info, so I feel I should refer you to the info available from their website in respect of using site content. This is the legal bit, I guess!  \n [http://wwf.panda.org/using\\_site\\_content/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150304194517/http:/wwf.panda.org/using_site_content/ \"http://wwf.panda.org/using\\_site\\_content/\")\n\nHope this helps  \nDoghouse\n\n"
