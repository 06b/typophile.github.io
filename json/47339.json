I have used many hours reading threads and replies, and commented a few my self.\n\nI have made web design all of my life, starting 10-years old. First in 2000 I tried Photoshop, soon to be followed by all the other Adobe products. It was here I started my passion for corporate ID design.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905121930im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logos_4832.jpg)\n  \n**1. Magventure**  \n Magnetic stimulation.\n\n**2. Advanseed**  \n Sells special seeds like Rucula.\n\n**3. Regnskabets time**  \n Auditor. The name is on Danish and is a saying like, “The 11th hour” but with a more threatening meaning. Like “Let’s settle the score” sort of. It meant to be humorous.\n\n**4. Kongens Lyngby haveservice**  \n “Kongens Lyngby” is a city in Denmark. A part of Lyngby. Translated to English it would be: “The Kings Lyngby”. “Haveservice” means “Garden Service”. So “The Kings Lyngby Garden Service”.\n\n**5. Daren**  \n Darén is a cleaning business. The idea was that the white stuff is like when you sweep.\n\n**6. InOffice**  \n Office hotel in Copenhagen.\n\n**7. Advanseed**  \n Sells special seeds like Rucula.\n\n**8. AktieFokus**  \n A financial stock news firm that monitors stocks and brings the news to the newspapers.\n\n**9. Giantmedia**  \n An advertising agency.\n\n**10. Intramedia**  \n A CMS IT comany\n\nI don’t know why i post it - it’s way too late to change any of them... well ... maby just because we all love logos... :-)\n\nPlease be free to say your opinion, whether it’s good or bad... :-)\n\n [‹ I need some suggestions to select a font type (please!)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905121930/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47376 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Maze/Labyrinth as logo symbol ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905121930/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47167 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It needs quite a bit of work, but it’s a good start.\n\nDaren total is looks nice and ok but I don’t think that’s a corporate logo. At least not for cleaning business.\n\nEspecially I like the tree/crown logo. I would change it a bit to make crown and tree work as single image, because they look as two images at the moment, but it’s very nice and memorable. I hope wherever it’s used it has enough breathing space around. it’s the best one of all these.\n\nOther logos/images are quite web2-ish...  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
