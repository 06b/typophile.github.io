  "content": "Im doing a project for my graphic design class. The goal is to create 3 unique brochures sharing a common thread. individually these brochures are about a single typeface the common thread is the classification, Slab Serifs. My selections are, Rockwell, Chaparral, and Lubalin Graph. I know that these arn’t the best and that serifa and stymie would be better choices but i’m a student, and well that’s all i can get my hands on. okay, so my question to you fellow type lovers is, does anyone know WHO created rockwell? I Keep Finding that Rockwell was created by Monotype Designs, But my instructor wants to know WHO created it. i assume it was a collective effort. the reason why its also important from a design perspective is because i need an image of the creator, and if the creator was a company instead of a single human being or a team, im going to need to find an image of a building and photoshop Monotype designs on the side of it. Not my style.\n\nOh and another question, does anyone know where i can find the three typefaces, Rockwell, Chaparral, and Lubalin Graph in use? I know that WHATTHEFONT.COM is useful at figuring out what font is used the only trouble is i have to HAVE the fonts in my cache, and i cant seem to find anything.\n\nId appreciate all the help i can get and i look forward to learning from you all.\n\n [‹ The difference between Garamond, Garamond Premier Pro and Adobe Garamond Pro?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201175004/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49102 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [You're on a deserted island ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201175004/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49543 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I can’t recall seeing the other two recently, but I’m sure they’re around.\n\n“serifa and stymie would be better choices “... Why? These three are fine, and, to my mind, Chaparral is very good.\n\n"

But McGrew goes on to note “English Monotype has several weights of Rockwell, a square serif family which differs from this face and should not be confused with it.”\n\nThe Rockwell that most of us are familiar with is not quite the same as the Rockwell that originated as Inland Type Foundry’s Litho Antique. But I suppose that the Salfords Works could have based their drawings on the American original, making changes as they saw fit.\n\n— Kent.\n\n"

It would probably be possible to trace a link from the English Monotype Rockwell (which gives us our current digital form) back to the original Inland Litho Antique.\n\nIn which case, for what it’s worth to the original poster, Litho Antique is attributed to William Schraubstädter for Inland Type Foundry.\n\n— K.\n\n"
