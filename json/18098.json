To a system or an application that doesn’t understand the OpenType Layout tables, a TT flavour OT font is largely indistinguishable from any other TrueType font. The same rasterisers are used for TT and TT-OT fonts, so I don’t think you have to worry about TT longevity.\n\nAlso note that your comment about PostScript fonts is not accurate: it is specifically Type 1 fonts that are likely to be phased out and which are not supported in Avalon. PostScript CFF OT fonts are supported in Avalon.\n\n"

I really got it wrong when I said that Windows would support Type 1, including MM, for at least the next ten years.\n\nSo: cui bono?\n\nFirst, let’s look at the history: Adobe’s so worried that nobody’s buying Type 1 fonts for Windows, and nobody’s buying ATM for Windows, that it gives away ATM to MS. And nothing happens. It still doesn’t make any money. So what choice is there but to do what everyone has always done in the past? Change the format and make everybody buy the base library again. I didn’t think it could be done. But it does mean that every graphic designer who is serious about fonts and licensing them, not to mention every service bureau, will have to ante up again, about $10,000 and up, for new font libraries. This will really benefit Adobe, Linotype, Font Bureau, and everyone else whose libraries are gold standards.\n\nBut that’s only on Windows. What if publishing people all stay on Macs? What if Mac market share increases? That seemed out of the question four years ago but it doesn’t seem out of the question now. Not when you have a computer company run by Walt Disney II, and that remarkable iPod success, and Intel chips.\n\nCui bono?\n\nThis could be rather painful for users but a lifesaving shot in the arm for foundries. Strange that MS is being so sympathetic to foundries’ existential grief all of a sudden. Or is it really that sudden?\n\n"

(Supplying conversions is probably a better idea, since homemade conversions could fail to work, which would reflect badly on the foundry. As well, consider that many users will be unwilling to do their own conversions for many good and bad reasons.) But that won’t affect the larger foundries, because if you need Linotype Janson, you need Linotype Janson.\n\nBut Nick, I think I might be reluctant to replace a font bought ten years ago. What do you think? After a certain number of years, doesn’t the foundry deserve a little more revenue? And isn’t it a little snarky of the user to suppose that after ten years of using your software, he doesn’t have any associated upgrade costs?\n\nWell, then, the question arises, what constitutes the upgrade? One answer is, at the very least, cross platform compatibility and, theoretically, automatic cross-platform ligature support. I am assuming that at some point, applications will have uniform opentype support. But there is only fragmentary evidence to support that optimistic assumption.\n\nMay I ask, isn’t there a term that describes an upgrade that isn’t an upgrade and isn’t a downgrade, but is a ’same-grade’?\n\n"

I fact, I have a specimen page from a church missal that was printed in 1520 and, guess what: you can still read it WITHOUT paying a single extra cent to upgrade.\n\nPersonally, I think a company which sets a standard and then abandons it (because it will force it customers to buy more of its product) practices bad (American) business (as usual: bite the hand that feeds you, again and again). I am certain that Mr Phinney, as official Adobe spin doctor to this forum, will have a different perspective on the subject, as he is paid to do: I can’t wait to hear the rationalization for this bone-headed move.

It’s a feature that the stereo vendor may or may not build into new products.\n\nIt has been said many times before that fonts are software. The software originally produced, tested and sold by the foundries works and will continue to work with the software for which it was designed. In the case of Postscript Type 1 fonts, this means current and previous operating systems and supported applications. I don’t see why there is any obligation on the part of foundries to provide compatible font software, free of charge to run on a new system simply because the OS vendor has decided to remove support for older technology.\n\nConsumers have a choice to purchase and use Microsoft Vista. However, if MS breaks backwards compatability I don’t see how this is the fault of a font vendor. Keep in mind that I don’t necessarily believe my own argument completely. It is a great opportunity for a font vendor to earn a lot of goodwill from loyal customers if they can ease an OS transition.\n\n(Also: Where’s my OS X native PageMaker? I loved those “windowshades” on the text frames.)\n\n"

While Adobe obviously has some interest in this area, Microsoft has little or none.\n\nMicrsoft invented OpenType because they _needed_ to extend their existing TrueType format to support complex script rendering for their Middle Eastern and Asian markets. All the fancy typographic features of OpenType Layout are riding on the back of the complex script handling. OpenType is fundamentally an internationalisation technology. The impetuses for its creation are Microsoft’s international market, the character/glyph model and associated rendering demands of the Unicode Standard, and the massive increase in dynamic electronic text serving of the Internet (contrasted with the largely static print media of the desktop publishing revolution that gave rise today’s digital font business.)\n\nAdobe’s reasons for signing on to OpenType are largely similar to Microsoft’s, although with a different set of priorities. The fancy typographic support that Microsoft saw as an added bonus of their complex script support is obviously of more immediate interest to Adobe. But the importance of electronic text serving to Adobe’s current strategy is obvious: PDF has become a viable web-publishing format, and this is only possible if the underlying text behind a typographically sophisticated document layout remains cleanly encoded, searchable, copyable, pasteable, etc. In short, when Microsoft were developing OpenType, Adobe were already well aware that the whole 8-bit ’expert set’ encoding architecture that had served the static media of desktop publishing was inadequate for the Internet. On the internationalisation side, Adobe have long been involved in the Far East market, especially Japan. More recently, though, they have begun to show their hand in other areas: Acrobat 7.05 includes support for Arabic, Hebrew and Thai, taking advantage of the complex script support of OpenType.\n\nRegarding Microsoft’s decision not to support Type 1 fonts in Avalon (and bear in mind that Avalon will co-exist with the old GDI layout engine, which continues to support Type 1 fonts, and it is far from clear how many applications will actually make the switch from GDI to Avalon), I think the reasons are pretty mundane. Although they are both PostScript formats, Type 1 and CFF format fonts require separate rasterisers. There appears to have long been resistance from within the Windows core engineering group to supporting multiple rasterisers. Dropping one from Avalon, for what is clearly an obsolete font technology from the internationalisation perspective that is of most concern to Microsoft, is a no brainer. They save resources, simplify their layout and rendering, and at the same time encourage greater adoption of the sfnt font file format.\n\n"

I believe that Lucasfonts, and Underware offer “upgrades” from PS to OT versions. And (I hope) that other foundries will provide this kind of offer too. When I am obliged by software considerations to move exclusively to OpenType, I will most probably buy OT versions/upgrades for my three most trusted and dearly loved fonts, and use these exclusively in the future. I might even offer myself two weights of TEFF Trinity at that point !! Replacing my entire type library would be financially impossible unless done, font by font, over several years.\n\nMight anyone know whether Fontshop offer PS to OT “upgrades” ??

The process of making good OpenType fonts is very labor intensive, much more difficult than generating old Type 1 fonts. If OT conversion fonts were just given away to customers, this work would go uncompensated.\n\nAlso, in most cases, OT fonts have larger character sets than the fonts they replace. If I had just purchased Times Roman from foundry X, with a standard 256 character set, an free upgrade really wouldn’t be all that fair for foundry x if they decide to include CE characters, small caps, and old style figures etc. in the new OT version. I’d be getting all of these glyphs for free if I’d never licensed the old expert versions! And most foundries do release OT fonts with bigger character sets, because that is what customers want. Especially in Europe where heavy degrees of language support is a must. Many Americans just don’t see this. In the US, we can print products with instructions in just one (or maybe two) languages. In Europe, everything is printed in a gazillion languages. Even the money has two separate writing systems (Latin and Greek).\n\nAs a separate issue, I do think that it would be interesting for a foundry to offer a “lifetime upgrading possibility” price to fonts. The font would cost more, but you would always get the upgrades sent to you, forever! Bulk buyers could look at this like insurance… sure, some fonts might never be upgraded, but others definitely would be. Who knows what formats the future holds?\n\n"

I’d be inclined to think not, as typographic complexity (the old “expert” sets) seems inherent in the character/glyph model._\n\nInsofar as any unencoded glyph variant of a character is an inherent presumption of the character/glyph model, yes. My take on this is that Microsoft were certainly aware of the typographic potential of OpenType when they were designing it, so it wasn’t incidental in the sense of a byproduct, but at the same time fancy typography wasn’t a driving consideration for Microsoft. The character/glyph distinction had been around for more than a decade, during which time it is notable that MS never once shipped anything like an expert set encoding or used PUA codepoints to access typographic glyph variants. Clean text encoding had always been more important to Microsoft than it was in the desktop publishing world, where any mechanism to get the desired glyphs next to each other was considered acceptable. Fine typography essentially requires the Latin script to behave as a complex script. This leads me to conclude that fine typography was not a driving consideration for Microsoft in the development of OpenType, because if it had been we could have expected OpenType, or something like it, much earlier. It is only in the context of actual complex scripts, i.e. scripts that _require_ higher level protocols in order to display text in a readable way, that the impetus to develop the new font format and rendering engines emerges.\n\n"
