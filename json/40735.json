  "content": "Eco Typeface -- Work in Progress\n\nThis typeface is still in development. It's been inspired by a similar typeface but redrawn from zero -- no copy/paste has been used.\n\nDo you have any ideas how to make it better or is it good enough? The point is that one day Eco should become a commercial typeface.\n\nNote: Eco has only lower case letters because it's a display typeface.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417044653im_/http:/typophile.com/files/eco01_6103.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Jedan , you might need to find another name for this one I’m afraid. There’s a typeface called [Eco](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417044653/http:/www.fsd.it/fonts/eco.htm) by Fabrizio Schiavi that’s been around for a while now.\n\nOther than that, I’m not sure your typeface quite works yet. Many glyphs seem confusing and out of touch with the others (s, x, k, z, v, y) and I second Kevin’s take about the c and t being difficult to tell apart. Are there any uppercase letters? Punctuation?\n\nI don’t want to sound overly negative: as a display typeface it might have some uses, but my humble advice is to keep working on it. Modular/geometric typefaces like the one you’re doing are very hard to do right, because of the crudeness of the shapes you necessarily have to work with. I hope this helps.\n\n"
