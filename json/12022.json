In a broader sense, a lover of letters. This looser definition encompasses writing and lettering as areas of interest. See also [typophilism](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/typophilism).\n\n**[Indices](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Indices) : [Organizations](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Organizations) : Typophile**\n\n[Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.typophile.com/) launched 16 April 2000. Typophile originally launched with exclusive articles and online courses from [Jonathan Hoefler](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jonathan%20Hoefler) based on his [Yale](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Yale) lectures as well as articles from [Three Island Press](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Three%20Island%20Press) and [TypeRight](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeRight).\n\nTypophile's stated aim is to further [typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/typography) as a craft as well as a profession by providing an open, collaborative environment where users can contribute and access content for free. In the Typophile Forums members discuss everything from how to pronounce [Benguiat](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Edward%20Benguiat) to writing [pangrams](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Pangram) or just getting help identifying a [typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/typeface).\n\nAspiring and professional [type designers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20designers) post their work for peer critique. Currently there are over 500 fonts by designers from all over the world where English is commonly spoken -- North America, South America, Europe and Russia.\n\nTypophile is produced, designed and maintained by [Punchcut](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Punchcut) ( [www.punchcut.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.punchcut.com/)), a San Francisco based interface design company. Typophile members, film fest sponsors and advertisers provide the sustaining financial support to keep Typophile thriving.\n\nTYPOPHILE FILM FEST\n\nIn 2004 Typophile started the [Typophile Film Fest](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.typophile.com/filmfest/) with the debut showing held at [TypeCon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeCon) 2004 in San Francisco. It has since been shown in New York, Boston, Seattle, St Petersburg and Vancouver.\n\nTypophile has been featured in _[Tupigraphia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Tupigraphia), [Metropolis](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Metropolis), [Applied Arts Magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Applied%20Arts%20Magazine), [STEP](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/STEP)_ and _[How](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/typophile.com/wiki/How)_.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\n**Typophile**  \n170 Maiden Lane, 3rd Floor  \nSan Francisco, CA 94108  \nUSA\n\nEMAIL: typophile [at] punchcut [dot] com  \nURL: [http://www.typophile.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.typophile.com/ \"http://www.typophile.com\")  \nVIMEO: [http://www.vimeo.com/groups/typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.vimeo.com/groups/typophile \"http://www.vimeo.com/groups/typophile\")  \nFLICKR: [http://www.flickr.com/groups/typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typophile \"http://www.flickr.com/groups/typophile\")  \nTWITTER: [http://www.twitter.com/Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.twitter.com/Typophile \"http://www.twitter.com/Typophile\")  \nFACEBOOK: [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Typophile/22085983311](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010193140/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/Typophile/22085983311 \"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Typophile/22085983311\")\n\n",
