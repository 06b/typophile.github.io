      "content": "The lower part of a script f would not normally be a swash, unless it was unusually flamboyant. Generally swashes are extra/alternate characters for a Script font, and while they are most often embellishments of the upper case letters, they could also be special beginning or ending flourishes on lower case letters. Adobe Bickham is a good example of a font with both kinds of swashes.
