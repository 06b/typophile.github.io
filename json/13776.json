Designers' aim with mid-capitals is to make the small caps slightly larger so that the overall difference between the small caps and the roman, in a given setting, is more subtle and therefore more unified. Mid-caps then simply refers to striking a balance somewhere between the x-height and the [cap height](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cap%20Height).\n\nThe term mid-capitals could be the nitpick of purists to simply put a name on slightly enlarged small caps to run more cohesively in text. Some would argue that it is therefore appropriate (and more practical) to refer to what might technically be mid-capitals as a variant on small capitals.\n\nIn recent years mid-capitals are becoming more common, especially for types that are geared toward use at smaller sizes. Some designers believe that at smaller sizes a less noticeable difference between the roman and the small capitals is desirable.\n\nThe [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) specification admits the [small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Small%20Capitals) feature [smcp,c2sc](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33993) and a petite caps feature [pcap,c2pc](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33993). Fonts providing both often have petite caps that match the [x-height](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/X-height) while the [small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Small%20Capitals) are somewhat larger, thus filling the mid-caps role.\n\n**See Also:**  \n [Small Capitals](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Small%20Capitals), [SmallCaps How-To](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/wiki/SmallCaps%20How-To)\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n- [Medium Capitals](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/www.typophile.com/node/51622)\n- [Slightly smaller caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/66307)\n- [midcaps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/10410#comment-65805)\n- [Smallcaps Height Standards](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/6605)\n- [How to Use Small Caps Correctly](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/56161)\n- [Plural words that require small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/40920): Contains Nick Shinn's [argument for multiple types of \"Small Caps\".](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/40920#comment-252257)\n- [Medium Capitals](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/www.typophile.com/node/51622)\n- [OpenType smallcaps in a separate font?](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/32455)\n- [Lack of small-cap height lining numerals.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/29580)\n- [Small Caps: the older I get the less I know.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/1223)\n- [Fonts with mid-caps?](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/88982)\n- [Correct use of small caps at the beginning of a paragraph](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424040834/http:/typophile.com/node/17024)\n\n",
