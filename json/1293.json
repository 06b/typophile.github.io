  "content": "The fonts I'm after are quite commonly seen, so I'm sure someone will know what they are ?! I've got a couple of fairly close examples, but I'd like to get the real thing if I could.   \n   \nThe first two I'm after are the ones found on vintage travel posters like this one :   \n   \n [http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/PIN/VNT16.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133447/http:/imagecache2.allposters.com/images/PIN/VNT16.jpg)   \n   \nThe orange font - is that the font I've seen that's called simply 'Art Deco', or does anything know of anything very similar (particularly if free !). Also, anyone know what the white \\*'Monte Carlo Superieur'\\* font is ?   \n   \nThe third, 1930s font I'd like is the one seen, again on posters, but in particular British travel ones including British Rail. It's on these two posters :   \n   \n [http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/AWI/AW1160.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133447/http:/imagecache2.allposters.com/images/AWI/AW1160.jpg)   \n   \n [http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images/VIS/v202.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133447/http:/imagecache2.allposters.com/images/VIS/v202.jpg)   \n   \nThis font looks so simple - could it possibly just be arial or something ? Any advice on achieving this ?   \n   \nCheers\n\n",
