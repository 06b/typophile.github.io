Some samples from this exhibit can be viewed online.   \n   \nPosted in behalf of the International Poster Gallery   \n   \n\"This yearâ€™s holiday show beckons viewers to the mountains with a richly diverse selection of ski posters from 1908 through the 1970s. More than 100 rare, original vintage posters tell the tale of the fascinating transformation of skiing from a sport into a global industry, showing changes in equipment, technique, competitions, and facilities over the years.   \n One of the most sought-after poster collectibles today, ski posters capture the joy of fresh mountain air and the exhilarating rush of a downhill run through tree-lined glades. Combining travel, sports and fashion, the ski poster has achieved immense popularity, rivaling the traditional blue chip categories of ocean liners and luxury trains.\"   \n   \nDecember 5, 2003 through January 5, 2004   \nInternational Poster Gallery   \n205 Newbury Street, Boston, Massachusetts   \n [http://www.internationalposter.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090601195915/http:/www.internationalposter.com/exhibits.cfm)\n\n",
