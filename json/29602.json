  "content": "I am an illustrator who has become a regular reader of Typophile in order to learn as much about typography as I can. I have a great deal of respect for the knowledge-base that is open to sharing here on this board.\n\nI have designed a large-display emblem for a salon and I need your help on the text portion of the emblem. Currently, I am using Rosewood Fill; however, it is getting a little too much play these days and I would like to support a different font and its designer. I am aware of Cam, but it doesn’t rock my world. I would like to go for something that complements the ornate emblem and personifies luxury. The font should work both within the emblem and on its own. I don’t think Rosewod Fill works well on its own for a salon, at least not one that is high-end. Maybe I am asking too much for a font to work in both applications, so the more important application is in the emblem.\n\nMy second question is what font(s) do you think work well in this context to accompany the emblem? It should have the feel of luxury like a font that would work well in high-fashion. The font shouldn’t compete with the ornateness of the graphic. Price is not an issue.\n\nAs a bonus question, I understand Rosewood Fill needs to be kerned manually, I have little knowledge of this other than what looks natural to me, so I ask you to critique the job I have done.\n\nI thank all of you who openly share your vast knowledge of typography here on this board. It greatly helps those of us who may be proficient in other areas, but lack when it comes to typopgraphy.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [studio\\_salon.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019053502/http:/typophile.com/files/studio_salon_0.gif) | 11.13 KB |\n\n",

Maybe with a bit more detail to work with the swashy shield rather than silhouette. In terms of usefulness, I mean printing well at most sizes, I would consider placing the type outside the shield, below or to the side possibly. Your kerning looks good (difficult to see at the small size of you post) ALO is always going to present problems kerning, essentially what you are trying to achieve is to have visually similar spaces between characters, a good practice is to view the setting with a squint so you can see the spacing as a blur you should be able to pick out particularly dark or light areas.\n\nTim\n\n"

I might try making it thinner and more upright.\n\nhhp\n\n"
