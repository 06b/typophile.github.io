All I can say is that it doesn't seem to be at the MyFonts site, or they didn't categorize it as \"curly\".\n\nThe most similar font I can suggest is Edison Swirl, an Art Nouveau-era design that has digital versions from both [HiH, as \"Edison\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20100705084346/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/hihretrofonts/edison/) and [Spiece Graphics](http://web.archive.org/web/20100705084346/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

They seem to have a whisping quality to them. Most noticeably on the \"d, e, c\" letters. Could be the same font for both. I would think that \"e\" and \"c\" would be the most recognizable characters of the set.\n\nMost beautiful font I have seen. The author of the theme will not return my emails. :-(\n\n"

It looks completely hand-drawn to me, but the more I look at it, I can see why you'd say that. The proportions are pretty much TNR and the skeleton core of each letter, with the exception of a few letters, also seems to follow TNR's shapes. I can see you making the overlays now, that show how the wispy, curly serifs are the main thing that were changed.\n\nThat being the case, if they gave prizes for the most creative font based on Times New Roman, this would be a contender in my book.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
