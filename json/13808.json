  "content": "Thanks to the blog option, i can have my own handpicked threads. This one falls under the category of \"hot topic\" as in watch out for all the flames. And without further ado:\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/9245](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106035802/http:/typophile.com/node/9245 \"http://typophile.com/node/9245\")\n\ni must admit, a little heated discussion certainly makes for interesting reading. i'm just glad this one hasn't spiraled into the realm of personal insults. in between flares of personality, one can actually find an interesting line of discussion revisting topics including: the merits of revivals, interesting technological methods and the debate over the definition of \"design.\" threads like this are the reason why i'd rather send my entertainment $$$ to typophile rather than the cable company. eat your heart out reality tv!\n\n",
