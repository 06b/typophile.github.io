  "content": "Hi,\n\nI know it's tough to see, but I was wondering if anyone can make out what font is used for the text \"i love you\" on the gift wrapping paper in this scene from How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. For the second image, I made the background darker in an attempt to help see the type. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416110212im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wrapping-paper-(front)_5086.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416110212im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wrapping-paper-(close-up)_6518.jpg)\n\n",
