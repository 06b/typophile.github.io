NorCal Designs is a graphic design company and I create any kind of corporate collateral (business cards, letter heads, company logo work, etc.) but I specialize in website design & creation for small businesses.\n\nThis is the first piece of concept work for my new logo based on Emigre’s Sabbath Black. I am not sure on the look and feel that I want to achieve yet so hopefully it will develop along the way.\n\nBelow is my sketched out version of the lettering as well as the traced paths in illustrator (which took forever) and the result. At the very bottom is Emigre’s Sabbath Black to show you my starting point.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011010948im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/norcal_process%20copy_6534.jpg)\n\nI am looking for ideas on where to take this, interesting blackletter variations I can try adding, any ideas on improvement. It is very unfinished both in the concept and lettering. for now...\n\n [‹ Logotype for a media firm using custom type](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011010948/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47596 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Desperately need help with type ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011010948/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47816 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Your client definitely wants the name to be fully legible. The “D” has a disproportionate amount of (what will visually translate as) white space in comparison to the other characters; so when you stand back, it appears as though there is a gap in the text.\n\n"

Also the term norcal became popular along with a clothing brand with the word norcal set in blackletter along with a star.\n\nAlso I like blackletter more than i am afraid of the motorcycle stigma attached to it.

See how it slants at about a 70 degree angle? I would straighten that out a bit. Also lessening the lower-left curl on the “D”. That curl is disproportionately large compared to every other curl in the design...and it is creating alot of white space. That will help to tighten up the logo into a more unified image.\n\n"

I am looking for ways to make it more versatile. To create a look that does not associate with any of these groups. (of course the type by itself isn’t my attempt, it is just my starting point).\n\n@vintagesignman. Lol i will tighten that gap. But i also really want to have to use a Pi ligature now! Cool logo, but this is sort of the look i want to get away from. Are you showing it for the swashes?\n\n"

I need to find more typical blackletter that are differentiated by their type treatments.\n\nI think Ekrine might look motorcyclish without the beautiful uniform swashes. By the way is there a term I can use to describe more classically associated blackletter styles besides motorcyclish?\n\n"
