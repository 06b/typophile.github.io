Do you know maybe of any good sites that’d explain how companies go about advertising their fonts? Or maybe good books that would have reference to this. Your help would be much appriciated. Thanks alot\n\n [‹ Why are we so passionate?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007192145/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17501 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Serifs.
