I plan to have 4 weights and matching italics/obliques.   \n   \nAlan Rimmer   \nwww.fatchair.com\n\n<center><table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225655im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_gif.gif\" align=\"LEFT\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">VasarelyLight.swf<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150414225655/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/vasarelylight.swf\"><b>vasarelylight.swf</b></a> (11 k)</td></tr></table></center>!-/attachment-!\\>!-attachment:\\> \n",

I think it is quite sexy - love those little lilting upswings (very technical terms there) on the tops of the lowercase letters. I kinda wish a bit o' that was incorporated into the caps - but then I don't know if it would be too much. It might be well balanced already.   \n   \nOverall - fantastic - I'd totally use it. It's not abnoxious at all.   \n   \nI won't comment on kerning or any other technicalities - just from visual appeal.\n\n"

      "content": "it's got a great stencil feel to it, without being too informal/stencily.   \ni don't think the caps need the flourishes at all. it would be too distracting.   \non the other hand, if there were alternates for drop caps, etc., that's a   \ndifferent story.i dig the stroke intersections w/the soft brackets, if they   \ncan be called that. pretty cool stuff.   \n   \nam i the only one who sees the W as... well, think fifties pin-up poster.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your comments - I presume you're referring to the top of the 'a', '2', '3' etc when you say 'upswing'? I did start with that applied elsewhere but thought it affected the legibilty of the face too much - I really wanted to design the typeface as a very 'usable' one (if it's at all possible!)   \n   \nI'm happy with the soft brackets but unfortunately when I've tried making the heavier weights this has been a problem as they look terrible with the wider brackets and really need thinner intersections. I think I may have to drop the heavier weights and maybe stick to to just two weights. Any ideas how to get around this problem?\n\n"

I've changed the name to 'Venkmann' - Vasarely just didn't seem appropriate.   \n   \nI stuck with the 2 weights (and italics) although I may do the others if I feel like it (and there's a demand).   \n   \n...and I can't believe I first posted it here over a year ago!\n\n"
