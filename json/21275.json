I censored myself because I thought it might be too wide for you. But it's lovely and I can certainly vouch for it, having used it many times. The others have the advantage of size-specific cuts, and Minion has many more extras, but if those aren't requirements, Verdigris would be my choice.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144444im_/http:/typophile.com/files/get_Font_Image-3_5025.php.png)\n\n"

Its versatility and aesthetic virtues were obvious. After having actually used it for two lengthy pieces of work, dealing mainly with Roman classical literature, my impressions of the font have been confirmed.\n\nMy attention was diverted by Envoy, however. I found its old-style characterestics rather charming, but the comparison to the overly-clean and consequently, insincere Minion, turned me away from it. So Verdigris came to mind, etc.\n\n"
