  "content": "Hi, how are you all today?\n\nYesterday a friend of mine sent me a sample that he's trying to ID, but couldn't. I took a look and wasn't able to come up with anything off the top of my head, nor with my limited type books. So I go to the place I always go with these questions...\n\nDoes anyone have any idea what typeface is used for the outline/shadow numbers in this type sample?  \nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [unknown.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220813/http:/typophile.com/files/unknown_4.jpg) | 487.85 KB |\n\n",

If that is the case, this should surely be a metal or wood type, and finding it as a font is unlikely. Since my best book on American Metal Type is for the Twentieth Century (McGrew), it is also unlikely to find it there -- I tried, and didn't see it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
