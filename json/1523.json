  "content": "Here's another one. This time for a water treatment company. They wanted a round continuous logotype so I build up this set of letters from the drop form used on the a & q. the u & n are again the same, the C and the O are very simmilar, but I skewed the top O to match the R ending curvature. The E comes from the C cutted and rotated into the center.   \n   \nOn the back of the card there is the type + logo, a simple water drop. I think I have some conflicts on the size of the letters, the tr ligature is of course the exception.   \n   \nThanks for your time & feedback again.   \nadriano   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023181241im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/17954.gif)\n\n",

They look a little like they're towering over the curved tops of the other letters.   \n   \nMaybe you could try rounding the tops of the 'u' bars a little, as if there was a curved top to the letter.
