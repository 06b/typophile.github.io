  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nFor a project that I am working on in PHP/HTML/CSS, I have to string glyphs together as seperate images. So, a word like \"how\" would be presented as a string of images with one image representing each letter.\n\nAs each glyph image has been saved without padding, the kerning has to be figured out separately.\n\nMy question, therefore, is how do I identify the scalable kerning values of a font so that I can calculate a pixel kerning value based on the font's size. (Fortunately, the font being used doesn't have any kerning pairs, which simplifies things a lot.)\n\nMeanwhile, does anyone have any idea how to parse a font file in php?\n\nThanks for your help.\n\np.s. Sorry if I'm posting in the wrong board.\n\n",

      "content": "Perhaps I'm missing something, or misunderstanding the question.\n\nIf the font has no kerning, there's nothing to identify. You could do your own kerning somehow. Or perhaps you really mean tracking, not kerning? (Kerning is adjusting spacing between individual letters based on their particular shapes, while tracking is adding or subtracting a standard amount of space to all the letters.)\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "No problem. Thanks for clarifying your question.\n\nWhat size range do you expect to be doing this with, and with what sorts of typefaces? Can you tell us more about the usage?\n\nAFAIK there is no standard for tracking based on type size. To the degree to which there is some consensus, I think it is that type on screen benefits from being looser than type in print at the same nominal size, particularly at text sizes.\n\nAnother consideration is that different typefaces may be designed for use at different sizes and for screen or print, and spaced appropriately. So for example Verdana is designed and spaced to be used on screen at typical text sizes, and is spaced appropriately loosely as a result. There are few situations in which I can easily imagine needing to increase tracking for Verdana. But there are many situations in which I could imagine doing the same for Times, Helvetica, or Arial.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

I'm simply working with BellCential-StdAddress at size 12 and size 20, but the technique I am working on is something I would reuse in the future on other typefaces at other sizes. So, I'm trying to get things right first time so that I can apply the technique to any font at any size.\n\nMy thoughts were that, if the font's default tracking was included within the font's file, it could be extracted and applied accordingly. I would have thought that tracking would be based on some kind of ratio to another metric of the font and I could then calculate a pixel equivalent based on those 2 pieces of information and the font size.\n\nThanks again for your help guys.\n\n"

      "content": "Actually, I think Kent is right, and you are probably actually wanting the sidebearings. That is, in the original font, how much space exists between the outline of each letter and the left and right edges of the space it occupies.\n\nIgnoring monospaced (typewriter style) fonts for a moment, this varies depending on the letter, based on underlying design characteristics of the letter. This info \\*is\\* in the original font, but in most formats it is only accessible by actually analyzing the outline structure of every glyph.\n\nMost applications setting text don't normally have to keep track of this themselves, even when creating bitmaps. They define where they want the text to start. Then they plop down a glyph. OS APIs tell them how much total space each glyph takes (including sidebearings), which is essentially how far to move to allow for the next glyph....\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

Values are given for each character, which include among other things, the leftmost point and the advance width, right? Couldn't a bounding box for an image be derived from that information, converting to pixels and rounding?\n\n-- K.\n\n"

So, advance to position leftx, draw (blit) the character, advance by WX. Properly scaled from 1000 units to the actual em-width in pixels, of course.\n\nYou cannot blit straightforward, because character boxes may overlap; however, that should not be beyond your capabilities :-)\n\nIf you can handle FreeType, this works in precisely the same way. Ask FT to draw a bitmap for a character, and it returns the very same values, together with a tightly cropped bitmap (you also have to position the bitmap vertically). You could ask the FT lib to re-generate the characters in your font to the same size, and store the values of interest. Then use the bitmaps you already have.\n\n[Add bonus points if you also use the _kerning_ values for micro-adjustments!]\n\n"

Of course, a loose Type 1 font in the wild may or may not have an AFM, and other formats won't; an OpenType font such as the one used in this case won't have an AFM. I am reasonably sure I remember some Adobe engineers having the same need and not having any way to get the info short of analyzing glyph outlines.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
