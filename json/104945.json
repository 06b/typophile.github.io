Overall design is close to [Radiant](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804171455/http:/typophile.com/wiki/%5Bhttp%3A/%252Fwww.myfonts.com/search/Radiant) but haven't found a close version. Agree also on angled finials.\n\nEDIT: just found [Magnesium](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804171455/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-magnesium). It has angled finials but contrast looks a bit off. May be reworked version of it?  \nThere are also [Euro Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804171455/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/euro-sans-pro) and [Peignot](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804171455/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/peignot) (of course).\n\n"
