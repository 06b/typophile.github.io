Years ago I remember a reason   \nfor doing this with Fontographer as there was a snag with   \ncertain Windows systems.   \n   \nRecently I've noticed my OpenType fonts not showing their   \naccented characters on the Myfonts.com server. I decomposed   \nthe accented glyphs and everything now appears.   \nIs this an OT thing? Fontlab?\n\n [‹ Romanian T comma Vs.
