  "content": "/// Due to popular demand! MyType has been extended to May 18th. ///\n\nthe exhibit will now show until Sunday, May 18th...make sure to check it out!  \ndesigner Noel Nanton will be closing the show with a talk about ’his’type...  \nSunday May 18th at 3pm, this is a free event.  \nsee below for MyType details and exhibit location...\n\n—-\n\ntypotherapy+design, Keep Six Contemporary Gallery and the Festival of  \nArchitecture and Design invite you to:\n\nMyType: An exhibit of limited-edition, new modernist  \nposters by graphic design genius Noel Nanton.\n\nExhibition dates: May 2- May 18th. 2008\n\nKeep Six Contemporary Gallery 938 Bathurst Street, Toronto, Canada.  \nFree Admission.\n\nFeaturing new fonts designed by typotherapy, eye-popping popsicle colours, bold abstract shapes, and a very new take on classic modernist typography.\n\nStarting with the premise that typefaces are as expressive as the words they form, typotherapy has created a series of large-format posters that explore the relationship between positive and negative space. Letters speak, and if you remove them from the constraints of sentences and even words, they have a language of their own.\n\nMyType uses the craft of typography to find new ways of speaking using fonts famous and unknown including Helvetica, Avant Garde and typotherapy creations like Tomeri and VWmobile.\n\nFor more information visit: [www.keep6c.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/www.keep6c.com/ \"www.keep6c.com\") and [www.toronto.ca/fad](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/www.toronto.ca/fad \"www.toronto.ca/fad\")  \nFor more new modernist design genius, visit: [www.typotherapy.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/www.typotherapy.com/ \"www.typotherapy.com\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MYTPE-07.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/typophile.com/files/MYTPE-07.jpg) | 170.79 KB |\n| [MYTPE-01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/typophile.com/files/MYTPE-01.jpg) | 110.96 KB |\n| [MYTPE-03.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/typophile.com/files/MYTPE-03.jpg) | 117.53 KB |\n| [MYTPE-06.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121114258/http:/typophile.com/files/MYTPE-06.jpg) | 90.68 KB |\n\n",
