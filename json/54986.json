  "content": "At a time of corporate downsizing and outsourcing, freelance writers have found a great way to protect and grow income. Why? Nowadays, successful freelance writing jobs offer the chance of earning a good income, while working from the comfort of home and spending less to get started.\n\nThe question now turns to how can an aspiring freelance writer be successful in such field? What are the basic tricks in becoming one of the next proficient and profit-generating freelance writers? Here are some tips:\n\n**Create a clear cut between work and home.**  \nIt’s always efficient to have a division between work and home although freelance writers do most of their task at home. It is advisable to have [a designated work space](http://web.archive.org/web/20110203052430/http:/www.aolcdn.com/living_nyny/103-home-office-space-12-438x328jf010207.jpg). An office or studio space outside of the house is preferable. If not possible, create a home office with a door is the next best option. If still not applicable, go to your local Pier 1 and buy a Chinese screen and section off a corner of a room and viola – an instant office.\n\n**Dress up and take off the pajamas.**  \nIt’s more inspiring to work if you’ll [dress like you’re going to the office](http://web.archive.org/web/20110203052430/http:/farm1.static.flickr.com/248/461497568_36f89065d6.jpg). Why? Because indeed you are. Even if your “office” is only your kitchen table, wearing regular work clothes puts you into the right mind-set.\n\n**Go to work on time.**  \nOne of the best things that freelance writers enjoy is the luxury of hassle-free commuting. However, this does not mean that you can go to work whatever time you’d like. You’ve already bought yourself a little time out of the travel-free set up of freelance writing. So go ahead and grab that extra cup of coffee but it’s better for your clients and personal sanity if you keep at a relatively [normal business hours](http://web.archive.org/web/20110203052430/http:/www.azsignshop.com/images/business-hours.gif).\n\n**Don’t watch TV while working.**  \nNever mix pleasure with business as they say. You’re working, so go and work. However, occasional naps are acceptable and a great way to be reminded that while you might not have a technical support, you still have a pretty awesome working life.\n\n**Have regular breaks and go out to lunch.**  \nWriting life, especially freelance writing life, can be isolating and tiring. And everybody knows that isolation can lead to one serious thing: insanity. So practice taking regular breaks just like what usual working people do. It is also ideal to go out to lunch sometimes so as to free and freshen up your mind.\n\nThere are a lot of other things that can contribute to being one of those successful [freelance writers](http://web.archive.org/web/20110203052430/http:/www.writers.ph/), like meeting deadlines and not annoying the clients. But those things are better figured out through experiences. In the meantime, put that remote control down and get to work.\n\n",
