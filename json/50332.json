Currently working on an assignment and desperate to find a newspaper which uses Bondoni as it’s primary font.\n\nAny other Bodoni examples, current or otherwise, would be very much appreciated.\n\nGoogle isn’t cutting it!\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ please help with what font this is?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009203335/http:/typophile.com/node/50344 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Probably gonna write a font manager for Windows... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009203335/http:/typophile.com/node/48494 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But it’s still found as headletter in some papers.\n\nThe Washington Post is still using a custom headline Bodoni that Matthew Carter designed for them, called Postoni. You can check it out at the Newseum.\n\n[http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=DC\\_WP&ref\\_pge=lst](http://web.archive.org/web/20081009203335/http:/www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=DC_WP&ref_pge=lst \"http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/hr.asp?fpVname=DC\\_WP&ref\\_pge=lst\")\n\nCan’t think of any others off the top of my head, but I’m sure others will chime in.\n\n— Kent.\n\n"
