  "content": "I have started looking at 15th Century Belgian/Flemish 'Burgandika' manuscripts in Boston area collections, the kind that Gerrit Noordzij recommends. I am of course looking for contextual alterations ligatures & so on. Has anybody on Typophile preceded me in looking at this stuff?\n\nI am also going to be looking at some Gutenburg pages for related reasons. What ligatures should I be on the look out for?\n\nCheers!\n\n",
