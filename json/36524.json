I can’t seem to find how to increase it further in the printer settings, and I can’t find any information about this online (maybe I’m asking the wrong questions and searching the wrong terms).\n\nDoes anyone know whether and how I might get the driver up to 1200dpi? Happy to provide additional information as needed. I’m using the latest stable build of Gutenprint (5.0.1) and Tiger on an Intel iMac 22”.\n\n [‹ Remarkable ‘value’ for money](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002010015/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36591 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Movies where type/graphic design is a plot element. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002010015/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36404 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
