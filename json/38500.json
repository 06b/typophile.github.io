Agreed a company should have a non-grunge logo in this day and age (and preferably one that’s not just 3 letters from a typeface), but you can’t always get them to update.\n\n"

I even have some old David Carson fonts which are unfortunately no longer for sale, and some of which are quite nice like Serifed Sans and Gangly. This sample doesn’t have that edgy DIY quality I associate with grunge, it just looks like crap.\n\n"
