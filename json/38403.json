  "content": "Hello.\n\nI am looking for the Equestrienne font in opentype format and cannot find a typeshop that offers that version. Do you happen to know of a shop that does?\n\nOR if you can recommend a font in that style... I've been looking for quite a while and can't find one. It should be fit for (rather cheap) newspaper-print and have that sublety in not being too harsh and not being to snobby. I am aware that you might not find it like that at all. But if you apply those attributes to that font, maybe you will know what I am looking for.\n\nThank you and all the best.\n\n",
