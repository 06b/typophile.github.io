When set at corresponding type sizes, they seem to be like brothers to me. (You think Slimbach had that in mind?)\n\n [‹ Baseline Grids Versus Margin Calculations](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022453/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42607 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Serif Companion for Trade Gothic Extended ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022453/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42616 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If Kepler in text is too florid for you, use Utopia.\n\nI actually think Veronika Burian’s Karmina works better as a companion to Meta than Meta Serif. Is that blasphemy? ;)\n\n"

I was just testing [Karmina on FontShop.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022453/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/typetogether/karmina_bundle/) this week and noticed some similarities to Meta Serif. They certainly have a similar structure. Karmina doesn’t pair better with Meta if you really use them side by side in a layout, but I share your love for it. I set the text of [Interrobang](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408022453/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Interrobang) 5 in Karmina and found it a pleasure to use.\n\n"
