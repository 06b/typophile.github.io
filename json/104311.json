So, I don't know if I can get closer to filling David Březina pockets by buying from Rosetta rather than MyFonts, but I'd think so. Any way to get more to him?\n\nTIA\n\nCharles\n\n",

I do not frequent Typophile lately, so feel free to get in touch via email [david@rosettatype.com](mailto:david@rosettatype.com), Twitter: @rosettatype or facebook.com/rosettatype .\n\nEven though I like MyFonts people, it is always best for the designers if you buy directly from Rosetta. Thanks for your consideration. I wish more people gave it a thought.\n\n@John: Principal, I like that! In Czech it refers specificaly to a circus principal which fits nicely.\n\n"
