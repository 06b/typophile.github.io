The 'Moderno' that is now the Typophile display font achieves this. In other words, it is possible to be 'smooth' in a certain sense, but not bland and average. My concern on this font of yours--and not others of yours like National or Meta Serif Black--is with uneven color. While I greatly respect the 'eyes' of others commenting in this thread, the fact is that Tiffany noticed something, too.

So it's not a matter of evening widths; it is a matter of their relationships.\n\nI'm can't tell you physically what it is, but I think I can see it when I put a letter between others, and play with its width and weights of strokes. I think it has to do with the overall density of the black (or white) within the advance width, but also it is affected by the distribution of weight in the letter.\n\nIt ends up with there being a relationship among widths within a design, where making some too narrow or wide in relation to the other disturbs the rhythm of the way they set, and makes words look not as good, even though the individual letters may look good.\n\nIt is related all the readability stuff I've been blathering about on typophile. Hopefully I'll very soon be able to give you a detailed illustration of how I've carried it out, but I think there are a lot of typefaces that do this quite well--including some of your own.\n\nKent, might you put up a scan of those you were referencing?\n\n"

I'm guessing that the Hardy's commission was a one-size-fits-all and was probably skewed toward display, since I imagine packaging will be a primary use.\n\nI think the even color you're looking for can also be a matter of distribution of weight as much as relative proportion. In a \"transitional\" style like Hardys there are some real challenges when trying to get good display qualities. The way that weight is carried on the shoulder of the arch letters (which tend to retain more oldstyle characteristics) vs. the weight around the \"corners\" of round letters (which are more upright in angle) can be a tricky balance to achieve while still retaining the style's essential qualities. Keeping contrast crisp for display exacerbates the problem, while reducing contrast for more sturdy text performance tends to ameliorate the issue.\n\nIf I get a chance later, perhaps I can get up a scan of some English Latins. But don't hold your breath. I don't know that they're that germane.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

I'm not clear about the point you're making, though.\n\nIn Baskerville, the stress is vertical, and the weight of the shoulders much reduced compared to old style. This goes together as both are a natural result of using the pointed pen--as I learned in the thread on that issue.\n\nIn Caslon's designs, the vertical o contradicts the slanted stress of the b d etc; its stress doesn't follow the rules of the broad pen held at a constant angle. This variation is a characteristic of what Bringhurst calls 'Baroque' faces, of which Caslon is an example.\n\nI agree with you that in a display face you can contradict good text rhythm for the sake of a gain in artistic or decorative effect. But I don't see the gain here. For example, in Hardy bold, I don't see the same problems in rhythm as in the regular. I don't see why the regular couldn't be the same...\n\n"

I didn't get that.\n\nI thought you were saying that the relative widths of some letters -- e a, for instance -- were too wide and caused uneven color. My point was that it might not be so much their relative width as choices in how the weight is handled.\n\nI can imagine pulling just a little more weight around the lower left, 7:00-8:00 region on the a c and e, for instance, without adjusting their relative width, and perhaps achieving more of what I think you're seeking.\n\nThe second part of my point was that doing this will subtly affect the nature of the stress in the glyphs. This will be negligible in a low contrast, text environment; but in a higher contrast, higher style, display environment, it will be more apparent and the choice of where to strike that balance may be different.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether in this case the Regular could be made more like the Bold in this way without losing something. One would have to try it out.\n\n-- Kent.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>not be so much their relative width as choices in how the weight is handled.\n\nYes, both weights and widths are involved. I just first noticed the a, that it pushed itself to my attention a little more, which is not so good. My first guess was that it is too wide. In general to improve color and rhythm, is a matter of playing with both weights and widths, and hopefully combination of them ends up working.\n\nKris, I wish I had a comprehensive theory, but I don't. I just have ideas, which I apply by trial and error. Some of the ideas are:\n\n1. Even color is paramount in the lower case of a text face, because uneven color constitutes 'noise' that interferes with readability. The idea is that the only thing that should be different are the shapes, and not the \\*apparent\\* darkness or lightness of any parts. This goal can't always be realized, as with the L an r, but closer is better.\n\nCaps, however, don't have to be even color with the lower case, since the caps are supposed to stick out as markers. Maybe for German even color between caps and lower case is more important--I don't know.\n\n2. Even color does involve the same black/white density within the advance width, in the x-height region, I suspect. The counters need some kind of harmony, but it's not a matter of strict equality, either in width or area. I can't characterize it more precisely, at least not yet.\n\n2. Often achieving even color often means more variation in among characters--a design that is less 'modular.' I have ideas on how to do this for the design I have been working on, and will put up an illustration after I finish the text size--I hope very soon!\n\n3. As a practical matter, as I work I compare on the screen the same words in my design and another typeface I think is very even. My main standard has been Adobe Garamond, but I have used others, including recently Kent's Whitman, which I think is admirable in that respect. It probably helps to have a design that is in the same general category, but the idea is \\*not\\* to match the design, but the evenness of the look.\n\nSome tricky stuff is going on with vertically divided letters, like a e s A E S. Generally, when you divide a space, the top half is going to be vertically smaller, and often narrower as well. That is often going to affect the counter, or how wide it will be. Generally, the whole thing seems to get narrower to look right; a's are usually narrower than n's or o's, I believe.\n\n"

I usually have several different styles open to compare mine to, not just Adobe Garamond. And I've not just re-spaced, but re-drawn in response to this comparative process.\n\nAlso, I don't think only old styles can have good color. Chronicle is an example of a recent 'Scotch' that I find strikingly well done as far as even color. And as I have said, I find Whitman also very good in that respect, and it also is not an old style. Moderno, now in our headings, is a display face, but it also is very even--even without kerning, which is pretty impressive.\n\n"

      "content": "Stefan,\n\nThanks. There's another important factor here, which is not my theory but that of David Kindersley. He wrote that there is a 'visual center' to a character, and that visual center needs to be equidistant from the side bearings to look balanced within words. The visual center is something like if the letter were solid, and you put it on a board, the visual center would be near where a fulcrum would have it balance. Except that the left and right extremes of the letter have more weight--Kindersley used the square of the area in a column slice of the letter (square of its weight, if solid), rather than just its area (weight).\n\nThere is another factor noted by others, which is that the spaces between letters need to look visually even. But the need for visual centering and for visually even spacing between different letters don't necessarily work together, so not every design will space well as far as even color.\n\nKindersley gives the interesting example of the L, and the often heavy serif at the end of the leg. What this heavy serif does is to shift the visual center of the L to the right. And that means that if you space the left side bearing of the L similar to the I, the L will look visually less unbalanced than it would without the serif. It still leaves a hole, unless you have an all caps setting very widely spaced, but it helps.\n\nKindersley's theory doesn't capture all that is going on visually, but it is a very interesting insight, I think. It shows that how you distribute the weight in the glyph affects how even the color will be, and how you should space it.\n\n"
