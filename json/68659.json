  "content": "Is there a 'correct' way to include spaces before and after items in a list (such as bullets)?\n\nI am working on a document that has a space of 12pt after each paragraph. I like the visual break this provides. Should I have a 12pt space after each item in the list? Sometimes this looks too much.\n\nI'm working to a 12pt baseline grid so it seems that the space should either be 12pt to match my grid, or nothing.\n\nAny tips/design examples?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for this, have given this a go and things are looking good.\n\nI'm wondering though if it matters that using 6pt after my bullets means that I can't snap them to my 12pt baseline grid. There seem to be a few flowon effects I'm not happy with.\n\nBasically, all of my headings and paragraphs (except my newly spaced bullets) are snapped to the baseline grid.\n\nUsing 6pt spacing means the bullets vary from the baseline grid. This looks OK to me, but it creates an inconsistency in the amount of space before headings and paragraphs directly below my bullet points, which are snapped to the baseline.\n\nIs this an issue? Is there another approach I could take with my paragraph spacing? I don’t really want to lose the nice structure my baseline grid provides.\n\n"
