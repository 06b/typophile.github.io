I thing his influence is a last 50%.\n\n-- [astype.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124091336/http:/www.astype.de/)--\n\n"

      "content": "So it's been over a year already?! Scary.\n\nOne of my students\\* is considering digitizing the Latin/Roman font cut by Hoell for Bremer. He says it's unlikely to go further than his own hard drive, but we agree that it might still be useful to research the rights situation (even though the design is over 80 years old) and/or find out if anybody has already digitized it. If things turn out to be sufficiently accomodating I'd like to encourage him to eventually release it, since it's a lustrous rara avis of a typeface.\n\n\\* [http://typophile.com/node/30444](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124091336/http:/typophile.com/node/30444 \"http://typophile.com/node/30444\")\n\nAny ideas?\n\nhhp\n\n"
