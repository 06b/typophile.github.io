My hope is to recreate a Jack Daniel's label with a dog twist called, Jack Spaniel's. As in a springer spaniel. Instead of 80 proof, it will be 80 woof. You get the idea. The bottle will be filled with ice tea.\n\nThere are what I believe to be, six different font types on this label. Any help is much appreciated.\n\n1- Every drop. . .  \n2- Sour Mash: Franklin Gothic  \n3- Whiskey  \n4- Jack Daniel Distillery: Clarendon Bold  \n5- 40% ALC BY VOL. . .  \n6- Here at the Jack Daniel. . .\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [JD label fonts.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072435/http:/typophile.com/files/JD%20label%20fonts.png) | 255.07 KB |\n\n",

HOWEVER, I noticed Monotype Grotesque [MT] Bold (not extended) has a C like the one on the label. Is the JD font an earlier version of Monotype's or is it another grotesque altogether? Why are the C's terminals differently fashioned for normal and extended?\n\n"
