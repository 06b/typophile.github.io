      "content": "This is really fantastic. I particularly like the A, the R, and the Q.\n\nThe asymmetric curve on the D, R, 2 and 5 is great. Have you considered working that same curve into the tail on the 6, 9, the parentheses, and the ampersand? I think it would work in those characters.\n\nIt might be the small point size, but the top of the D doesn't look like it gets completely horizontal, unlike the R, 2, or 5.\n\nThe middle of the S is too horizontal... it should be diagonal.\n\nI don't like the thin horizontals on the G and the J. The G could have an extra vertical going straight down in the lower right, or maybe just a square corner in the lower right. The J probably doesn't need a horizontal at all.\n\nThe W looks squished. Not sure how to fix that.\n\nOverall I think it's great. It's got a stencil, constructivist feel while being refreshing and different.\n\n"
