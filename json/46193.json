When I saw this for the first time, approximately 2 minutes ago, my first instinct was “is that some sort of font/wordmark?” With Phillip Morris footing the bill I’m positive they have a team of psychologists on this job.\n\nI am currently trying to find a good shot of this bar code, yet I have also come across certain variations. Lhe link at the top of the page is the one I just saw. It also appears on the backs of the pit crew’s shirts &c.\n\nCan anyone help crack this code?\n\n [‹ Quick Slab/Sans question](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628002022/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46185 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fonts scaling ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628002022/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46170 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If you click on the pictures below the text, you get them full size. Here is a grab. Those bars are everywhere, including on the helmet.

I think the idea is that the whole scheme is weird enough to be written about in the racing press, and enough fans will find out what the barcode and colors mean for this to be a relatively effective advertising campaign even without the Marlboro logo.\n\n"
