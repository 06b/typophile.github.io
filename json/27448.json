  "content": "So when I was studying in college, I once had some art director who was a special guest to my class get mad at me because I used dumb quotes (or a dumb apostrophe; whatever it’s called) in my design. From then on I’m always careful to try to make the right choice. Anyways, I’m doing a design for the community college and they use Futura Bold Condensed on a lot of their publications, so I thought I would use it as well, but the apostrophe is not curly. Would this be a safe decision?\n\n [‹ Portfolio Website Redesign (part deux)](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201122529/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21400 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Suggestions Needed ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201122529/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27375 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
