It's going to be for a blog that provides information on \"green\" services and what not in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.\n\nThe mark is Texas and the orange part represents DFW.\n\nNot sure if I feel satisfied about it, but she likes it.

I think you can alter its shape in a way that both perfects the balance of the mark and maintains the shape of the state. There's also something about the top left leaves that disrupt the balance.\n\nNice type. The kerning isn't so hot, though. Either tighten up \"reen\" to match the \"go\" and \"gr\" or loosen \"gog.\" I personally think the tighter version might look a bit better.\n\n"
