I am making a sign for a coworker for a fundraising event for her volunteer work in San Carlos, Costa Rica. I don't have a budget for this. Otherwise, I'd buy Fire House. Thanks!\n\n[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/firehouse.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20120225213417/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/firehouse.shtml \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/firehouse.shtml\")\n\nJosh\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120225213417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/firehousecharacters_3542.gif)\n\n",

You're probably not going to find anything that looks like Firehouse, or at the same level of quality, but then again, you get what you pay for.\n\n"

Adobe Wood Types are probably even cheaper than $30, it's the cost of a pair of socks. My system seems to have several, probably that came with some software; it can be hard to keep track, sometimes.\n\nA couple of links:  \n [http://simplythebest.net/fonts/western\\_fonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120225213417/http:/simplythebest.net/fonts/western_fonts.html)  \n [http://www.1001fonts.com/fonts\\_overview.html?page=1&category\\_id=28](http://web.archive.org/web/20120225213417/http:/www.1001fonts.com/fonts_overview.html?page=1&category_id=28 \"http://www.1001fonts.com/fonts\\_overview.html?page=1&category\\_id=28\")\n\nLiam\n\n--  \nAnkh on the Web: [http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120225213417/http:/www.holoweb.net/~liam/)  \nWords and pictures from old books: [http://www.fromoldbooks.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120225213417/http:/www.fromoldbooks.org/ \"http://www.fromoldbooks.org/\")\n\n"
