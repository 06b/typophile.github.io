  "content": "Hi Everybody:\n\nI got some great advice to post this question on the forum...so here goes:\n\nI apologize for being vague, but I have to. I have a client that has approached me to expand a font I had done some work on awhile back. Currently, the basic glyphs are being used but this font needs to be expanded to include a full character set including diacritics, loads of clean up, lots of hinting and so on so that it can be used in a video game. It's a well-known video game with multiple iterations.\n\nTo say the least I am excited to take on the project but I need to provide a price...this is where I am concerned. I want to price it fairly but I do not want to 'give it away' given that this is a well known brand and very well known video game.\n\nI am not looking to retain rights to the font.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas as what my mindset needs to be, hoe I should be thinking about pricing this?\n\nThoughts?\n\n",

      "content": "I find that type of job is the most difficult to price. If I'm working on a font I get to keep/sell after the job is done, I charge less, about a fifth of the exclusive price. If it ends up being more work that I expected, I don't feel ripped off because I can make if back in the following decades of font sales.\n\nBut these jobs where I don't get to keep the font afterward, I'm just clocking in hours. Of course, no client is ever satisfied compensating for hours; they want a number up front. The time on a font can vary so much so it's really tough to do a proper estimate from the initial description. The solution that's worked well for me for non-exclusive or fonts the client owns is to offer free test work. I give a really vague price range just to see if they're expectations are reasonable. I explain that there's no obligation to pay for the test font. If it's non exclusive, it's still mine and if it's not then it's not my problem. Be clear about that in your negotiations.\n\nThe test font: It depends on the job but in general, I create a few letters, let the client test it on their equipment, do some test hinting, kerning on those letters, weight tests etc. If they bail out at that point, you've lost hour of two of work and there should be no hard feelings. I've done about 80 custom font jobs over the last decade and nobody's ever bailed out on me. Okay, one guy. I could have spent those hours negotiating the price, working on contracts, sending emails back and forth and it would have been time wasted anyway. I prefer to spend my time in FontLab instead of on the phone or Gmail.\n\nBy the time I've gone back and forth and have a working test font, I have a very clear idea of how much work is involved in the project and I can give them a proper price quote. I don't need to crank it up to allow for overruns. I can make a fair price. How much they've budgeted for their work or how deep their pockets appear to be shouldn't matter. Work is work: if you crank up the price based on what the client seems to be willing to pay . . . then I don't like you. I get paid what I'm worth. If it's too steep, they can try someone else. A lawyer? How annoying for the client. How annoying for me. How nice for the lawyers. I just set my price, set my terms and do the work and get paid. Maybe some of you think that's a naive way to do business but it works. Apart from the rights to the font (a separate matter) there's never been a need for me to use a lawyer. My client is a customer. Unless they've actually violated an agreement, there's no need to go down that road.\n\nMaybe some people have had bad experiences with clients but I've never had a problem . . . except that one guy. I get the final quote to the client within days, not weeks, I get the job done and money in my account. The test font allows the client to do some early testing and in some cases it can vastly change the scope of the project. Clients often think they know what they need and find out later that they need something different. It happens a lot, actually.\n\nOnce in a while, a job goes a bit longer than I had anticipated. Sometimes, shorter. Time spent on fonts is time spent building my skills/speed, not time wasted. A few times I've asked a client for more because the scope of a job changed and they've always agreed.\n\nThat's my angle anyway and my experience with it has been very good. 10 years, and about 80 jobs.\n\n"

      "content": "I guess I gtt what you're saying but it still doesn't make much sense to me to quote a price that way. Fonts are (in my experience) commissioned to be used as tools. Tools to make headlines or hey, even art. Maybe some of them could be vanity pieces but I've never seen it. You brought up art but I'm specifically talking about font design: I don't know anything about art pricing.\n\nI think clients deserve something better than a quote based on gut instinct about how I \"feel\" about the use of a font. I think it's unprofessional and similar to market vendors who size up their customers wallets and making up a price. That's what you can be if you like. If you're asking \"what's your budget for this project?\" you're no better than a weasley used car dealer, in my mind anyway. Yeah,k I'm judgmental about that kind of thing. If a store has no price tags, I'm out of there.\n\nI price separate aspects of the job: work and licensing. When I sell fonts through a vendor, I don't charge more based on \"far reaching\" or artistic. A customer might be using it for a dog food label, album cover or a lost dog poster. I charge based on the number of users, just like MyFonts.com and other vendors. It's consistent and to me, consistent pricing is fair. If the fonts are going to be included with software or whatever, there's a custom contract involved and a system to deal with that. Often the licensing cost is higher than the work cost.\n\nLicensing and work: two different things. Licensing doesn't affect the work cost.\n\nWork is worth $X.  \nLicensing the font is worth $Y  \nIf lawyers have to get involved in licensing details then of course, that has to be taken into consideration.\n\nI charge the client $X+$Y\n\nThere is a \"giant mega-company\" extra charge but I'll get to that later. It has nothing to do with how deep their pockets are.\n\nIf the work is non-exclusive and it's only going to be used by 1-5 users, the extra charge for licensing is around the standard retail price. So for a single font for a single user, the licensing aspect might only crank up the cost by $20. Most clients want a site license for a custom font, so I adjust the licensing cost. If they're going to include it with software, they want to sell it, I factor that into the licensing cost.\n\nI don't think this model would work for exclusive fonts, but I wouldn't know as I don't do exclusives.\n\n\"well, that indicates to me that you would charge the exact same to a cash-poor client as you charged a client with deep pockets. it’s ok with me if you do that.\"\n\nWell, I would hope so. When a rich guy walks shops at Wal-Mart, they don't charge more. If Bill Gates wants to commission a font for a lost dog poster, I'm not going to charge him more. If you don't keep those costs separate, work and licencing, at least in your own mind when you're quoting, then you're not being professional, or ethical. It's a simplistic model; I'm sure other people have much more elaborate pricing systems. But, at the very least, the very least keep those two aspects separate.\n\nBut there is something to charging more for larger companies. The bigger they are, the longer they take to pay. Small-medium company: you get your check the next week. Big company: add 6 months at least. They also require reams of paperwork. You invoice, they want a work order. Then they want an invoice again. Then they want tax forms and it goes on and on. So, you can work for days just on the paperwork. With small companies it's usually just an invoice and check sent within a week of job completion. But this type of charge should be reasonable. It's not thousands of dollars of inconvenience to have to sign a ton of forms and wait for a check. Hundreds, sure but not thousands.\n\n"
