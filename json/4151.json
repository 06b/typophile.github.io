It looks like a typeface from the 19th century, (Midolle, Silvestre or Klimsch). A \"Dover\" book perhaps? Any information would be appreciated.\n\n [‹ Type ID.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709010539/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44917 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for the font that has this \"W\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709010539/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44893 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
