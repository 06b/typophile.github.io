  "content": "After a stint of some headline serif (and false-serif) fonts, I went to the opposite direction to neutral sans serif, and drew a font to resemble Helvetica. I made an effort not to look at any samples of Helvetica during this (pretty much impossible to do these days, I found out).\n\nHere is the result of my week:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415024848im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tacit_4950.png)\n  \nI was surprised how ingrained the basic Helvetica(ish) shapes were in my head. And I was also surprised how wide the basic Helvetica is; my design is almost condenced (well; I'm a Finn, so narrow typefaces come naturally to me). None of the glyphs are an exact match to Helvetica, but the overall look comes pretty damned close. Some glyphs I decided to make clearly different. Some of the glyphs were a bugger to draw; this sort of neutral design allows very little bumping…\n\nI also made an alternate two-storey g and a single-storey a.\n\nSome glyphs still need a lot of work, but overall it's starting to be representable.\n\nWhat's your opinion?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Tacit.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415024848/http:/typophile.com/files/Tacit.pdf) | 153.36 KB |\n| [Tacit2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415024848/http:/typophile.com/files/Tacit2.pdf) | 161.27 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks, guys-\n\nAlternate g is way too narrow. Single-storey is too wide, and that terminal is too high as well. Lc s is wobbly in way too many directions. Needs a lot of work. If I remember correctly, Helvetica has pretty pointy quotation marks as well. I went with round punctuation.\n\nMore to follow.\n\n"

      "content": "Slow down, Tomi!\n\n- Tittle on i is too small and close  \n- t is very narrow  \n- Bicameral g is from a totally different font (reverse italic)  \n- 8 does not relate to construction of other characters  \n- % does not require ligature (Is that what this is called in this instance?) IMHO  \n- Inside of n too symmetrical  \n- w is black  \n- Helvetica comparison is undue (stronger influence of contemporary fonts)\n\nI think with a font like this you must spend many months as the originality of  \nthe design is not the main concern and cannot deflect attention from the quality.  \nI have noticed you draw very quickly but… Hare and the tortoise with some things.\n\nBest wishes\n\n"
