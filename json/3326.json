      "content": "Hello Aka, nice work and nice type face.   \nI would like to make some reflection about some points.   \n   \n1) Your symbol ($) it fells like a sans serif apparence, I think that must be follow the same felling of the rest of your letters (serif).   \n   \n2) Why you use a capital letter on lowercase (e)? you didn't repeat the same idea on other part, and probably fells like stange I think.   \n   \n3) I think your leg on l/c letter (h) is very interesting but why you don't apply on (m,n,u)?   \n   \n4) Take a look on your capitals about the serifs, for the exemple: the letter (H) don't have any serif, or like (X) all parts of the letter have serifs. You must uniformaty all parts to don't fell strange when combine together.   \n   \n5) I don't know if is a good idea you put only a serif on [], probably will make some confusion I think.   \n   \nSo I don't have more coments to tell for now and I would like to read more sugestions from the others ( I'll wait for Hrant too) to make clear better my sugestions. See you soon and tell me what you think about all this sugestions. Sorry about my inglish and if you didn't understand any part of my text, tell me.   \n   \nRegards to you and to all typophile friends / Ricardo\n\n"

At the first time, I thought the e would be great if its SC like. And can make Djohar more unique faces. But I guess I'll work on that again.   \n3. You are right about the h. I kinda like it when I designed that. But I don't know if m,n,u can have the same aura if I made it like the h. Guy's help me....   \n4. Good point Santos   \n5. At the first time, I thought it would be great if the [] stay the same. I think it gave the [] a contemporer aura. But then,...I'll think about it Santos.   \n   \nWow, guys it took time for me too fix this experimental face, cause I'm still studying in college. Oh by the way Santos, the face still in vector format. I haven't convert it to type file.   \nSorry...maybe I can't make a sample text with Djohar... \\< ![:(](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723170249im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \nBut I'll try.   \n   \nWarm regards   \n+ep+\n\n"

      "content": "Eka, sorry for the delay.   \n   \nI think there's a lot -too much- going on in this very pretty face, even for display use - even though I think the basic design could even be made into a text face.   \n   \nYou have case-mixing, funky half-serifs and unorthodox structures all rolled into one. One thing you can do is leverage that and go to an extreme (which probably appeals to your obvious playfulness), but Grunge is dying, so unless you're doing this mostly for your own pleasure, don't go there. If you want many other people to use the font, I'd advise toning things down, but maybe providing many alternates.   \n   \nSo, what to keep and what to dump? I think a good conceptual model for you is Democratica\\*: it's structurally unorthodox, but manages to seem both authentic as well as \\*natural\\*. I think the secret is the finish: it has the superficial appearance of a normal font - so I think you need full serifs everywhere on Djohar, but you should use funky structures to make it unique; this might include UC forms, but don't use them gratuitously - only for a reason. Like your lc \"c\" is right on, but I'm not sure about the \"e\".   \n   \n\\* [http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=89](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723170249/http:/www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=89)   \n   \nSome specifics in the lc:   \n\"a\": narrower   \n\"g\": funkier   \n\"h\": wonderful   \n\"y\": too scripty   \n   \nThe caps present an interesting problem: since they're used a lot less (about 5% of text), you have a lot more freedom, so you might want to make those structures especially funky - but make sure they'll still work harmoniously in all-caps setting - it won't be easy. Specifically, I think your UC \"M\" is super, but as sexy as that \"S\" is, it's too much here. Overall, your caps need a lot more work than the lc.   \n   \nOther glyphs: your \"?\" is delicious; the \"&\" could be much stranger.   \n   \nOne last thing: your contours are wobbly, but I'm not sure that's a bad thing here.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The caps need a lot of work. I agree. Other suggestion too. I think I need to be more focus next time.   \nbtw thanks Hrant.\n\n"
