  "content": "I'm looking for a font similar to the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream font. I realize the font was originally hand drawn by a Ben & Jerry's former Design Director (and named after her). As the company grew, she couldn't keep up with all the writing, so her hand lettering was converted to a computer format. It is a proprietary font, owned by Ben & Jerry's and is not available for sale or downloading. But does anyone have any idea as to what font would look similar\n\n",
