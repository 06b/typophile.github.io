It was issued in the mid 1970s (when the first Star Trek movie was barely a glimmer in Gene Roddenberry's eye), and most of it was based on the original TV show, which at the time was gaining in popularity thanks to syndicated re-runs. Some of the material, though, like the banners of the star systems that belonged to Star Fleet, was either new or previously unpublished. The same people who created the Star Fleet manual (Franz Joseph Designs) also came up with complete blueprints of the U.S.S. Enterprise from the original show.\n\n"
