I think ITC New Baskerville looks pretty close, based on the Q tail shape, although the tail of your 'a' seems a bit more vertical than the sample in the book I'm looking at. There are a lot of Baskervilles, and I'm having trouble getting MyFonts to open, or I would search with this sample text for a closer match.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
