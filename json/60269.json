I suspect the blind would prefer something that is quick and easy to use.\n\nAlso, define calendar. Today it can be a list of days, weeks, and months, or something that one puts appoints into (Outlook Calendar).\n\nMight as well define blind as well, since there are the totally blind, and those who have limited vision, yet are legally blind.\n\n"

My father was basically blind in one eye as a result of an eye injury in the war so I had a teeny bit of sensibilty about this dilemma. To this day my eyes are so empathetic that if some ones tears up I am a goner. After a couple of weeks of talk I asked my friend what he felt he missed in the seeing world. To my surprise he said \"NOTHING.\" He loved textures, things he could feel, touch and smell. Well that was all I needed. I started bring him things that I found interesting to touch and smell. He said the nastiest thing was a wet spent Hibiscus blossom, the best smell was a Gardenia bloom and his girlfriends body was the best sensation in the world.\n\nThanks for dredging up that friendship, he has since passed away.\n\nTexture and odor might be the way to go.\n\nIt's odd now that I have typed this I remember I did a cover and inside lettering for a book by Random House called \"The Stinky Book.\" Loaded with scratch and sniff....... what fun : )\n\nMichael\n\n"
