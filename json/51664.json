      "content": "Jan,\n\nVery close, thanks. The S&W type has older looking, more rounded off serifs. Is there an older predecessor to Clearface that might be closer? Also, in order to get the yellow (Clearface) to be close to the underlying (blue) original, I did a LOT of horizontal scaling, kerning and even baseline shifting.\n\nFor perspective though, S&W told me they use Garamond Bold to approximate it. It doesn't.\n\nThanks for the input!\n\nJoshua\n\n"

In 1978, under license from ATF, the International Typeface Corporation commissioned Vic Caruso to develop it into a family of four weights with corresponding italics. ... And then it went digital. So, transformations happened.\n\nTo answer your questions: Not in digital form.\n\n"
