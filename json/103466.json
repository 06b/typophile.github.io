      "content": "I agree with Nick.  \nAlso, consider the size of the letters. I can't see a letterpress machine with huge fonts in a battle zone in WWII.  \nOn the other hand, I expect that some soldiers had sign writing/showcard experience could have whipped this up. Many took pride in the regularity of their lettering. They would use many sources as their models. The lettering is a pastiche of easy to draw styles of the era.  \nThe F in \"Fighting\" is interesting. A source font?  \nDon\n\n"
