(See the circled panel in the screenshot below for Hoefler Text.)   \n   \n ![Glyph Variant Screenshot](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191038im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/33144.gif)   \n   \n [Apple's docs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191038/http:/developer.apple.com/fonts/Registry/index.html) are far from clear on how to add this. In the Morph Input File (MIF), I have used \"Character Alternates\" (Namecode 17, also visible as a closed panel in the screen shot above) to define sets of alternate glyphs, but that doesn't give me the fancy pop-ups that are context-sensitive to the selected characters, only radio buttons to identify alternate character sets.   \n   \nI'd appreciate any tips.   \n   \nCheers,   \nBrent\n\n",

If you compare creating typographic OT features with FontLab and typographic AAT features with command line tool provided by Apple, it's not strange, that hardly nobody is working with AAT fonts.

I've done work with them, but not by choice: the client needed AAT tables in the font. Even then, we had to have Dave Opstad (ex-Apple font guy) help us with the state tables for contextual substitutions. I understand the tools have improved a bit since then, but they're still nothing like as easy as making OT in FontLab or VOLT, nor even as easy as making a Graphite font with SIL's own text based tools.\n\n"
