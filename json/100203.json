A version of the font that is not quite so wide.\n\nDispatch extended is a bit more narrow, and closer to what I am looking for, but not quite there yet.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/dispatch/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419024900/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/dispatch/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/dispatch/\")\n\nAny thoughts? I'm thinking it may be easiest to just modify Dispatch.\n\n",

Frankly I'm personally not against that sort of thing, as long as: you make dead sure it doesn't leave your drive; if it does leak out, be prepared to face the consequences. Also, make sure you don't just do a mechanical narrowing - all kinds of things will go wrong.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "The thing is, you don't actually _buy_ a font (unless you commission a custom typeface) you merely license it, according to certain terms. See section 3 here:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/help/singleuserlicense/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419024900/http:/www.fontbureau.com/help/singleuserlicense/ \"http://www.fontbureau.com/help/singleuserlicense/\")\n\nThings used to be more lenient, but sadly no-mod clauses have become the norm now. I say sadly, because I believe it's disrespectful of the precedents any type design is inescapably based on.\n\nFYI, Adobe is one of the few foundries that still allows modification. If you're likely to want/need to modify a typeface, buy Adobe. Unless you're like me and you think it's worth taking a risk/responsibility anyway.\n\nhhp\n\n"
