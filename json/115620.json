Also, could be my eyes but a bit confused by the kerning on 'CHROMEO' which looks kind of weird/amateurish/absent (which could be the earmark of a freebie). Letter width looks also unconsistent, /H and /M looking weird among the others... A way to answer could be to [buy last issue](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072746/http:/pocketmags.com/viewmagazine.aspx?titleid=2086&title=Be+Street) and inspect PDF type properties...  \nSome alternatives: [Europa](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072746/http:/www.europatype.com/articledetail/17), [Nevis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072746/http:/www.tenbytwenty.com/nevis.php), [Circe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072746/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/circe), [Hurme Geometric Sans 4](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317072746/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hurme-design/hurme-geometric-sans-4)\n\n"
