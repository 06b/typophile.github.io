The events, [Design for Publishing](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713055858/http:/brandperfect.org/index.php/component/events/?view=eventdetails&id=7) and [Adventures in Publishing](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713055858/http:/brandperfect.org/index.php/component/events/?view=eventdetails&id=6), are intended for senior management, designers and developers working in brands and agencies who want to sharpen their creative skills and deliver compelling cross-platform brand strategies.\n\nThe first event, Design for Publishing, will be held Feb. 6 at New York’s Studio Arte, featuring an evening of discussion on the latest strategies for delivering great multi-channel reading experiences and improving the performance of advertising in publishing. Celebrated publishing designers including Mario Garcia and Robert Newman will share their perspectives on the intersection of design and technology, and how that is influencing publishing and the publishing culture.\n\nThe signature Brand Perfect event, Adventures in Publishing, will be held Feb. 8 at the Condé Nast Building. Bringing together leaders from the publishing and technology fields, the day-long event will include a master class that will help attendees create an advertising and content strategy, and learn how publishers can deliver a seamless brand experience regardless of where customers begin their journey.\n\nCameron Connors, executive director of The Studio at Condé Nast, and Wyatt Mitchell, creative director of The New Yorker, will deliver the keynote address, sharing how a leading publisher has taken its brand across media formats to deliver successful campaigns and interactions, wherever the reader engages. Read the Brand Perfect interview with Connors [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713055858/http:/brandperfect.org/index.php/knowledge/interviews/350-interview-cameron-connors-conde-nast), in which he explains how the proliferation of mobile devices and platforms has changed the user experience and inspired his team to broaden its technical and design expertise.\n\nJennifer Eldin of American Express OPEN will describe how the community she created is helping small business owners succeed by evolving from a campaign-based mindset to a community-oriented digital newsroom. Katrina Dodd, consultant for Contagious Communications will shed light on the rapidly evolving publishing industry, where established players find themselves competing for customer loyalty with tech companies, start-ups and authors.  \nThe event also will feature Dan Rhatigan, type director at Monotype , who will lead The Brand Perfect Master Class. Attendees will experience a hands-on exercise that walks them through the multi-disciplinary process of conceptualizing and designing a brief suitable for cross-media execution.\n\nAttendees will apply lessons from the master class to support the INSP (International Network of Street Papers), an organization that supports and develops over 120 street press projects in 40 countries to create employment and training opportunities for homeless people. Delegates will pool their talents to create a brand experience for INSP that can be carried across different platforms. The brief will be critiqued by Brand Perfect community design and development experts Chris Liu and Jesús Gorriti of Fjord.\n\nAbout Brand Perfect  \nBrand Perfect is a Monotype initiative that serves as a collaborative think tank to help brands learn new cross-media marketing techniques.
