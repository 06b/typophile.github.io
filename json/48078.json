      "content": "James, I will be interested to hear what you learn and how your thinking evolves. Without knowing anything about it at all, I have never been comfortable with the idea that Underground developed from calligraphy. It doesn't look like a calligraphic typeface to me -- does it look like Flora to you? Just because the caps are proportioned less rigidly than in conventional grotesques does not somehow endow this typeface with calligraphic value. Johnston was a great calligrapher. So what? I think the sources are more likely to be found more widely in art nouveau and art deco.\n\nI also object to the idea that calligraphy is, necessarily, in and of itself, a desirable influence on type.\n\nAnd finally I am uncomfortable with the designation 'humanist'. This is a warm, fuzzy word that implies that there is something 'human' rather than machine-like about a type. You constantly read, in font PR, about 'warm, humanist touches' in this that or the other typeface. OK to have PR, but let's not fall into the trap of believing it.\n\nThe word itself was developed to contrast not with the machine but with the divine, and the OED, as yet, has not recognized the use of the word in typography. (OED3 draft)\n\nIn my sometime role as reader for the OED, I will be sending my editor there a note on this because like it or not, the word has been used extensively in writing about type. Any help identifying sources for the earliest quotations using the word in its typographic sense would be greatly appreciated.\n\nIn this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/node/35213](http://web.archive.org/web/20110218134550/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35213 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/35213\")\n\nthere is a fair share of nonsense. When Updike, a tremendously careful writer who would never introduce a novel term without defining it, spoke of humanist influences, he will have been using the word properly, something like 'the system of the Humanists, the study of the Roman and Greek classics which came into vogue at the Renascence' or 'Pertaining to or characteristic of the humanists or classical scholars of the Renascence; classical.'\n\nIt's not always easy to know what people meant when they said it.\n\nAnd type people, the divine Bringhurst not excepted, have taken too many unnecessary liberties with the language in late years.\n\nIt would be great if you could separate some of the wheat from some of the chaff. Stone has really been studying this topic. I would contact him directly.\n\nI think I know what happened to 'humanist' in type. Someone, too clever by half (maybe Updike?) used the term humanist to refer vaguely to Renaissance-style proportioning of letters. The usage was picked up by someone who was at a loss to describe the Johnston sans serif caps. Others, not so clever, picked up on it, or, on the other hand, spotting a great potential PR manoeuver, said, what the hell, let's go with it, even if it is daffy. It works! (and it does)\n\nThe thing is, when you use the word 'humanist' today, to people who don't know that all it really means is 'not Godly', it has enormous cachet, enormous allure.\n\nBut I am firmly of the opinion that the first thing we should do in talking about type is to reject cute neologisms. Just because one has thought of them or found them clever doesn't mean they are good enough to be used in our discourse. I am so glad that I haven't heard Bringhurst's 'bicameral' lately, but maybe I haven't been reading Typophile enough. Or is his influence on the wane? A fabulous book, but ... trust the language. I don't like special vocabulary in philosophy any more than I like it in type, or in any field. Plain English is good enough for me!\n\n"

During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the great bulk of all known classical literature, both Greek and Roman, came from the press. Although printing was not an Italian invention, most of the first editions of the classics were printed in Italy until about the time of the Sack of Rome. The greatest of the early Italian printers was Aldo Manuzio of Venice ....\n\nhumanist in type really does seem inseparable from Aldine.\n\nBut I thought Morison et al. did a lot of work to show that why what Aldus and his lot did was so great was that it \\_rejected\\_ the calligraphic in favour of the purely \\_typographical\\_. So we go back to the earliest cap inscriptions . . . . which are not calligraphic.\n\n"

The reflects the views of other historians, which he references. The origin of the Carolingian minuscule is undoubtedly calligraphic or chirographic, pen-driven. However, in the 15th century it was modified to make it less calligraphic, influenced by the Imperial capitals, and I think Jenson and Griffo made it less pen drawn in ways that made roman type more even in color and readable.\n\nThis makes sans in turn influenced by Jenson and Griffo's proportions only remotely derived from the pen. Still, the pen is an important \"underlying force\" (as van Krimpen put it) in the letter shapes. At least that's my story, and I'm sticking to it :)\n\n"

I suspect that you'd get several very different answers from Frutiger, Meier, Zapf, Johnston and Stone regarding the specific models that influenced their typefaces. Specifically we know it was stone inscriptional lettering Zapf built Optima on, And I think Meier has referred to renaissance typefaces in discussing Syntax. Frutiger I very much doubt was looking at anything scribal. At the time, Frutiger was a very unusual hybrid of type forms. I actually think none of your examples are very closely related to anything scribal, they are probably all more related to other types. I especially think \"handwriting\" is not an appropriate term if you are trying to trace influences in these specific types.\n\n\"Humanist sans\" probably is meant to suggest that the structure follows the Aldine, renaissance, or whatever you want to call those classic proportions.

That alone is enough to put a big dent in any claim that Gill Sans is significantly humanist, renaissance, Aldine, anything but what it is, a stylish clone of Johnston. Why do we have to be more serious about it? We're in constant danger of looking silly when we read too much into Johnston/Gill Sans, etc. See Walter Tracy, Letters of Credit, as I recall, for the quotation and illustration.\n\nGood heavens, everyone wanted to get the hand out of anything to do with Gill.

I don't make claims for the oprimacy of this. But I also reject the idea that another definition has primacy either. At least not yet.\n\nI do think that given the squishy nature of the specialist terms you have to accept that unless & until you develop a body of shared terms with another type designer where you know what they mean & they you ( a shared or mutual set of definitions or touch-stones) you will not be able to use the terms all that effectively.

You could reply that the terms oldstyle and modern are, albeit a few degrees less, also value-laden. So what's the problem with Aldine and Didone? Except that neither is useful in classifying a sans. Sans serif classification is tough.\n\nI find Peter's view difficult to accept. There is no sans serif that has anything like the contrast of a broad pen penstroke. The first thing one learns in designing a sans is that there is only so much contrast the vernacular will allow, and it is small.\n\nRobert Slimbach said that Chronos was not a clone of Today Sans Serif because to the extent he drew over Today, he drew over it with a felt pen and then digitized the results. Be that as it may, the two typefaces are remarkably similar. To speak of one as pen-derived and the other as not would be stretching it.\n\nMy view is that if a humanist sans has diagonal stress -- which it needn't at all have to enjoy this classification - - it derives its stress from Aldine letters, and only therefore quite indirectly from the pen. I still don't see how any sans serif comes from the pen, except for those with absolutely calligraphic italics.\n\nBy the way, Today Sans was the first sans superfamily, not, as Martin Majoor claims, Scala Sans.\n\nBy the way, if there's something intrinsically humanist about a sans roman, such as, presumably, Frutiger, and you then slant the roman to get the italic, what is it about the slanted version of the italic that is not humanist -- except in the mind of a PR guru? At just what degree of slant did it lose its humanity? For, as we know, the only italics that count as humanist are those that are explicitly calligraphic or, in practice, chancery-derived.\n\nThere's another point where the humanist label fails. Strictly speaking, it ought to mean the same thing for an italic and for a roman, yet it doesn't. Indeed, it ought, probably, to apply either to the hand-derived 15th century italics, OR to the 15th century purely typographic romans, considering that they were not, then, when humanism was actually happening, paired types, but entirely separate types. When you try to use the label for both, it's particularly difficult to tell what you might be meaning by it.\n\n"

Everything you need to know about the difference between 'grotesque' and 'humanist' sans is shown there. What is important to understanding the difference is what happens in the rest of the cube, because the contrast of the actual sans letters is so low that the stroke dynamic isn't obvious. But once you see the whole picture, you realise that ‘grotesque' sans correspond to the construction of expansion based stroke letters, while ‘humanist' sans correspond to the construction of translation based stroke letters. Sans serif letters are, apart from their obvious lack of serifs, typically letters with greatly reduced stroke contrast. But if one takes letters created with a split nib pen (expansion stroke, ‘modern', ‘didone', ‘romantic') and systematically reduces their contrast one ends up with a grotesque sans. If one starts with letters created with a broad nib (translation stroke, ‘humanist', ‘garalde', ‘renaissance') and similarly reduce the contrast one ends up with a humanist sans.\n\nThe terminology that we apply to these forms is cultural and, hence, freighted with associations (as you note with regard to ‘static' and ‘dynamic').

Bringhurst calls them Realist. Than there is the Geometric Modernist sans which takes the Realist sans and applies geometric rules of construction associated with the perfect circle and the square. Finally the Humanist sans substitutes a pre-Modern (in the Oldstyle / Transitional / Modern sense) contrast styling for the Modernist contrast styling of the traditional or Realist sans in some or all of the letters.\n\nThe descriptive protocols for contrast implicit in the cube provide an important handle on gauging formal features.\n\n"

If you look at the wonderful books that Scangraphic published to announce Today, you will see that Küster very definitely was working with the forms of the Bembo typeface which he loved and had spent much loving time redigitizing for Scangraphic.\n\nI would argue, however, that Küster's goal was to put as much of Bembo as he could into a sans serif _whilst remaining within the vernacular parameters established by the 19th century gothics_. These parameters are strict in my view, applying to many specific shapes, contrast, stroke weight, x-height, and more.\n\nHowever, it would be best to get his own, or Albert-Jan Pool's input on this. Last I heard, Albert-Jan was on vacation, so he might not be available for comment just now.\n\nAn even more extraordinary adventure to the extreme of what is possible with the fixed vernacular we have been handed down from the 19th century is Unger's magnificent typeface Argo.\n\nKüster looked at Bembo; Unger looked at Electra and Swift, which is his contemplation of Electra. (This is not strictly my view; it is Unger's view which I have direct from him; Carl Crossgrove, my duenna, has been seeking confirmation from Interpol; we hourly await his results.) None of these people seem to have been interested in nibs, broad-based or otherwise, or any of these other far-fetched rationalizations. And Frutiger, as Nick Shinn has helped me to understand, is an absolutely unique event in type that really does represent an original break with the past.\n\nOne of the problems with this thread is that everybody is trying to discover things about typefaces without asking the people who designed them what was going on in their heads at the time.

That is perhaps the main reason why they are no longer so popular. Unger has utilized some of the best of Dwiggins's ideas, and successfully applied them to digital type.

It is the translation stroke contrast of the renaissance formal manuscript bookhand. This of course is parachirographically interpreted by punchcutters, is translated into a new medium, but the most distinctive characteristic of these shapes -- when contrasted with those derived from the expansion stroke contrast of the romantic period -- is their open forms, which are evident in both manuscript hand and type. The relatively closed forms of the romantic and post-romantic types (Didot, Bodoni, Walbaum, the various Scotch Romans) -- which is translated into post-romantic sans serif types -- are interesting because they are not _determined_ by the split nib, but they are enabled by it and they become a primary characteristic of the late 18th and 19th century styles, again in both formal writing and in type.\n\nSo I'm basically in agreement with you, Bill, about the contribution of the shape and proportion of humanist serif letters to the character of 'humanist' sans, but want to draw attention to where those shapes and proportions came from.\n\nThe proof of the pudding is in trying to write a Scotch Roman letter such as a lowercase e with a broad nib pen and a fixed translation stroke (a really skilled calligrapher could fake it reasonably well with some rotation and/or a nasta'liq lift). The lower right terminal will always end up heavy instead of the characteristic hairline of the Scotch type, which is only possible in the expansion stroke model. To avoid this heaviness with a translation stroke, you have to avoid closing the shape, hence the open forms of the humanist bookhand, which become the open forms of the renaissance typefaces, and then become the open forms of the 'humanist' sans serif types.\n\n"

I believe that almost all type design is parachirographic in one way or another -- which is not to say that it must be so --, while very little type design is purely chirographic (implying direct reproduction in type of handwritten forms). In parachirographic type design, the structure and characteristics of written forms, as derived from gesture and tool, are referenced but are modified by the designer to achieve either stylistic or technical goals (adapting shapes for size-specific designs is an obvious example).

Other parameters are low contrast and absence of stress._\n\nThe 'absence of stress' is a function of low contrast; in fact, there are few designs with a complete absence of stress, since there are few designs with a complete lack of contrast. As soon as you have any contrast at all, you introduce stress, however minimal or even optically unapparent. Why are almost all sans serif types low contrast? I think basically because that's the only way you can make stable letters with straight, serifless stems. Once the serifs are gone, the thin stems become unstable, they either need to be flared as in Optima, or they need to be made heavier. If you make them heavier, you start to close up the inside of the letter, so you compensate by making the thick stems lighter, and hey presto you have a low contrast letter.\n\nThe x-height issue is an interesting one. I think it is worth noting that, prior to the revival of renaissance type styles in the 20th century, x-heights had, on average, been getting larger for a period of 250 years. After Garamond, they could hardly have gotten smaller! By the time Scotch Roman and 'Egyptian' types develop in the 19th century, their x-height is pretty large, so there is a direct precursor in serif type to the large x-height of the post-romantic sans. There is also a practical consideration that arises in the Egyptian slab serif style and which applies also to sans: once you start increasing the weight of thin strokes to reduce overall contrast, you need to make room for them vertically. This is especially the case for letters like a and e, in which the only way to keep the counters open as the stroke weight is increased is to make them taller. Although 'humanist' letterforms are typically more open, they are also subject to this condition when their stroke contrast is reduced, and so they share a similarly large x-height in their sans guise.\n\n"

That first line of text breaks so perfectly..._de rigueur._ The attention to detail--everything working together meticulously--holds one's attention, assures its readability.\n\nThe overall effect is pointedly anti-chirographic. The cool, understated neo-classicism of the layout has the quality of ancient Roman lapidary inscriptions. At the same time, the neatness of the type's impression has the quality of high-tech engineering, not the pen. One finds the same fusion of ancient and modern in the origins of the sans serif, contemporary, so it would appear to be a driving force.\n\nWhen the pendulum swung the other way later in the 19th century, the context was a Morrisonian disgust with industrialism. No humanist sans serif just then, as the sans genre itself was too tainted by its association with the modern world. When modernism became acceptable again, c.1930, there was really no call for an organic, chirographic-looking sans serif, as that rather defeated the purpose of the new modernity. So when did it become acceptable for a sans serif to overtly reference chirography?\n\nWell, I don't think the pioneering \"humanist\" faces did that. They were referencing the organic and hand-made, but not necessarily the pen. Although they may have employed forms that are chirographic, that was incidental. Consider Eras. It was originally designed in the 1960s, and has never been touted as a humanist face, as far as I am aware. If anything, the sophistication of its drawing gave it a very sleek and streamlined up-to-date look.\n\nSorry James, I must echo Bill's first post, that the \"development of sans serif humanist type\" is a pretty weak and haphazard concept, prior to the influence of Gerrit Noordzij.
