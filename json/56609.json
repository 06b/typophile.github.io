      "content": "It's called \"Marble Heart\", and it was an ATF typeface, based on an 1870s type called \"Gothic Double Shade\" from the Boston Type Foundry (which was an ATF predecessor). this info comes from Mac McGrew's great book on American Metal Typefaces. It is also shown in the Solotype Catalog & the Phil's Photo \"Homage to the Alphabet\" book, which means it made it into film type. There is a similar style called Orleans Open that was digitized by FontBank as \"OldWest\", but I do not think I know of a digital verson of Marble Heart. Maybe Mark Simonson or Mike F. would know.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Don,\n\nThe original mission of The Type Heritage Project [THP] was to publish a series of textbooks illustrating at least 1,500 already-existing digital revivals of display types originating c1800-WWI:  \n [http://typeheritage.com/textbooks/overview/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420022543/http:/typeheritage.com/textbooks/overview/ \"http://typeheritage.com/textbooks/overview/\")\n\nIn the planning process, I realized the importance of preserving as many of these gems as possible--before maintainable letterpress equipment becomes any scarcer! The THP forum website recruits, coordinates and supports volunteer partners committed to THP's second mission:  \n [http://forums.typeheritage.com/undigitized/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420022543/http:/forums.typeheritage.com/undigitized/ \"http://forums.typeheritage.com/undigitized/\")\n\nSo far, THP partners have produced hundreds of new revivals:  \n [http://forums.typeheritage.com/status/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420022543/http:/forums.typeheritage.com/status/ \"http://forums.typeheritage.com/status/\")\n\n\"Margarethe\" is a revival of Marble Heart including a super-rare lower case perhaps not shown by ATF. It was renamed because  \nI must [reluctantly!] advise revival developers to do so:  \n [http://forums.typeheritage.com/topic/legalities/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420022543/http:/forums.typeheritage.com/topic/legalities/ \"http://forums.typeheritage.com/topic/legalities/\")\n\nLater this year, THP will launch an eCommerce font boutique specializing in revivals and others drawn from historical  \nmaterials. A semi-functional model may be previewed here:  \n [http://www.vixemporium.com/fontcart/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420022543/http:/www.vixemporium.com/fontcart/ \"http://www.vixemporium.com/fontcart/\")\n\nUntil then, these fonts are not available unless the partners decide to offer them elsewhere.\n\nAnna\n\n"

People who are not part of your project also find the old typefaces interesting and will probably produce their own versions for sale in the near future, since they see nothing in the marketplace.  \nDon\n\n"
