Although a mountain is cliché for climbing I wonder what other images might be more evocative and keep some of the mystery of the legend whole.

All the climbing brands I have looked are mainly badly done or too serious, unlike skate boarding and snowboarding brands who have a really fun universe around them. For the Nepalese flavor, its a climbing group in Belgium... and I don't think they even know that the yeti is a legend from Nepal. I will keep your advice in mind and try to think about maybe a softer visual element.\n\nThank you so much for comment.\n\nJeo324  \nI'm definitely going to try out what you said. The backpack idea is really great. Thanks !\n\n"

Thanks\n\n@jupiterboy: I agree (if i understood correctly) that there might be too much detail on the yeti for a logo.. but when i put it in small the details are less seen but its still understood that its a yeti (i think). I did think about what it would look like on clothes and in packaging and thats why i went in this direction too, i thought i might be able to have more fun with it .. Skate style but i might be wrong. Thanks again for your advice and your little trial :)\n\n@evanbron: Hey thanks for your comment number three might be the right way to go. And for the borders I'm trying out some things at the moment. I'll post them later it would be great if you could let me know what you think about them once they are up!\n\n@altaira: This is a project for my final year jury. So its not actually going to be done unless the company wants to buy it off me. The group that created this brand are 4 quite young flemish guys that are all about the outdoor. They actually kinda look like the yeti :) same attitude at least. Also with the \"mean\" yeti I'm trying to pass the idea of toughness. The group do events as well... like climbing the Mont Blanc.. its not for anybody. The age group is between 17 till late 30's and older if your still fit enough.  \nI tired a few things with a yeti foot. But it was even more literal that doing a yeti... and gave off less attitude. The foot prints from Tintin are to cartoon like I find, but I am working on a yeti version more like the yeti in that comic. Thanks for the comments!\n\n"

The cameo around the Yeti dictates a centered layout, but when the type is mechanically centered, **OUTDOOR** looks wrong because of the shape of the. **Y** , so you ended up moving **OUTDOOR** to the right.  \nMaybe you could replace the cameo with a border around the whole logo?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082056im_/http:/typophile.com/files/YETI_5598.jpg)\n  \nThe border draws the eye away from the shape of the **Y** , so **OUTDOOR** can be centered and still look right. \n"

The bouldering scene (one form of climbing) leans towards the skate style, and sport climbing is getting there, traditional climbing is a little more/over serious. I guess I am trying to say that there are 3 major divisions in climbing and they are each marketed very differently. Ive also noticed a difference between companies that make gear (hardware) and companies that make colthes (software).\n\nI like the mean yeti, number three in particular.
