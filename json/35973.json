FontShop Berlin has quite hefty PDF specimens for [at least some] of the FF families available for download. These help convince clients much more.\n\nAlso, one may try contacting the foundry directly. Even if the foundry in question does not distribute fonts to designers for test purposes (many do if you ask a detailed, specific question, BTW), they may be willing to set some sample text from you or the client into a PDF for you.\n\n"
