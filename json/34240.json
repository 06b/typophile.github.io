Oh and another thing... AT&T/Cingular was rated poorest in service by Consumer Reports. T-Mobile being the best for GSM is my choice.\n\nLike others have mentioned, the version 2.0 will probably be better. And one thing that bugs me about Apple's new devices is the screen aspect ratio is not compatible with the HD 16:9 standard. Jobs at one time proclaimed the year of high-def but that never came to fruition in their products.\n\nI still like my free Nokia phone too...\n\nMikey\n\n"
