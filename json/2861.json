The whole thing has been converted to curves and lc x-height, baseline shift and squooshing� freely manipulated.   \n   \nGetting the slant angle right obviously depends on having exactly the right x-height, tracking/kerning and squoosh�, which I think are all a bit off in my attempt.   \n   \nEDIT: It may of course have started with a different cut of Palace Script.\\</font\\>\\</font\\>\n\n"

Well, either way, still, registration is done. :-)   \n   \nAnd, jack K. davidson, no, no need to say sorry, absolutely, not at all, please! :-) I mean, it wasn't even about your comment in itself, which I fully respect. (Your words only stated an opinion. Something to which every person is entitled to. Or ought to be anyway. Sadly enough our world doesn't always roll in the right direction, but, that's another story of course...) It was more the fact of... well, of someone (in the case, you) recognizing the \"source\" of the logo I presented... It just felt like, in that moment, the spotlight had turned on, pointing right at me, and saying: \"So, you like Gyllene Tider!\", if you understand what I mean? :-) And, truth is, I am not that much fond of being in the spotlight really... :-) As I said, actually I'm rather a shy person... discrete... reserved... And although yes, indeed I do follow and enjoy the work of the Swedish music artists Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson, also true is that I keep it as something... well, personal... personal to the point of blushing, when it is noticed, yeah, oh dear, do I feel ashamed... :-) So I guess in the end the blushing did \"denounce\" me, huh? :-) Yes, you reckon right, caught me there. ;-) Sandra is the name. (Although... a guy is entitled to blush too... isn't he? ;-)) And also to you I thank for all the kindness. But please, please don't say sorry, there's no reason for that. At all! :-)   \n   \nAnd so now, and if may, I'd then like to request your help on trying to identify another font. Off to start a new thread then. And thank you. :-)\n\n"
