I do not have the typeface, installed on my machine, that is...i just saw it on my friend's machine, he gave me the name, FF Confidential, and I googled it because he didn't remember where he got it. I posted the first link I found, for illustration purposes only. I dont even want this particular font...I just want to know what typeface it is derived from and maybe a link to where I can purchase it. If anyone can help, please do.  \nCheers\n\n"
