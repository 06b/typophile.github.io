  "content": "I’m looking for some opinion on a choice of font for a book of poems. The mood of the book is somewhat despondent; poems of death, holocaust, graveyards, historical references to gruesome battles and struggles of faith. I’m thinking along the lines of Vendetta. Minion is too generic, Warnock is too happy. Fairfield is nice but it feels too much like old literature.\n\nI guess I want something with a just bit of an edge to it, but not so much as to distract from the reading.\n\nIt’s a book of poems, not a novel, so pure function isn’t so important.\n\nTell me if you think Vendetta, or someting like it might work. Any other suggestions are welcome!\n\nThanks\n\n",

It’s more like he’s writing about these things from a distance, honestly, but with a certain degree of animosity.\n\nEldorado Micro is a bit too much, but the roman is quit fine. I love the hand-crafted feel of it. And Prospera is worth trying out for sure. Does the Prospera family contain more glyphs than the website shows?\n\n"

      "content": "Vendetta seems like quite a good choice. But I’m also getting this feeling that you need two distinct voices: something coarse but well-proportioned like Vendetta; but also something clinical and austere, like a Didone, an old-fashioned one, somewhat archaic, maybe turn-of-the-century French. As G W Ovink said\\*, “Bodoni is an admirable letter for a death notice!” The trick though would be choose two fonts that both contrast and match.\n\n\\* Actually, that’s a collage of two of his phrases.\n\nhhp\n\n"
