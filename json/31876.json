  "content": "Hey guys! I have this project for my typography class that I need help with. We were assigned to design a poster for an art gallery exhibition on a typographer and I need help coming up with a concept and also a tag line/slogan. The typographer that I have is [Paul Renner](http://web.archive.org/web/20120627031420/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Renner), the guy who designed [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20120627031420/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura). Any ideas would be great and would be a big help!\n\n",

      "content": "Well one of my ideas that I have is sort of focus on the way Futura is used a lot on identities of fashion lines like Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein and D&G. Also I noticed that It's also used on perfumes by Britney Spears and J.Lo and as well as in Ikea catalogs and many other magazine ads. I need a slogan/tag line that would tie those in together.\n\n"
