  "content": "Good evening all.\n\nSo I know henna is a medium, not a style, but I'm wondering if anyone can help recommend an ornamental font (not lettering, but that might be interesting too) that evokes the traditional style of arab and/or asian body art. It needn't necessarily be authentic, just evokative.\n\nSo far I've come up with Altemus Arabesques;\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/altemus/arabesques/altemus-arabesques/charm...](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114042448/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/altemus/arabesques/altemus-arabesques/charmap.html \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/altemus/arabesques/altemus-arabesques/charmap.html\")\n\nwhich I think is interesting. Anybody else had fun/been inspired by this kind of work?\n\nTa,  \nAnthony\n\n",

[Olduvai](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114042448/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000054) also has some of that feel.  \nTim\n\n"
