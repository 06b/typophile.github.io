It's a bit crude, but reasonably close.   \n   \nI just remembered another one: [Magnesium](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516142249/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?CFID=100108&CFTOKEN=34681066&SKU=MB30109). It has the right overall feel, but some of the details (like the poiny A and N) are different.\n\n"
