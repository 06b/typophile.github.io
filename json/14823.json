The process is that I receive pictures that I will then deconstruct and try to read their meanings from there through typography I will design a visual representation of what I found. If you are interested let me know. Thanks.  \nReading into images\n\n",

      "content": "I am a student of the University of Wollongong studying Graphic Design. I am in my final year of study and am doing a Major Project. I am interested in type so I decided to explore type through an investigative process. My aim is too see how I can generate a type by being influenced by things outside my control. That is why I am asking for a photo from a random source. I thought that Typophile would be a good place to start seeing as though it is a forum for people interested in typography.  \nAll that has to happen is you send me a photograph of whatever you want, I will try to then use this photograph to inform my typeface. The pic would have to be at a res of around 200-300 and at a standard photograph dimension of 8” X 10”.  \nIf your interested my e-mail is [jlm80@uow.edu.au](mailto:jlm80@uow.edu.au)\n\n"
