  "content": "I am looking for reversed out versions of Helvetica and Garamond to mix with black on type in a document (long story short the client wants an interim document between two editions that indicates the areas that have changed and it must be possible to photcopy on a monotone copier). Failing Helvetica and Garamond any sans and serif could do. I know Linotype used to do a version of Helvetica and Univers Bold Reverse, ideally I would need a family though.  \nThanks in advance with fingers crossed,  \nTim\n\n",

Hence the reason for the lack of reversed-out fonts from major foundries—there just isn’t an industry demand for them.\n\nThe only old technology work-around font that I am readily aware of is [Neue Helvetica 75 Bold Outline](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109113309/http:/www.linotype.com/13619/neuehelvetica75boldoutline-font.html). But who needs that is this day and age… just about every DTP app can display an outlined version of the font.\n\nI’m glad tht you found a work-around in Quark.  \n\\_\\_  \n [www.typeoff.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109113309/http:/www.typeoff.de/)\n\n"

For example, the German and Polish copyright laws allow fonts to be converted of modified “to achieve interoperability with other software programs”.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\nPs.
