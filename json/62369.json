The options for good-looking, functional online fonts are limited, and issues of licensing are complicated. But as more and more design is created for the web, the importance of great type online—and the need for it—is only growing.\n\nIn this presentation, type designer Christian Schwartz will address the pressing problem of type for the web. He’ll look at the pros and cons of the different ways to implement non-standard type choices on the web, and discuss why @font-face still isn’t ready for prime time. And he’ll offer a peek at the future of type on the web.\n\nTo register to attend this presentation, follow this link:\n\n[http://www.printmag.com/Article/September-29-Fonts-that-click](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134541/http:/www.printmag.com/Article/September-29-Fonts-that-click \"http://www.printmag.com/Article/September-29-Fonts-that-click\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103134541im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Sept29_Print_image_200_6340.jpg)\n\n",
