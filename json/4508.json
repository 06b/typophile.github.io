Any feedback or ideas, there is a lot of work still to be done. ![MachineMan Curves](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023125147im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34495.gif)   \n   \nOh and great forums by the way!!!! I just found this site, and I'm whiling away my lunch hour as we speak (or as I speak rather)\n\n",

      "content": "Nothing here especially sings to me, and it could stand a little cleaning up, but I'd say it's   \nworth tinkering with. I'd start by thickening up the lines. It looks like your **i** has disappeared?   \nMaybe in making the graphic?   \n   \nHalf of the bottom of your **s** is gone too. That makes it unique among this alphabet. (The **c**  \ndoes it too, but at the top, so the theme isn't nearly as obvious, if you see what I mean.) Do   \nyou want to include more of that theme? If not, then I probably wouldn't apply the idea to   \nonly one letter. I'd either develop it more or eliminate it.   \n   \nThe lower half of your **g** looks too deep to me, like it descends too far.   \n   \nBut then, I'm a rank amateur around here. There are lots of other folks who have lots more   \nexperience and critical acclaim for their work than I do.\n\n"
