  "content": "After a long time I decided to revise and finish a typeface I worked on a while ago. My intention was to make it suitable for small sizes from about 7 to 9 points. Hope you like it.\n\nBy the way: It is named after a character of The Godfather. Just like my other typeface Im working on at the moment [http://typophile.com/node/55850](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202033/http:/typophile.com/node/55850 \"http://typophile.com/node/55850\").\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Fredo.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202033/http:/typophile.com/files/Fredo.pdf) | 83.98 KB |\n| [Fredo-002.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202033/http:/typophile.com/files/Fredo-002.pdf) | 84.56 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Very good. I think the \"g\" is a little to narrow and timid, actually. And the thinness of the verticals of \"4\" and \"7\" is perhaps more suitable for a display typeface than for one intended for footnotes.\n\nThere's something very familiar with the top serifs of mnpr and the ascending glyphs ... Mercury Text, perhaps? That's not a problem, but I somehow feel that serif is vaguely out of context with the rest of the typeface, but that might just be me.\n\n"

Mainly changing some sidebearings and making the inktraps a bit wider. Think it is a bit more readable now in smaller sizes.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202033im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Z%C3%BCgel_3598.jpg)\n\nThe top one is the old. I widend the g, broadend the ? and gave the letters like Z etc a sharp inner corner.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417202033im_/http:/typophile.com/files/0123456789_5519.jpg)\n\nAlthough I changed the numerals a bit and added old style numerals\n\n"

Lowercase w is a slight bit narrow too? And I'd make the tail on the comma a tiny bit longer. Bottom of G looks a bit heavy? And perhaps the terminal of the tail on y could be heavier?\n\n"
