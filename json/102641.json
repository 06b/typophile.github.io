It's late, I'm tired, my eyes are getting blurry and a proofing deadline looms...\n\nThe kicker is that this looks so familiar - I just KNOW I've seen it somewhere, but do you think I can remember? (Of course not...)\n\nAnyone have any ideas what font this is?\n\nThanks in advance for any replies :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130526010824im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SampleText_6744.jpg)\n\n",
