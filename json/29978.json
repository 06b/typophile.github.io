Honda’s is a slab serif.  \nGuessing from the range of brands they are more sports/commuter-oriented than customs (Harley-like). Have you any thoughts about the logo is it going to be just type or have a mark as well?\n\nTim\n\n"

      "content": "As I see it there are two ways to go here. Either you design something entierly new without inheritance from earlier motorcycle logos or you go for the similarity...\n\nIf you go for similarity the brands you mentioned above are (according to me) slightly more \"modern\" than for example Harley Davidson or Triumph. I would go for a fat and wide font like Annonce from Canada Type ore something like that. Something with impact.
