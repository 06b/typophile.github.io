  "content": "Hi All...\n\nDoes anyone know if it's possibly to open and edit a protected font??\n\nI am not trying to ruin anything or stealing any fonts, but i am working on a major global Agency and at our Korean office they have been so smart to buy a otherwise great font called YoonGothic..\n\nMy problem and the reason why i need to edit it is it simply don't contain ® (Registreded R)  \nWhich is quiet a big problem since we are doing work on an strongly legal controlled client..\n\nI have change designed and changed font's with Typetool3 and Fontlab Studio before, but this font i am not able to open up and re-design...\n\nI know a lot of people might think that what i am doing is wrong but consider this, how can a professional font design company make a font with roughly 8700 characters not not design a ®... especially when thinking of the Korean office have bought 35 licenses at a pretty hefty price..\n\nThanks in Advance  \nNicklas\n\n",

Fontforge (a free/open-source font editor) might also be able to handle a font of that size.\n\nBut if you’ve bought 35 licenses of what I imagine was a very expensive typeface I think you should call up the vendor and ask them to do it.\n\n"

Like you say, probably should have been in there from the beginning. I think it's a reasonable request.\n\nIt certainly can't hurt to ask, and might be the most effective way to get this done.\n\n"

      "content": "I wonder if SING (Smart Independent Glyphlets) technology will help, depending on which applications you are using.\n\nI trust your Korean office will be able to handle any requests to Yoon Design. But it might help to tell them that supplying missing glyphs upon request of clients is part of the 'global standard'. Let me know in case you need help with translation.\n\nAre you pairing Yoon Gothic with another font for the Latin or are you just using the default Latin provided with it? In the case of the former, you would just use the ® in the Latin font. If the font will be used for bilingual text, not just the occasional Latin acronyms thrown in a mostly Korean text, then it will be worth considering using a Latin-specific font compatible with Yoon Gothic anyway.\n\nBy the way, what 'version' of Yoon Gothic are you using? The latest is the 500 range, and though I haven't used it, it's possible that they have added some character support. But admittedly, character support has not been Yoon Design's strong suit compared to rival Korean foundries (8700 characters means no Chinese character support and only the most commonly-used modern Korean characters).\n\n"
