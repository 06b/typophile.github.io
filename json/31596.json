I can see the name in the font list but when I select it the font doesn't change and that font style is removed from the font list. I know this could be any number of things, but are there thing I should be checking when I generate the fonts. I've generated the PS font family which works fine on both platforms.\n\nc.\n\n",

Sometimes it helps to delete the font, and install it again. And also make sure the Adobe apps are not running while installing the fonts. Normally that shouldn't matter, but unfortunately it does. For me, anyway. :)\n\n"
