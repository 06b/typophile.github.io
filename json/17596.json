These scripts have been developed for the way that I work, so your milage with them may vary. Currently they have all been tested with [FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102736/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontLab) 4 and [RoboFab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102736/http:/typophile.com/wiki/RoboFab) 1.1 on the Mac. There are scripts for automatic placing of accents, dealing with development VFB files with lots of overlaps and composites, quickly generating multiple [instances](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102736/http:/typophile.com/wiki/instances) of a [MultipleMaster](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102736/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MultipleMaster) typeface for testing, and a couple of other things.\n\nThe scripts can be found at [http://www.benkiel.com/typeDesign/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102736/http:/www.benkiel.com/typeDesign/ \"http://www.benkiel.com/typeDesign/\")\n\n",

I didn't realize I needed it, but smile every time I save a minute. The accent generator is also useful and I'm experimenting with tayloring it to my own workflow.\n\nCan you tell us a little more about your workflow with accent glyphs?\n\nThanks!  \nRandy\n\n"

      "content": "_Randy:_  \nI create my accented glyphs as one of the later things I do in a design. Once I've designed the accents, tested them briefly with Spanish, German, and French, and feel that they are appropriate weight and size, I start placing anchors for everything. This usually takes a bit of time to get right, as deciding what the optical centers for your glyphs and accents are is more of an art than a strict number. To help speed placing along, I start with anchors in the center of the glyph (halfway from furthest left edge to the furthest right edge). The scripts for placing anchors does this automatically for me. I then check and adjust as need be. Depending on the design of the typeface this can be a lot of adjustment or not so much adjustment (geometric Sans? very simple. very calligraphic Roman? lots of adjustment).\n\nWith my anchors placed, I run my script and start to check the glyphs. Some accents, such as the cedilla and ogonek, need to be further incorporated into the design. Most glyph, however, if the anchors were placed well, are done.\n\nI sometimes go a bit overboard and do accent designs for capitals, lowercase, and small capitals. That's why my script allows one to have different designs for each: otherwise creating all of those glyphs by hand would take far too long.\n\n"
