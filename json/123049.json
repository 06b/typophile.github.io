Most of their works are hand-drawn or (heavily) customization of existing typefaces ('Easy Tiger', 'Stag', 'Forestbound', 'Patagonia', 'Hufnagel'... see [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317071232/http:/www.google.fr/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=site:typophile.com/node+everitt) for previous discussions).\n\n"
