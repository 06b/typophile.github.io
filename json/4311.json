I was hoping to get a better impression of how it is best used (being myself very much a typography amateur), so any examples would be much appreciated. Also, is there a good bundle of fonts where Wilke is included?   \n   \nHere is a link to the Linotype library:   \n   \n [http://www.linotype.com/1609/wilke-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050902040501/http:/www.linotype.com/1609/wilke-family.html)   \n   \nBest,   \n   \nAlois\n\n",

      "content": "I've always wanted to play around with Wilke, but never had a project where it was appropriate. That's a big problem with Wilke; it has a lot of \"flavor\" so you need a project where being that flavorful is okay, and that particular flavor fits.   \n   \nIf \"Cthulhu by Gaslight\" were to get re-issued, Wilke would be perfect for that. It's a horror role-playing game set in the Victorian era, and typically in England.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
