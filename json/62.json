They have also added ranging & non-ranging figures (numerals). I haven't had an opportunity to completely look through the changes. They discussed it in their latest issue of their magazine. (which by the way has amazing music to boot!)\n\n"

But, I like to think that I'm not such a bad designer that I can't set some type into paragraphs. I like to work with the text and finesse it into what I deem to be a \\*rocking set of lines made of type.\\*   \n   \nThat said, is there anyway to educate those of us (whom obviously have much more to learn) who do not understand the finer points of a well-spaced face? (By means both visual and textual?) Instead of just saying \"it's pretty bad\"? (no insult, just curiousity. ;-) Hi Hrant!)\n\n"

Maybe in another place/time.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

That said, the spacing really isn't bad as lots of people have made it out to be.   \n   \nBut worrying about the spacing might be useless, since I think Mrs Eaves could never be a book typeface in the first place. Too exaggerated.   \n   \nThere is mention of an upcoming OpenType version.\n\n"
