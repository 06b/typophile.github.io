      "content": "hmm...   \n   \n I don't know what to say. I think maybe you want to   \nscrap it, and start anew. Do you want to capture the   \nmeaning of the word at all in the letterforms you   \ndesign? The geometric shapes work for a construction   \ncompany, but not for communications,and not divine.   \n   \n The forms are looking very randomly generated to me.   \nThe \"E\" is very squared off. It bothers me the most.   \nI can almost make it say diving. The \"V\" and second \"I\" are   \nmost proportionate, so if you continue, I would work off of   \nthose 2 letters. just duplicate the second \"I\" for the first.   \nThe \"D,N,E\" must be condensed. Overall,   \n#5 shows the most promise.   \n   \n There is really not enough playing going on. Maybe   \ndraw, scan and trace for a bit before digitizing?   \n   \nWhy did you choose the word Divine? I am also curious.   \nI'd like to see the final version of any progression   \nyou decide to make.   \n   \nGood Luck,   \n   \nAndrew\n\n"

      "content": "Yves:   \n   \nAs I mentioned in my first posting and as Andrew confirmed, these letterforms are not yet closely related. It looks like at least three different typefaces have been thrown into the mix. In addition it doesn't look like there has been an attempt to equalize their weight.   \n   \nI agree with Kemie, therefore, I disagree with Andrew regarding the appropriateness of the look. I think the forms, although somewhat unrelated to each other, do a pretty good job capturing the concept of divinity. I think you just need to focus in on one of the forms and make sure the rest work with it.   \n   \nLike Darrel, I mentioned previously that the \"i's\" dots are too light. The squared dots that Adriano illustrated work better, but considering the word you might try finding a dingbat to use as the dots\n\n"
