  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking for a geometricish sans that has display qualities similar to Futura, but has text qualities like Frutiger. Preferably available in a family with a range of weights from Light to Black, and presence of hanging figures.\n\nAny suggestions? :)\n\nBest,  \nArtur\n\n",

Once you found your way throught the various OpenType Stylistic Subsets, Hypatia Sans will turn out to be a very [versatile system](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106223646/http:/typophile.com/node/33619).\n\nF\n\n"
