When I saw the book icon you designed I immediately though of the top of a carousel.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108205041im_/http:/typophile.com/files/book_5001.png)\n\nI think you need to adjust the letter spacing.. a lot. Also, I don't really like the O's. I think it would look better if the O's were more round. That way it would create a repetition with the O in the icon.\n\nJust a thought.\n\n"
