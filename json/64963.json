I had an idea to add a section to my portfolio where I don't show finished work, but rather specific skills. It's just going to be a small section where I can show things like before and after pictures of color correction, illustration, etc. I am not a type designer but would like to show some sort of type treatment as well. Does anyone have an idea of a type exercise that might be good in this context? As always, I appreciate any advice you have to offer.\n\n",

Might make for a very nice before-and-after. And you could even discuss the process/result right here.\n\n\\* I've recently started doing that even in large headlines when there is time – convert to outlines and make ligatures, alternates, flourishes… Who says fonts need to be set the way they come out of the box!\n\n"

I like the logo idea, I've done plenty of logos before but using type exclusively and modifying it might be a good exercise for this. Thanks for the help.\n\n"
