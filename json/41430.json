  "content": "from the website:  \nOn December 17, 1987, we formed the Tokyo Type Directors Club (Tokyo TDC) to realize our vision, which was to firmly establish the field of \"typedirection.\" This discipline would involve extensive and deep searches into the visual expressions of letters, going far beyond conventional character designing. The primary activities of our club include an annual international design competition, the publication of the yearbook and the production of exhibitions. Embracing free-flowing ideas, flexible rules and a perceptive eye for quality, we hope to continue to provide an environment that inspires and nurtures new artistic energy.\n\nURL: [http://www.tdctokyo.org/index\\_e.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010202431/http:/www.tdctokyo.org/index_e.html \"http://www.tdctokyo.org/index\\_e.html\")\n\n",
