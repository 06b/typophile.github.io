Now that I've done that I think the \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", \"Y\", \"v\", and \"w\" seem a little out of place. Maybe even the \"m\", \"n\", and \"r\". I like the characters on their own, but just not sure they fit. Hum, maybe even the \"G\", \"3\", and \"4\". The compact version needs some kerning, maybe that has something to do with it...\n\n"
