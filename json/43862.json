They've been around for 18 years and have performed for U.S. Presidents, etc., and even sang the national anthem for one of the Final Four games last year.\n\nI've already started setting type for the project, using Helvetica Neue Ultra Light for the headlines and Helvetica Light for the body, but I'm still open to suggestions. My boss hasn't seen it yet. ;-)\n\n"
