  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m redesigning a business card for some interior designers. I had already designed their logo (approximately 5 years ago) and they’re still happy with it & so am I. I’m using these business cards as my first step towards the new direction - so it would be great if you can critique the cards along with the overall look.\n\nI always flexed the use of whitespace along with grey type. I will be staying in this direction.\n\nOne of the new elements I want to introduce (and get your opinion on) is the halftone usage on the left of the cards. My goal was to simulate a snowfall - I didn’t want to put the elements at the top of the card, I found it would be too literal.\n\nI want to introduce the halftone as embossing, debossing or spot varnish. However, the cards will be uncoated, I’m not sure if I can use a spot varnish. Although I appreciate being subtle with the halftone, I’m wondering if it will show enough.\n\nAnyways, I appreciate any help or commentary!\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Igloo-Concept1b.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208085219/http:/typophile.com/files/Igloo-Concept1b.jpg) | 100.4 KB |\n\n [‹ Wordmark critique please](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208085219/http:/typophile.com/node/52195 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Talking Heads ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208085219/http:/typophile.com/node/52242 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If it were to say _igloodsgn_ I’d have to read it as ’igloo desugun’ which I would interpret as design!\n\nLooks decent, I believe it needs more contrast to be readable, but instead of toning it up to a black, why not tone it up to that medium blue you see in the shadows of snow.\n\nIf this is about igloos the thing ought to use the same colours as snow anyway right?\n\n"
