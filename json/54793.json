  "content": "Can anyone tell me where to get the best version of Akzidenz Grotesk? When I was in school I had some Font Pusher student load like 9274908347 gigs of type onto my computer and with it came 928752 versions of the face. Now that I am a professional I would like to have a legal copy for my own use. I looked around but sometimes it's hard to decide with just web previews. Any suggestions?\n\n",
