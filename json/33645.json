You must spend a lot of time in ’font backwaters’.\n\nI’ve looked over the Apostrophic Lab fonts many times over the years, and have written to, and gotten samples from, several of the designers, but I can’t recall them as well as you seem to be able to do.\n\nThanks.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The font info file itself credits ’Alejandro Paul & Apostrophic Labs’. I believe that ’Apostrophe’ knows Alejandro.\n\nI also did some Google searches with ’Usenet and Alejandro’ and found a number of results linking them.
