      "content": "Dan,  \nWhat “rule” about not setting things in all caps do you mean? I guess you mean the generally accepted notion that all caps typography is less readable than lower case.\n\nThat one applies more to type than handwriting. The flipside (and here we go again with topic drift into a discussion of readability) is the matter of familiarity. Despite Hrant’s non-acceptance of the idea, I can’t find fault with Zuzana Licko’s maxim, “We read most what we read best”, because it’s basically true. I have met people who insist that lower case type is harder for them to read than all caps. It turns out these individuals read very little book typography and write in “printed capitals”, and these handwritten caps are the principal form of lettering they read. By near-complete lack of exposure to what we know as typography (book settings using lower case with caps for capitalised words), these people read best the form of lettering thay are most familiar with. It makes sense. I think Hrant’s rejection of Zuzana’s maxim has more to do with his unfortunate experience with one of Emigre’s fonts than his capacity for rationale and readability theory.\n\nNotwithstanding, lower case forms are inherently more legible and inherently more readable on both a technical and aesthetic basis. This much we know. So what an individual finds more legible or readable is a matter of personal experience.\n\nIn the example above there’s a lot of rounded corners, gently curved straights, and variation of alignment, and I’m sure those factors help make it more readable than type capitals with their profusion of straight lines.\n\nI devised a test one time where I took a seriffed roman font I was working on and ran a grunge filter on it—-a combination of randomize nodes and envelope. That grunged all the letters up nicely, thinning them in spots, thickening in other spots, warping of straight lines, size variation, off-zenith alignment, and characters moved off the baseline. The auto-grunged font was easier to read than the straight one I had arrived at purely by design.\n\nDid Hrant or someone else at some point offer up a theory as to how randomness, noise and distortion (in the right amounts) enhances the readability of a font?\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

This is entirely a practice effect. Most readers spend the bulk of their time reading lowercase text and are therefore more proficient at it. When readers are forced to read large quantities of uppercase text, their reading speed will eventually increase to the rate of lowercase text.

Similar to different styles:\n\nWe have late medieval, early modern accounts of Dutch and German readers not coping with Antiqua. Probably one could find newer ones from the 19th century as well.  \nOn the contrary, nowadays most untrained readers of today have serious problems with Fraktur.\n\nIt’s all a question of practice.\n\nActually, what I discovered after developing a secret alphabet as a child was, that not only was it possible, that someone is more proficient in reading than writing (this is evident. So many people read, but can barely write, or if so, unrecognizibly), but you can also be more proficient in writing than reading! I mostly took some notes in my secret alphabet when I was scribbling something (in boredom) and others should not be able to read it, so I rarely read it. Even though I made up the alphabet myself, I could fluently write it, but only decipher it sign-by-sign!\n\nIt was quite a relevation on how the human mind works!\n\nActually, we know, that medieval copyists worked the following way: one read (aloud), many wrote (that was time-saving... multi-tasking/parallel processing, if you will).
