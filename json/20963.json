  "content": "Hi. I’m looking for a condensed sans serif that comes in a decent set of weights including a light. I want something that has the formal structure of, say, Akzidenz or Univers but with slightly rounded edges. I don’t mean something explicitly rounded, just a softer more ‘modern’ edge.\n\nVillage’s [Section](http://web.archive.org/web/20060719212905/http:/www.vllg.com/Lux/Section/mudTyper+Weights/) is quite good but more condensed would be nice…\n\nAny tips greatly appreciated.\n\n",
