The tallest glyph is currently /A ring acute/ (Unicode 01FA) at 1085. So, the WinAscent value for Gidole needs to be a little above that figure.\n\nThe WinDescent should be set lower than the glyph with the lowest node, which is currently /g cedilla/ (Unicode 0123) at -385. However, this glyph is usually represented as a /g/ with something like a /comma/ on top. See [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110824/http:/www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0123/fontsupport.htm) and click on the 'view' link alongside each font to see how they treat this character.\n\nIf you change your /g cedilla/ to match those in that list, your /A ogonek/ will become your lowest glyph, with a node at -202. You need to allow a little extra room, but enter the value as a positive one, not a negative one.\n\nAs for setting up the metrics in FontForge, I'm afraid I don't use it so can't be absolutely sure about the 'General' value you're referring to.\n\n"
