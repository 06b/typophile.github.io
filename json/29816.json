My name versus a clever amalgamation example: Andrew Sipe Vs Clever Amalgamation Designs  \nIs this professional? Is it acceptable? Is it the way to go if I’m the only person using it, i.e. no other employees in this company?\n\n2. Tagline : Yes or No or should I just use a title like graphic artist/designer/communicator?  \nIs it necessary to have a tagline/title line at all when creating a personal identity?\n\n3. What are some resources or guidelines I should consider familiarizing myself with when creating my identity system. I’m guessing there isn’t much difference between a personal ID system and a professional company ID system, but I could be mistaken.\n\nI’m sure I’ll have more questions as this topic develops out, until then I’d be happy to read your honest insights and opinions on the subject.\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Postage Stamps by Type Designers](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905141216/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33064 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Desktop Publishing Vice or Virtue ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905141216/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33136 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I was kinda hoping there might be more of an argument against the common “so-and-so design” formula a lot of artist/designers use when creating a personal identity. Perhaps an argument like:\n\n• The artist/designer who tacks on “design” shows little creative energy to their own personal identity, might translate to showing the same energy for the customer’s projects...\n\nor\n\n• the artist/designer who uses their own name as the company name might translate to having an egocentric attitude...\n\nor for it\n\n• there could be positives to using their own name, especially if the artist/designer is well known or their name is extremely unique and would lend.\n\nI’m still not sure, I don’t want to come off as pompous and I don’t want to seem immature or under experienced to potential clients/new employers. If I use a name other than my own, I’d have to justify it some way, at least in my own mind.\n\n"

Just be honest with yourself and you’re clients will see it. Don’t try to be something your not (not saying you are BTW). It’s just you. And if you feel that this might come off as amaturish or small then it’s your job to convince potential clients that staying small allows for a more personal and effective design approach.

Personaly I would just use your name. It has a certain ’ring’ to it.\n\nWhen designing my identity I wanted to emphasize my bilingual design skills. I used two methods. The first was my name Ivan Melendez. The second was the word ’graphic design’ (not graphic designer) in both english and spanish seperated by a virgule.  \nI used a simple typographic logo (the letter ’M’ surrounded with different glyphs set in differnt fonts) to emphasize the heavy influence typography has on my work.\n\nKeep it clean and simple. In fact, the less info the better in my opinion. It allows for questions about what you do, that’s your opportunity to impress them with what you have to say. Much better than having the things you do on a card. In my case. I chose not to use the word ’typography’ or ’typographer’, not many people know what it is or how important it is to effective design.\n\nHope this makes sense. In the end it’s really up to you. As you grow you can always change your identity to reflect such growth.\n\nIM\n\n"

The latest one is a black cap in some Celtic-ish font, enclosed in a circle of a Pantone orange, with the rest of the text in Albertus.\n\nThe trick, I think, is finding the right name to start with: I was lucky enough to find one that reflected my _zeitgeist_ and still started with “L”.... ;-) YMMV, as they say.\n\n"

They work with you because of YOU...not because of your logo.\n\nFinally, using your name has one simple benefit...it’s your name.

I just feel the words I mentioned are being used entirely too much in the realm of art & design. I think it would only result in a ’me too’ kinda feel. It’s such a matter of personal space. There are no set rules, no right and wrong answers.\n\nI live in Reading PA (will be attending Kutztown University in the near future Asvetic) and there are several “design studios” in the area who’s work I can only describe as craptacular. Almost all off them use the word ’design’, ’studio’ or ’communication’. My choice to not use these words came from the desire to seperate myself from this group, and it’s worked. That’s not to say I would not choose to use one of these words if my business would grow and have employees under my direction. But I would have to had developed a solid reputation for myself in order for that to happen so I won’t be mistaken for a lesser studio.\n\nAsvetic we should talk some time and colaborate on future projects (currently working on somethings for the Reading Hospital).\n\n"

For a company that emphasizes brand strength they sure put the name “Igor” on everything. Like “Igor agency”, “Igor naming guide”, “Igor-created...”, “Igor Naming and Branding Meta Blog”. Very redundant.\n\n<cite>Have you done any strategy forming for your company yet? What are your goals, the feel of your company, etc.<cite></cite></cite>\n\nHaven’t really formed any strategies, since I’m realtively new at this, I figured I would allow the flow of specific work to guide what my ’company’ will do primarily. I am leaning towards strengthening the bilingual aspect of my work as most of my work involes designing in both languages for clients. I will say, however, that I never refer myself as a company (it’s just me and it’s too corporate in my opinion. Besides, what if someone asks me how many people are in my “company”? I’ll have to say “just me”, and look silly in my opinion)\n\nWhich brings me to the second question. My goal is to offer effective design without all the “fluff”. In the area I live in I’m often faced with “design solutions” that really don’t do much, don’t function. I also try to tackle what I call relevant design issues. In other words, I look to make designs that are truly useful and long lasting in their benefit. For example, I’m currently designing bilingual patient information forms for a hospital who’s number of hispanic patients grow every day. I really enjoy this job because I feel I’m doing good work. I’m not trying to sell someone something they don’t need, or designing for something or someone I don’t belive in. I’m designing something that will aid in effective healthcare.\n\nThe feel I’m trying to send out is approachability (which is why i’ll always try to stay small). That anyone can approach me with a design problem, big or small, and expirience the same level of passion and dedication. I also allow my design to take on a humanistic approach. Often relying on the emotion behind it all to guide me to a solution. Yes, form design may seem boring to some and it’s pretty unglamourous, but to me I think about the patient who is scared and confused when coming into the hospital and has a difficult time communicating because of the language barrier. That drives me.\n\n"

Narrowing down everything will help you pick a name, design a logo, determine colour choices, etc. Bilingual Aspect, No Fluff, humanistic approach, etc. are all good things to narrow your goals.\n\nAlso you might want to look at Bauhaus Design which was design for a purpose that was supposed to be affordable so that everyone could enjoy good design. Also maybe Edward R Tufte if you do a lot of information design.\n\n"
