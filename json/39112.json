In one day, I received an email from FontShop promoting the gorgeous new [FF Meta Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/nov2007_a/) (congratulations to Erik Spiekermann, Christian Schwartz, and Kris Sowersby), an email from House Industries noting that its new [Neutraface Complete](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=619) is on sale until December 1, an email from Veer for Alejandro Paul’s new [Feel Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.veer.com/ideas/feelscript/), an email from ITC for its (questionably useful) [ITC Intro](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/NewFonts/2007/1107_Intro.htm?osadcampaign=IMP), as well as an email about the release of [ScanFont 5.0](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-converter/scanfont/) for Windows.\n\nIt either means that Wednesdays are good days to release type news or that font serendipity is a real thing. Or, perhaps, I’ve subscribed to too many type email newsletters and haven’t noticed the confluence before.\n\nMostly, I wonder, what do folks think of FF Meta Serif? To me, it is lovingly crafted and will be a strong addition to my serif collection.\n\n [‹ Veering away to Corbis](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38979 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Digital Type: Pros and Cons? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203114527/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38961 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
