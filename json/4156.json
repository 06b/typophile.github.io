Maybe you've seen my string hunting for these letter forms, but i finally found em all and did my best to digitize them. As with most designs that I respect, i've started to work on international characters and a cyrillic set to match, but haven't gotten too far on those yet. I would set some text for you, but i haven't messed with the spacing much yet. I need some help in that regard anyway. if any of you want to point me toward some good sources... Any comments at all are appreciated, so lemme know what you think of these letter forms. I tried my hand at two � glyphs, but don't know if either work. help please! also how do the thorns look? Anyone who's versed in Cyrillic, i'd love to hear what you have to say on my small assortment of glyphs, especially the m'agk'ii znak. And what do you all think of that Euro symbol? does it work? Anyhow, hope to get something back on this one. Thnx in advance.   \nP.S.

Notice the lc x. wobbly (handtooled looking). Not a bad way to go on something like this but you need consisency.   \n   \nU. Add a scroll to the top left like the N   \nk: The upper arm is inconsistent.   \nlower case: color issues. Compare how dark the p is vs the n. Your rounds are generally too thick (I think, but check it in text)   \nq: make the top of the stem a point, not flat.   \nVWvw: serifs on the points? (could be the style)   \nR: right leg too stiff. Maybe a scroll here too.   \nQ: tail needs more pizazz in a font like this, surely! Go absolutely crazy nuts. Make it a 3 mile long dangling mess of scrolls or something.   \nserifs: all serifs are not the same length! Consider a cupped serif.   \nI (cap i): Looks naked. Add some decoration.   \nEuro: give the cross bars some curls   \n   \nIs this guy dead? If so, how dead? Does anyone own the rights?

I guess i was too excited to get this up and thus didn't bother with the back history (or even finishing that lc x) But here's [a little backhistory](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203044/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/24232.html).   \nI started this project because i wanted to find a digital version and couldn't so i figgered i'd have to make my own. As to rights, i tried to find that info out and all i came up with was [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203044/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/atf/), and i'm not sure if this info applies to this face. If so, this will definately just be a personal project for myself, or maybe i could give it away to interested parties?   \nI tried to keep as true to the original as possible, (you can check this against scans of the original in the backhistory) but i'm not opposed to making alternate glyphs. In fact i think i need an lc f without the flourish just for example. I'm not particularly fond of the original A or Q either, so i may try to come up with something for those two as well.   \nThis face was first marketed by MacKellar in the 1890s? so I'd guess that Hermann is long departed, or else i would have liked to speak with him about his great display faces!   \nThanks for the feedback again, Randy. And did any of the scrolls seem square to you? I'm paranoid that i may have not gotten them quite right. (They were a pain in the neck!) Thanks again, and if you could, lemme know what you think after checking out the original.\n\n"

In this incarnation:   \n1) the font is morticed (thnx hrant) and instead of bracketing the serifs on the lc, i incised them - i'll make a bracketed version after i figger out where i'm going with this (and have a chance to look at Bodoni   \n2) i tried fixing the lc color issues by making my bowls a bit trimmer.   \n3) Manufactured a few alternate characters - mostly just fiddling around slapping parts together. The only one I'm really pleased with is the alt X. Goudy helped me think that one up. The alt k is alright, as is the alt U and alt Q, but that alt j is just nasty! i also tried manufacturing a double s (esset?) but i don't know if it's too jarring to the eye. i don't really know how it should look. i'm still trying to come up with a few more alt characters - trying to imagine \"a more elegant g\" that would fit in this face and how to make the I less nekkid, the R less rigid and the A less garish   \n4) I don't know how well i did with spacing. I can't tell if it's too loose or not.   \n5) I gave you a sample setting - i don't think this face would ever be used for more than a few lines at a time - if that.   \n6) I added diacritics - i think i did okay positioning all my sputniks, the ring seems too small tho.   \n7) Still working on the vwxyz, so don't fault me there, i'm not finished with those yet. Otherwise chop it up! Lemme know where i'm still missing some of the finer details.

Wake up, guys!}   \n   \nThe first big question I guess is: do you want the swash caps to stand out so much in weight, or do you want them to be equal to the small/normal caps? And if it's the latter, what size relationship do you assume (if the swash is a totally separate font)? What you might do is have a smallcaps font where the \"UC\" set is the swash and the \"lc\" set is the normal caps but vertically centered. But then you couldn't mix the actual lc very easily... In terms of the weight, ideally I guess you should have multiple weights for the swash - but that might be outside your \"time budget\".   \n   \nAs for form, I think most of your swash caps are solid, but some need a lot of help. Especially those long curls you have on some of them are seriously malformed. Like the \"N\" needs to be totally rethought, I'd say. Some of them are great though, including tough ones like the \"G\", \"U\" and \"X\".   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

They are bolder than the typical text (perhaps this is what Hrant is getting at). Much of the weight is in the number of line segments, not just the weight. As Hrant indicated above, this would work better with CAPS and Small Caps.   \nTo me, flourishes are meant to entwine. See pointed-pen italic caligraphy or engravers scripts like Bickham. This of course makes for slower reading but it is not a problem with small amounts of text as in invitations or citations where the reader is at leasure to re-read and enjoy the hopefully well-crafted typography.   \nI feel your Swash initials could be used nicely as initial drop-caps with a more traditional roman text face.

Since this is a display face, hopefully the weight difference won't be too disturbing at display sizes. I'll admit, the difference looks really stark in the digital sample... i still need to print it out to see if it looks that way on paper.   \nRight now i have all these in one font with the swash caps available through the OT swash function & the smcp function gives you the swash+normal caps combo. I think that I will do a couple other versions, balancing the weights better and separating the sets up into different fonts.   \n   \nSo you don't like the N.swsh? is it really malformed? or you just don't like the letterform? as iterated before, i'm trying to stick as close to the original as possible (see link above), but i'm totaly open to doing alternate characters (the cap X in the first line of this first sample is one of my alternates). What other characters need alternates besides the N.swsh?   \n   \nThnx for your help and comments, guys. I really do appreciate all your feedback.   \n   \np.s. okay i printed it out and that N.swsh IS pretty fugly i'll fix it. But did you mean there should be an alternate character, Hrant? or just that i need to pay better attention? Also, the swash caps ARE a lot heavier, I think i'll lighten em up for any versions that combine all 3 sets or where they're paired with the lc. whaddya think of that?\n\n"
