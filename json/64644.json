  "content": "Hi typeophiles\n\nI am looking for a san serif display font that works well with scotch modern bold italic ... to use with a magazine masthead. I've attached our fashion & lifestyle magazine cover, Scoop Magazine, so you can see the Scotch font mast. One of our other titles is Scoop Traveller. We need to use the Scoop mast the same way but to incorporate Traveller below that and I am having trouble finding a good san serif display font that works well with it. Hence I am visiting you lot as you've always had great suggestions for me in the past. Any suggestions appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Scoop Cover.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201084706/http:/typophile.com/files/Scoop%20Cover.jpg) | 56.23 KB |\n\n",
