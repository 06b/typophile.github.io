  "content": "So many fonts, so little time.   \n   \nI recently upgraded to Panther and installed Adobe's Creative Suite. While I'm enjoying learning InDesign (over time, it will be \"bye bye\" to Quark after 13 loyal yet increasingly frustrating years). I've been using Font Reserve to manage my 10,000 fonts. (Yes, I know I need to freeze about two weeks of time to go through and one by one examine and dump or preserve each font)   \n   \nBUT here's the problem: periodically, randomly, daily, an Adobe application will abruptly quit. Many hours on tech support, and I'm convinced that corrupt fonts are at the heart of the problem. I am running Font Doctor to try and diagnose this. It's been running for about 20 hours straight, and is not nearly done fixing ID number conflicts.   \n   \nTwo part question: Are you all experiencing similar crashes in OS 10.3? Do you also find Font Doctor extraordinarily slow? Any tips?   \n   \nmany thanks,   \nMarTay\n\n",

There must be something wrong when it takes 20 hours. I don't have any tips other than regular system maintenance - weekly Cocktail, monthly Disk Warrior. I am running 10.3.5 and Adobe CS and the only app that crashes is InDesign. Pretty rare though.   \nGOOD LUCK!   \npeace\n\n"
