Maybe you should us more details (bigger picture).   \n   \nDo you intent to make a roman as well, or is it an Italic design, standing on its own?   \n   \nI am not sure about the 'O' and 'Q'. It feels like the top part shouldnt be open.   \n   \n---Jacques\n\n"

I have noticed the Z needs some attention.   \n\\   \nThis is a semi freestyle font, so I do not want uniformity within the font.   \n   \n. ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419025315im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27230.gif)\n\n"
