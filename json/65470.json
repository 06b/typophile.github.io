I'm trying to find something that is as close to the original as possible, the exact match would be perfect. I can't find any single font that has that type of long curvy serif like on letter \"A\". I doubt that it was his custom font since I've seen it on many paintings around that era. Out of the period, I guess that's gotta be some humanist serif type, but I've found nothing really close.\n\n"

      "content": "I think you need to recognize that when Perugino painted there were hardly any 'fonts', because movable type was still a novelty if it was available at all. His lettering was hand-drawn and probably based on Roman alphabets he had seen in use in Umbria, or whatever regions he traveled and studied in. I don't think I have seen a modern font that has all the attributes you are looking for. Goudy, who studied Roman inscriptions, designed the typeface [Hadriano](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202040725/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-hadriano/), which I think may come near the A you want.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
