I am working on a Russian typeface and along with my dim understanding of encodings, I am also at a loss to find relevant information regarding kern pairs. Any relevant caches of information out there that folks can point me to? Ideally, I'd like to find a list of common kern pairs.   \n   \nThanks a bunch!   \n   \nPaul Platosh\n\n",
