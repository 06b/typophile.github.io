I've settled on Gotham Ultra for the second word but can't decide on a handwriting font for the first. Hopefully you can see what I'm trying to achieve in the attached image.\n\nAny ideas? I thought that Dali looked ok but a few hours later I'm not so sure.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110618060809/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_26.jpg) | 17.5 KB |\n\n",

They are competing against each other. Try reducing the the size of the word \"blogger\" â€”&nbsp; that should allow the word \"upstart\" to breathe a bit more. They may work better together if one word is the main focus and the other is in a supporting role.\n\n"
