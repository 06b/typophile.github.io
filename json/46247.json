This seems to be taken from a thread or list you have saved from Typophile or locally. I noticed it too on another thread regarding contemporary sans faces. I like your listings as they always seems to contain high quality faces - omitting the older more tired renditions.\n\nWould you be willing to share this list with us or point me to the thread where you originally posted?\n\nJay\n\n"

I want the look t-Star mono have, but need all glyphs. Im looking at Naiv, but this is maybe to playful..  \nThanks for all help, appreciate it.\n\n- Thomas\n\n"

Others, like scripts, contructivist Bauhaus-style typefaces or lined fonts can be browsed on [Bowfin Printworks](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/). The [TypoWiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/TypoWiki) has some lists, too.\n\nI remembered that we already had 2 or 3 threads about this rounded tech thing and searched for [Gravur](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20gravur) and [T-Star](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/www.google.com/search?q=site:typophile.com%20t-star), using this [favelet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/typophile.com/node/12436).  \nThus, I compiled a little list of the alternatives mentioned there, plus some more that came to my mind.  \nNo magic involved, only a little help from TextExpander (a Mac app that helps to insert links etc., similar to Typinator or RapidoWrite).\n\nThomas: Why don’t do ask [Die Gestalten](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/www.gestalten.com/fonts/detail/?id=402881820693de75010693debc1600d3) or [Mika Mischler](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414223531/http:/www.binnenland.ch/)? What about T-Star TW Pro?\n\n"
