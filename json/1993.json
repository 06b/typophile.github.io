Among other things, there is an [Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011231806/http:/www.designwritingresearch.org/archive.html) of articles and interviews. Some of the interviews are previously unpublished, such as the one with [Tobias Frere-Jones](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011231806/http:/www.designwritingresearch.org/frere-jones.html), or unedited versions of published ones, like the [Jonathan Hoefler](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011231806/http:/www.designwritingresearch.org/hoefler.html) interview. Both of these interviews date from the mid-1990s and make for some interesting reading.\n\n",
