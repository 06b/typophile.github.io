      "content": "Hey Roger, welcome to typophile!   \n   \nThis is a very interesting mark you having going. Good idea with the 't' 'c' lig. Should the red circle be a bit smaller? Or perhaps the glyph needs to be wider? It seems to me that there is too much red space on either side.   \nAs for true caliber, maybe try another typeface? I'd like to see what everyone else thinks about that.   \n   \nAs for the positioning of everything, the mark may work better beside true caliber, rather than being centered on top.   \n   \nI like how the red circle is a bullet hole, or maybe the back of a bullet. Perhaps you could develop on that more, by adding a ring around the edge or something?   \n   \nJust some thoughts   \n   \nDrew\n\n"

I'm learning too (albeit slowly ;-).   \n   \nI'm agreeing with Daniel, Dominik and Scott: the red circle version is the strongest. I wouldn't sweat the swoosh thing. There are some swooshy shapes, but none is individually a dominant element, and the feel isn't that arcy, swooshy curve. It's more of a vortex feel, drawing the eye into the center of the logo. The square version of same is my second-favorite, though I like it more each time I look. Perhaps try using a similar but less-compressed face for the 'true caliber' to develop more horizontal motion, like the lig is a point on a timeline.   \n   \nThe newer versions--the solid black type-only--don't do so much for me. The gothic 'TC' ligature reads as a 'T' to my eye, and there's too much whitespace between it and the 'aliber'; looks like a hole. Where the red circle/square draws the eye into the ligature itself, the later versions draw the eye into a hole. The first is better in that respect, but there the lig feels too heavy. Maybe slim/reduce the back side of the 'T'? Or use a contrasting color for the interior stroke?   \n   \nAlso, you might try splitting up the 'ib' ligature. Part of the strength of that face is the verticality, and connecting the dot on the 'i' and the serif of the 'b' interrupts a particularly strong vertical and, to my eye, disturbs the rhythm of the face.   \n   \nLast, I think you're going to get 'gun' inferences from almost anything with your name. 'Caliber' is just very closely associated with firearms.\n\n"

The t is excellent; all of \"true\" has a great diagonal force that \"caliber\" doesn't, maybe because you have two strongly vertical glyphs interrupting the diagonal movement.\n\n"

To me it looks like a logo for some homogenized software company. Sometimes it's not about whther looks good, but whether it feels good. This could work for my film company if I wanted to be a little more freewheeling with the stories I want to tell, but I definately want to make hard-hitting and challenging movies. Think of flicks like Traffic, Fight Club, Seven or the commercial work by Chris Cunningham and Spike Jonze. Irreverant, experimental, but always, always unpredictable.   \n   \nSo have I got you guys sold? How could I improve on this one? I did take into account your input on the 'i' so I stuck a dot right back in there.

I'm not sold on the 't/c'-'a' join--though that's better than the other. Maybe try reworking the t-c lig to avoid joins with either word? Or maybe just flatten both curves a touch so they don't join at all?   \n   \nI also agree with you regarding the horizontal composition. Maybe you could dodge the joins and strengthen the horizontal in one swoop by reducing the x-height a touch?   \n   \nRegardless, I still find the 'lib' spacing a teensy bit awkward in Scott's version. I definitely like the independent dot on the 'i', tho. Maybe BJ is onto something with a triangle for the dot of the 'i'? Also, rather than reversing the serif on the 'l' I might try ditching it entirely--or maybe that's an opportunity to reuse the notch from the 't'?   \n   \nFinally, I think the 'er' join is a bit awkward with the tail (or whatever the correct term is) on the 'e' sticking up like that. Maybe eliminate it?   \n   \nAll niggles and dodgy advice aside, it really is coming together nicely.\n\n"

It could be read, by the casual glance as \"true T caliber\" or \"true C caliber\" it is almost redundant. In some ways, I think your original post is still the strongest. You used color and shape and placement to separate. You had a \"mark\" that could be used separately when necessary. The \"nipping and tucking\" you did to the emigre face is very nice, you should focus on that, and find a way to create a separate mark.\n\n"
