Yule is exotic yet familiar and evocative of winter holidays.  \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/yuleset.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629042601/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/yuleset.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/yuleset.html\")\n\nP22 Curwen is a set of 2 fonts by Colin Kahn. P22 Curwen Poster is a digitized version of a rare wood type used by the Curwen Press in England in the early 20th Century for poster work. P22 Curwen Maxima is a new hyper-stylized re-interpretation of Curwen Poster.  \n [http://www.p22.com/ihof/curwenset.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629042601/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/curwenset.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/curwenset.html\")\n\n—————————-\n\nIndie Fonts 50% off pre-holiday sale\n\nAnyone who visits graphic design sections of major bookshops may have noticed the Indie Fonts books as reprinted from a major publisher. These books are the second edition (with the exception of their logo all over, and theirs not using silver ink in Indie Fonts 2, the books are identical). For two weeks only get the first editions for 50% off! If you already have a copy, you know this makes a great gift and at half-price it makes it even better.  \n [http://www.p22.com/indiefonts/indieset.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629042601/http:/www.p22.com/indiefonts/indieset.html \"http://www.p22.com/indiefonts/indieset.html\")  \nThis special pre-holiday sale expires Nov. 14th 2005\n\n——————————\n\nLook for more this month from P22 including classic Lanston holiday ornaments and more gift ideas.\n\nCheers  \nP22 type foundry\n\n",
