[Adelle](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109011833/http:/www.type-together.com/Adelle) is a 12-weight slab serif typeface conceived specifically for intensive editorial use, mainly in newspapers and magazines.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109011833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/adelle_4913.gif)\n\nIt's personality and flexibility make it a real multiple-purpose typeface. The unobstrusive appearance, excellent texture and slightly dark color allow it to behave flawlesly in continuous text setting. As it becomes larger in print, Adelle shows its personality through a series of meassured particularities that make it easy to remember and identify.\n\nAvailable exclusively at our online store at [www.type-together.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109011833/http:/www.type-together.com/ \"www.type-together.com\")\n\n",
