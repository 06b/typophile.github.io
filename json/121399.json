[Starling](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/starling) FB might be a good option to consider too.  \nNo match for the script. Some close: [Englische Schreibschrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Englische+Schreibschrift), [Symphony](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/symphony-pro), [English 157](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/english+157), [Sonata](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/sonata-pro)  \nBTW, this logo is freely available to download as vector [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/logo?search_api_views_fulltext=hennessy).\n\n"

      "content": "URW’s Danmark is actually a pretty good match for the overall letter shapes/proportions—with a little manual condensing:\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/danmark/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/danmark/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/danmark/\")\n\nThicken the crossbar and refine the serifs on the |H|, add serifs to each |s|, and add a ball finial to the tail of the |y|, and you are pretty close.\n\nAgree with Ryuk about Times New Roman for |COGNAC|—a little artificial widening, and it is a better than 95% match.\n\nNimbus Roman by URW is a close second:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-roman/\")\n\nFor the script face, Ballantines Script by Elsner+Flake is good for everything except the initial caps:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/ballantines-script/\")\n\nNovia isn’t bad, either:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/novia/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404231930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/novia/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/novia/\")\n\n"
