If I am, I sincerely apologize.\n\nBasically, I was hoping one of you typophile gurus would be interested in taking on a business card design project.\n\nAs stated, it is for a medical spa, so I need it to convey both professionalism and some refinement/luxury. I was thinking letterpress would add to the latter, but am open to discussions.\n\nI prefer something clean and relatively sparse, but again am open to ideas.\n\nMore details can be provided as needed. I hope one of you has the time and the interest!\n\nwe can also discuss payment options.\n\nI’m looking for this to be done sooner rather than later.\n\nhope to hear from you!\n\npc\n\n [‹ Type and social responsibility](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830100749/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39040 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for a FontLab manual ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830100749/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18228 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
