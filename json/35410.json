      "content": "Personally, I think it's really clever and shows a lot of imagination and hard work. My thoughts would be:\n\n-- It's too complicated, making it difficult to read and comprehend the concept. I would simplifiy it overall, and try to lose some of the lines which obscure the lettershapes. Granted, you're trying to fill negative space and not leave unsightly gaps, but still, at first blush I find it a little tough to read. Maybe some air might actually help.\n\n-- Have you seen it in a very tiny version? I'm wondering if the tight kerning will plug up when reduced in size or printed under adverse conditions.\n\n"

Maybe lose the diagonal that links to the 'm'. At first glance you might need to move 'amp' left so the 'C' lines up with the 90 degree vertical of the 'A' - I know this throws everything else out but thats why designing logos is'nt as easy as people think!  \nThe 'B' doesn't need to be flipped.  \nLose the line under the 'm'\n\nIf you look at some examples of Avant Garde being used by Herb Lubalin, you will see that it does'nt need to be as complicated to look great.\n\n[http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Avant/Avant2.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20111229204214/http:/www.graphic-design.com/Type/Avant/Avant2.html \"http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Avant/Avant2.html\")\n\n"

      "content": "It does come across as mark from the 60's. Very iconic. A few suggestions, first, would be work on the 'A' in Ian. You may not need to make it so disjointed. Second, I would be curious to see what the 'M' would like if the bottom line was removed. Third, the 'B' might not need to be flipped. I'm sure making this changes would bring up the space you're probably tying to address. Do you have a color version? This might fix everyones readability issue.\n\n[www.holadesignstudio.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20111229204214/http:/www.holadesignstudio.com/ \"www.holadesignstudio.com\")\n\n"

I'd say if you make the camera one color and your name another it will work just great.\n\nComments:\n\nI think it's a little odd that the A in Ian is slanted in the opposite direction from all the other angles.\n\nThe C is pretty close to being an O and lost. You need it to look more like a C than a lens.\n\nI think this is cool, though. As long as you have your name clearly printed in wherever you're using this readability shouldn't be a problem. If you want it to work all by itself start working off some of the feedback you've gotten here and post updates!\n\n"
