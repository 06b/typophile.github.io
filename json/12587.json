The program itself is friendly enough, but [TrueType hints](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070716/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TrueType%20hints) are encoded in their own stack-based programming language -- as complicated as the language used to describe font outlines themselves -- and the GUI can go only so far to mask the complexity and power of the hints.\n\nOriginally designed by the architect of the TrueType font format, [Sampo Kaasila](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070716/http:/www.typesolutions.com/). Released as 'TypeMan' for the Macintosh. Completely rewritten by Beat Stamm of Microsoft Typography and released for both Windows and the Macintosh.\n\nAvailable from [Microsoft Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815070716/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx) upon completion of an application. Both Windows and Mac OS are supported.\n\n",
