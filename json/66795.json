The problem is that I'm not really sure if such books cater for left-handers, or if indeed it makes any difference at all. Any thoughts or specific recommendations?\n\n",

A key reason why lefties struggle with a broad-nibbed pen is that it's difficult to find an angle that's both natural and that allows the nib to be drawn across the paper as it's designed to be. With Chinese calligraphy the tool of choice is a brush rather than a pen, which has a flexible rather than a rigid tip and deposits ink on paper in a very different way. And if I'm not mistaken, the angle at which the brush is held is nearly vertical, which is just as easily done with the left hand as with the right.\n\n"

The characters written by the left hand (I think) were mirrored, though. Unless it was the case that I happened upon the one street calligrapher in China who does that, it can't be that rare a practice, and perhaps there are even those who write normal un-mirrored characters simultaneously with both hands.\n\nAnd yes, Aric, you make good points about Chinese calligraphy being more amenable to lefties. I learned some Chinese calligraphy when I was young (a bit before Korean calligraphy, actually). I had already got used to writing with a pencil, held at an angle to the page with the fingers close together and the wrist resting on the paper for support, so it was difficult to transition to holding the brush vertically with enough space maintained in the inside of my hand to grasp an egg (I think that's how they taught it). This and the fact that it's a round brush means that there is no angle bias at all with Eastern brush calligraphy.\n\n"

This is something one learns from watching Arabic calligraphers rotating the page and writing top-to-bottom.\n\nWriting direction is independent of pen angle, and it is the latter factor that determines the normative patterns of letters when they are written with contrasting stroke tools, especially translation stroke tools such as broad nibs or flat brushes. One can ignore those normative patterns, of course, but the result will be that the letters look weird to most readers. Normative contrast patterns are so basic to script identity that reversing them frequently gives the impression that one is attempting to make a pastiche of a different writing system, e.g. writing Latin letters à la Devanagari.\n\nAgain, my advice to a lefty would be to look at tools (brushes, split nibs, low contrast tools) that do not enforce a translation stroke pattern, and at styles of lettering within a writing system that favour left-handed execution.\n\n"

If you look at the ways in which different writing systems are written around the world, I don't think you can easily define what constitutes a 'natural' way of writing: all writing is cultural. I think it is better to talk in terms of comfort and ergonomics. In which case, it is interesting to note that the common hand position of European writing, in which the wrist is flexed backwards is less comfortable over a long period of time than what we would think of as a rotated position in which the hand is in-line with the lower arm and the wrist is not flexed. As someone who suffers from rotator cuff mobility problems and pain, I'm very much aware that there are habitual positions that are very bad for the body and that should be avoided.

An adaptationist could easily make a case that being able to e.g. paint animals well on the walls of a cave would lead to greater social status and hence to both better nutrition and to more opportunities for reproduction. I'm not much of an adaptationist, though, and while I wouldn't presume an ‘inherent, primordial ability’ I would be inclined to think that there are innate potentials or capabilities that might be developed into abilities or characteristics. And we see this with regard to fine motor skills even today: we have this capability, but it must be fostered and practised by each individual, usually at quite a young age, or else it doesn't develop. This is parallel to many other innate capabilities, which we probably all have but which we lose if we do not develop them. There are no tone-deaf people among speakers of tonal languages, because they all develop their capability to produce and recognise verbal tonality at a young age; whereas speakers of English generally have much poorer tone sensitivity unless they have studied music quite seriously. Depressingly, one can imagine all sorts of innate capabilities that we might possess, but which we have neglected and lost.\n\nEvolution is an imprecise process, in which mutations tend to be surplus to requirements (since mere survival is the only requirement): you need mutations that make it possible to survive in a sub-Saharan grassland, and you end up with Bach.\n\n"

I think most (professional) calligraphers have a precise mental picture of what they want to draw, but their hands fail them in reproducing the lines from their imagination.\n\nIn fact, I believe most calligraphers are seeing to much: They tend to over-adjust their movement -- and often even their plan -- midway because seeing the partial picture (or even the current partial curve) makes them insecure about whether it's right. Maybe if they rely less on their eyes and more on the mental picture in their head -- go into a meditative trance, if you will, so as to tune down the non-stop visual feedback analysis that's messing with them, they would produce more fluent and natural results.\n\n"

People generally don't have trouble recognizing a word at a time sideways. I wouldn't sit down and read a novel sideways, because it would slow my reading down to the speed of writing, but it should work fine _while_ writing, because you write a word at a time and have to be somewhat conscious of the shapes on a stroke-by-stroke level anyway. But maybe I'm projecting my experiences as an ambigram specialist, wherein I do a lot of mental rotation.\n\n"

AFAIR there have even been studies to show this.\n\n2) I might _possibly_ agree when it comes to traditional  \ncalligraphy, but that \"any\" there is certainly too much.  \nLefties do write, after all!
