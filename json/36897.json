  "content": "I am looking for fonts which read well in small sizes. When I do back labels I tend to use universe or helvetica for the mandatory copy and a condensed san serif or serif for the story. Nothing ever goes above 10 points. My back labels stink. I am so busy I don't have time to do the well but I'd like to improve them. Maybe set up some templates with great small type.\n\nAny thoughts? Also any books on the fine print or setting small copy. I's an odd topic I know but maybe someone tackled it.\n\n",

Who ever said don’t sweat the small stuff didn’t do back labels!\n\nI would like to have a variety of fonts that I can use for small print\n\nThe Freight Micro seems so unique with it’s serifs. Franklin Gothic is good and I use it but I = forget about it thanks for reminding me, I haven’t seen it small but it might be limited in it's usefulness. I am still wondering what people think of that knock out series B. Bell centennial looks like a good font might be really useful. Lafomica.de has an ant running around on the page, a note that says just married and I have no clue where the fonts are. Capitolium is great. So much to add to my wish list.\n\nI see a real use for a design reference book showing small type layouts. Cycles is nice but I wonder if the Arepo would hold up in 8 points.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
