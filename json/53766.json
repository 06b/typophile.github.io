If memory serves me correctly, it could sort of produce compositions similar to these:\n\nAny help finding this tool would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013173856im_/http:/typophile.com/files/alphabet_city_001_3934.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013173856im_/http:/typophile.com/files/text-photo-1_5720.jpg)\n\n",
