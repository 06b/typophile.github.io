  "content": "Hi, first post here, not sure if this is the right place to post this, and I must apologise for creating a rather selfish first post! I've been lurking and meaning to sign up for a long time now, so I'll try to start contributing what I can with the little knowledge I have now as a student.\n\nAnyway, apologies out of the way, I'm doing a dissertation which involves looking at a few typefaces from various angles, and part of it requires me to look at modern usage of these typefaces. And by modern I mean, like, in use in the last year at least.\n\nThe only one I'm struggling with is Caslon, with it being so old and serif and all. But, being such a stalwart typeface, I would assume that it must be everywhere, and I just can't see it, and I'm hoping you guys will have a better knowledge of where it might be!\n\nThe kind of things I'm looking for are brand identities, advertising, newspapers, magazines, books... well, anything really. I know Caslon doesn't lend itself so much to brand identity, but I am looking for semi-unusual uses, so if anyone knows of it being used in a logo or something like that it would be great! I haven't got my hopes up though, so it would be just as well if anyone knows of a publishing house that uses it regularly, which I imagine is more likely.\n\nOr, if nobody knows of any notable uses, then if anyone has any insight into why that is, then that would be useful too!\n\nThanks\n\n",

Waxdeck bird-calling contest.\n\nI know some campuses use Caslon in some form as a typographical identity standard.\n\nWhat I saw of Caslon in some metal type specimen books looked horribly dated to me, and it seemed not to resemble older books set in Caslon, being an artificially light face. Also, what seemed to me the most widely available form of Caslon was Caslon 540, which has short, stubby descenders.\n\nAdobe Caslon may not be \"distinctive\", but when I took a look at it, it certainly did seem to be a real Caslon, and to avoid the pitfall of excessive stroke contrast that plagues other Caslons. And yet, I can also see how it could be mistaken for Baskerville (or some such thing) at a quick glance.\n\n"

Its proportions are also half way to Baskerville, and I personally like Caslon's original widths in his Roman, I think the rhythm it establishes is one of the original's best features.\n\nMy detailed discussion of Adobe Caslon is in my essay [Reviving Caslon on ilovetypography.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20121109100455/http:/ilovetypography.com/2010/11/02/reviving-caslon-part-2-readability-affability-authority/).\n\nThere are also several other recent revivals, I think partly in response to the feeling that Adobe Caslon is has its problems.\n\nI think Adobe Caslon works better in display, and I see it more often there.

Its proportions are also half way to Baskerville,</cite>\n\nAh, so when I looked at it and thought of Baskerville, I wasn't dreaming.\n\nI agree with you that it has gone too far - it's _recognizable_ as a Caslon by looking at the letterforms, but it just barely qualifies. I think that it is a highly readable typeface, eminently suitable for body copy... and one that might contain 24% lead oxide, but which avoids the iron and the cobalt... but, yes, as far as being a \"Caslon\", I would agree that a reasonable response would be \"why bother\" - and use Times Roman, Caledonia or Century Expanded instead. Baskerville or Garamond would be a definite improvement if one was looking to make one's document more unique.\n\nIf anything, though, it accords with my typographical tastes well enough that I've learned from it to \"be careful what you wish for\".\n\nI would not expect anyone in his right mind to set body copy in ITC Caslon 223, as one example. I think going a bit further in the direction of Adobe Caslon than Williams Caslon does is acceptable - but going as far as Adobe Caslon did... yes, I will acknowledge that even if it only gets noticed in the typographic community, there are limits to how much inauthenticity should be accepted.\n\nOf course, if they just hadn't put the name \"Caslon\" on it, the world would not be hurt by the availability of a nice readable Caslon-influenced typeface. But it probably would not have been noticed, and one can't blame businesses for being commercial.\n\nIf hardcover fiction is being published in Adobe Caslon, then it has done some good.\n\n"
