  "content": "Hi all- this is all new to me so please forgive my ignorance up front.\n\nI've been tasked with laying out a 100-page textbook-like publication (research based) on student achievement... I don't have much of a design background at all.\n\nI chose Perpetua Titling for my headers, Garamond for my text body- and used some different versions of Garamond for my pull out boxes- back to perpetua for pullout quotes.\n\nMy boss likes it for the most part- but she is a big fan of Arial, as all of our materials that preceded this particular project (handouts, powerpoints, workbooks, etc.) have used Arial. For everything. It's always been one of my least favorites, and really looks amateur in a textbook format.\n\nI'm using the newest Indesign, but I don't have time to keep playing with the type as much as I would like, so I found you all. I'm hoping you have some suggestions that could make her happy (but for real, how much of a \"brand\" can you build on an Arial font?)\n\nThank you so much in advance! I can't wait for your thoughts! Jen\n\n",

Be pragmatic, ignore the pedantry, do as you please and get the approval of someone higher in rank, someone with no explicit opinions about fonts, but who'll sure acknowledge the designer knows for the best.
