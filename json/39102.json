      "content": "Alex, a few other things to put on your release checklist:\n\n\\* Character set / code page integrity. Are you making the defacto standard Western 1252 character set, or something with more extensive language support? Whichever, make sure your code page complies the Unicode industry standard.\n\n\\* Decompose all composite glyphs before generating font files and remove overlap from glyphs needing it, such as Ccedilla and things with ogoneks. There is no practical reason for shipping fonts containing composite glyphs, as they save only a few kilobytes and add nothing to the value of your font.\n\n\\* Do all glyphs have a Unicode number assigned to them? If not, they may not survive cutting and pasting between applications.\n\n\\* Does your font contain .notdef, .null and CR cells? All three are mandatory, especially the .notdef cell, which needs a blank rectangle in it so that users know what the deal is when an undefined character is called by the material they're setting.\n\n\\* Are we making TrueType and/or Type 1 versions of the font? Presently not many font makers bother with Type 1. I still include TrueType versions of my fonts in the standard ZIP package as a courtesy to Mac users still using OS9.xx, but I'm starting to wonder if it's worth the extra time and logistic hassle.\n\n\\* Promotional material. Whatever your means of distribution, you'll probably need to make type samples to show potential buyers how the font(s) look in use. I only have experience with Myfonts. For a Myfonts release you need a 200 x 200 pixel font flag, ideally something showing the font(s) used in a very attractive way. Depending on the font, a strong font flag can mean the difference between selling a few copies and making no sales.\n\n\\* Promotional written copy. Regardless of your distribution method, it's helpful to write something about your font(s) for customers who want to read something about it (not all customers do). Promotional copy can be (1)&nbsp;a simple description of the font and its characteristics, (2)&nbsp;a detailed description, (3)&nbsp;a description laced with positive and persuasive statements. Be careful with number 3, because it's easy to overdo it and end up with promotional copy that dazzles too much and puts customers off. Also avoid writing very long blurbs unless you are Frantisek Storm and have lots of interesting things to talk about.\n\n_PLEASE do not emulate the bad habits of so many small boutique foundries: don’t release text families with only one weight, add OSFs in OT, and keystroke-link your fonts like the big foundries do._\n\nHow many and which indie font makers release families with only one weight? With only one weight or variant a font cannot be called a family, by definition.\n\n$10 --- $12.50 per font is an impractical price becaws after the costs involved in distribution and promotion are taken into account you'd be left with a paltry $5 --- $8 total revenue from each font, and those figures are based on the lowest margins charged by the most generous distributors in the biz. That amount would be reduced further by discounting. Font discounting is one of the main means of generating interest in a font as it makes your brand visible to the market.\n\nLet's not turn this into an arse kicking thread guys.

They have benefited from their price moderation; their historically literate faces were not that easy to market at first. In my personal shopping list, the moderate prices get the action: Quaestor ($50 for 4 fonts), Envoy ($50 for 5 fonts), Atlantica ($5 per font in OT bundle), Dutch Medieval Pro ($13.99 per font in OT bundle), Rebecca Samuels ($15 per font), and Leitura ($20 per font in OT bundle). By contrast, Constantia at $35 per font is not different enough to be worth the higher price. For Zingha I paid $40 per font because there's nothing like it, but I was rewarded by, once again, getting no keystroke links between fonts, so now I'm doubly shy about buying from that foundry. It's a crowded field, and price moderation coupled with user conveniences will pay off in the long term.\n\nAs for completing text-type families, the obvious examples of one weight are FF Clifford and H-FJ Requiem (their only variance is optical weight or text vs display). More often, we are frustrated because the family has bold but no bold italic--tons of examples there! We need to keep emphasizing the importance of industry-wide standards for these failings, because the main perps are the cool small boutique operators who can't be bothered offering the same user conveniences the big boys always offer. These are not small issues.\n\n"

Even books vary all over the place in market potential. The cheap $10 books you speak of have a far greater market than textbooks on Microbiology. I am a big purchaser on Amazon and most of my books are typography related. They average over $50 per book because the market for specialized books is small. Typography freaks are not rich but they love books so we are willing to pay for them. The old axiom of volume of sales increases as price declines has a very big limit. Once you saturate the market, there is nobody else to buy the product no matter how cheap it is. If there were books available on french braiding men's hair for $2, I would never buy it because I am not interested (and am bald). I paid $75 for a book on Cyrillic type design that was only in Russian and I don't speak a word of Russian because I still felt I could get something out of the visuals. The publisher is not planning an English version because he feels the market is too small to cover the cost of production. I would love it if he would produce the book anyway and sell it for ten bucks but it would be very self-centered of me to insist that he do so and loose thousands of dollars just to make me happy.\n\nChrisL\n\nPS: I don't find anything said by the likes of Josef Goebbels as something I would care to follow.\n\n"

In fact, while the big box boys have gone with giving fonts away (aka \"bundling\") and ho-hum pricing, independent foundries have led the way with a great variety of innovative packaging, formatting, encoding, pricing and licensing ideas.\n\nThere is a very good reason why typefaces may be released without a Bold Italic: Bold Italic is the least used of styles, and it's a bitch to draw. So sure, a foundry may lose sales to those who like to have lots of features they rarely, if ever, require, but on the other hand, it's gained a production efficiency. And that's its prerogative.\n\nBTW, the four-style \"nuclear family\" standard created at the birth of DTP by, AFAIK, Microsoft, has been a disaster for the typographic industry.\n\n"

I think you should do two things before you raise these complaints again:\n\n1: Retrain yourself to consider the cost of fonts as expenses of your design business. There is no need to argue about how your clients won't pay for them. There are dozens of ways you can account for expenses in your business when tax time rolls around. It's really just a simple accounting matter. Fonts are legitimate tools for design just like layout software, proofing, printing and internet service.\n\n2: Develop a workhorse, 4-style text family of your own original design, with oldstyle figures and small caps in every style, style-linked (the correct term) and available in OpenType format with adequate features to access all the special glyphs. Negotiate a distribution deal that somehow nets you adequate compensation at the prices you name. Then personally answer all tech support calls and messages you get from your customers.\n\nThen maybe we can have a meaningful conversation about the cost of fonts. You clearly have no idea what it is you are asking of type designers by requesting professional-quality fonts at such absurdly low prices.\n\n"

In fact, even after reading your post, I still wouldn't moderate it.\n\nOur function as moderators is not to steer discussion. We are not emcees or forum leaders. We monitor Typophile threads for inappropriate content, and take action where necessary. We also try to encourage the best content where we can, by putting things on the front page, or on the wiki, etc.\n\nMondoB has a very strong point of view that I personally may or may not agree with. But he is not attacking anyone personally, writing libellous text, linking to stolen fonts or software, or encouraging anything bad. He just wants people to make fonts the way he wishes that they would.\n\nI think that there has been enough counter-reaction from other forum members (i.e., Richard, Nick, Chris, etc.). Why should we go in and cut out parts of his posts, or close the thread? That sounds too much like censorship to me. MondoB has a right to post what he would like, as long as it falls within Typophile's [guidelines](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416013908/http:/typophile.com/readme). This is also a right shared by you, and everyone else here.\n\nNote, of course, that in Typophile's guidelines, we ask vistors not to hijack other peoples' threads. While MondoB has been rather insistent in arguing his point of view, I wouldn't say that he has hijacked the thread. His points do have to do with how fonts are released. For me it is enough on topic. This is my subjective point of view, and I'm sure that all the other moderators have their own subjective points of view as well. I will not presume to know what these are. However, I'm sure that most of the other moderators have read this thread as well, and as you write, they didn't take any action either.\n\nWe discuss when to intervene regularly, and it seems to me that this is clearly a case of when we wouldn't do that.

However, there are internal factors that can thwart transparency.\n\nIn particular, there are numbers of foundries that have produced font families whose internal font and style names and flags make them unworkable in a Windows environment, although they work perfectly on Macs.\n\nBoth Thomas Phinney and Adam Twardoch have produced documents that describe methods to make such families work equally well on both platforms. These documents should be studied and followed by anyone creating a family that consists of more than the four bais Microsoft styles.\n\nAnother compatibility obstruction is fonts whose glyphs are not completely unicoded. In a Windows/Microsoft Office environment ( prior to Office 2010 and prior to Windows 8, but I don't know about these and any later versions), such glyphs cannot be accessed at all. Windows' Character Map function doesn't see non-unicoded glyphs.\n\nI have also just been made aware of certain Open Type fonts that are acceptable to MacOS but give a \"not a valid font\" error message when opened in Windows (any version). This may even be intentional on the part of the font designer(s). I have no further information at this point.\n\n- Herb\n\n"

In certain distributors this can make a huge difference as you may have only one shot at making it known (MyFonts hot new fota features is pretty good for that). Why I say that? Because I released a single weight typeface in 2008 just to know If anyone would buy it. I offered it at 5 bucks. People bought it and I was happy but learned that it'd had been better If I'd waited and maybe charged more.\n\nThat said, releasing that single weight gave me a thrill that thrust me into wanting to do more, so maybe it's just what you need as well.\n\nDon't be scared of charging in the same range as the competitors. Work instead on making so that your type deserves that price point. Make it support more languages, give it OT features. If you use glyphsapp that's too simple not to do.\n\nLook at it as an app: it can improve over time. As a first release, chances are you'll make mistakes. The good news is you can fix them and your users will be able to upgrade it later at no extra cost. And you can add things, like that cool otf feature you just learned on a typophile thread.\n\nYou'll learn so much by simply realeasing whatever best you got now, that my last suggestion might be incongruent with my first: just do it :)  \nBest  \nRodrigo\n\n"

These would be characters that don't have standard unicode mappings (such as small caps or swash characters). You _may_ give them codes from the PUA (Private Use Area), but by definition there can be no standards for such encodings, so there is no way to predict what will happen if the font is changed for some reason. Instead, character variants should be accessed via OpenType features.\n\nWhile you don't _have_ to follow this recommendation, it is a valid way to make a font.\n\n"

Yours is the first complaint I have seen, as far as I recall.\n\n“ The ideal solution would be if Microsoft included in its OS an updated equivalent to today's CharMap that would allow access to non-unicoded glyphs.”\n\nThey could do it, but the glyphs could not be made to show up in existing non-OpenType-savvy apps, so that would not help much.\n\n"
