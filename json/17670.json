I don’t think they are from a font, or if they were, they were modified out of recognition with the original. This is really a logo design, I think. The stem on the Y is too short, and the N proportions and contrast are quite exaggerated. Perfect for this logo, but strange for any type uses, in my opinion.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
