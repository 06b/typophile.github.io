Despite it’s overall uniformity, there are some minor inconsistencies (unless the backgrounds are messing with me), there are few to no kerning pairs to speak of, and the “O”s and “U”s do not extend past the baseline or the capheight.\n\nIt’s likely based on some geometric that I don’t recognize, but I can’t help beyond that.\n\nAnyone else?\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
