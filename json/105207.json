      "content": "Hey Frodo,\n\nCan't use the inline because as far as i can say it is made to use in combination with for example Roma solid, The X-height off all the letters is more or less different (for example compare U and M), if i'm not mistaken therefore its only to be used as an \"inline\" specifically with other Roma variants. When i type a word with the inline version the word looks kind of wobbly and some letters appear to not sit on a baseline but kind of float in-between baseline and x-heigth.\n\nI'm not a type designer so do correct me if i'm completely wrong on this.\n\nI considered DTL Noble because i kind of had the idea they kind of would work...again not sure therefore i was asking for some suggestions from people whom are better at this and have loads more experience.\n\n"

      "content": "It’s hard to use to almost-but-not-quite-similar designs well together. The differences tend to look like errors. Roma is modeled on the letterforms of capitalis monumentalis, as is Trajan. There is at least on sans serif take on these: Trajan Sans. It has no lowercase though.\n\n"
