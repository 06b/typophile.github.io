  "content": "Hi Everyone. I hope you can help me with this.\n\nThe font I am trying to ID is a relatively contemporary, square faced sans-serif.  \nI am not sure that the “A” in this sample is accurate to the font; because of the way this has been used on a movie prop it is possible they “tweaked” the A to better match the source image.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080203103019im_/http:/typophile.com/files/USPS_4881.gif)\n\nThis is a blown up sample of the original. The rounding on the corners might be a result of my blowing the fuzzy image up and sharpening it.\n\nThis is driving me nuts. I am sure I have seen this font before. I’m pretty sure I used it as a dry transfer lettering in the 1980’s. It is also making me think of Star Trek.\n\nCan anybody help?\n\n [‹ (x) Typophile logo & background of homepage - H&FJ Gotham, Featured Face {Jan E}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080203103019/http:/typophile.com/node/41606 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Gaby Imports logo decorative serif face w/ swashes & curls ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080203103019/http:/typophile.com/node/41602 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
