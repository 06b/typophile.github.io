The food is served in an elegant way but is not too pricy.  \nIf it’s that not clear - M should remind lightly the pomegranate flower (...)\n\nThanks!  \nElsi\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141129000914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pomegranate_01_3830.jpg)\n\n",

The counter in the letters, especially in the \"a\" are too narrow. Also there's some letter spacing problems; \"ate\" and \"meg\" areas.\n\nI really like both directions.  \nLooking back at your first posting, i wonder how it would look if you made the \"a\" and \"e\" large lowercase letterforms, (matching the x height of the capitals) so that it keeps the roundness within the logotype—without having to make the logotype conform to the shape.  \nMD\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with epsilicon, the lighter weight is better.\n\nThe color looks fine; the skin of a pomegranate and it's seeds (anardana) inside are both dark red, so I'm not sure what \"marcdavid\" is talking about? I'd also disagree with his kerning advice -- the “ate” and “meg” look fine, but the \"r\" could use a little air on either side...but that would depend on which weight you settle on, of course.\n\nOverall, I think it's finally working. I looked over all your drafts, and this last concept is by far the best. I'd be careful with the pillow embossing, however; you don't want to veer into the chain-restaurant/Chili's look.\n\nNice work - obsessing pays off!\n\n"

I think Marcdavid meant that some poms seeds can be light pink (?!)\n\nI’m trying to give some roundness to the ‘r’ – is it working?\n\n(top logo is before changes)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141129000914im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Pomegranate_02_6153.png)\n\nElsi\n\n"

I'd suggest to levae the whitespace between 'e' and 'g' the way it is and space out the rest to balance it.\n\nFurthermore I'm not sure about the details added to 'r'. It will propably get lost at smaller sizes.\n\nNevertheless the current version feels very nice and the whole process is really enjoyable.\n\n"
