      "content": "At screen resolution, they are pretty similar. However, MS Sans Serif is bitmap only. I think Tahoma replaced it when they decided to go with an outline font.   \n   \nTahoma was created by Matthew Carter (who, as we all know, also did Verdana, which is very similar). I imagine Microsoft wanted to keep it fairly similar to MS Sans Serif and that may be why they look similar.\n\n"

I think it first appeared as an OpenType font with Windows 2000, and is titled \"Microsoft Sans Serif\" (no abbreviation). The old bitmap MS Sans Serif is named sserife.fon on my system. The outline version is named micross.ttf.   \n   \nI think Tahoma made its debut with Office 97, at least that's when I first recall seeing it.\n\n"
