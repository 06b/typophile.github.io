They have been very helpful but I just thought I would have a quick check as I don't know much about the subject and also feel a little snowed under by the amount of information out there!\n\nShould I use the font suppliers EULA?\n\nor\n\nShould I try to create my own EULA?\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Joe,\n\nI think this is a long discussion. By using the serch engine above you can find many topics about EULAs here in Typophile Forums.\n\nI particulary use the MyFont's standard EULA and I never had any problem.\n\nI think this is a matter of 'how do you want people using your fonts'. If you find anything that you do not agree or that you think it could be a little different in any standard EULA, I encourage you to modify that points before licensing your fonts.\n\nCheers,\n\nRicardo Esteves Gomes  \n [http://www.outrasfontes.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015010952/http:/www.outrasfontes.com/ \"http://www.outrasfontes.com\")\n\n"

      "content": "Every EULA is a little different. It really depends upon what you want to do with your fonts and how you want (don't want) them used. I don't think I've read their EULA. A direct link to their EULA would be good so we can read it and comment specifically about it.\n\n"

      "content": "Ricardo\n\nThanks for your feedback, its good to know you use Myfonts, as thats who I was planning to go with. They are very helpful whenever you contact them. I have had a look through their license and it does seem reasonable.\n\nMiss Tiffany\n\nI don't have any particular use for my font in mind, it is my first font to be released and is a bit of an experiment into commercial font design. Hopefully it will sell and therefore be worthwhile! Thanks for your help.\n\n"
