  "content": "Hi!\n\nCan't find exact match to [this font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320091035/http:/www.bsstreet.lv/bsstreet/img/logo_bilde.gif). In original version should'nt be with the \"grunge effect\". Seems similar to EF Microgramma, but it's not the same. Anyone could help out with the name of typeface?\n\nThanx in advance!\n\n",
