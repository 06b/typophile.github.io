  "content": "Howdy! In going through the archives of the Yale Daily News, I came across this sans used for headlines in the mid- and late-1950s. It seems to me to be a mid-century humanizing step in the evolution of grotesques, following the example of [Morris Fuller Benton](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007182941/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Morris%252BFuller%252BBenton)’s News, Trade, Franklin, and Clearface gothics, but I could definitely be misguided. As always, any help or directions for further research would be very much appreciated. (And sorry for the so-so images; they’re the best my camera phone can do :-) )\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007182941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Merrymakingydn_3949.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007182941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/forydn_5549.jpg)\n\n [‹ Looking for square geometric/architectural style sans typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007182941/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39998 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [\"Anila\" square very bold sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007182941/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39962 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I looked through my FontBook, but the related types (Futura, Neuzeit Grotesk, Super Grotesk, DIN, etc.) are just more geometric. Hmmm...\n\nIn case it helps, some of the other headline types we used around that time were (I believe) Cheltenham, Didot, Trade Gothic Compressed, and Futura.\n\n"

I do find it interesting that in the light weights the bottom stroke of the “e” is vertically cut off like in Gill Sans, but in the heavier weights it’s diagonal (like in my images); reminds me a bit of the Helvetica “a” tail.\n\n"
