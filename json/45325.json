      "content": "Thanks for the replies guys.\n\nIt´s nice to get a second opinion on this since I´m working on my own. Should have done it in the first place:-). Since I more or less produce all the material for this restaurant, I have the power to implement small changes. The website is done by someone else and came out pretty lame, and totally different from my sketches....\n\nI agree to the critique about the tail of the “l”, there´s something not quite working between the l and y. I would have to look for a solution and make a soft implementaion.\n\nI went for some totally different and more “Italian” logos in the pitch for this job, but the customer chose the last sketch from a folder of sketches I just wanted to show them, where the logo could go in a more straight and modern direction. I´we actually grown fond of this logo after working with it for a while.\n\nThe little red symbol is actually working quite nice in small print. But I also use a version where I make the line a bit thicker both for the sub and the symbol. It depends on which kind of print it is, offset, digital etc... But since the red is 0,100,100,0 there are no rasterpoints, so it gets sharp.\n\nI have also a tree witch is used in different versions together with the logo. This gives the whole picture a more human feel and not so “airplane”:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007164731im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Ny_logo_tre_4818.jpg)\n\nPS: I´ll give you some insight to the menus and other material when I get time.\n\n"

It’s too far away from the ’a’ to be angled, and it doesn’t touch like the ’t’ and the ’a’. I think you should make it straight, despite the typeface.\n\n"

The logo is now implemented on menus, business cards, baloons, walls, 30meter banners, Adds etc etc. I was just down at the restaurant and had a nice lunch, the food tastes great and the interior and the profile works very well together.\n\nBut like I said, I´m in the position to make small changes, so I will keep all the feedback in mind.\n\nE\n\n"
