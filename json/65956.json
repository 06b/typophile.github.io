  "content": "Hello All,\n\nI cannot for the life of me remember the name of the type conference that publishes a book (perhaps specimen book) of their conference. It seems that I stumbled upon it once, but failed to book mark it. What I remember is that the 2009 book was no longer available but the 2008 book was or vice versa. Any help or leads would be greatly appreciated.\n\nwas thinking something from typecon, but cannot confirm.\n\nTbird\n\n",
