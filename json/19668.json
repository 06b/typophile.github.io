  "content": "im converting fonts over from post script to OTF and am having trouble when enabling them via ATM. When theyre in post script format the styles seem to fall under their parent type face (ie: univers selected in an app would have 55,65 etc under the style catagory). Now when i convert them to OTF each style becomes its own font family (ie: Univers 55, Univers 66 acting as 2 different fonts with only 1 style being normal/plain). How do i go about converting them to OTF while keeping the font names and styles intact? or how do i solve this problem?\n\nThanks for the help!\n\n [‹ Font cataloging print program](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120232118/http:/typophile.com/node/19660 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Opentype Contextual glyph replacement ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120232118/http:/typophile.com/node/15724 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
