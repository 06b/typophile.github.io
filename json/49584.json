  "content": "Flying out of Frankfurt today I kept noticing a guy on the plane that looked familiar. Then I realized it was [John D Berry](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201173844/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/John%252BD%252BBerry). So great to see a familiar (and friendly!) face in a foreign country. We shared a cab to our respective hotels.\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing the city’s massive monuments to autocrats, wars and past glory. I’m also hoping to get my fill of cyrillic alphabets; enough to perhaps finish my own cyrillic alphabets I’ve started.\n\nThe theme of ATypI is “The Old and The New”. Paying 500 rubles (about $20) for 5 hours of wireless internet while sitting in a smoky lounge — since I can’t get wireless in my hotel room — feels like a hearty dose of the _old_. I’m looking forward to some _new_. I’m really interested to see what local designers in Russia are working on right now.\n\nI’ll post notes here when I have pics up on Flickr. You’re welcome to see pics from my recent week at IBC Conference in Amsterdam. What an amazing week.
