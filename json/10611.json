      "content": "Francisco, I wouldnt go for anything under 75-100 a page. If you do go lower, put a clause in the contract that they only get x number of revisions, and after that you charge a higher hourly rate (about 2 or 3 revisions is good on average). Otherwise, you will be swamped with long and drawn out revisions over trite things.   \n   \nYou also need to factor in materials (mailing final files, prints for your own in-house review and for the printer). Thats kind of how I came up at about 75-100 a page, anything less and you might only end up making 20 an hr when its all said and done.\n\n"
