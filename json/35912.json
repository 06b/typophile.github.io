[I looked around and couldn’t find the name of that particular part of the anatomy…])?\n\nThanks to anyone who can decipher my criptic writings and can give me a couple of ideas.\n\nYou guys rock.\n\n-Adam\n\n [‹ (x) \"Grappling Submission\" square sci-fi display face - Electric Toaster {Mike Rohde (self)}](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008040657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35871 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Mitch\" distressed serif type - Caslon Antique (Casablanca Antique) {Mike F} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008040657/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35906 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
