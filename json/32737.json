  "content": "April 1, 2007, Berlin — FSI FontShop International proudly announces [FF Mt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107025048/http:/fontfont.com/downloads/)™, Erik Spiekermann's most economical typeface ever. Employing obscure but powerful techniques like _vwl mmssn_ and _cap reduction_, FF Mt uses up to 50% less paper, screen real estate, and wall space than other text faces without a single condensed letter. The German government has already incorporated FF Mt in their [road sign system](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107025048/http:/translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.fontblog.de/erster-font-mit-opentype-sprachintelligenz).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107025048im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vorwegweiser_gross_3612.gif)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------  \n_Before (left): Inconsistent hierarchy. Is Mönchengladbach less important than Münster or Dortmond? After (right): Clean hierarchy, increased legibility, 15% smaller sign saves costs._\n\nIn addition to its conservationist benefits, FF Mt also enables the generation of buzzwords, product names, and Web 2.0 domains _as the user types_.\n\nFinally, FF Mt prepares us for the future. English is changing. With the popularity of MMS and internet chat, spelling reform is occurring at a quickened pace. FF Mt accommodates this new condensed written language now. Any copy set in this advanced font will conform to next-generation standards, yet still pass present-day spell checkers.\n\nFSI FontShop International believes FF Mt is so revolutionary and beneficial to the Earth that access should not be limited to the few. Starting today, April 1 2007, the cross-platform font is available for free at [FontFont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107025048/http:/fontfont.com/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107025048im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mt_free_ani_5793.gif)\n  \n--------------------------------------------------------  \n [Download FF Mt and start changing the world today!](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107025048/http:/fontfont.com/downloads/)\n",
