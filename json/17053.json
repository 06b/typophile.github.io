      "content": "Hi, Philipp,\n\nUnfortunately to my knowledge there hasn't been such a book yet. I am thinking of starting to work on something similiar to this, a book on chinese type design and typography, preferably published bilingually. But that's not gonna happen within some years I guess.\n\nType setting in Chinese is not as complicated as with English. There are no ligature, hyphenation etc. to ponder about, and not as many considerations in the process of its type setting. However, there are certain rules in this regard, but it would be hard to summarize and introduce to you in a short time. You could write to me about your specific situation if you want. I'll see what I can do to help.\n\n"
