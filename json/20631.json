  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am a designer working on a poster for an in-house program that's promoting employees to take alternative transportation to work. The program is new so there are no set standards on style except I must use Trade Gothic Bold Condensed as one of my main fonts since it appears in their logo.\n\nI am looking for a good, complimentary font to Trade Gothic. I had initially assumed I'd be using this additional font for the text, but I'm open to the idea of using it as a headline instead if it fits the bill.\n\nThanks to all ahead of time!\n\n",

I think it was Stephen Coles who  \nposted it in a another post the other day, and I now  \nabsolutely love that face. It's another serif that has a 'fun',  \nslightly quirky feel to it with its single story 'a' and 'g'.\n\nOn a side not, do people think Dolly is going to become  \none of those overused, see it anywhere and everywhere  \ntypefaces? I really like it, but it almost seems like it is  \nbecoming the default typeface for 'fun' serifs.\n\nPhil\n\n"

I've been told, is a good companion to trade gothic, although it depends on your design. consider trade gothic as the text, hence a neo-gothic/grotesk for copy then decide what best compliments a grotesk for a headline.\n\n1) The obvious choice is a renaissane / roman, hence grotesks are a roman -sans with the same qualities., but would using a classic roman be justified in your poster theme? does it suit the style? probably not.\n\n2) then, try viewing all the fonts from the same type designer that created trade gothic, sometimes, like adrian frutiger, they suit each other well, ex: meridian/apollo go well with univers/frutiger. since the original designer of trade gothic used early grotesks as a base, you might have to dwelve deeper.\n\n3) Create a headline that suits the theme more than the copy. a font that conveys \"transportation\"... a few that come to mind are \" interstate for the U.S. and Frutiger for Europe (france).\n\n"
