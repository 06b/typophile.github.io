  "content": "Hi there!  \nI really hope this is the right forum to post the question in. I have a font called Skitch from Yellow Design. I have installed all 11 variations but only some of the are available in Photoshop. For example the Skitch fill version doesn't show. I am quite new at using an opentype font like that. I tried to look in the character sub menu in Photoshop but that didn't help. They show so many nice options on their site but I can't access them. F.ex how do you stretch the borders like that when they consist of two characters?  \nHere are some links  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/skitch/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720163555/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/skitch/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/skitch/\")  \n [http://yellowdesignstudio.com/fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720163555/http:/yellowdesignstudio.com/fonts \"http://yellowdesignstudio.com/fonts\")  \nThanks!\n\n",
