(I paused my stopwatch when the animated logotype, another useless and unwanted fillip, stopped moving.) You are then presented with an interface, using custom scrollbars and jammed into a little rectangle, to what appears to be the actual purpose of the site – discussion. Select an item and whaddya know – you’re sent away to the actual forum, built mostly around HTML. (Actually, it should be entirely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; there is no cause for Flash, save perhaps for sIFR.)\n\nWhat should the new homepage look like? It should look like the homepage of a site whose owners aren’t trying to show off and who actually want visitors to understand and use the site. The homepage should _be_ [the Forums page](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419093103/http:/typophile.com/forum/ \"/forum/\"). Hire somebody like Jason Santa Maria or Zeldman or Andy Clarke or Simplebits to work on it. But nearly anything would be better than the Flash monstrosity we’re stuck with now.\n\n",

I never go to the home page, so that's not an issue for me, but, for example, the links along the top and the search box are simply gone if I view the site on my iPhone. Using Flash for such basic site elements seems pointless.\n\nThe funny thing is that apparently I never, or rarely ever, use those parts of the site. I actually had to look at the site on my iPhone to see if they were there or not.\n\nI think it's also interesting (and perhaps telling) that the ads on the right side, which is usually where you see Flash used on other sites, rely on Javascript instead. So, I do get to see those on my iPhone (not that I'm complaining about that).\n\n"

I don't think that can fly. It sounds good, but closes the door to really learning the strengths and weaknesses of different traditions.\n\nAnd I don't think it's ethnocentricism. The critical tradition can look at multiple traditions and critically compare them--as well as being self critical. That's its power, which the others don't have.\n\nBuddhism has a lot of personal tolerance in it. But it never had a social or political doctrine, as far as I know. In China traditional social and political doctrine is Confucian, and Confucianism, while deeply humane, is equally deeply authoritarian.
