      "content": "Definitely custom + there have been a couple of versions - the latest has petit serifs...I also notice that their country-specific websites have started using just the logotype (ie without the rectangle/lozenge device) but yellow on white which breaks the cardinal heraldic rules of not putting a metal (silver/white) next to another metal (gold/yellow). Still, rules are there to break, just don't expect success when you photocopy the logo. Anyway, back to your original query, Antique Olive Nord may have influenced the IKEA logo a little.\n\n"
