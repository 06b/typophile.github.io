  "content": "I am looking for a appropriate font to use with some text (in English) by Plato. When I search for \"Greek\" fonts, often \"Trajan\" comes back. While the style of Trajan works well for my needs, it clearly links to Roman style. While I understand the Romans borrowed freely from Greek culture, I don't want to make a mistake of using a Trajan font if it does not really have any relation to the Greeks. If Trajan works, great. If there are other suggestions, I would enjoy hearing them! Thank you.\n\n",
