Ideal to use on wine labels or organic food packaging, stationery and old maps. It also makes a great choice for designs relating to outdoor activities and rugged travel, where the concept of the wild is to be accentuated.\n\nMatogrossoâ€™s OpenType programming combines several alternate lowercase characters to generate perfect fit and more natural textures.\n\nVisit [Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203001218/http:/www.sudtipos.com/).\n\n",
