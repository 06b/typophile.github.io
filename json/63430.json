Being that the type is hand drawn, and the word is uncommon, I'm worried about the viewer's ability to pick up the name. Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\nJim\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018114941im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tk_5599.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Is it really supposed to say Tommy Knocker? Damn that's bad. It looks fun though, but I would probably put the \"Tommy\" part all on the left side without the first M at the top, but instead lower, so that it would say \"Tommy\" diagonally. If done right, it will bring the Y more to the left so you have more room for \"Knocker\" so you won't have to do that horror with the \"noc\" part. Don't make \"no\" into one letter/symbol, don't cut the \"o\" in half, and don't make the \"c\" so big. That being said, I do need to compliment you on the style of the letters and the illustration. Nice work there.\n\n"
