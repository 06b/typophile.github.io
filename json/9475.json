Yes, it's custom, as Dan said, but if you want to imitate it (non-commercially, of course), look for Latin Serif fonts, like [Spike Incised](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516143714/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/quadrat/spike/incised/testdrive.html?s=MARINERS&p=48).\n\n"

If you add a stroke to it, it would really resemble the new logo in your sample.\n\n"
