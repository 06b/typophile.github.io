If any error messages come up, or it takes a long time, disregard them, your message will be posted.   \n   \nWhat I do is launch a duplicate window before posting. Then do the posting process. After a couple of seconds, close the posting window (regardless of whether it's finished loading). When you refresh the remaining window you will see your post.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

Go to myfonts.com, login and update the settings to display the word(s) you need and then do a keyword search. This helps visualize other options you might not consider. Also, I'm not a big fan of free fonts, but a recent client wanted to do a poster that had writing like the old really bad \"b\" monster movies (i.e. the swamp thing, black lagoon). He didn't find anything that work in the commercial arena so we did a search in the free fonts and he found the perfect one. It is a really bad quality font that gave the exact look he wanted.\n\n"
