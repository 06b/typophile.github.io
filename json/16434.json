I have the concept for the poster already, I just need to execute the idea, and this is the one thing that I’m not sure about. The poster is inspired by blotter art, and will essentially **be** a sheet of blotter with this logotype underneath the blotter (I am planning to take out the pieces of the actuall blotter so you can see the logotype, like a puzzle).\n\nOh, and the play is called “The Grateful Alive”, yeah as in “The Grateful Dead”. :)  \nI need (with your help I hope) yet to figure out the placement for the “The” and the “Alive”. I’m thinking: “The”—top left, “Alive”—bottom right. But I’m not sure about the style.\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nEdit: Aaargh, stupid SmartyPants ...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [grateful\\_typo01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120091037/http:/typophile.com/files/grateful_typo01.jpg) | 46 KB |\n\n [‹ Making things bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120091037/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17180 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Designing the Uppercase B and lowecase b ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120091037/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17036 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The daisy was a pacifist symbol for peace.\n\nNow on the type “The would never be on a straight line It would follow the curve of the characters below. The h would drop and tuck under the t and get larger and the e would follow the curve and become larger (filling the space). These posters were hand drawn and they took liberties to fake spacing. The second l in gratefull looks like a t. Once again make Alive fill the shape and follow the curve. Destortion is a good thing for 60s a look.\n\n"

The swash on the bottom of the t is hindering recognition, you could look at bringing the f down to link to the swash and have the t as a more recognisable character, btw your a & e counters look white rather than the background pattern  \nYou are right about the spelling of Grateful.  \nAs for the v sign (although it wouldn’t be ideal for the UK\\*) I think, given the context and style of the poster, you can use it if it doesn’t have any local cultural connotations beyond peace.  \nTim  \n\\*I first thought you were telling the Grateful Alive to go forth and multiply (or rather a more Anglo-Saxon term)\n\n"
