  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m looking for a serif font similar to Clarendon (see ning.com) with a tail on the lower case ’z’. I love the ’g’ in that font but my name doesn’t have a g in it.\n\nCan anyone suggest a suitable font? Its for a masthead / logo on a website.\n\nthanks!\n\n [‹ Tuscon AZ Type meet-up?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122063226/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48365 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Buy Cadena for cheap and awesome. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122063226/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43560 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
