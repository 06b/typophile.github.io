Those were the two programs I had heard about (I was hoping there might be others).\n\nI found this article:  \n [http://www.jefferycotton.net/info.asp?pgs=hairpin](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825141849/http:/www.jefferycotton.net/info.asp?pgs=hairpin \"http://www.jefferycotton.net/info.asp?pgs=hairpin\")\n\nIt would seem to say that Finale is the better choice, as does most of the chatter on the web on the subject. But I wonder if it is not a Quark versus InD debate...\n\nTiffany, if your brother has used both, I would love to know what his feelings are on the subject!\n\n- Robert\n\n"
