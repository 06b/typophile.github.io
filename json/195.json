  "content": "My company has a TrueType font for our company logos and unfortunately a couple years ago when someone created it, they forgot to check the box marked FREELY REDISTRIBUTABLE. So now when we just bought Acrobat 5, it won't let us export our own font!   \n   \nWe have since lost our old version of Fontographer and I am looking for a way to change this single setting. Although I would love to do type design one day, I don't have time for that right now. Are there any utilities or demos I could download that would get the job done without having to spend $300? Thanks!   \n   \n- Adam   \n   \nP.S. Please respond by email if possible to [adam@monier.net](mailto:adam@monier.net)\n\n",
