  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs many of you may know, I’ve been playing drums in British/Belgian pop/rock band Troubleman for over 10 years. If you want to know what we do, where we’ve been, and sample our music please visit our [MySpace](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201075329/http:/www.myspace.com/troublemantheband) or [Facebook](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201075329/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/Troubleman/8599842637) page. In the increasingly difficult music business the quality of your music isn’t sufficient enough for a breakthrough and a band needs all the help it can get.\n\nNow that our second album is out we might have a shot at something more serious. Bel-RTL has a new concept for Sunday nights between 9PM and midnight. Three bands are featured on the Bel RTL website and during the broadcast. Every Sunday the band that garnered the most votes will get airplay and an interview on the premier radio of the French community in Belgium. Troubleman was selected for the first broadcast with “Radio”, so vote for us! It’s simple — just click the link below and select “Troubleman” in the list.  \n [http://www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201075329/http:/www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge \"http://www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge\")\n\nVoting ends on Tuesday midnight, so there’s a little over 24 hours left. Thank all of you who decide to help us. ;^)\n\n [‹ Another hypothetical](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201075329/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49874 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help with Identity ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201075329/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49903 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When it originally started a week ago the middle guy received a staggering 800+ votes within a few minutes, bringing him to 90% of the votes. I don’t know if you can devise a program that does that automatically (vote - erase cookies - vote - erase cookies and so on), but it was sufficient for the organisation to let us compete again. I think now at least we stand a fair chance. :^)\n\n"

My chest is nowhere as impressive as John Downer’s nor Dolly Parton’s.  \n2. My personal music views are left of center, yet when I play it’s right on.  \n3. I’m still waiting to get out of puberty, but Prince made a tremendous impression on me and greatly influenced my drumming style. Little did I know back then he mainly used a [drum machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201075329/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_machine#Digital_sampling).  \n4. Because they live fast (and consequently die young). And they’re crazy. A can’t miss combination.  \n5. Yes.  \n6. That’s elitist crap. I don’t know anyone who makes music and doesn’t want the rest of the world to hear it.  \n7. I’d dance on their collective graves as they ripped off countless artists in the past and are directly responsible for the current malaise in the music business.\n\n"
