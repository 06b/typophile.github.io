I have looked at all the slabs I could find, and nothing is particularly close, with the angled slab serifs on the T, L and E. However, as a long time outline-tweaker, I can imagine that a font like Nick Curtis’ [Spaghetti Western](http://web.archive.org/web/20060204102148/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/) could quickly be made to look like this just by moving the serif corners inward. I picked this font because it had no top serif on the A, and the K and E were the right kinds. (It’s not that I’m promoting Nick today ;-))\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
