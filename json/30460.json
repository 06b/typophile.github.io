  "content": "I have to design Olive Oil labels (with more products to come). do you have any sources of inspiration? Labels that make you go \"Wow!\". Books, Web sites?\n\nI'm looking for inspiration. I'm desperate.\n\nThis will be my first time. After years of mediocre design for undeserving clients and design agencies, I am now crippled with stunted typographic skills.\n\nPS—I live in Ireland, so I can't visit the local _Safeway_ to look at labels on the shelves if you are directing me to American brands.\n\nJC\n\n",
