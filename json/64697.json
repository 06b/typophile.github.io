  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis is my first post here & I know I will get some good honest feedbacks.  \nThis a logo for a technical exhibit that happens in my company once every year. Basically the logo is for the theme this year — iNewvation.\n\nThe idea is to show that new ideas coupled with active efforts lead to innovation.  \nThe logo is not something very hot .. basically trying to show “out of the box thinking” & through some movement in the logo the act of breaking out of the box!\n\nI have some serious doubts about the kerning and the general feel of the logo though as I cant say I am very adept at that and it is my first attempt at something like this. Would love to hear your comments on this and improve it as much as I can ...\n\nThank you all for the feedbacks already :)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116065723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/TechfairLogo_3691.v1.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Technically, it seems proficient. But stylistically it may have a little too much \"boing\" in it. Implied motion is great in a logo like this, but it's a little too playful. Add to that, the dot seems out of place on the \"I\". If you must have some whoosh, I would consider looking at alternative strategies, either with the letters themselves, or around the letters, or as an extension of the box. I would take a look at how other designers have achieved this for inspiration.\n\nAnd definitely avoid running the \"WV\" together. As is, it could be read as either \"WV\" or \"VW\".\n\nBut overall this looks crisp, feels professional, has breathing room. The box isn't an amazing illustration--its white edges might not be ideal--but it conveys the point.\n\nThe green/yellow color might not be the most inviting, but the color coding is definitely a good look and adds to the dynamics of the logo.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for the feedbacks ...\n\n@ dirtcastle : The reason I clubbed the W and V together was because there was going to be a clear distinction with colour (Since only the colour version of the logo will be used -- in banners & t shirts), and I wanted the whole up down zig zag thing to create a path of movement for the \"whoosh\" .. but yeah, I will definitely try separating them and simplifying what the logo is trying to say ... will also try improve the illustration and maybe add something to it to give the feeling of movement instead of messing up the type.\n\n@ ratbaggy : I know what you mean if you think it is way to complex. I can see the hoch poch going on in the middle of the type too. Any suggestions on how can I can avoid that and still depict \"breaking free\"? btw what do you mean by \"someone clearly thought this was “genius\"? Just asking ..\n\nThanks again for the feedback! Much appreciated :) !\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not a huge fan of the super-smart wordplay either, but the logo concept is pretty cool. I'd lose the box though – too many stories in one logo.\n\nI'm not quite sold on the angles of the springy curve on top of the \"A\". The \"incoming\" angle is much flatter (and also looks like it's receding into the distance), so the sudden steepness of the \"outgoing\" curve seems unmotivated.  \nBut maybe that's just me.\n\nIn any case, it seems that the kerning could use some more love, especially around \"VAT\"; and you should really finalize that before doing much more work on the boingy line on top.\n\nAlso, type-related:  \n- I agree that it looks too much like the \"W\" and \"V\" are really one letter. I'd try moving the \"V\" away, and also making the \"W\" a little narrower, so that it doesn't look like it's made of two \"V\"s.  \n- Have you tried making the middle apex of the \"W\" (and the joins of the \"N\") pointy as well, like the bottoms of \"V\"/\"W\"? Might give it more sharpness.  \n- Any reason for the \"A\"s lack of a crossbar? FWIW I don't think that's particularly fresh (\"innovative\") anymore (not that it needs to be bad – just asking).  \n- The tittle on the \"I\" needs to be a bit larger. And it's shifted left relative to the boingy curve.\n\n"
