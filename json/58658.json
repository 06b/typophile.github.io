Do you agree? Do you disagree? Why? Also, please criticize the typesetting of the example itself.\n\nIf we want web typography to be respected as a part of our art and craft, web typesetting deserves our fullest criticism – judging the work on aesthetic merits while accounting for available technologies.\n\nTim\n\n",

As unfriendly as it is, at least you only have to make the file once.  \nEverybody with Windows has IE to fall back to. (Retreat!)  \nMakes looking at examples a lot more reliable.\n\n"

More people need to care, as you do (and as I do), for an unbiased experience. Not necessarily the same experience [http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120414232533/http:/dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/ \"http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com\") &nbsp;... but an unbiased experience in that, if there exists the capability, no agent should be segregated. I trust you won't stop reminding people to pay attention to their entire audiences.\n\n"
