      "content": "Looks custom to me and /g totally made from scratch but could be wrong. For \"enie\", you could start with some geometric sans like [Avant-Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015113827/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic) Bold and cut crossbars. I don't know how to reproduce this /g (which looks terrible for me) and I don't know any font that could fit it unfortunately. The best way would probably be to entirely draw it. You could start for instance with Avant-Garde Gothic /o and add it a custom leg of your own. An easy alternative would be [Kabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015113827/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/kabel).\n\n"
