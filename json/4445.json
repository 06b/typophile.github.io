  "content": "Hey all,   \n   \nFirst real critique post for me... Can I get your opinions on this? It stands for \"Robert Sainte-Marie\". He's an interior designer friend of mine. I thought of including the hyphen but it made the S look somewhat like a F. Do you think I should raise the \"m\" a little? It looks a bit like it's falling to the right to me, I'm not sure. Any other comments?   \n   \nThanks!   \nEm   \n   \n ![Monogram](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021031510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34225.gif)\n\n",

The lowercase script is also the source of trouble with the S vs f. These letters have tons of potential. If you have a copy of Fonts & Logos take a look at pages 108/109 and 234/235 for monogram ideas. If not I will pull a scan in the next few days if you like.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

I agree with you on the r, the fact it's inside the sloop also bugs me a little because it looks so \"internetey\".

I guess you could leave the \"S\" subtle, or if you want it more visible give it some curve in the spine, somehow.   \n   \nYour second direction is cool too (and more \"S\"-visible) - I guess it depends what kind of interior design he does.

I also messed some more with the initial direction (mostly cleaned it up) I liked the shapes but I don't want too much of the inky texture since I don't believe that fits with what he does.   \n   \n ![RSM](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021031510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34275.gif)   \n ![RSM](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021031510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34276.gif)   \n ![RSM](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021031510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/34277.gif)   \n   \nAny feedback on this?   \n   \nThanks!   \nEm\n\n"
