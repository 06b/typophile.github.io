Its basic shape is like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417123346im_/http:/typophile.com/files/v-shape_6451.png)\n  \n.\n\nThe goal is to make \"V\" resemble a flipped over \"A\" and include a pointy, arrow-like element to render a concept of \"bouncing back\".\n\nI thought I'd try and see if/how it would look in a Serif font, made few sketches and that's when I realized that I am seriously out of my depth here. I mean they look OK to me, but I just can't tell if the Serif option is something that's worth pursuing.\n\nAny thoughts, advice or comments on the following pair of sketches ? Either specific or of a general nature (e.g. \"don't mess with a good typeface\").\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417123346im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bvc_4655.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417123346im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bvc-2_5102.png)\n\n",
