      "content": "Hey,  \nI liked very much the beginning and the music; also you seem to have grasped some of the very first visual tricks of typography based animation. Since motion graphics is [my main source of income](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042935/http:/www.motions.it/), I can maybe tell you a couple of things I noticed wathing the video. I can gather you worked in flash, right? To achieve a more interesting look you could (if you aren’t already) begin to investigate After Effects: the software isn’t as simple as flash but so are the results.  \nWorking in AE can give you a lot more control to the dynamics of the animation (I noticed some unsure passages here anad there), and something crucial to motion graphics in general and type animation in particular: motion blur, an often overlooked detail that can spell the difference between ’rich’ or ’poor’ animation. In addition to that AE lets you animate characters in a 3d-planes world... not that i don’t like the 2d animation of your movie: personally I prefer it almost always over 3d, but certainly the possibility of 3d is something that opens up a lot of ideas in type animation.  \nOne great way to work with type is to make typography animation of dialogues of famous films: lately [the great one from Pulp Fiction](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042935/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=syf8olcM0z4) has been making the rounds, a very good example of what I mean (though, personally, I think that adding the original sound somewhat makes things too easy: if it works without the speech, then it’s truly great).\n\n"

Both in terms of concepts to grip and in terms of cost.</cite>  \nI don’t really know the legal side of it, but for type animation you are basically set with AE 6 or 6.5 (I think even 5 is ok, but later they introduced the ’text’ object), so if you can manage to get an old version (used or obsolete), that would be almost just as good as CS3.  \n<cite>I could have enjoyed a slightly faster pace actually.

I wonder if he worked on the completed music or had some kind of creative feedback with the composer.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank all of you for your kind comments:\n\nsatya: Yes I knew the Pulp Fiction Animation. Really impressive - on a whole different level. I haven’t seen the mk12 animation though. Thank you for the link.\n\nnicola: You are damn right with the AE thing. Though I would have used Combustion rather then After Effects.  \nBut I did the whole piece in 3dsmax. The stupid thing is that this scene is just one real scene. I’m not scaling anything - it’s just a camera that is flying through the words.  \nBecause of that I had some really big problems with the animation, since all 3d Packages tend to have problems with really small values. The clock at the beginning for example is around 100 km in size - compared to the smallest sentence (“to see the truth”) which is 2 mm in size. That’s too much of a difference for any 3d package I think. So I should have used AE in the first place, as you said. I could have done the editing (or beat matching) there on the fly as well.  \nAnd the beat matching was my problem as well. I had a version with motion blur. But it was hard to control, because it was too much in most of the scenes, because of the extreme zooms. You are probably right, but I left it out with intention (together with film grain, dark corners and other fancy effects) - to see the crystal clear truth you know ;)  \nYou work is top notch. I have concentrated on 3danimation but will damn sure get closer to motion design... it’s such a powerful field (as it becomes obvious on your site)  \nthanks for your suggestions.\n\npaul d hunt: :D Thank you for the link. It is brilliant. ’Love it!\n\nEben Sorkin: Thank you. What do you mean with more surprises?  \nYeah the pace was really hard. It’s hard to get an idea how fast people read... and I didn’t want people to stress too much when they read it. By that it turned a tad too slow probably.  \nNext is... well a lot of projects going on - this was more a weekend job... check my website and blog for updates :) [http://www.alexanderlehmann.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025042935/http:/www.alexanderlehmann.net/ \"http://www.alexanderlehmann.net\")\n\nThe music was done and final before I started working on this. This is a compliment though - since it really seems to tie in great. :)\n\n"
