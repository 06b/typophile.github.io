I’ve seen the Fontwise site, and tried their little standalone demo, but wasn’t overly impressed and am seeking other options. Is anyone aware of alternative network font audit tools? I could just write some scripts, but I bet there are good tools out there already. Please share your experiences and recommendations!\n\nThanks.\n\n",

It was the VisiBone Automated Font Survey. I’m not sure if this will do what you need, but perhaps it’s worth a look: [http://www.visibone.com/font/tests.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060716120704/http:/www.visibone.com/font/tests.html)\n\n"
