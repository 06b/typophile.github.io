Related to that, I think lettering on boats, planes, etc. can benefit from it.\n\nThat said, I do feel there's more unexplored potential for Ritalic, especially concerning mixing with Semitic scripts (which go leftward).\n\nhhp\n\n"

Using them to indicate sarcasm is an interesting idea, but it's just useful to have another way to indicate emphasis.\n\nThe thought has struck me that it might be a good thing if reversed italics for the Roman alphabet were sloped by a significantly smaller angle (say by 15 degrees or so) than normal italics. That would avoid them being mistaken for normal italics at a quick glance. Also, that would be useful to avoid clashing with how the letters are structured, and to allow them to be a slanted roman instead of a semi-script-like new set of characters like true italics. (And having them a slanted roman again differentiates them from normal italics in a second way.)\n\n"
