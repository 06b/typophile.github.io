  "content": "_The New York Times Magazine_ unveiled a redesign today. Aside from the magazine being \"9 percent smaller -- a little off the top, a little off the sides\" (as the editor wrote in his letter that doesn't seem to be online), there is a brand new type palette at work. \"This week we are introducing a new typeface, [Lyon Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018120940/http:/carvalho-bernau.com/retailfonts/lyon), that was designed by Kai Bernau and Christian Schwartz and will be used exclusively by the magazine. It is more condensed than our previous typeface -- with the result that the words-per-page tally has hardly been affected. Perhaps if we hadn't mentioned it, you would hardly know the difference.... We are introducing new display-type faces -- [Knockout](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018120940/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013) (by the studio Hoefler & Frere-Jones) and Nyte (by the Portuguese designer [Dino dos Santos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018120940/http:/www.dstype.com/)) ...\"\n\nThese three are joined by [Stymie](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018120940/http:/typophile.com/node/6774) and Process Type's [Sunday](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018120940/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/custom/sunday.html) from the previous design.\n\nScans below.

      "content": "\"What you are sure to have noticed is our new design. When we were told last winter that our dimensions were being downsized, we took a cue from Rahm Emanuel -- we muttered lots of words we aren't allowed to print, then saw how our 'crisis' might present an opportunity: a redesign. The magazine's look had not changed much during this decade, and for at least one good reason: We have annually won a raft of design awards, including the 2007 magazine-of-the-year-award from the Society of Publication Designers. But every object can use a bit of refurbishing now and then, and that is what our art director, Arem Duplessis, and his staff have done -- they've given the magazine a cleaner, more modern feel without changing who we are and what we do.\"\n\n"
