  "content": "G’day\n\nI’m a little bit worried, we have a deadline to get this book finished this week but indesign has just started crashing everytime I attempt to mve from the current page. It also does it on other copies of indesign on other computers so it must be the file itself. I have kept the display performance at typical, I have thrown out all styles copied over from word, I have trashed the preferences file. Does anybody know anything else to try, kind of desperate.\n\nI work by copying text out of word and pasting it into pages, I select all the italics and change it to an italic style and then I force the body text style over the top. Up until now, I’ve had no problems with this method.  \ncheers\n\nNick\n\n [‹ Bezier question](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122346/http:/typophile.com/node/33004 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Dingbats ID ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122346/http:/typophile.com/node/32904 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When you hit “Save” you’re saving all of that chalk. “Save As” is like doing a thorough cleaning of the boards and then writing only the final set of notes onto a clean background.\n\nAs for the transfer from Word to InDesign, like Nicholas I tend to simply “Select All” and copy the content from the Word manuscript and paste the entire thing into the first text frame of my InDesign file, then create new P & C styles and work through the book from start to finish to apply the sytles. Occasionally the styles don’t take and I have to manually apply/strip certain attributes, but this allows me to keep the manuscript’s formating (italics, etc.) even though I’m changing fonts & sizes, etc. This is the way I’ve always brought Word docs into InDesign and I’ve never had a problem.\n\nThat said, I work on a PC, so I don’t have the frustrating OS problems that Mac users are always pretending they don’t have.\n\n"

I rarely if ever make one file for a whole book.\n\nJason - I was having the same problem with the styles not “taking” but if you hold down shift+command (on a mac) when you apply the style, it overrides whatever else is in there. Also, select all and hit “No Paragraph Style” before you start.\n\nBut here’s a question, if you apply the character styles FIRST then you don’t have the override problem when you apply the paragraph style?

This normally fixes the bug. I only use “Clear Overrides” as a last resort.\n\nFor a while I played with setting up my styles first using placeholder text, then clear the document of content and bring in the Word copy, using InDesign’s replace-Word-styles-with-InDesign-styles dialogue, but this never seemed to transfer smoothly, so I’ve gone back to bringing in the Word file and manually applying the InDesign styles I’ve created. Then I trash all of the Word styles and continue to tweak the content both through my style definitions and manually, where necessary. These are often 400 page books with more than a dozen master pages and dozens of graphics and I’ve yet to have a major issue.\n\nAll of this, of course, depends on how well copy-edited the manuscript is. I have one client who sends me the most meticulously formated manuscripts you can imagine, with good, clean stylesheets used throughout and the text fully colour-coded (blue italics, red acronyms, green parens/brackets, orange URLs, etc.), but the majority of the source documents are chaotic disasters. Thus, manually applying my custom styles one paragraph at a time is my own method of damage control in that it forces me to format the project piece by piece, thus gaining some real connection to the content, which is always a good thing.\n\n"

It will be rebuilt with this system’s fonts._??\n\nIn 1993 I did a very complicated scholarly book, 256 pages, 8.5 x 11 with text in 2 cols, with huge numbers of illustrations and detailed notes at the end of each chapter. As mentioned above by someone I saved it in chapter chunks rather than in one large file (thank goodness!). I was probably using XPress 3.32, can’t remember now. Anyhow, I started this job on my Mac IIcx and it never left my machine. Ever. In general I adored this project: great editors, great content, nice design, just fun all around. So most of the time I cruised along, thoroughly enjoying myself.\n\nBut then, after toiling away to get the textual reference to a picture to be on the same spread as the picture, or to accomplish any number of things that we all like to do with fine typesetting, sometimes going back 3 or 4 or 5 pages to gain or lose a line, out of the blue I’d get this sudden message. It was as bad as getting “the bomb.” It drove me crazy because there was no pattern to it. Despite hours of consultation, Apple and Quark were never able to find out what was wrong.\n\nAnd of course when you are experimenting with something like these moves, you don’t want to save the file every 5 minutes because you may not like where you end up! Once the dreaded message appeared, all the text for the entire chapter would reflow, ruining all my careful tracking moves, soft returns, and so forth. I would either revert if I was lucky, or sometimes I’d have to do a “thumbnail drag” (for those of you not familiar with XPress, think of it as an “extreme save as”) to generate a new file.\n\nAnyway, just curious if any of you ever ran into this. I was astonished, since no other external system was ever involved, and my own computer remained constant in terms of what system I was running at that time.\n\n"

We have a set of routines that we run on the RTF files that change the RTF formatting strings into InDesign tags — we call such files .ITT (InDesign Tagged Text). These are then imported into InDesign. All this on a PC, but it should work for a Mac.\n\nThe hard (well, laborious) part is writing the initial conversion program going from .RTF to “.ITT” — but once that is done, you’re in business. BTW, don’t try importing an RFT file — InDesign will mess up some of the characters.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
