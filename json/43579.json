My only grumble is that is is a bit thin with direct-to-plate printing, which is quite understandable given that Sumner made it in the repro days. I have the new Cycles in various sizes, but have not used it so cannot confirm my impression it will still be a tiny bit thin with DTP printing. But I have this complaint about lightness-when-printed with a lot of fonts; other may find it just to their taste.\n\nHave also used Stone Print for a long text. Wonderful font if you don’t specify the measure too long. You can really pack in the characters, to either save space (book length) or increase margins.\n\nSan Francisco Public Library looks very interesting, in between Cycles and Stone Print in terms of how condensed it is. There is a fair need for slightly condensed fonts, and SFPL looks like it might fit the bill for this.\n\nI have been using Magma Compact for a few books now, and like that too. I’ve used it paired with Quadraat, and for a companion display sans, like it better than Quadraat sans.\n\nAs to ITC — Sumner once remarked that he had to license the Stone “clan” (Stone regular, sans, and informal) back from ITC in order to sell them, even though he was the designer.\n\nAll in all, I think there are some good bargains here on some pretty darn good fonts.\n\n"

But the newer ones, which ought to be flying off the shelf on merit alone, offer deal-breaking problems of incompleteness and formatting.\n\nSFPL, very attractive, lacks a bold italic. What happens when some Bay Area librarian wants bold italic? Does her boss reply, “Mister Stone said you won’t need it”? And consider Cycles from a type consumer’s viewpoint: what the f——?! Of the four optical weight text families, only Cycles nine and eleven have even a semibold roman, and none has a semibold italic. And that blizzard of specialty fonts for fractions and tabular this and that could all have been folded into an OpenType version by now, which Stone does not offer. Compare Cycles against its nearest competitor, Arno Pro by Slimbach: not only complete in OpenType, but more than complete! For this reason, Arno will probably also kick Requiem’s ass, even though Requiem is superior on details—R still has no bold or bold italic.\n\n"

Someone else, who uses mice type or display type a lot, might consider these potential family members indispensible. Then there are those who want language support. And others who can’t do without small caps, or old-style figures. And so on.

It’s certainly possible, if you have enough control over the situation and are willing to walk some people through it. It’s also a nice test of one’s skills to find alternate solutions. However, I will admit that it creates certain limitations, such as no titles in bold heads, etc.\n\nSome typefaces, such as the aforementioned Requiem, are designed in such a way that heavier weights would violate the purpose/ spirit of the face, so those marketing them should be up front about the intended specialized use. Requiem is a book face (and I’ve seen it do a fantastic job in books like _Cloud Atlas_), so the only reason to add weights to a family like that is to increase sales, not to truly serve the user.\n\nThat being said, I have had clients who balked at a type choice with that ’limitation’. If I write about a type family, I always mention its range and note the lack of any expected weights/ styles, as should anyone reviewing type. As a type consumer, I can attest that offering a family without a bold italic will limit a typeface’s appeal/ sales, particularly amongst non-typophiles. But the worlds is full of choices, so why kvetch?\n\n"

Not so.\n\nTo share my own experience — I often will not buy the bold and bold italic even when they are available. Titling and small caps are far, far more important to me. I have used bold italic once in a book design and it worked quite well, but it is not indispensible. Almost always, I think, it is better to do without them. There is now a proliferation of what could best be described as the Word-document-design-aesthetic and it is the new ugliness.\n\nThus I was quite disappointed to find that the new edition of the Scifi novel Dune used bold italic on epigraphs. It is a step in the wrong direction, I think: it looked better before.\n\nI’m sure that bold and bold italic have their place, but that place is not at the very center of book design.\n\n"
