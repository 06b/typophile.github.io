I know that some of his colleagues are away, so he may be at the same event.\n\nYou can call the Linotype offices - the phone number is on their website: [http://www.linotype.com/53/contactdetails.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222213318/http:/www.linotype.com/53/contactdetails.html \"http://www.linotype.com/53/contactdetails.html\")\n\nThey have normal business hours in their time zone, so keep that in mind when you call. You should be able to find out Akira’s availability when you call.\n\nGood luck with everything.\n\n"
