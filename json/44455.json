I know it has to work at all sizes, for posters, packaging, billboards, letterheads and business cards.\n\nWhen I design the typeface do i create one identity, one image, one file and then scale it down for stuff like my letterhead? or do I create various sizes which then can be applied to various mediums?\n\nWhat is the professional way to do this?\n\nhope you typoheads can help me here!!\n\n [‹ sans serif robots](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153351/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44529 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Teaspoon ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153351/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44370 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Usually when you design a logotype you would design different version for different conditions. These conditions are defined by all the uses you can imagine the logotype would be used in - these works as limitations on the complexity of the design. For instance, if the logo is to be printed in flexography in one inch width that sets some harsh limitations colours and details. So you take the worst case uses and work your way up from there. Usually a simple black version of the ’mother’ logo is created to be used in these worst case situations, and proper colour logotypes are then used in normal usage.\n\nSize concerns are solved also be making several versions for different sizes. The typography can be optimised for small usage by slightly widening the letterforms, increase the letterspacing and increasing the x-height. All these differences should be harmonious and coherent, and invisible to the layman’s eye.\n\nWhether one, a few, or many version of the logotype is needed, depends on the character of the logotype, so your milage may vary.\n\n"

      "content": "Illustrator will create vector art, except if you have applied any filter that renders a bitmap results - e.g. like a drop shadow. The logos should then be in 100% of the size they are to be used in. The largest logo version is free to be scaled up, but the other variations should not be scaled, so that there are only a number of absolute sizes/version of the logo used across printed elements.\n\nWeb versions of the logo is much more complicated (in practical usage). It depends who designs the webdesign and uses the logo. If they know what they are doing it’s better just to give them the EPS logo made for small size. You can supply GIF, and JPEG versions for web use, but often they won’t fit the usage and the web-designer will ask for the EPS anyway.\n\n"
