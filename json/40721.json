Any help with ID'ing this typeface would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FilmInFocus\\_Logowtagline 9.5.07.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220839/http:/typophile.com/files/FilmInFocus_Logowtagline%209.5.07.jpg) | 47.43 KB |\n\n",

I suspect it is a custom or modified font to match the FOCUS logo. (I thought the FOCUS logo was AG Old Face, but it's not.) (Incidentally, the Neutraface M is slightly splayed, too.)
