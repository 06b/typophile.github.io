  "content": "Found a few faces I quite liked in an old sample book and fancied bringing a couple into the digital age. had a look around but couldn't find digital versions of any, but wanted a few more eyes to check them over and ensure I don't duplicate work...\n\nFaces are here: [http://www.stone-soup.co.uk/uploads/fonts1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719115716/http:/www.stone-soup.co.uk/uploads/fonts1.jpg \"http://www.stone-soup.co.uk/uploads/fonts1.jpg\")\n\nObviously Hidalgo is very much a Clarendon style slab, but there's a couple of differences (notably the 2 and 7 which I've failed to put on the sample), and Crusader seems to mostly be Swash/decorative caps -- I'm mostly interested in Philite, as I've fallen in love with it and want to get stuck in.\n\nAnyone spot any that I shouldn't bother with?\n\n",
