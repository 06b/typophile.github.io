That's fair enough.\n\nHowever, when you find arguments that support your point of view you do not seem to check if they are actually true, maybe because when checking them they might turn out to be invalid. That's not OK. Please check your statements more thoroughly before you post them. It is not about asking others to prove you wrong, you should only post statements if you are certain to be correct.\n\n<cite>So specify and prove at least TWO untrue statements.</cite>\n\nYou're not getting the point here. It is YOUR responsibility to verify all the information BEFORE you post it. You cannot simply publish stuff and see if people tell you off.\n\nAnyway, a simple example: On your website you say that Linotype has awarded the \"Certificate of Excellence in Type Design\" to their own fonts. Do you deliberately post such incorrect information? Or were you just to lazy to check it? Or were you worried to find out that your argument is invalid if you found out who actually awards the \"Certificate of Excellence in Type Design\"?\n\nPlease dont't reply something like \"OK - what else is wrong?\". It is not my job to look for errors on your website. It is your own responsibility to check what you write.\n\n<cite>“Statements” in plural? This would mean at least TWO.<br>\nSo specify and prove at least TWO untrue statements.</cite>\n\nThat sound very much like you are already aware of ONE lie?\n\nBtw, I am still wondering about your motivation for doing what you do.

However, this is an internet discussion and people think differently:\n\nIf you want to convince people you have to make an effort so they agree with you.\n\nIf someone spots a single error/lie in what you say (and most of them will not even be bothered to tell you) they will (unlike a judge) not believe a single word of what else you say.\n\nMaybe that helps in our discussions?\n\n"

That said, you wrote:\n\n<cite>The Australian FontShop ... is even presently offering Paxim and Parlament for sale</cite>\n\nI just checked, and the Australian site doesn't offer the fonts you mention for sale. In fact, none of the iterations of FontShop worldwide offer Paxim or Parlament. The .JPG links you provided could be forgeries themselves for all I know (or care). But, unless you provide a working link to an active FontShop page somewhere in the world offering the fonts you mention for sale, there's no basis to your argument. If FontShop offered it for sale in 2004, why post about it now? What can anybody at Typophile do about it?\n\n<cite>For Mr. Ahrens and for the other Typophile members it seems to be entirely legal for forgers to snatch the fonts made by others and to rename them and sell them as their own fonts.</cite>\n\nTypophile members don't make the law. Indeed, many are quite upset at current U.S. copyright law which, in fact, doesn't protect typeface designs themselves, only the source code of the computer files.\n\nBut, if you are arguing the morality of copying and reselling fonts under different names, you'd do much better to avoid _ad hominem_ attacks on members of the Typophile community and the purchasers of the fonts they create. Likewise, if you want to be taken seriously as an impartial \"documenter\" rather than a biased \"prosecutor\" with an axe to grind, I'd take a page from journalists' book and avoid using loaded words like \"font _forgers_\" and \"_criminal_ research.\"\n\nAs of yet, I have not seen in this thread nor in others you have started any willingness to ascribe to these simple rules of polite discourse.

      "content": "Uli,\n\nwhile I'm not in any way part of the dispute, I would like to make some comments on your findings and claims.\n\nAs you point out in [http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/escoria.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123085044/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/escoria.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/escoria.pdf\"), the original type design Chevalier was designed by Emil A. Neukomm in 1946 at Haas, and was distributed in Germany by D. Stempel AG from the 1950s on. As you probably, know, both Haas and Stempel assets have been acquired by Linotype-Hell around 1985-89. Linotype-Hell was acquired by Heidelberg and its font division was separated into Linotype Library GmbH in 1997. In 2006-07, the company changed the name to Linotype GmbH and was sold to Monotype Imaging.\n\nThere has been a continuous legal ownership of matrices, design originals (drawings), designer credits and (in many cases) trademarks by Linotype GmbH from its predecessors.\n\nWhile Hertin Anwaltssozietät asserts there is no copyright protection for type designs in Germany and typeface designs can be only protected as design patents (Geschmacksmuster), this does not automatically imply that this is the case worldwide. For example in Poland, courts have decided that typeface designs are protected under copyright law (rather than the patent law, which only offers paid and more time-limited protection).\n\nOn [http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/chevalier.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123085044/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/chevalier.htm \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/chevalier.htm\"), you interpret the \"June 2006\" release of Chevalier by Linotype so that before June 2006, Chevalier was not available at Linotype. Your interpretation is wrong. As you have documented yourself, Haas published Chevalier as metal type in 1946 and D. Stempel AG distributed the metal type from the 1950s on. The typeface was available for sale by these companies. Haas' type assets and D. Stempel AG were purchased by Linotype-Hell in the 1980s, and their assets have gone into Linotype GmbH. Linotype GmbH is the legal successor of D. Stempel AG and at least of the type assets of Haas (I don't know the exact details of the transactions).\n\nYou make the point that Softmaker sold the digital font \"Maurice\" as early as 2002 (or perhaps earlier), and that it was a \"forgery\" of the Chevalier design. You conclude that Linotype's digital font \"Chevalier\" is a copy of \"Maurice\", therefore not an original. But as Linotype is a legal successor of the type assets of Haas and Stempel, wouldn't you agree that it has the right to claim to be the originator of the Chevalier design, dating back to 1946?\n\nFurther, you completely ignore the distinction between typeface design and the digital font form. The Adobe vs. SSi ruling in the U.S. has affirmed that digital fonts are treated as software programs and are copyrightable under U.S. law. Since U.S. and Germany are part of the WIPO and of the Berne convention, it can be asserted that while typeface designs may not be copyrightable in Germany (but only enjoy patent protection), the software programs, and therefore the digital fonts, are copyrightable. I believe there are some German court rulings that see it the same way.\n\nYour analysis of Linotype's Chevalier and Softmaker's Maurice digital data is interesting. Indeed, it suggests that both fonts share the same digital software code. While Linotype release the font only in 2006, there is no reason to assume that it was not \"digitized by Linotype\" earlier. Many fonts exist in raw digital formats for years and only get published much later.\n\nKeep in mind that copyright protection does not take the date of publication into account, but the date of creation. Therefore, it is of no significance that Softmaker released their font in 2002 (or earlier) while Linotype did so only in 2006. What is important to discover is who and when did the digitization of Chevalier, i.e. turned the Haas/Stempel/Linotype original design into software code.\n\nI cannot agree with your conclusion that Linotype's statements \"Digitized by Linotype\", \"Linotype Original\", \"Copyright by Linotype\" are \"blunt lies\" (\"plumpe Lügen\"). Given the fact that Chevalier was produced and marketed by companies that were acquired by Linotype, Linotype is entitled to call the typeface a \"Linotype Original\". Provided that the font software for Chevalier was indeed prepared by Linotype (Linotype-Hell AG, Linotype Library GmbH, Linotype GmbH or a service partner working for any of these), I have no reason to see why Linotype should not claim copyright on the digital software code, and credit itself on the digitization.\n\nUnfortunately, Ulrich -- as usual -- you are jumping to conclusions without properly analyzing the materials. I agree with you that the matter should be clarified by the legal authorities, and therefore am grateful for your work on documenting these issues. However, I don't think that you're doing yourself or anyone else much service by accompanying your documentation with loud claims such as \"blunt lies\", which, in my eye, you have not sufficiently backed up with evidence.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

They say that the typeface \\*design\\* \"Chavalier\" has become public domain, and that Elsner+Flake digitized it, expanded the character set and implemented the typeface in contemporary font formats. While typeface designs may not be copyrightable in Germany, digital fonts are considered copyrightable software. In your reply to Hertin, you cite Hertin's book in that he describes that forging public domain works such as Shakespeare's is illegal.\n\nBut your analogy is flawed. The works of Shakespeare are public domain but if one produces a software program that displays and presents Shakespeare's works on modern computers in an innovative way, and extends the works by comments or some other additions, the result of this work \\*is\\* copyrightable even though the underlying work is public domain.\n\nThis is why Hertin writes: \"In case of the typeface 'Escorial', our client [Elsner+Flake] digitized an existing metal type of letterforms, added special characters such as €, @ and others that have meanwhile become customary, and implemented the result in contemporary font formats. Our client offers this service as licenses for the relevant fonts.\"\n\nQuite clearly, Hertin's point is that while Chevalier is a public domain design, Elsner+Flake's version (\"Escorial\") is not copyright-free because Elsner+Flake digitized the typeface and implemented the design in digital font formats (which are considered software) and performed some work that added intellectual property (such as creating the custom characters).\n\nIn your reply to Hertin, you mix up typeface designs and digital fonts and ignore the rest of the distinctions I have explained above. This indicates that you don't understand what Hertin wrote to you.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

So, I regret that their argument is rather extrabold.  \n(At the same time, referring to the link Adam posted, I have the sad impression that the court took the easy route: because fonts deserve protection as <cite>font software</cite>, they did not even attempt to answer the question whether the <cite>typefaces</cite> are actually works of art and thus copyrighted in Germany. Since font formats come and go, protection of typefaces as font software is only a substitute for real protection of the pieces of art/design which typefaces are or can be. It is as if a 300-dpi scan of a drawing were copyrighted but the original drawing were not. It is plain absurd. But another story.)\n\n\\*&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Darueber hinaus ist ein rechtlicher Schutz von Schriftzeichen vom Gesetzgeber nicht vorgesehen.\" (p.2)  \n\\*\\*&nbsp;&nbsp;\"Bei einem Schrifttyp handelt es sich jedoch eben <cite>gerade nicht</cite> um ein urheberrechtlich geschuetztes Werk iSd § 1,2 UrhG.\" (p.3)\n\nAs to the Chevalier outlines, it is amusing that obviously Softmaker sells a cleaned up version while Linotype's shows Ikarus-conversion-artefacts in the left serif.&nbsp;&nbsp;:)  \nIt might be a funny project for future students of type history to create a genealogy of font outlines.\n\n"

It goes like this:  \nTo make software, you need to have computer knowledge and training as typographer or typesetter (the ability to space letters is explicitly mentioned). It does not even matter whether the type designer actually programs the font software, or uses applications which generate the font software. The ruling emphasizes that, to make font software, one needs \"creative programming skills/efforts\" which justify copyright protection. (One could back this by the assumption that e.g. a PostScript font in fact is a program which <cite>can</cite> be programmed. But there is no word of this in the said ruling.) In short:  \nOn the one hand, protecting font software -- i.e. the technical implementation of typeface design -- is easy. The ruling emphasizes what at best can be characterized as mere technical skills.  \nOn the other hand, the barrier for typeface design -- as a work of art -- to be regarded as copyrightable is set so high that it is rather unlikely that a good text face would ever enjoy this kind of protection.  \nAbsurd.\n\n"

Do you mean \"schutzfaehig\"?\n\nI just browsed my law books and found that some common assumptions about intellectual property legislation are not applicable in Germany:\n\n- The notion of \"who owns the copyright\" does not seem to be common, at least I have not found anything like that in the texts. You could, of course, ask the question \"Who could claim protection for his work in case of an argument, and on which legal basis?\"  \n- Obviously, the creator (Urheber) could do so but no action is necessary to protect you intellectual property on the basis of the UrhG.  \n- A company cannot be a creator (Urheber). (§7 UrhG)  \n- Copyright can not be transferred between living persons (§29,2 UrhG).  \n- However, the creator can transfer rights of use (Nutzungsrechte). I guess this is the legal basis on which intellectual property is \"sold\".\n\n"

Throughout this thread, you keep stating that the letter to you was written by Professor Hertin, a \"copyright law professor at the Berlin University\". However, the signature between the letter reads \"Klages, Rechtsanwalt\", which obviously indicates that the letter was written by one of the attorneys in the law firm in which Professor Hertin is the major partner. According to your logic, if my little sister says something, you can quote these words as \"Adam Twardoch says\". If you need this kind of appraise, go ahead. But I consider it laughable.\n\n\\> Mr. Twardoch’s comment contains so many erroneous  \n\\> legal assumptions that it would require too much  \n\\> time to clarify them in this thread.\n\nOf course, I'm not a lawyer, so my comments may have a few mistakes, though I don't see why these would be \"many\". And regardless of that, I believe that I at least managed to get away without any major logical holes, which your reasoning is unfortunately full of. As I have written repeatedly, you prematurely jump to conclusions based on imprecise of partial analysis of the text that you have at hand.\n\n\\> hold the copyright to this same font sold with  \n\\> different copyright claims (“Copyright by Softmaker”,  \n\\> “Copyright by Linotype”, “Copyright by Elsner + Flake”).\n\nWhat makes you think that these fonts are \"the same\"? Surely, these are based on the same typeface design, just as Helvetica LT, Swiss 721 BT and Nimbus Sans are all based on the design of Helvetica. But these are different fonts.\n\nI recommend that you think long and hard, and try to finally understand the difference between \"typeface design\" and \"digital font\". Or maybe you do understand the difference well but you just play naiive, hoping that by twisting your words you can get away with your major logical loopholes.\n\n\\> Even if fonts were copyrightable in Germany, this would  \n\\> be legally impossible.\n\nIf these fonts were the same. However, while these three fonts represent a digital form of the same public domain typeface design, I'm still rather not convinced that the digital computer programs are the same. At least you have not shown any evidence that the Linotype version and the E+F version are \"the same fonts\".\n\n\\> But due to the legal fact that fonts are not  \n\\> copyrightable at all in Germany,\n\nFortunately, LG Köln thinks otherwise. Attorney Klages from Prof. Hertin's firm in their letter to you only states that \"Schrifttypen\" (which in the context of his explanations is to be seen as \"typeface designs\") are not subject to copyright protection. I do not see in which part of their letter Anwaltsozietät Hertin would comment on copyrightability of Fonts as computer programs.\n\nA.\n\n"
