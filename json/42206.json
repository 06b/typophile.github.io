[Fontgrube](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227203959/http:/www.fontgrube.de/en/index.htm) (Andreas Hofeld) took several fonts that others had made and improved them by fixing mistakes and filling out the character set. He was always very up front about this.\n\n"

I've never learned the original name for Dragonwick/Dragonfly either. That's always been a tiny burr in my saddle.\n\n"
