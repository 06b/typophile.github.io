Nobody has really asked Web designers or font vendors/foundries about their needs.\n\nI have made a relevant blog post and launched two related surveys (one of Web designers, one of font vendors).\n\nThe survey for Web designers/producers is here. I’d appreciate your help in getting the word to relevant lists and forums:  \n [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA\\_3d\\_3d](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083621/http:/www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA_3d_3d \"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=wyFVRRqnxAmTypkzThJOkA\\_3d\\_3d\")\n\nThe survey for font vendors is here:  \n [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ\\_3d\\_3d](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083621/http:/www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ_3d_3d \"http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=I9LYBFmggGJ8SCTU0u3CtQ\\_3d\\_3d\")\n\nMy blog post is here:  \n [http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web\\_fonts\\_1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083621/http:/blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web_fonts_1.html \"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2007/11/web\\_fonts\\_1.html\")\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\nThomas Phinney  \nProduct Manager  \nFonts & Global Typography  \nAdobe Systems\n\n [‹ Firefox 3 text rendering](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083621/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39326 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Most excellent lettering linkage ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706083621/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39308 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Plus there are technical considerations as well.\n\nBTW, what is this “life” thing you keep talking about, Nick? Seems like I’ve heard this word before somewhere.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

The people behind Flash/Flex have their heads screwed on a lot tighter, and may be more likely to produce internet standards that designers and consumers want to work with in the long run. It’s been six years since XHTML 1.1, and I don’t see the W3C moving things forward. What Macromedia/Adobe have done in the same timespan is pretty impressive.\n\n<cite>What I find sad is that now that Adobe has Flash, they’re not compelled to push for SVG support like they used to.</cite>\n\nI don’t blame them. SVG seemed to run into the same problem a lot of commercial open-source projects do: when the open-source crowd finally gets commercial support, they don’t really contribute enough to make it worthwhile for the businesses involved. It makes more sense for Adobe to just stick with Flash and avoid the extra headaches.\n\n"

I see your words, and I know what you’re saying, but Adobe, MS and Apple have done many things over the decade+ of this issue’s existence and none of them work for “The Web”, just for their users. why change now? Thus, this survey had little to offer me as far as questions I felt like answering. When someone asks, “What do you, (you type designer you), need to know in order to provide a quality font to any user?” Then we’re cookin’. We’re cookin’ now on our own grease, but it’ll be awhile because the fundament of tool makers had to be replaced with ones who don’t lack for ears, eyes, noses and throats.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

It’s just become a question of exactly how. That’s spurs reactions from companies such as Microsoft and Adobe.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

More interestingly, it could create an opportunity for “font services” to be provided by the font vendors to a client with a lower up front cost.

Open source isn’t good for the business of commercial software companies like Adobe, of course, as that’s their livlihood.\n\nSo, yea, I can see why Adobe has no interest in supporting open standards and would rather try and own the web technology (just as MS has for so long).\n\n“and none of them work for “The Web”, just for their users.”\n\nOh, I certainly agree. ;o)\n\nAnd Thomas, with all due respect, I do have to point out the irony of the page not working in Firefox. ;o)\n\n"

It’s more of “it depends.” Adobe was a major early supporter of SVG, for instance. We have donated big whacks of code such as Tamarin to the open source movement:  \n. We donated the OpenType spec to the ISO, and currently support adoption of Microsoft’s EOT as an open standard at the W3C.\n\nJames: No, I didn’t ask the Design Observer staff, but please feel free to pass it on. In fact, I appreciate any and all promotion of the designer survey - I want it to have as broad as possible a cross-section of Web designers. Especially non-typophiles, really.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
