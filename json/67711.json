  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm doing a logo for a stand-up comedian 'Anders Helenius'. Been struggling with this one, tried various concepts without any result but now I think I have something that will work.\n\nA smile and \"vibrating/shaking\" text. I'm designing the website as well and we're going for a \"street\" feeling so I'd like to convey the same message for the logo, bold and rough. This is the first version with my new concept. It might have a bit of a \"wild west\" feel to it.\n\nAny feedback appreciated  \npeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021021224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/anders_logo_v2_6340.jpg)\n\n",

I was more worried that it looked like HH instead of AH.\n\nGonna try and add some colour to it and maybe have the AH as a part of the inside instead of it cutting the wings. Feels like the shape of the mic needs to be cut out like that otherwise the wings become too dominant.\n\nI think I'd like it more advanced though. First thought was a grafitti/stencil kinda thing but I don't think we'll do that any more. The website has that in the menu and the logo kinda disappears when it's all the same.\n\nWill work on the AH though if I decide to keep. Gonna play around with it some more.\n\nThanks  \nPeter\n\n"

I think I would have to draw it in more of a 3D view for it to work and that's not really where we want to go.\n\nIf it looks like it's for a lation rapper, that's not such a bad thing. Kinda that style we're going for but more rock 'n roll. Showed it to some friends as did the client and they didn't connect the logo with a TV preacher, not even after I mentioned it, I guess that's because that phenomena doesn't really exist in Finland or any of the Scandinavian countries. Here religion is still pretty old fashion. It's a concern but I don't think many Finns will make that connection.\n\nThe \"sticker on a suitcase\" is more of the direction I want. That's the plan as well to make stickers that he can put up where ever he has a gig.\n\nI've made some changes to it though.\n\nHe also wanted the logo to portray how his performance evolves or changes, going from nice to angry/critical. So I've split the logo in to parts and added a distressed feeling to one side.\n\nFigured the orange colour might be too \"nice\" so I've tried using red instead.\n\nAny feedback appreciated, thanks.  \nPeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021021224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/anders_logo_v3_3611.5.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Distressing works fine in one colour. And for a solid colour I'll probably just split it in the middle so that the two sides are obvious. I will increase the distressed part so that it is more obvious in smaller sizes.\n\nMight not even make it one colour at all. This will have a fairly limited usage area and to provide a one colour version might not even be necessary. Or make it so that that only the solid colour version has a line through the middle of the microphone.\n\nHave to check with the client what he wants but everything that he controls the layout of can just use the colour version. This one is also going to have some limitations on what backgrounds it can be used against since there can't be a inverted colour version.\n\nYou can have a grayscale version and maybe a semi transparent version instead of a full solid colour. That might work in colour as well, put the right side at 50% for example and then in red or something, then it will appear as it is two colours even if it's not, depending on the background. That might actually be kinda cool. Gonna try it and see how it looks.\n\nthanks, peter.\n\n"
