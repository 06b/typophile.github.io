FUSE 7 is ’Crash’ and had fonts by Tobias Frere-Jones, Neville Brody and 3 other designers. Nothing in FUSE 7 looks like the bitmap font that shows up when you hover over the images on the posted page.\n\nI guess the conclusion is that FUSE 7 is not the same as ’Fuse Seven Complete’. It seemed like a promising connection. Sigh.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I went and looked through all 32 pages of Bitmap fonts at DaFont.com and didn’t see any that duplicated this, although several were reasonably close. That might be worth doing, if a similar bitmap font would be OK.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
