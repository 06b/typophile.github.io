Loy’s Nineteenth-century American Designers & Engravers of Type. With biographies of 30 engravers and illustrations of over 800 typefaces it’s a must for anyone remotely interested in type. Also an ideal Xmas gift for your acquaintances who don’t “get” type since no one can resist the wild flourishing Tuscans or even the absurd texts used to display the faces. More info at [http://www.oakknoll.com/Loy](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103122929/http:/www.oakknoll.com/Loy \"http://www.oakknoll.com/Loy\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103122929im_/http:/typophile.com/files/loyCover_4912.jpg)\n  \nThat cover photo of Gustav Schroeder cutting punches at his home in Mill Valley, California is the oldest known photo of a punch-cutter. \n",
