      "content": "The case of font used for The Avengers is interesting, and certainly during Series 4 and Series 5 of the Diana Rigg episodes, the graphic design was of a very high calibre. For the monochrome (Series 4) programmes, I have only ever found the font as mentioned above by riccardO. For Series 5, however, it appears the font used was Compacta, and for the opening fanfare 'The Avengers In Color' it appears to be Compacta Outline. Apart from the title, Compacta was also used in Series 4, along with a combination of Helvetica.\n\n"
