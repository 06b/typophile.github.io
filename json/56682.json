[http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/04/phinney-joins-extensis/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804052713/http:/www.thomasphinney.com/2009/04/phinney-joins-extensis/ \"http://www.thomasphinney.com/2009/04/phinney-joins-extensis/\")\n\nI'm pretty excited about this new position. It's already turning out to be lots of fun, and gives me plenty of opportunities to learn new things, while working with a great crew of people and not leaving the type industry (albeit not involved in making fonts).\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n",

We'll miss our friends in Seattle, and a few of the local cultural things, but in general this seems pretty great.\n\nWe're not buying a house right away, mostly because I believe the price of houses could still fall another 10, 20, maybe even 30%. We'll rent for at least a year, then buy once housing prices seem to have bottomed out or are starting to rise. (Even allowing substantially for costs and hassles of moving, and tax benefits of owning, if housing prices drop more than 3.5% in a year, we are better off renting.)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
