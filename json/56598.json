      "content": "As the designer I would ask for any motifs of special relevance to you first. Can be everything, from a favourite saint, animal, place or season …  \nWhat books do you cherish? What are your subjects of interest, of reading?  \nA design could be rather typographical or more pictorial. Any particular style preferred?  \nIf interested please contact me via the contact form of [www.signographie.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804021447/http:/www.signographie.de/ \"www.signographie.de\")\n\n"
