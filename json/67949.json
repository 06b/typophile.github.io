      "content": "It seems to be a customization of Engraver's Roman, with a Baskerville-ish C. Bob Alonso had a very close take on the Engraver's typeface with his [Richmond Hill](http://web.archive.org/web/20110225123834/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/richmond-hill/). Many of the other Engraver's Romans have a more triangular serif on the N. Your sample has a ruled serif that isn't much like any of the Engraver's fonts I saw, but the R is certainly like this group.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
