As the corporations are going with PDF versions, their staffs and contractors are dumping their old printed versions. About the only ones left are in the hands of collectors. I know a ton of people that work for International Paper and recently tried to get a copy of the old Lester Beall Standards Manual. I waited too long to ask because everyone said they dumped theirs when the electronic versions were adopted.\n\nGood hunting to you.\n\n"
