However, only certain letters are similar, and the lower case is quite different. Unfortunately my books show little in the European scripts, so I have no idea whether Friedrich Poppl designed many other script typefaces, besides this and Residenz. This is what I would look for, as a starting place.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
