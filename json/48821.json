However, I didn't try many variations since it was a rushed logo but I decided to make some today.\n\nI definitely like the 'V' more in the 2nd attachment but I like how more of the letters touch the baseline, especially the 'R', in the 1st attachment.\n\nWhat do you'll think?\n\n-btw, right now I'm leaning towards #2 in attachment 1\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [vallarta\\_logos.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090436/http:/typophile.com/files/vallarta_logos.gif) | 20.68 KB |\n| [vallarta\\_logos\\_plain.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090436/http:/typophile.com/files/vallarta_logos_plain.jpg) | 21.58 KB |\n\n",
