Am I TIRED. SDCC knocked me for a loop, but I’ve still got font-i-ness for ya…\n\nNEW FREE FONT – POTTY MOUTH BB  \n [http://www.blambot.com/fonts.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129182757/http:/www.blambot.com/fonts.shtml \"http://www.blambot.com/fonts.shtml\")  \nIt seems like every few months someone e-mails me and asks what font do people use when they have a character swear in symbols instead of words. At first I thought they were being silly…then I realized, “Hey! Why isn’t there a font JUST for that?” And now there is! POTTY MOUTH is 52 hand-drawn symbols for cursing, cussing, swearing and all out poopy-talk. It even comes with a PDF format reference chart so you can see which key does what.  \nClick here for a preview:  \n [http://www.blambot.com/stuff/preview\\_pottymouth.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129182757/http:/www.blambot.com/stuff/preview_pottymouth.jpg \"http://www.blambot.com/stuff/preview\\_pottymouth.jpg\")\n\nNEW PRO FONT?  \nYou’ll notice there’s no new Pro font this month. That happened for two reasons:\n\nSAN DIEGO COMIC CON  \n [http://www.blambot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1219](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129182757/http:/www.blambot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1219 \"http://www.blambot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1219\")  \nClick the link above to check out some choice SDCC photos! A good time was had by all. Partied a little, had a great meeting over at Dark Horse (more news on that when I get the ’ok’.), and got to talk to a lot of great creators.\n\nNEW BLAMBOT.COM COMING SOON  \nThere’s a site redesign coming soon! Not a massive shift from what’s there now (if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it), but a streamlined, remodeling that I’m hoping to have done by the next update. It will include an expanding content area, larger overall interface, more efficient font menu, and a less cluttered look.\n\nIF YOU READ THIS FAR, I SALUTE YOU!  \n [http://www.yousendit.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129182757/http:/www.yousendit.com/ \"http://www.yousendit.com/\")  \nI get asked a lot about how graphics folks can send big files without cluttering up their webspace, avoiding e-mail quotas, or without actually having any webspace of their own. Check out YOUSENDIT at the link above. A very handy way to send your art files with no fuss or muss!\n\nSee you next month when I’ve finally recovered from SDCC and website redesigning!\n\n~N\n\n",
