Although make-ready and operation rates would probably be cheaper - as far as currecy conversion goes - in or around Montreal.   \n   \nThat said, I don't know anyone who does C&C vinyl cutting in Montreal. Perhaps in Winnipeg, but I don't know if that would save you very much in the end...\n\n"

I'm guessing you'll   \nbe sticking it to plaster or sheetrock walls - which it will do   \nwith ease. In fact, we used to have it on the walls of our   \nold apartment. White on white walls can look nice.   \n   \nWe used Fast Signs. Basically the Kinkos of vinyl. There are two   \nmain grades - normal and heavy duty. The heavy duty will   \nwork outdoors and they claim it even sticks to cement.   \nI wouldn't suggest that, but the museum I used to work for   \nhas had the same vinyl on sheetrock walls for years.   \n   \nUsually you can just send an Illustrator eps of your artwork.   \nBe mindful of the sizes the shop has as it can dramatically alter the price.\n\n"

You can purchase low tack vinyl from office supply stores that can be pre cut by you and affixed to the wall as a template for painting the copy.   \n   \ngln\n\n"
