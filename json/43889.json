Next to our original designs, foreign currencies tended to look like play money.\n\nI was pretty upset when I got my new $5 altho am benumbed by previous redesigns as well.\n\nI am also rather amused by the attempts to make life easier for the visually impaired. For example in my subway station there is a tiny little plaque with some braille on it, on one of many many columns on the platform. First of all, by the time you've made it into the station, thru the turnstile and onto the platform, the plaque is pretty useless, innit? Second of all, if you are blind, how in creation are you going to even find this silly little plaque on a random column. But I'm sure it's complying with some law, somewhere.\n\n"
