  "content": "I've read what you lot have had to say about specimen documents and looked at some of the better books. Let me just say that good specimens are almost as much work as the type face in question. Now, I want to see from your view points how much I've absorbed about what makes a good type spec book. Presented are a couple of type books that I've finished in the last couple of days. I expect them to be flamed mercilessly, but it might also be helpfull if someone told me what is RIGHT about them.\n\nThe first is Copper Penny, a reworking of Copperplate Gothic featuring a lower case character set.\n\n[http://cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/40/0/20617.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823175026/http:/cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/40/0/20617.pdf)\n\nThe second is JLS OverKill, an ultra bold block style display face.\n\n[http://cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/40/0/20607.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823175026/http:/cdn.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/40/0/20607.pdf)\n\n",
