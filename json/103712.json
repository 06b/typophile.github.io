The font is called \"WatchMNOutline\\_,\" but all the version I have found don't have lowercase letters. If anyone can make the uppercase letters the lowercase ones as well, it would be perfect. Also, here are some covers for reference-\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031234002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OneMoreTime_4000.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031234002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Daft+Punk+-+One+More+Time+-+One+More+Virgin+-+DOUBLE+CD-203300_6470.jpg)\n\n",
