BTW it's nice that MyFonts has a reporting mechanism, eh? On Dafont for example the \"moderators\" are often the worst ones...  \n [http://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=licinia\\_aged](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713165218/http:/www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=licinia_aged \"http://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=licinia\\_aged\")  \n [http://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=ballpark\\_weiner&text=Fixed+B...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713165218/http:/www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=ballpark_weiner&text=Fixed+Barcelona \"http://www.dafont.com/font-comment.php?file=ballpark\\_weiner&text=Fixed+Barcelona\")\n\nSo have you finally started caring about plagiarism, or are you pointing out an example simply to claim that plagiarism is OK?\n\nhhp\n\n"
