I am trying to find the coding used in FontLab so that the end user can access the alternative glyphs in there layout program. The font currently uses Nick Shinn's Pseudo-random 3.0 script and I have the glyphs in there corresponding classes. If I am remembering correctly it's not an OpenType script that was run, but it is somehow done through the classes.\n\nmw\n\n"

When I try to access them through an application the first three \"A\" glyphs show me all four variations, but the fourth only shows me three (one of them being itself). It is always the default glyph that is not shown, and this happens throughout the entire font not just the \"A\" glyph.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nmw\n\n"

This adds the fourth variation to the submenu for A.3, but it makes A, A.1, A.2 show itself twice in their submenu giving the user a false fifth variation.\n\nThe typeface I am working on has 383 glyphs with four variations for every character, which means I would have to write that code 383 times. The 'aalt' feature from the test font (Minion Pro) in Adobes FDK just shows a list of its OT features.\n\nmw\n\n"

You could just include (with the appropriate class definitions):\n\n` sub @Variant4 by @Base; `\n\nThe 'aalt' feature is the one feature which can include other features, in which case all of the substitutions performed by that feature are included in 'aalt'.\n\nThe results you are getting would seem to indicate that the way in which your features are set up involves multiple different pathways by which some of the glyphs can be mapped to the others. If you can't get the desired results by listing your features, you might want to instead not include those features and just include individual substitution statements like the one above.\n\nAdmittedly, though, I haven't experimented with this technique so I can't give any guarantees. I usually just let FontLab create the 'aalt' feature for me.\n\n"
