Key is admittedly an extreme case. Better ones are FF Zine, FF Olson, Parkinson's Azuza and The Foundry's Form. Why am I paying attention? I guess because of Patria. I like the \"honesty\".   \n   \nAnd it's the next trend in text fonts, baby! :-)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Nah, seriously it reminds me of [PMN Caecilia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135920/http:/www.myfonts.com/FontFamily27469.html) or TheSerif at [Lucas Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135920/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/).

      "content": "Although there is some superficial resemblance between the faces you mention, Hrant, and Key. There is one 'key' difference. While FF Zine, FF Olsen, Azuza, and Foundry Form all attempt to invigorate traditional forms through a contemporary medium and within a digital vernacular (an avenue which I think traces its roots to Swift), Key is just messing around with some shapes:   \n   \n[from the Veer website] _A bold, chunky typeface . . . that explores the manufactured or prefabricated aesthetic: construction from a set of graphic shapes. Letters are treated as individual graphic elements within a set grid. This is an aesthetic based purely on the look of the graphic form . . ._  \n   \nThe others are admirable, hard-working typefaces; I think Key is in a different class -- not refined enough for text, too blocky, in my opinion, for more than the occasional whatchew-lookin-at?, I'm-so-rebellious, Rolling Stone headline.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
