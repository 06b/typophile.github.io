  "content": "My high-end academic company has used Times New Roman as their \"logo\" for the last 17 years. It's even in giant silver letters on the office wall. I asked for the logo file and they said \"oh, just type it.\" Cringe. Cringe.\n\nAs their new director of marketing, I'm trying to help them modernize. Fortunately, we're re-branding and they're up for a logo change, but I'm sure any extreme departure from Times New Roman is out of the question.\n\nSo, we're shooting for a high-end, classy, luxury typeface that still has some academic tendancies.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions?\n\nI will definitely look at them all. Thank you!\n\n",
