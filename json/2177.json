Many of their faces tend to riff off of each other. Take [Sylvia](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051934/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ALT0000124) and [Aminta](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051934/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ALT0000127) or [Enabler](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051934/http:/www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ALT0000105) and the upcoming Anomoly (I'll try to find an example of this...) for instance.\n\n"
