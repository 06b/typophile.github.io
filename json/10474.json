  "content": "From graphics.com   \n   \nWin: Microworld Releases Sharptype Photoshop Plugin   \n   \nPosted on Wednesday, April 13   \n   \n   \nMicroworld claims that its new plugin for the Windows version of Photoshop can create clearer type output at small point sizes.   \n   \nThere's no doubt that generating clear type output at small point sizes from any image editing application can be a challenge. Microworld has come up with a new approach in the form of a Photoshop plugin that it believes provides \"ultra-clear\" font output. It also adds a few extra touches, such as the ability to employ a user-defined font directory and provides a character map to ease font and symbol selection, with support for multiple languages.   \n   \nSharptype is available as shareware on the Microworld site, with registration costing $29.95. The unregistered version provides a limited range of font sizes.   \n   \n [http://www.sharp-type.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163429/http:/www.sharp-type.com/)  \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071107163429im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/70407.gif)\n\n [‹ Fontographer Vs.

Even more remarkable is that the antialiasing is automatic, not manually created by a designer. I wish there was a Mac version to play with, but the developers say not yet.\n\n"

I am not agree to clasify all in the same level, below sharptype “smooth” ware.\n\n"

I think we can both agree that not all the Ultrafonts are as well made as yours and Miguel’s. And the advantage of Sharptype as a Photoshop plugin is that we can create graphics from _any_ font. In that respect perhaps it’s not really competition for Ultrafonts, but a different sort of tool for potentially different projects.\n\n"

Not to mention that you were probably looking at that on a Mac, where the flatter gamma would hide the crapfuzziness. It’s good to see a company like Sharptype trying to improve small font rendering\\*, and maybe it is indeed better than out-of-the-box Photoshop rendering (maybe) but it’s not remotely as good as what the human eye/hand can do. Gustavo did a good job demonstrating that; Mana-9 will do an even better job. :-\\>\n\n\\* Especially in the light of so many designers who ignore the problem. The other day I was complaining about the small text on a website of a typography PhD, and the reply was: we see nothing wrong with it. Yeah, the fuzzy stems and horrid spacing is just dandy I guess...\n\nThe only thing that comes close to handmade grayscale fonts is the Longhorn Cleartype stuff; however, in Cleartype a character can have different renderings depending on where it falls on the subpixel grid - and this is because it maintains the classic unhealthy attachment to WYSIWYG.\n\nhhp\n\n"
