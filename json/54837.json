  "content": "I hope somebody can help me. I once found a brilliant quote of Gunnlaugur S.E. Briem online which I used in a Dutch language presentation. I translated it to Dutch for that presentation but didn't keep the original. Now I need this quote for an article I'm writing for PSD Magazine and can't find the original English version. Judging from my translation I can assume it should go something like this:\n\n<cite>Some people profess that letters solely exist to be read and that's why any factor that influences their legibility should be avoided. This is akin saying that the only purpose of alcoholic beverages is to get drunk.</cite>\n\nNow this sounds like crap and I'd like to cite Briem correctly, so I would be very grateful if somebody could point me to the original quote. Many thanks.\n\n",
