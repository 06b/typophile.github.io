If you have a lot of special characters to type and you don't want to use PopChar or the character palette you may try tools like Typinator: [http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022045914/http:/www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/ \"http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/\")  \nWith such tools you can define your own Unicode text replacements, like every time you type \"#-\" it woud become am real minus sign, \"#tm\" would become ™ and so on. Even faster than PopChar.\n\n"
