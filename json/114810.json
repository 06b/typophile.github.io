      "content": "Good selection by Fivos as usual. For the record, this one is definitely based off Eurostile, the 'NIKE' part is blatantly it. The only things to do is to start with Eurostile Extended, even up /E crossbars and redraw /G cutting top right part and making terminal oblique. I guess it'd be pretty easy to do. So for your job, why not starting with it and customize it to make it unique. Eurostile is a catchy font and if you avoid or customize some of its earmarks (/S, /R leg...), it could work quite well.  \nYou could also have a look simply searching for ['Eurostile' at MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Eurostile).  \nFor some 'Eurostile-like' with a twist of techy vibe: many [Typodermic Ray Larabie](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typodermic), [Venera](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=venera), [Biome](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Biome), [Eursostile Candy](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile-candy), [Clonoid](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/clonoid), [Magistral](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/magistral), [Cube](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/cube), [Reversal](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/reversal/), [Saturn](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dsgnhaus/saturn/), [Reaction](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-identikal/reaction/), [Phantom](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-identikal/phantom/), [Stak](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-identikal/stak/), [Geometry Soft Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/geometry-soft-pro), [Miedinger](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/miedinger/), [Phat](http://web.archive.org/web/20140531135547/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-identikal/phat/)\n\n"
