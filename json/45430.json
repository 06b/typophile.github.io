An example might include a good image of the Rosetta Stone or a sample of cuneiform or possibly a high res image from the Book of Kells. These would only be used for teaching purposes and not reprinted. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nThank you in advance,  \nLance Kagey\n\nRavenhouse Design Practice  \n1430 N Prospect  \nTacoma WA  \n98406\n\n253-861-1056\n\n [‹ Looking for Fat Filled 70s Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055045/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45424 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Why can't people educate themselves about ampersands? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055045/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45277 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
