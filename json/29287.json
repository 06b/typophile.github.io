  "content": "Hi,\n\nI've been searching for a font to use for my new website and decided to use Lane-Narrow which I believe was designed by Graham Meade. Unfortunately, one of the key symbols for me is missing from the extended character list - the Great Britain Pound (GBP £) symbol is unavailable and I really don't want to use a separate font for that one character. Does anybody know if there is a more recent version of this font available including the GBP symbol - I've searched all over the internet with no success.\n\nIf not, does anybody know how I can get in touch with the font designer to request the addition of this symbol?\n\nMany thanks,  \nMatthew James\n\n",
