Snap the pic,and use your mobile twitter client to tweet \"@typeid {message and picture link}\" and they will show up on the right sidebar of the TypeID page.\n\nWe're working on a way to integrate these requests into the message board. Until then, feel free to tweet these requests back to their submitters using Twitter.\n\nPlease spread the word!\n\n",
