  "content": "Has anyone else noticed the beautiful blackletter typeface that is used in the New York Times Style Magazine? It is the best blackletter typeface I’ve come across in a long time but I can’t figure out what the name of it is, if its for sale, or if it was created specifically for the magazine. The only things I’ve uncovered is that the T logo itself was designed by Matthew Carter. I thought that maybe Carter designed the accompanying blackletter typeface as well but I’ve not been able to track it down. I have actually e-mailed the New York Times asking about the name of the typeface, but of course they haven’t answered back. Any clues, suggestions, answers would be helpful. Thanks.\n\n-Mariel\n\nLink to T Magazine: [http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2009/04/19/style/t/index.html#pageName=homem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120636/http:/www.nytimes.com/indexes/2009/04/19/style/t/index.html#pageName=homem)\n\nP.S. I've had one person answer and say that it is called NYT-FrakturSix, but I can't find that font for purchase or download and that is what I am interested in doing.\n\n",

The NYT blackletter isn’t even a [Fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120636/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fraktur), strictly speaking. It’s a [Textura](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120636/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Textura).\n\nCheck out English textura faces like Cloister Black or Old English. They will bring you much closer. Here’s an [older thread about that style](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120636/http:/typophile.com/node/15773).\n\n[Fraktur mon Amour](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120636/http:/www.typografie.de/Unsere-Buecher/Typografie/Judith-Schalansky/Fraktur-mon-Amour::589.html) is a great book. The second edition (enhanced, in German and English) is out now. Yes, it comes with a CD full of Blackletter fonts, for private and restricted commercial use. Fontblogger Jürgen Siebert made a [PDF chart [3.8mb]](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120636/http:/www.fontblog.de/picts/FrakturMonAmour.pdf) that shows samples of all the 150 bundled fonts.  \nF\n\n"

      "content": "There are a number of different New York Times blackletter fonts in use, particularly in the \"T Magazine\". Some of the differences among them are subtle, while some are fairly extreme. All of the fonts and designs are proprietary and created or adapted for the Times by Matthew Carter.\n\n1) FrakturSix-NYT  \n This is the font that's used for most of the captions and blackletter text in T-Style Magazine. It has a large character component with some limited punctuation characters. It includes lower case accented characters but none in the upper case. There are many character positions containing no glyphs, a faulty upper case \"Z\" that hasn't been fixed in four years, and a few alternate glyphs that look left over from the creation process.\n\n2) Fraktur NYT  \n Used sparingly, this has sharper corners, straighter lines, and heavier spurs than Fraktur-Six. Thus far, I've found only 24 lower case letters (missing j and q) and only 2 upper case letters (A and R). The \"A\" is strikingly different than the \"A\" in Fraktur-Six, with an ornament similar to that on the \"N\" of the nameplate.\n\n3)NYTimes-MagStyle Bold  \n Used ONLY for spelling out \"The New York Times Style Magazine\", and contains only the necessary characters. I haven't found out about anything concerning the glyphs use in the rarely appearing \"Real Estate Magazine\".\n\n4) NYTimes-FourCapT  \n Contains a number of variants of the unique T Magazine \"T\" logo.\n\nOccasionally a font will appear with a name like \"Fraktur-Eleven NYT\" but these appear to be personally created versions of Fraktur-Six containing only a limited number of glyphs.\n\nThe designs used for the newspaper's nameplate and New York Times Magazine are different from each other, and different from the fonts listed above.\n\n"

I would be very surprised if there is a closer non-custom font.\n\nThe clean-up is especially noticeable on the left serif on the right arm of the Y. The biggest other difference I see is the shape of the little ornament on the vertical bar inside the T, changed from an arrowhead to a diamond. Also, the flourishes have been enlarged and their curvature increased—look at the lower right of the h, the left of the N (top and middle), and the left of the Y.\n\n(Sorry for reviving, but this page hits high on Google, so I thought this might be useful to researchers like myself.)\n\n"
