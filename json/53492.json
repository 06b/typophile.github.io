Thanks everyone for all the input, it helped me a lot to decide which direction to take.\n\nThe color treatment is still being decided upon, but the the concept and the actual wordmark have been finalized:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021001248im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dark-on-light_3913.png)\n\n",
