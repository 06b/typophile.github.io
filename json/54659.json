  "content": "I've just been stumped by our IT programmer who hasn't heard of Opentype.\n\nWhat I want to do is replace Arial with Myriad Pro on our standard PDF letters. We are a training company and we send applicants standard e-mails through our website, uusually with dynamically created PDF documents attached. These PDFs are built on the fly using information specific to the person, such as the training course price, dates and location.\n\nUnfortunately the coding to build the PDFs is quite old and doesn't include instructions what to do with an .otf file, only .afm and .ttf.\n\nHis solution would be to convert the .otf file to .ttf, which I think might not be legal but would solve the problem quickly.\n\nMy suggestion is that it must be easy to build a PDF using an opentype font, but he doesn't know where to find the right code. (He also doesn't see the difference between Arial and Myriad, but as he's a programmer I suppose that's excusable!)\n\nI'm sure there's a simple solution somewhere, so does anyone have any useful links for doing this?\n\nMany thanks :)\n\n",
