  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm looking for an elegant stencil font for a logo. I want a stencil font because I like the industrial/handmade feeling it conveys, but at the same time, I don't want it to be too cold. It should be somewhat \\*a bit\\* warm and elegant. Yeah, I know that's pretty much opposites. I know I could design it myself, but I've never designed fonts and I'm afraid it would look cheap compared to professional type designers' fonts. If a font like that exists somewhere, I am willing to try it !\n\nThank you very much for your suggestions.\n\n",

Though this is not my choice for \"elegant\" stencil fonts -- I had to share because it was a nice assortment and you can't beat \"free.\"\n\nPersonal choice for an \"elegant stencil\" would be Glaser Stencil - however, seeing that this thread originated in June of 2006, I think it would be safe to assume that eclectic's search is over...\n\nBTW - does elegant and stencil actual go together?\n\nP.S. Patty, I see you are also a fan of Glaser. My all time favorite stencil - and I try to sneak it in on jobs is House Industries Flyerfont-Reject... it's just, well, adorable!\n\n"
