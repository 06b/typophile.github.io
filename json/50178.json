  "content": "Hi there dear Typophiles,\n\ndoes anyone have a picture or a typespecimen of the typeface »Retina« by Hoefler & Frere-Jones and could show it?\n\nReason why: Mario Garcia has redesigned the layout of the – where I live – well-known quality-newspaper from Austria [»Salzburger Nachrichten«](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417082953/http:/www.salzburg.com/epaper/PHP-Files/archivedpages.php). They now use [Scotch](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417082953/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/ScotchFB) from David Berlow as copyfont, the italic-weight as lead-typeface in some books and [Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417082953/http:/www.identifont.com/show?LY) from A. Frutiger as headlinetypeface.\n\nOriginally Mr. Garcia wanted to use »Retina« as headline-font, but the people there rejected it and stuck to Frutiger, as used the last couple of years.\n\nHuh, Retina?\n\nHaven't found much of this typeface until now. All the previous links from typophile go to 404-sites to H+FJ. Is this Retina-typeface out of business? Could someone show a complete alphabet of it? Please?\n\nWell, thanks for reading. Even more thanks for answering. ;^D\n\n",

Do you or anyone else know if there is a display weight of it, too?\n\nIf not, how could anyone want to have all those inktraps seen in headlines? Now I know why the people there didn't wanted to change their headline-typeface.\n\nStrange.\n\nMerci, Stéphane, again.\n\n"
