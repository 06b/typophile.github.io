I just don’t want Times New Roman, and that’s what the engraver uses most of the time.\n\nThanks,\n\nEileen\n\n",

Not all of that can be expressed through a typeface, but it would give us something to go on in offering selections.\n\nThere are considerations in lettering design for monuments to forestall erosion and such, but with modern techniques that usually involve sandblasting through a computer-cut template into very hard stone such as granite, those considerations don’t really apply.\n\n"

Granted, it is pricier... although I do not think that it is prohibitively so.\n\nIf you choose a font / typeface, it will most likely be sandblasted on the stone... giving perfection and a flat back... whereas with hand done lettering, you get those really nice V cuts within the letterforms.\n\nI am sure, whatever you do, it will be the right + nice solution for you, however, I would keep solid hand carved letters in mind if it is a priority to get the most beautiful results possible.\n\n"

So far, I rather like Aichel.\n\nTo answer the questions thus far ...\n\nMy dad lived his entire life in the Boston area, but I’d love suggestions for stone carvers anywhere in the northeast. I’ve only visited one monument shop, and it wasn’t memorable.\n\nI’d love hand carved lettering, but I’m not opposed to a well crafted sandblasted stone. The photos posted above are gorgeous, but are too flourished for my dad — and the stone will have my mother’s name added when she dies, and she prefers a more simple, somewhat stoic look.\n\nAbout my dad? Well, his parents came over on the boat, literally, from Ireland just before he was born. I’d love the stone to have an old world feel with just a touch of Ireland implied. He was a very simple, understated man, often quiet, and exceedingly kind. I don’t think he had a single mean thought in his entire life.
