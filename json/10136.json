  "content": "I posted this in another section, but this area seems to get a little more traffic, so after a little bit of additional work, I thought I'd re-post here. To be honest, I'm getting to the point where I've been looking at it for so long that I can't where things are and aren't working.   \n   \nI am currently working on a wordmark project for a faculty within a university. They have used a logo previously, but have decided to get rid of the logo as it was cumbersome to incorporate two logos (the university's logo is required and standardized across campus) all the time. The budget does not allow for a custom font.   \n   \nThe focus is intentionally shifted to emphasize \"graduate studies\" in order to distinguish them from not only the university as a singular entity, but also from other faculties within the university.   \n   \nI am by no means a highly experienced typographer, so I would love to get some feedback with regards to what we have so far. The powers that be seem pleased with it overall, but I would rather be nit-picky and ask the experts now rather than once it's too late. Thanks muchly!   \n   \n ![formal version](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518130957im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68896.gif)\n\n",

The smallest letters ( UBC etc) have big spacing & Graduate less so - so 'studies' should maybe be in between 'Graduate' & 'UBC...' spacing.   \n   \nI tried to show you what I mean ( roughly )   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518130957im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68904.gif)   \n  \n   \nIdeally you might slightly increase the weight of Studies too so it ties into Graduate better.

No matter how much I wish I did, I do not have the training to adjust the weight of the font so that it better ties with \"graduate.\" Given that, I'm concerned that bringing down the size of \"studies\" just exacerbates the balance problem. Not sure how to grapple with it, though.   \n   \nAt any rate... is either of these looking better?   \n   \n ![edits take 1](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518130957im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68907.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "A!   \n   \nB looks confused to me - or maybe just too casual.   \n   \nMaybe push the Studies back out a tiny tiny bit. The advice I gave about moving the word had to do with getting the type to be optically even on the right which is a judgement call ( rather than litterally or actually mathematically even ).   \n   \nI thought of 2 ways to deal with the weight issue without becoming a type designer ( or hiring one - you can't can you?)   \n   \nUse a multiple master type face. Then you can specify the weight for gradulate & studies in small increments until it looks right to you? Not sure what this is? Seach on the board or at adobe or google.   \n   \nThe other possibility ( evenb easier) is to use a Font with Small caps. Use regular CAPS for graduate & the SC - small caps ( already designed to be used together ) for the Studies.   \n   \nDoes the font you are using have a small cap?   \n   \nReally though I think you have done a decent job!\n\n"

Why?   \n   \nI think in tightening up the spacing some of the relationship between the UBC & the Graduate Studies has been lost. The fonts are different ( obviously ) but there was a subtly implied realtionship between UBC & Gradualte because of the spacing - which I liked. Don't get me wrong it isn't ruined or anything but I miss the connection.   \n   \nHere is my suggestion: What if you took Graduate down by 3 pts & Studies by 1pt & opened the spacing slightly. Keep watching the alignment of studies. I think it might need a \\*slight\\* push to the right. It will feel a bit more refined & shout less.\n\n"

Moving the top line to the right a little more will help the U-G relationship, but it should also help with how the F (in OF) relates to the U-A. Also, nudge the STUDIES back and forth to see how the E-S fits best with the T-E above it. I like where your logotype is going.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"
