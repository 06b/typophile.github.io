Not cursive and something that can be easily read (even at smaller sizes).\n\nI'm trying to add to the unique, hand drawn feel that the site will have. The site is for my graphic design portfolio and will have watercolor paint and paper as the background texture.\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated! Also, if there's anyone who thinks that their own font might work, please let me know:)\n\nThanks!!\n\n",
