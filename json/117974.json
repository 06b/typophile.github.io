That still leaves room for the independent foundries to create high-quality faces that fill roles that Monotype's faces don't. The tricky part is just ensuring that independent foundries can get their faces seen and purchased.\n\n"

      "content": "Acquisitions and mergers are subject to regulatory approval when the firms involved control more than a certain percentage of a market, without any allegation of wrongdoing. That is one of the features of antitrust law, in the U.S. as well as in Canada.\n\nThe current situation appears to be an oligopoly, divided between Monotype and Adobe. I suspect that the root cause of this is the changing nature of font piracy.\n\nFont piracy is not new. In the days of hot metal types, in order to survive, the smaller firms imitated the popular typefaces from the large firms that were in demand. In the days of phototypesetting, there were many new firms which all seemed to have their own imitations of the standard typefaces - Times Roman, Univers, Optima, Century Schoolbook, Caledonia, and so on. And of course Garamond and Caslon as well, but those didn't really belong to anyone.\n\nBut this was piracy by competing firms; customers still had to pay for their matrix-cases or glass disks or golf-ball elements. Now, while design imitation is still also present, the actual .ttf and .otf files are being stolen by end-users, and for some reason, while places that distribute hacked copies of Windows get shut down quickly, blatant distribution of pirated fonts goes on unchecked. (This despite the fact that the actual files have the same legal protection as software, and so aren't affected by weak legal protections against design piracy in the U.S..)\n\nThis creates a climate where it's very difficult to do a profitable business unless you're a very big company.\n\nIn fact, though, the piracy _itself_ is only a part of the problem. Notice _what gets pirated_. So the driving force behind piracy is _itself_ a problem.\n\nThe demand for fonts is mainly for _fonts of the standard typefaces that people see everyone else using_. That's not to say that there's _no_ demand for anything else. But the people who want something original do so because they're willing to pay extra money for the highest quality, for a unique brand identity, something that leads fashion trends instead of following them.\n\nAnd while some of those people can trust their own taste and judgment to lead them to what they're looking for, most people with such lofty goals have to rely on the abilities of others to get there. So they will go to FontFont or similar firms with well-established reputations in the stratosphere of type design.\n\nOf course, there are niche markets that are an exception to this: Comicraft comes to mind.\n\nBut in general, what I see in the market for type is one with immense barriers to entry if one is looking for significant financial success.\n\n"

It appears to me that there is very limited interest in new or original typefaces, except if they're coming from a source like FontFont with an excellent reputation and a proven track record. That limited interest comes from the few design houses that can, and will take the time to, find good typefaces without relying on filters to do the work for them.\n\nOne way I could be wrong is that good original fonts by independents do get noticed because type designers can look at a few independents, at least, and then they might talk about what they find - through media from blogs to the trade press, and so there are ways for the professional typographer to have his ear to the ground, so to speak, and be an early adopter of hot new typefaces from many suppliers, not just a few famous ones.\n\n"

Especially when they are updated or changed. Currently, it seems that there are cases in which designers get a fairly smaller share from OEM deals (down to 10%) made my Monotype than by FontShop (30%). Some of the designers that sell their fonts through MyFonts may have noticed that in case of ‘OEM-deals’, that business may (occasionally) be handled by Monotype instead of MyFonts. Instead of the usual 30 to 50% share at MyFonts, it seems that there may be OEM-deal-scenarios in which the typeface designer gets only 10%. Those who are in the font business a bit longer may know that with ‘OEM’, legal documents used to refer to so-called Original Equipment Manufacturers, i.e. manufacturers of laser printers or other devices which have typefaces ‘on board’. Current developments suggest that OEM deals may also be interpreted as ‘corporate licenses’ and the like. Unnecessary to say that the financial volume of a single OEM or corporate license deal is likely to be fairly larger than a single license. I clearly state that this comment is based on a few observations which may not be generalized. Also it seems that license agreements between typeface designers with FontShop are not affected by the recent changes. What I intend to say with this comment is that I think that we have to keep an eye on future developments though.\n\n"

Technologies of various kinds have been rolling around in different places at different times with different receptions, adaptation patterns and various educational and cultural diffusion speeds, with type involved.\n\nBut, at this moment, I'd say there is no way could guess whether there was either more or less piracy or money in Latin vs non Latin, and I just don't see any o it, as the prime motivating factors for any of the monotype acquisitions, 'cept 1.\n\n"

There's a lot less money in making typefaces for, say, Thai - so there are fewer typefaces available, and they cost more. That leads to a bigger problem with font piracy, but the root cause is that fewer and poorer people use the script system.\n\nCyrillic, and, to a lesser extent (because of the lower case) Greek can just be 'thrown in' when designing a Latin face, of course. Greek and Hebrew are somewhat in demand in the Latin script world for scholarly publication and the like. But most of the rest of the world's non-Latin scripts don't offer the same motivations.\n\nEven so, of course, some free fonts are being designed out of philanthropic motives to cover as much of Unicode as possible. In the case of Burmese, there's a controversy over whether Unicode properly covers the script system, though, so there's another level of problem.\n\n"
