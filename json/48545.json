  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nIm looking for some pointers and rules to start working with a light and bold weight of a regular I have made. (My typography is a geometric sans serif like Futura and Avant Garde)\n\n– Is there a special set of proportions between horizontal and vertical lines, when making a thinner and bolder weight? Thinking about thickness and width\n\n– What about the spacing and kerning – Does it change?\n\n– Whats the experince with making a general 'action' in fontlab, where You make all the letters thinner or bolder, and then afterwards creating the necessary adjustments?\n\nThe questions might seem a little naive, but i need to be a 100% sure about what I'm doing.\n\nAny entries on the subject will be gladly appreciated.\n\nThank You very much,\n\nGS\n\n",
