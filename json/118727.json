Much like [http://www.vertu.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241/http:/www.vertu.com/), [https://www.flyvictor.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.flyvictor.com/) or [http://www.bang-olufsen.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241/http:/www.bang-olufsen.com/).\n\nAttached, two superposed versions. How does Frutiger hold up? Knul in small caps looks a bit too playful to me, however it really works here [https://www.blackjet.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fwww.blackjet.com/)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Mera.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241/http:/typophile.com/files/Mera.jpg) | 159.04 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You're right, Captain. I've considered dropping \"yachts\" (still do), then moved in another direction as I felt I was lacking \"substance\" just with the letters M-E-R-A. But then, it would be more memorable to integrate the idea of \"more\" or \"beyond\" into the logo, instead.\n\nSimplifying to one word, I believe the version using slab serif \"Vitesse\" would work well. Simple, solid, confident. Like Hermes, [http://www.hermes.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241/http:/www.hermes.com/). Only disadvantage is one competitor using it already (not for their logo, though, but for headlines on their website). FF DIN could work as well, but less unique.\n\nExploring a \"handwritten\" version was suggested by the client, inspired by the Bmw GranLusso logo. But I'll advise them not to proceed in this direction. It's out of context.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317202241im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Mera2_5710.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Personally I don't think I would choose a slab serif font; somehowdoesn't feel luxurious enough. The scriptish font (Mera Yachts) looks like it belongs on an outboard motor or a fishing reel. I don't think all lower caps is best for conveying luxury.\n\nI like the one in the bottom right corner best, but with only four letters you could also do a custom design. You're not limited to pre-designed fonts. If I were doing this, I would explore the resemblance of the M to a trident. (I would expect \"Mera\" will make most people think of \"mer\" sooner than \"mehr\".) Or I would remove the crossbar from the A and make the M look like two A's stuck together.\n\nAgree with JamesM. \"If you can build yachts, why buy one from us?\"\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for your opinion, gentlemen. Brandon or Futura, bottom right, will be one of the versions. The trident is a nice idea, but I'd rather keep the concept more minimal. The crossbarless A is an option, though. I dropped the idea of using the slab serif (Vitesse) also because of a competitor using it extensively. It's uncommon for a premium brand, so you notice it even better. As for that sentence, I guess you're both right!\n\n"
