Schroeder is a fine letterpress printer. Have a  \nlook into his photos with references:  \n [http://www.druckerey.de/02angebot.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907155135/http:/www.druckerey.de/02angebot.html \"http://www.druckerey.de/02angebot.html\")\n\nYes 2 up to 3 weeks is realistic. No, sorry, correction:  \nits fast. Its another time dimension, not comparable with  \nMac’s World. Lots of steps of working includes manual human  \nressources and its not just a click on your mouse pad.  \nDifficult to understand for a digital designer, but believe  \nme: its just another dimension, not a question of “faster”  \nor “slower”, or more or less hectic. Yes, difficult to  \nunderstand. For now I have to leave. Since yesterday morning  \nI am printing new charater sets. And ’til now just 30 out  \nof 40 are ready... - ...yes, difficult to understand...  \ndifficult...
