      "content": "I would concur with bojev's find of Koloss. The B in the logo is in discord with the rest of the letters. I suggest this is probably a logo designer's custom touch. However, it is possible that someone released this Koloss variation as a font under another name.\n\nI like [Koloss CT](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017130304/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/koloss-ct/) from Castle Type which includes the addition of Koloss Bold Condensed and Koloss Bold Wave.  \nKoloss was designed by J. Erbar and released by Ludwig & Mayer in 1923. Some differences from the digitized versions, including an angled termination to the leg on R.\n\nDon\n\n"
