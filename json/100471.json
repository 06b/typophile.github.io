Like every letter was bitten by a snake on saturday, and no medical help is readily available. Or was comically decompressed in outer space. Or is just about to eat a last mint.\n\nFinding it hard to locate anything like it and would very much appreciate help on this one.\n\nThanks for helping!\n\n",

      "content": "@Form Function: Welcome to Typophile. Can you tell us a bit more about your context? It may provide people with greater insight, and allow them provide you with more informed recommendations (and prevent random shots across the bow). It may even be possible that the solution lies in the treatment of the type, and not it’s selection.\n\nAn example an old professor used to illustrate this point was a client asking a designer to build a door. They spent days talking about blue doors, green doors, screen doors, french doors, sliding doors, rotating doors &c. After several failed attempts, the designer asked the client “Why do you want a door?” The client replied “So I can provide my guests with privacy.” The designer replied “Oh, well if what you want is _privacy_, there are many things other than a door we can do for that. A bent hallway or flight of stairs to obfuscate view, sound dampening walls, a guest house &c. By identifying privacy, a whole new set of solutions presented themselves. If memory serves, this was from a lecture on the role of rhetoric and semiotics in the design process.\n\nMy father used to use a medical analogy: “Don’t tell me what kind of treatment you want, just tell me where it hurts.”\n\nIt has also been my experience that members tend to get more feedback if they use their real names as their screen names. It used to be somewhat of a convention.\n\nAnd remember: May the fonts be with you™.\n\n"

I always admired guys like Dondi, Haring, Basquiat, et al, who could create a coolio stick figure almost as a second nature of expression. So natch I wanted to create my own. It's more of a squiggle man than a stick man but hey I'll take it :)!!\n\nAnd what I really dig most about the figure is it's my name/signature.\n\nThe feet form an /N/ and up from there is the rest of my first name. The head is a /C/ and the rest of my last name down from there. So the mark doubles as a gestural figure and as my signature. I've snuck it into a couple of important graphics as a main feature ...hehe. It's gestural qualities and figural relationship compliment a manufactured element(s).\n\nAnd thanks also for asking about my identity ready to go yet ... I'll have it ready sometime during the Spring ...long time coming.\n\nForm Function, you still here???\n\nHave you found a satisfactory thump of plump???\n\nn.\n\n"

I needed it for a very specific use, and I felt that the keywords I gave were descriptive enough by far.  \nYour professors example is a good one, and I try my best to think like this in my process.  \nReal name?

Read my descriptions, and then look at some of the examples. They are not even close to what I asked for. But then again, I do feel a little like an asshole when saying this. I think you're right when you say that people are just trying to help, I just don't think that their effort was completely thought through. Their enthusiasm for showing their own work trumped my wishes.\n\nAgain, I do understand that I come across as an asshole, but I do think I'm right.

Your \"Eat Fat\" font is the closest thing I've seen till now though, so thanks for that.\n\nHi. No probs glad to give it a fat chance.\n\nThe letter shapes were done by stroking a skinny old normal sans serif font (one with slightly rounded corners) in Illustrator. I tried applying the same technique to a slab serif and the result was just as much a splat of fat except it had square corners. To apply a stroke and maintain the letter shape characteristics just use the drop down menu in the Appearance palette. Select Add Stroke (I think that's what it known as) and make sure to arrange the Stroke layer below the Type layer in the layer stack of the Appearance palette.\n\nTo bad your project went in another direction.\n\nn.\n\n"
