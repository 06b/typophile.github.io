I can however understand that a client would come here for a top quality product, but in such a case they should contact the member directly. In so many words, please don’t turn Typophile into a trivial marketplace.\n\n"

I think you mean whinging, as they too have different meanings  \nwhinge: ’complain persistently and in a peevish or irritating way’ ........yep!  \nwing or winging it: ’speak or act without preparation; improvise’ .........mmmm thats me\n\nThere are sites where you can get freelancers, I am sure members will post them, like Krop (as above) or Behance or another creative forum... though I don’t see why someone cannot ask as nicely as Deborah has, then to be directed to those freelancers for hire sites.\n\n@ James: how is the spam working out for you? although those spiders pick up on everything now\n\n"
