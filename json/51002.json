      "content": "It's visually interesting although a bit \"noisy\" - too much pattern and not enough contrast. The underlying HTML code however is not very good from an accessibility stand-point - those tables will give screen-readers fits, granted they are not your target audience. All that being said, your design work is good.\n\n"
