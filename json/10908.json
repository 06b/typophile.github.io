  "content": "Back in 1997 I went to London and checked out the St. Martin's Academy Of Art College. I picked up a gorgeous brochure (which I later lent to one of those people that do not return books).   \nThe brochure had text set in custom fonts by Phil Baines as well as Barnbrook's Manson ( later renamed Mason ), and also some student typefaces. Phils work was very innovative and I was hoping someone knew where to get his faces or at least view them. As I recall the \"A\" and \"e\" looked something like this. The only font I have seen anywhere is \"Can you\" from Fontshop / Fuse.   \n   \n  ![baines.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140808232252im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/847.jpg)\n\n",
