It’s not 100% free, but the regular weight is free. The rest is more than worth it’s price.\n\nFree fonts are usually crap, but Jos’ stuff is the exception.\n\nFutura isn’t free by the way, but it comes bundled with OSX.\n\n"

I just Google-d it right after I read your answer, and found out why it looks really familiar to me. So there. :)\n\nSorry about the confusion. And huge thanks for all your help. :)\n\n"
