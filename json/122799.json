      "content": "Agree with Don. As usual for this kind of artwork it's hard to define if it's hand-drawn or not. Most of fonts are now offering many alternate glyphs, ligatures and swashes intending to recreate hand-drawing. Some designers and foundries are kind of specialised in such art: [Magpie Paper Works](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Magpie_Paper_Works), [Emily 'Lime' Conners](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Emily_Lime), [Debi Sementelli](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Debi_Sementelli_Type_Foundry), [Great Lakes Lettering](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Great_Lakes_Lettering), [Trial by Cupcakes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Trial_by_Cupcakes/) or (some) [Eurotypo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Eurotypo)...  \nBombshell, Carolyna, Dasha, Ondise, Dahra, Jacques and Gilles, Peoni, Cantoni, Gemmadonati, Asterism among many others...  \n' [Script section at Creative Market](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320090949/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fcreativemarket.com/fonts/script)' is definitely a place to go and spot a good alternative with typefaces by MakeMedia Co., Seniors, Cultivated Mind, Nicky Laatz, MyCreativeLand, Artimasa, MyCandyThemes, AF Studio...\n\n"
