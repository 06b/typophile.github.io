It looks as if the face's irregularities are one of its most interesting features. Have fun with that and take chances! There are a million and one boring serif fonts, and yet people continue to crank them out. Take a chance and make yours unique.\n\n"

I don't even see the Snapfish logo using Mozilla or Netscape 7. There doesn't seem to be any platform specific issues indicated in the help section of the [Snapfish](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203333/http:/www.snapfish.com/helpindex/t_=0) site.   \n   \nThe only thing I can find is this note regarding [Viewing a Friend's Photos](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020203333/http:/www.snapfish.com/helpviewing#friend) - apparently you may have to be signed up for a Snapfish account to be able to view images hosted on the Snapfish site.   \n   \nThe heck if I'm going to do that.   \n   \nShana, could you just post a GIF or JPEG please?\n\n"
