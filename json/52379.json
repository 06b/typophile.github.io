  "content": "Several months ago I think I downloaded a font from either an open-source or free-font site for reasons I don't even remember anymore. In fact I can't remember where it came from but I know it began as something I wouldn't have used a whole lot if at all.\n\nAfter downloading the font I immediately opened it in FontLab and before I knew it, I had gone off on my own zoned-out brain hike and started messing around in every glyph like I was rearranging furniture. I eventually snapped out of it and saved the file, not to open it again for months.\n\nRecently after running across it again in one of my desktop folders, the file name didn't ring a bell so I opened it again and was like, \"Oh yeah ... wow, check this out.\" I immediately began messing around with it some more and liked its progress so much I spent the next three or four weeks essentially rebuilding the entire font. As of this moment it's still nothing I'd ever use, but in my eyes it clearly has some definite potential.\n\nNow the rub: In all honesty, I cannot remember where I got the font, its name, or anything else for that matter other than it was definitely a serif face of some sort, likely for text. However, now it's a nice-looking sans serif and considering the amount of work put into it and alterations made to it, couldn't even slightly resemble what it was when I first administered the anesthesia and opened it up. I also know that for sure because if was similar I'd probably remember what it began as.\n\nSo in simple terms what I've done here is created an entirely unique font, after starting the process with an entire set of previously created character forms. And the difference is so great, it was akin to taking a script font and turning it into a monospace for DOS.\n\nThe question now is, what if anything could I do with this font? Would I be breaching ethical goodness if I ended up selling this font or giving it to a friend for exclusive use in his/her business? YES, I realize I didn't start it from scratch but I also know the end result is completely unique. So where does that leave me? If someone takes, say, Helvetica for example and turns it into a gorgeous display script - and somehow benefits from it - should he or she start saying Hail Marys?\n\n",

Without knowing what the rules and design were in the first place, you can’t ethically release this design, because you really don’t know if you broke the rules or if the design really is something new.\n\nYou could always try passing the font to the Fontlab support staff to see if they can poke through the file to find the name of the original designer, and then contact that person for the most useful opinion you’re going to get.\n\n"

      "content": "First to dezcom: I can't remember what the original font was or if I even have it anymore so the before/after scenario is not possible. More on that in a second.\n\nTo sii: Ordinarily those would be good places to search but I'm what one might identify as nomadic when it comes to my computer files, their names, locations, etc. In other words, the original .vfb file has likely been \"saved as\" four or five different things notwithstanding the fact I probably began this journey almost a year ago. That and the fact my computer is in a perpetual disaster-zone state means I pretty much live in the technological \"now.\" I didn't even return to the original file until several weeks later and even then failed to recognize the name.\n\nThis all does however raise some interesting questions in my mind. Such as, in the long run does it matter whether I could identify the original font or not, or provide the aforementioned before/after comparison? I probably placed too much emphasis on my inability to remember the original font.\n\nAnother thing, in regards to what Mr. Puckett wrote earlier: for the sake of discussion let's say the original was an open-type version of the script font \"Tiffany,\" which I assume would come with some form of copyright/don't-mess-with-this protection. Yet now, the font is called \"Curious\" in which every glyph is a conservative sans down to the bone. What would I have done, in that situation? Did I alter the actual physical file or have I painted on some eyebrows and am calling my work the \"Moaning Lisa?\" If I painted a landscape of the Everglades over the Mona Lisa, could da Vinci claim an intellectual property foul? Pretty tricky stuff if you ask me.\n\nWhich is why I asked all of you. In a sense it's kinda like this: I created from scratch the lc \"g\" I use as my little icon there, along with the rest of the font to which it belongs. What if, though, that \"g\" originally started out as the one from \"Futuris Condensed Light,\" itself a direct \"descendent\" of its Futura predecessor? Who would I have wronged in that case, if anyone at all? As you can see, my \"g\" doesn't share any conceivable similarity with the Futura lc \"g\" other than both of them come after the letter \"f.\"\n\nOf course oprion said it all when he that the ethics issue is a personal one. Obviously I see some potential violation since I've now asked the question, but I can't escape the fact that what the font is now in .vfb form is completely from my own brain. Still, my mom always said when it comes to love and morality (ethics too), \"if there's any doubt, then there is no doubt.\" Meaning, it's either immoral or not love.\n\n"

      "content": "henrypijames, your post - at least from where I stand - amounts to little more than an ordinance stating that since a horse can be turned into glue, it's clear one must be able to turn glue into a horse.\n\nI have no recollection of any kind as it relates to the original font, including how it looked, what it was named or if it went better with white wine or red. However, I CAN be absolutely certain the difference in the original font and what I have now is like night and day ... for, let's see, one, two, three ... four ... a whole hell of a lot of reasons. Most prominent among those being how much time and attention I've already given the font.\n\nI realize you don't know me from a toaster oven but let me assure you I am not the type to spend fortnights to the nth power tweaking nodes a single point east or west and then back again for more than 200 glyphs. Another reason I can be certain is, I am a slave to sans-serif typefaces.\n\nThat being said, I've never seen a single sans font that's made me even consider what it might look like with that chunk of it missing, or this descender lowered by 20 percent. Thus, even though a well-developed fetus could count the number of times I've ramshackled an already existing typeface for the sheer hedonic glee of it, when I am struck by that demonic urge, being conservative about it is the last thing on my mind. Conversely, the creator of Deep Blue probably couldn't count the number of times I've all but finished, for example, a particularly wide all-caps font before nausea compelled me to turn around and transform it into a bunch of wetbar-themed dingbats.\n\nAnd finally, a few really important considerations in the overall picture here:\n\na.) This font isn't even spaced well and hasn't even been approached with the prospect of kerning yet. Summary 1: the several months I've spent on the font has all been on the letterforms. In fact this particular font might be the fourth different one I've done since opening the original file. Summary 2: It's no more ready to be used - or given away, or sold - as a legitimate typeface than my untied laces that land in the shape of an \"o\" or \"s\" after I've taken off my shoes. Consequently, my illegitimate excuse for not trying hard to find out the font's original existence remains as follows: why would I? I promise, long before I take that first step into moral descent - provided I ever even kern this font much less finish it - I will pack my parka and snow shoes for whatever lengthy search of the wild I may have to launch to find my own little font Yoda.\n\nb.) You wrote: \"if you don’t have a good recollection of how the original font looked like, you cannot claim with certainty that your alteration is fundamentally different from the original.\" Uh ... hmmm. You might have something here. But help me out here - couldn't that lack of recall also be attributed to the fact that it does look so different now? Almost via default? I vote against falling into that black hole of a chicken/egg dialogue. But not before making this point - if it currently did look anything like the original, science would dictate my chance of total recall improves by, well, I don't know but I bet it's a pretty sizable amount.\n\nBut, thanks for checking in with your disdain despite the fact I could've just said screw the world and stealthily tried to milk every penny I could get out of this font, and have committed no sin beyond asking the people here to offer their opinion on an ethical issue. Baseless and unwarranted cynicism and disparagement has always gotten a bad rap in my opinion.\n\n"

Draw by eye, imitate, mimic.  \n5) This way your new font will have no stolen points, no stolen curves.\n\nNote to colleagues---is this a good idea do you think? It's only a suggestion, and it's the only thing I can think of doing to put some distance between the original font Curious started with and what he decided on as his after his drawing and design activities.\n\nMeantime, Curious, we really need to see what you ended up with to help identify the source font, in order to determine how different your result may or may not be from the source.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Your OP asks:\n\n_\"The question now is, what if anything could I do with this font? Would I be breaching ethical goodness if I ended up selling this font or giving it to a friend for exclusive use in his/her business?\"_\n\nVarious people since have given you the obvious answer - that the first step needs to be finding the original font (and its attendant EULA) and assessing the differences between it and your new creation. To turn around later and say that obviously you would do that if you ever planned to release it kind of makes the original question redundant. If you don't plan to release it, you have no worries. If you do, you need to find the original.\n\nPeople have offered to try and help identify it if you post your version. If they can give you some ideas then you'll be a lot closer to finding the original. And if they can't, then there's a pretty good chance that your new glyphs are sufficiently different for you to no longer worry. Whether or not that would mean you are legally clear is a totally different question, but either way you'd have a much better understanding of how to proceed.\n\nTake care,\n\nAndi\n\n[[semibad](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023654/http:/www.semibad.com/)]\n\n"

Including most recently from you.\n\nJust two things, however, the first being to pretty much everyone and the second more directly to you:\n\n1.) My original goal was not to figure out what the original font was ... not even close. Honestly I couldn't care less, especially since this thread has convinced me of what I kinda already knew - that regardless of how good it is or different it is from the original, the font in its current state will never be anything more than an exercise in practice and experience.\n\nMy original and lone goal was to see how others here would view the whole scenario in ethical terms. I really wasn't looking to obtain anyone's permission to sell or even give away the font just to feel better about doing it. More like trying to measure my approach to ethics next to others who could thoughtfully consider and comment on their own. I suppose if people are looking for the challenge it might provide, I could post some kind of image, but I have no need to know its origins. I do however appreciate all the people who jumped in the boat here and tried to help me row ashore. If the mystery of it all would provide stimulating thought to anyone, just let me know and I'll let you at it.\n\n2.) Not to dig too deep here, Mr. Arboghast, I will just say that the definition of the word \"excuse,\" in this context, is to \"justify; make an apology for.\" To suggest I either did something unjust or for which I needed to apologize - especially considering what I REALLY did and explained above - is an insult to my character. To then suggest that \"unjust\" conduct was indefensible is what I call a verbal assault first, and \"help,\" somewhere like ninety-eighth. Out of 99. That's just me, though, relying on the specific words written above by henry p james and how webster's defines the most striking among them. Perhaps I should apologize for such deviant analytics. Or for being a smartass just havin a little fun with you guys.\n\n"

Because it is virtually identical to what henry p james said to me ... only I didn't even do anything remotely similar to calling anyone \"dramatic,\" which was just used for reference and not to imply your application of the word was condescending.\n\nSee for yourself - these were his words: \"In any case, it appears you haven’t tried very hard to track down the original font (how many hours have you spent trying?), and I don’t think there’s any excuse for that.\"\n\nI guess it's a disagreement of what each of us considers borderline offensive. I can dig that.\n\nAs for the font issue, I never really intended to release the font in any way, shape, or form. I just became interested in the world's view on it because in the two seconds I actually did give releasing it some real thought, the dichotomy of it made me so queasy I almost yacked. It's an odd feeling to go from feeling like scum to full artist's exhiliration in a mere 1.98 seconds. In truth this subject has hundreds of potential layers and no real clear solution. For example, what if I opened a new, blank font in FontLab and then created all the glyphs from scratch using the infected .vfb file as a visual guide? And the two fonts differed by say 40 percent instead of 70?\n\nAnother mind-bender is this: do foundries/designers copyright or legally prohibit others from altering the actual physical font file itself, or from creating a new vfb from scratch and simply duplicating the letter forms? Or both? Whatever the answer is, I am of the opinion that many of those clamoring for stricter infringement rules need to more thoroughly identify what it is they're attempting to protect. I did however obtain several very solid and diverse opinions and was able to - for myself anyway - resolve my own inner quarrel on the issue. Even amidst all the verbal gymnastics.\n\n"

Using someone’s font as the basis of your font regardless of the number of changes you make is not ethically okay - the issue of losing track of the original source doesn't appear to be relevant.\n\nIf the question relates to legalities rather than ethics, then there are separate arguments and I think James’s tracing suggestion probably passes the bar in most jurisdictions. (not being a lawyer I don’t know for sure).\n\nHowever there are various cautionary tales out there of people making \"original\" fonts that seem to contain generic characters (math operators etc.,) lifted from other fonts, or \"original\" fonts popping up with other people's vendor IDs embedded. These fall more into the camp of PR - in this business simple mistakes like this can hurt reputations long-term.\n\n"

I don't remember \"disagreeing\" with the answers provided here; I was simply trying to generate the most diversity in them as I possibly could. This was not an exercise in self-reassurance by any means, and when all is said and done this was just a forum topic about a font that will never see the light of day. It certainly wasn't my attempt to defend something like what happened to Jos's Delicious font or the T26 lookalike of \"Infinity\" if I'm remembering correctly.\n\nI guess above all, this ordinarily would have been a no-brainer for me if not for my certainty in the fact that the original font and what it is now are two completely different things. Which made me wonder why some of the talk centered around the concept of being \"inspired\" by or creating a quasi-tribute version of the font. I can't imagine either of those being applicable since I can't be inspired by or pay tribute to a typeface of which I have no memory or knowledge. That said, I think the meat of my inquiry got lost - that being the issue of the differences in the two fonts.\n\nAs I asked earlier, what if i just opened a new vfb file and re-created the font by simply eye-balling it and matching all the point positions? That of course would mean I created what ultimately was my own design (keeping in mind how much it differs from the original) in a brand new FontLab file. Could that still be considered unethical. And if so, who's to say how far that ethical line could be extended? I definitely have trouble with those who say under those circumstances I'd still be less-than above board since the only real tie or similarities between the two that remain was that long ago I opened the original in FontLab. The number \"if-thens\" that could be raised on this topic are mind boggling.\n\n"

They also put those under a creative commons licence and made a website to host fan-made remixes called _remix.nin.com_\n\nDuring the summer I downloaded a song that I forgot about, then one night I stumbled across this track called _bosendorfer morhper_ and I was hypnotized by it. It was totally unrecognizable, and I loved it - I had no idea where it was from.\n\nI wanted to use it in a remix, or pieces of it, and I knew it was under a creative commons licence so I knew I was free to, but I couldn't give credit to the author because I didn't know.\n\nI spent 3 entire evenings and nights scouring remix.nin.com listening for it, hunting for it. I knew I downloaded it April 4th, so I looked at the other songs I had downloaded and tried to search for what I thought I might have been searching for. Then I searched for dozens of other songs.\n\nI had given up on it, when one day I was just listening to remix.nin.com on random (and there are THOUSANDS of songs) and it played. At last I knew who it was!\n\nMy advice to you **search systematically** Try to think back to the date you got the original if you can, and see what else you downloaded at that time. **Check the metadata** for any hints as to the author, or any information you could search for. **don't give up** because it's still out there, and you will likely run across it again, and maybe even when you're not looking for it.\n\nGood luck, I know what this situation feels like, but do know that it is possible to find these things if you try.

The most recent example included calling my claims \"groundless\" and \"extremely doubious ...\"\n\nClearly it's time to break out the analogies here since they're always the best chance to successfully explain something to a tire iron. I realize you're taking a strictly scientific approach here, one that says a person with no knowledge of a subject couldn't possibly make comparisons to it, or form opinions on it. However, scientists also routinely admit the least understood aspect of the human condition is the brain, and the memory even moreso. But I digress ...\n\nLet's say you have some recall of going to a movie once with a friend perhaps 15-20 years ago, but can't remember its name, the theater, or anything other than it wasn't an action/thriller since those are your favorite. Then yesterday when talking to this friend's sister about seeing \"The Dark Night\" last week, she complains how you never take her to the movies. While trying to conjure a defense, you bring up the irony in even seeing one with her punk brother but not her fine self. Then for whatever reason she asks \"was it a good one, or one of those 'guy' movies like the Batman thing?\"\n\nAnd despite your memory gap, you feel 100 percent secure in saying, \"nah, they weren't even close.\" Which you base on a.) knowing it wasn't your favorite kind and b.) no general sense of having an especially good or bad experience. Here your memories are based not on visuals, pure instinct mixed with inner emotions and/or sense. I promise, it happens all the time ... except at the Traditionalist Scientists Club meetings in Tuscon every year.\n\nListen: first of all, I know the two are different because the original was NOT a sans because I don't tinker with those. Ever. That immediately means the original wasn't the same classification - an immediate difference. Also, I do understand the notion of \"contrast,\" which means though I can't recollect the original, I am certain I made big changes in that area to make it more sans-appropriate. Oh look, another significant difference.\n\nFinally, and for like the third time, I know they couldn't possibly be similar because I have vivid memories of the amount of time spent on it and the volume of alterations over several months. In a sense it's like having no recollection of how a house looked before you spent a year remodeling it but can still be sure it's completely different now because you can remember tearing up the place, the several coats of paint applied, putting in wood floors to replace the whatever crap the owners had there before, etc.\n\nThus, I leave you with the following: I can't remember the original at all but know for certain the current one is NOTHING LIKE IT AT ALL. Question or doubt me all you like ... now don't you have a boiling beaker somewhere that's about to start leaking over the edge?\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Curioustype.\n\nIt really is up to you whether you consider your transformations of the cannot-be-found typeface as inspired (because it really is) or _immediately_ derived (because it really is). Inspired works are also derived: one derives something from a work, and transforms it, improves upon it, mutates it according to one's own deviant taste, making it one's own. Then it becomes a question of whether you consider _direct_ contact with and transformation of the original source unethical. To many, it is, because you are directly manipulating someone's original (even if digital typefaces may be distributed, each original a perfect replica of _the_ original), and, in a sense, you are \"stealing their points and curves.\" On the other hand, you can also argue that you could've made your current typeface without even altering the cannot-be-found typeface, which is also probable, one way or another, perhaps a time in the uncertain future. This, however, is not the case: you have admitted to having directly manipulated the original. In a sense, what little remains of the original in your new typeface is simply the original, stretched, compressed, recurved, straightened, remolded; as long as it is not reduced to nothing: that what you have now, reduced to its essence that you claimed, is the original. That you have put effort into making a new typeface is admirable, but as the base material is not yours, and as you have had no permission to directly derive from it, then I'm afraid, in good faith, that you should not release the typeface as it is now, nor claim it as your own.\n\nIt is best to print out what you have now, and retrace them by eye in a font-creation software near your monitor. That way, the inspiration is your derived work, and you yourself put up the base material from the ground up, with all the clicking and dragging and key-pressing. And then call it inspired. :)\n\nI hope that helps.\n\n"

I already had decided not to release the font in any way ... in fact I'll never even use it for my own personal work/enjoyment. As I mentioned in earlier posts and was pointed out to me by others, I kinda already knew my position on the ethics of this issue before beginning the thread. I was just interested in hearing the positions of the designers here.\n\nApparently (before your post) some responders missed the part where I said the identity of the original font was unimportant both to me and the spirit of my inquiry since I sought only the views on the process itself and not advice on what I should do with the font; that's why I tried to use phrases such as what I \"could\" have done with the finished product. Ultimately I should've just posed the question as a hypothetical, asking what would others think if I did \"this,\" and \"that,\" to a font before releasing it. Instead I confused everyone by including actual events and describing the obstacle of having a bad memory which in this context was irrelevant.\n\nI also found interesting your discussion about the stealing of points and curves. Earlier I'd asked someone if they would've felt victimized if I had taken one of their fonts and created something completely different - to where he could never have even recognized it. When presented in that way, it would be hard for anyone to specifically identify exactly WHAT had been \"stolen.\" Certainly not the concept or visuals of the font ... and when all's said and done, a font's appearance is everything a font is.\n\nDespite that, however, there would be quite a bit of stealing - not the least of which being the original designer's time he or she spent creating the foundation of the font ... i.e., program settings, metrics settings, etc. All those things must be done at the outset, and they take valuable time. So even if the new font is 100 percent different, you've taken - without asking - the results of the time they spent doing those things. Also just as improper about this is, aside from what I just mentioned, this I'm sure would be a violation of a license or an \"agreement\" between you and the designer, in which you state you will not alter any part of the font file itself (meaning the .vfb).\n\n"

What if you took copies of the original drawings for, say, Gill Sans, and started drawing over the curves, and then redrew them, and then redrew them, until you wound up with something more closely resembling Caslon than Gill? Is that still unethical, as we seem to have decided that the OP's actions were? I apologize; I know we've had more than our fair share of analogies here, but consider this less of an analogy and more of a standalone question.\n\nI guess what I'm really trying to say is that legality and ethics are two separate things, and that it's very easy to say \"check the EULA\" instead of questioning whether an EULA is too restrictive. Creating one font from another in which every single node is different may be less legal than creating a virtually identical font, using the original only as a visual aid; but which is less ethical?\n\nI just ask that at this point we take this discussion away from the OP; that particular discussion has moved beyond rationality and relevance.

I think in the years of metal type, and certainly P-Fab could help us here, the absence of technology was a unknown burden but certainly made other things easier. With technology came the burden of figuring out how to regulate it.\n\nI do not think changing every single node in an existing font is less ethical than legal in the big picture. I do however believe there is something distasteful in avoiding the necessity of actually clicking the mouse once for each of the two or three thousand nodes first placed in the original. There is a certain theft of labor in such an act.\n\nWith all the debates over piracy going on, it seems protecting to appearance of a typeface should be easier to police. I can't imagine how I could be considered more criminal or unethical than those who created \"Futuris,\" or \"Futility,\" et. al. On the surface, I feel like the \"Futuris\" people are more poisonous to the industry, but it's also not good to benefit from the \"labor\" of others even if it is just the insertion of a few thousand nodes. I suppose if someone was hell-bent on avoiding such labor, they could simply start with an open-source font perhaps though I don't know the technicalities of that.\n\n"

It also could be that black and white, but becomes \"black and white and black and white\" when you consider each is its own unique concept and therefore black and white in and of itself. If you really wanted to throw a screwball toward this plate, how would the typographic \"authorities\" respond if someone took an open-source file with no restrictions at all and then created \"Futuris,\" which I guess would be the exact opposite of the scenario I originally presented. Unfortunately since PattyFab has left the building we'll just have to hope another \"authority\" manages to make their way to this thread. Darn.\n\nNot to mention, in addition to the technical vs. visual aspect, there's the ethical vs. legal one as well. Which also makes it choice vs. mandate. I can only offer my view: if someone took a typeface I made and completely altered and then sold it, I'd probably be annoyed but not ready to spit legal nails or anything.

That discussion is, of course, an abstract, generalised one - at the start of the thread it seemed like the OP was asking for _practical_ advice on a specific instance. The practical advice that several people gave was to find the font and read the EULA - in a single instance, there's no point debating what the EULA _may_ say. It _may_ have been draconian, or it _may_ have said 'do what the hell you like with this font'. Without knowing what the EULA says, how can we question whether it's too restrictive?\n\nOf course, the later question is much more interesting! And your analogy is a nice clean one, so no worries there. The more you change a typeface from its original roots, the more of a grey area it becomes. One question would be: why didn't you start it from scratch in the first place? But of course that's a question that only gets asked with hindsight.\n\nIn your analogy, I think that paper 'tracing' over Gill and ending up with Caslon would be some extremely creative tracing! But of course, digitally there is the issue of 'the file'. How much remains left of the original kerning, proportion, etc? There's obviously a scale here, which goes from unethical, to mildly unprofessional, to... Well, unlucky, I suppose, if you release an original font which is later shown to have been drawn over another font (as in the example that was posted earlier). This could be a legal problem, but not really an ethical one. When presented as a specific instance, of course it's easy to say 'check the EULA'. But I still think it's easy because it's the only real answer, aside from redrawing your face from a printout.\n\nI really hope the atmosphere in this thread clears up. These aren't the thoughts of a type designer (end-user all the way), and I would be interested to see what some other folks think. At the moment though, I can't see that happening. Curious, you really need to calm down. If you react to troll-feeding, then I'm sorry mate, but you're probably a troll.\n\nCheers, Andi\n\n[[semibad](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023654/http:/www.semibad.com/)]\n\n"
