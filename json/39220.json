And I don't like it when the rules change here. 1 year ago the killerrule was: First the name, then add the link in the SAME post. Now the rule is: First the name, then add the link in a NEW post even if there are zagillions other posts in between. Isn't very legible, eh? Quite irritating for a website dedicated to typophiles.\n\n"
