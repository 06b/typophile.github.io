(Nasdaq: TYPE), a leading global provider of text imaging solutions, and its subsidiary, Linotype GmbH, have unveiled version 2.5 of the award-winning Linotype FontExplorer® X Pro font management application for individual users, and version 1.5 of the FontExplorer X Server solution for workgroup administrators.\n\nFontExplorer X Server 1.5  \nDesigned for workgroups requiring flexible font management and control capabilities, FontExplorer X Server 1.5 debuts with a lockdown feature that allows administrators to limit certain functions of connected FontExplorer X Pro client users. Features include the ability to hide Linotype’s integrated font store and the workgroup’s local library from view, as well as prevent the ability to import fonts at specified client workstations. Administrators may also define fonts for automatic installation and activation on selected clients. Also new is a server replication feature, which enables larger installations to distribute workload across multiple servers. In this scenario, “slave servers” are connected to a “master server,” which enables data to be distributed amongst a defined subset of networked clients.\n\nBackup functions have also been enhanced in the latest release. Administrators may now assign without restriction the time of day and locations relating to when backups are conducted. Additionally, the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) connection has been revised to allow administrators to authenticate users directly from the LDAP server through the use of a domain password. In addition, the interface that controls system settings has been redesigned for improved clarity and handling.\n\nFontExplorer X Pro 2.5  \nDesigned for easy organization and management of fonts for individual users, FontExplorer X Pro, which received a Macworld® Editors’ Choice Award as one of the 13 best software products launched in 2009 for Macintosh® computers, now includes expanded capabilities that are also designed to improve ease of use. A new print function allows users to create font sample books without having to activate fonts in a separate application. This feature allows users to simply drag and drop individual elements into a print preview mode, which can also be pre-configured through a comprehensive set of options. Alternatively, users can choose from a menu of readily available templates when creating font sample books.\n\nVersion 2.5 introduces the ability to classify fonts. For example, users may choose to sort fonts and thereby create “smart sets” through keywords such as “serif,” “cover sheet” or other self-defined words or phrases. This feature also allows for automatic downloads of available font classification information from Linotype. The main window of FontExplorer X Pro has been reworked and includes new features, such as a “wide mode,” which allows users to take advantage of the extended image area of widescreen monitors. The main window can also be set to a transparency mode, enabling the ability to overlay fonts directly on documents.\n\n“FontExplorer X continues to earn exceptionally positive feedback. Receiving one of the coveted Macworld Eddy awards has been an amazing honor. It’s a strong endorsement that speaks to our commitment to offer the best possible font management products,” said Frank Wildenberg, managing director of Linotype.\n\nAvailability and pricing  \nAvailable for Macintosh computers running Mac OS® X 10.4 or later and available in English and German, FontExplorer X Pro 2.5 may be downloaded and purchased from [www.fontexplorerx.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713183704/http:/www.fontexplorerx.com/ \"www.fontexplorerx.com\") for $79 U.S. or 79 EUR (including VAT), or 59 GBP (excluding VAT) for a single user license.
