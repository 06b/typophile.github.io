  "content": "Hello fellow typophiles,\n\nI am currently preparing a book in french and english, due to be released in Europe and America around september 2009 at Atelier Perrousseaux publishing (the french publisher of Adrian Frutiger books), about 'forgotten typefaces': alphabets which have been drawn, possibly cast and used 500, 100 or 30 years ago but, for numerous reasons, didn't make it (yet) to the digital age and are not available on any computer.\n\nThe increasing rarity or lack of documentation about these might bring them to complete extinction, so I thought it would be a great idea to document these letters and their authors, and to provide good quality, high resolution prints of them for the courageous designers who would have the good idea to digitize them, or simply for the pleasure to see these letters again and again.\n\nI already have quite a big amount of documentation, but I am very much looking for help: if you have any document (visual and/or text) about a 'forgotten typeface', I'd be very happy to consider it. Be sure that any help will be thoroughly aknowledged in the book.\n\nThank you in advance,  \ndr\n\nps: In the framework of this project, I am looking for some high resolution scans from the \"book of oz\" which I (unfortunetaly) still don't own. If some good (and lucky) soul wants to help...\n\n",

Very few of the photo lettering companies libraries made it into the digital age which is what inspired my initial historical preservation efforts to revive them . . .\n\nMark Simonson would also be good for you to approach since he has worked with and revived faces of many extinct foundries including Phil Martin's original offshoot creations . . .\n\nStuart :D\n\n"

Any scan would be great, but if there is a lot, maybe you can at least take some quick snapshots with a digital camera in low res and send me... then if I need some of them in high res, i can tell you which ones. Anyway, thanks in advance.\n\nDiner: I would be happy to see your material regarding Filmotype and Lettering Inc, though if there is already a book in the making, I dont want to make the same work... And about Mark Simonson, I would be glad to get in touch with him, but again I am interested in typefaces which have not yet been revived.\n\nThanks again, keep posting,\n\ndr\n\n"

The typical faces offered by the big foundries, such as Linotype and Monotype, are based on the text sizes, since that's what their pre-digital equipment was made to set. Before the digital era, most hand-set cold type (Typositor, rub-down sheets, etc.) for display sizes was based on large sizes of foundry metal type. There are significant differences between the text cuts and display cuts of metal faces, and we've lost a big part of typographic legacy in the one-size-fits-all digital era.\n\n"

      "content": "If you're going to look at Cooper's work, then you should also consider the lesser known designs by his contemporaries Goudy and Dwiggins. There are probably dozens of Goudy faces that are undigitized. After all, he claimed to have designed more than 100 typefaces, some of which didn't even make it into much metal distribution (including many which may not warrant revival). Jim Rimmer would probably be an excellent resource for information about Goudy's oeuvre.\n\nWorks by Dwiggins (my area of some expertise) that might fit your criteria would include:\n\nCharter (although Sibylle Hagman's Odile is a nice homage)  \nHingham (Christian Schwartz had started something loosely based this newsface experiment; I don't recall how loose.)  \nArcadia  \nStuyvesant (I've been working on an interpretation/homage off and on)  \nFalcon  \nTippecanoe  \nExperimental 276D\n\nOf these, Falcon is the only one that was ever commercially produced (posthumously). Charter, Arcadia, Stuyvesant, and Tippecanoe made it into at least one commercial publication, but were not produced. Experimental 267D made it into one rare piece of ephemera that I know of. Not all of these necessarily warrant revival either. And I'm not considering other experiments that didn't reach a certain level of fruition.\n\nI have a fair amount of documentation on many of the above list. If you're interested in pursuing any of these for your book, let me know. Your brief is pretty wide open, so I'm not entirely sure what you're looking for. I'm not so interested in contributing to a swipe book, but historical documentation is right up my alley.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

Sorry, not enough bandwidth here on my mountain for hi-res.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322024057im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Charter_alphabet_3768.gif)\n  \nBut it's not my intention to turn this into yet another Dwiggins thread.

I am still in the early stage of preparing the book, so for now, I don't know, honestly. I'm keeping an open mind. I'm going to gather as much info as I can, see where it's taking me, and after a month or so I will sit down and talk with my publisher and decide where is the boundary of the book.\n\nKent: from what I saw here and there, I think for now I will focus on Arcadia and Tippecanoe from WAD. Charter is wonderful, but Odille actually fills the gap.\n\nAntonio: Thanks for the heads-up.\n\ndr\n\n"

      "content": "<cite> Piccic: I thought about that, but in all honesty, the original Futura is already available in many books, not to mention the web... I will though investigate the Gill Sans alternates (I think I saw some at the St Bride library). </cite>  \nYes, David, but I don't think there is a consistent version of Futura conveying its essence.  \nPersonally, I don't like Futura so much, but there is too much that got lost in early digitizations (for Gill, that's infinitely multiplied). It all depends on where the focus of the book will be…\n\nI do not agree with Nick when he says, after David's comment:  \n<cite> it takes time and courage for a designer to spend a huge amount of time digitizing another artist’s design in order to revive it, to dedicate one’s skills to the art of someone else so that the typographic creation and the creator himself doesn’t fall into oblivion. </cite>  \n **Bullshit. Sure, it takes time and effort to do a good job of digitizing an old face, but you’re pouring it on a bit thick with the rescuing from oblivion malarkey. By providing high resolution images, you will be making it easy for hacks to do a quick and dirty job autotracing from second-hand material. Where’s the nobility in that?  \nHere’s an idea: perhaps it is actually more daring to design a typeface of one’s own.**\n\n\"Bullshit\" un corno. It takes <cite>a lot </cite> of courage to take on one's shoulders the task of \\*properly\\* digitize a typeface, in order to get into its timeline spirit, the designer, to catch its essence and rework it for the present.  \nIt may take a lot more courage than designing one's own typeface, since it requires one's own \"ego\" to be left apart in order to devote themselves to the work of another person.  \nAt least, so it's always been for me. I've never been able to complete any re-production of lead types because it always seemed more attractive to work on original designs.\n\nSurely Nick is right when he says this makes life easier for superficial people hacking existing work, but it all depends on how David will plan and project his book.  \nUnfortunately such things have always been, but if we keep worrying about this we'll be concentrating merely on potentially negative behaviors, not good ones…\n\n"

I know the problem very well, suffering from it… :=)  \nBut I don't think David meant the book as a source for \"scanning and autotracing\". It seems more about important steps under the dust in the course of history, I hope. Although it seems not easy…\n\nI don't like the term \"revival\" because to me it implies a sort of superfluous addition to an original.  \nWhile this may be fine, the example of Odile is fitting. I think Sybille Hagman reworked the original forms of Dwiggins enough to make the whole typeface her own.  \nFor the same reason I think Dwiggins Charter deserves a good digital version. It's radically different from Odile, I would never use them for the same purpose.\n\n"
