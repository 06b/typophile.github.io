Typefaces that may have been used in conjunction with silhouette portraits or as stamped artists logos or signatures would be great too!\n\nIf you don't know what I mean by silhouette portraits this may jog your memory:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423013713im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jennys_5163.jpg)\n\nThank you!\n\n",

It's a later period than you're asking for but some amount of that type had to have been in use earlier. I'll try to post some scans later.\n\n"
