  "content": "Dear All,   \n   \nI hope you can help and I hope this is the right forum. Just installed the Linotype Essentials 1 and 2 sets of fonts on my new Mac (OSX 10.38, Quark 5.01 and 6, Suitcase X1, ATM Lite) and I have a problem.   \n   \nIn both versions of Quark some of the fonts both display and print with the bottom of descenders sort of chopped off (examples would be Avenir, Caecilia and Ergo among others). It also happens in Word.   \n   \nIn Quark 6, adjusting the baseline shift upwards slightly seems to correct (a pain but it works). In Quark 5, which I need to use as some of my clients still use 4, it makes no odds.   \n   \nScratching my head here and hoping someone can come to my rescue. Just moved from OS8 and Quark 4 so still finding my way round all this new software, but thhis ones bugging me bigtime as I have a deadline (isn't it always the way)   \n   \nThanks in advance   \n   \nPaula\n\n [‹ Hanging Punctuation](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023161619/http:/typophile.com/node/10368 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Why is Linotype claiming it owns Eurostile by Novarese? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023161619/http:/typophile.com/node/10406 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The good news is that I think I was wrong and Quark 6/OSX prints fine and I was mistaken - not about 5 though.   \n   \nDear Thomas, Thanks for the suggestion - makes perfect sense ... but tried it and it still doesn't work ...   \n   \nbut all I'm going to do for now is open the Quark 5 doc in 6, print from there and make sure I don't save it. In the process of all this, I discovered that the Quark6/OSX printing runs a lot faster anyway ... so there may even be an advantage of doing it this way.   \n   \nSTOP PRESS:   \n   \nA restart and Thomas' suggestion actually WORKED. Thanks a million everyone.\n\n"
