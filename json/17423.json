      "content": "Since there is much from where to choose, I believe you should try to identify the personality of the written text and kind of speech, because there is much difference between setting text with Adobe Garamond and Swift, for instance. I usually choose body text between 9 and 11, with a difference of 2,5 or 3 pts leading, that is, 9,5/12pts. Beware of the proportion! Why 2 columns?  \nA very good setting can be achieved with Slimbach’s Minion 10x12,5pts with a 21 pica line length single column. It’s a elegant typeface and also quite condensed.  \nDid that help?\n\n"

      "content": "Whether or not 2 columns is more readable depends on the trim size. Since it’s a text book I’m guessing it’s at least 8 x 10 in which case 2 columns probably is best. You don’t want too many characters per line, but not too few either.\n\nHowever I’m not sure about Goudy for a medical text, it is such a warm friendly face. I might go for something simpler such as Adobe Caslon or Garamond or Minion, and then use a sans serif for the graphs and tables.\n\n"
