  "content": "I'm a senior at Vassar College writing my thesis on Mexican Typography during, roughly, the first 100 years of Mexico's nationhood.\n\nI was wondering if anyone could point me to some studies (I have already read Fernandez Ledesma's work on the 19th century) or archives of graphic design during the Porfiriato (~1880s to 1910) and Revolution of 1910. I do speak/read spanish, so that is not a problem.\n\nwho's excited for the first ATypI conference in Latin America?!\n\n",

I was just looking at this:\n\nMexican Blackletter (Hardcover)  \nby Cristina Paoli\n\nI would love to read your thesis. I love Mexican type. I want to go there later this year. I would love to know some recommendations of places to visit.\n\nAlso, any other resources or websites you have found would be appreciated.\n\n"
