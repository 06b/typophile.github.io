[Premium Quality](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105759/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Quality..._Serve_Loud!)**\n\nMotives may vary but the fundamental reason students purchase custom papers online is that they want to submit decent papers to their teachers. One thing that students should keep in mind is always to go for first-rate quality and not settle for inferior papers. They have made their purchase and they deserve premium service.\n\n**_Solution:_** Before availing the services of a writing company, students should first have a look at the sample works. This way, they can evaluate the kind of writing that the writer does or the company provides, and after which, decide for themselves whether they would want that style and level of writing for their own.\n\n**2. No [plagiarism](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105759/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Plagiarism)**\n\nPlagiarism is a big issue in the academe, and students caught plagiarizing will be dealt with accordingly. Punishment ranges from suspension to expulsion depending upon the gravity of the transgression. If students submit custom papers with plagiarized contents, their hopes of passing the course will surely be in peril.\n\n**_Solution:_** Check the custom papers for possible plagiarism hits on the internet. This can be done by typing a sentence or two on major search engines and see if there are words that have been lifted without proper citation. There are also online article checkers and plagiarism detecting tools students can use.\n\n**3. On-time delivery**\n\nAcademic papers have deadlines, and often students are time-pressed so they just order custom papers online. Therefore, students should make it a point that the company that they are going to get can deliver on time.\n\n**_Solution:_** Students can only put so much trust on custom paper providers. Even though the company might say that they have a quick turnaround and that they can deliver on time, it would still be advisable if students will make the necessary precautions. Order the custom papers early on to avoid any inconvenience.\n\n_Ann Gardner is a [custom papers](http://web.archive.org/web/20090608105759/http:/www.bestessays.com/) writer for high school and college students.
