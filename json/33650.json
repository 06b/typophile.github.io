  "content": "Hello, this is my first post here. I am looking for a typeface that looks stitched, or sewn. I thought I found one but when we contacted the designer he said he had not finished the face. His name is [Tom Brown](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908121306/http:/tbad.ca/) and we saw his work in an old issue of Communication Arts. The attached is a screen shot from his site. I would have just linked to it but since it is Flash based thought this was safer.\n\nWe don’t need an exact duplicate so any suggestions of nice faces with a similar feel would be appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tom.brown.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908121306/http:/typophile.com/files/tom.brown.png) | 47.57 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Design Museum - FF Schulbuch Süd {Jan Erdmann}](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908121306/http:/typophile.com/node/33666 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for a PC equivalent for DIN fonts used in a Mac file ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908121306/http:/typophile.com/node/33678 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
