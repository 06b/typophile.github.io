I'll have a couple (drinks, not women) to celebrate.  \nWhat Stuart's holding looks pretty good for staters. :) Actually, my wife  \nand son are taking me out for a Creole dinner tonight. Bring on the gumbo!\n\nDan, the weather here has finally decided to cooperate with the season.  \nSo it's cold and wet but I don't mind. I just wish it didn't get dark so early.\n\n"
