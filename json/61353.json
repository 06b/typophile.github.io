  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI'm wondering if this font wasn't based on a commercial previous design. The author gives it for free at his website:  \n [http://www.ericolebedenco.com/yellowmag.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823092535/http:/www.ericolebedenco.com/yellowmag.htm \"http://www.ericolebedenco.com/yellowmag.htm\")\n\nDownloading the font and looking into, I can clearly see the Times figures there. Then, for this limited charset and lack of proper figures, I would think that this is a student/beginner/free font work. But a few pointers are leading me to think that this was based on someone else's work. For example, the right serif on F top is slightly bigger than on E - to compensate the bigger counter space - but hey, no dummy would know that...\n\nCan you think of anything that could be the source of this?\n\nThks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823092535im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture4_4128.png)\n\n",

Although Gizmo was obviously used as the basis for the new type, as it was significantly different, there wasn't a thing I could do about it:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823092535im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gizripoff_6321.gif)\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"
