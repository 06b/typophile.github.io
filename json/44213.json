The prices are incredibaly low & the quality seems decent enough...there must be a catch..has anybody had any experience using these guys?\n\n [‹ Veer Member Handbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44235 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Gravitas: elevating goofy letterforms ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062921/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44190 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I used Blurb to make a book with my vacation photos and I was really happy with the [final result](http://web.archive.org/web/20080720062921/http:/www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/143191). I didn’t end up using their templates, I designed the whole thing in InDesign and placed entire pages as images. The only thing that I didn’t really like was how the book block was attached to the hard bound spine. The white paper looks a bit flimsy, but the dust jacket covers most of that. The paper quality is ok and the images turned out nice, not super crisp but really decent. I also wish they had a choice for the color of the book cloth on hard bound, it is black.\n\nI hope that helps, I couldn’t find any helpful reviews of their books when I was deciding.\n\n"
