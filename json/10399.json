      "content": "Linotype licenses several fonts from Monotype. Monotype could have a newer version on their site. I do not know.   \n   \nSince the initial distribution of Times (New Roman) in the 1930s, there has been collaboration between Monotype and Linotype regarding design and distribution. Monotype's drawing office made the original design for the London Times, but most newspapers at the time were set by Linotype machines, so a (slightly different ?) version had to be produced for those.   \n   \nThe Linotype versions, called simply Times (as opposed to Monotype's Times New Roman) can be found via the following links:   \n [http://www.linotype.com/86030/timesten-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123003214/http:/www.linotype.com/86030/timesten-family.html)   \n [http://www.linotype.com/1537/times-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123003214/http:/www.linotype.com/1537/times-family.html)   \n [http://www.linotype.com/86584/timeseighteen-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123003214/http:/www.linotype.com/86584/timeseighteen-family.html)\n\n"
