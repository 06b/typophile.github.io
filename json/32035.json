If so, I’m not alone: take a look a Monotype Bulmer OpenType, purchased through Adobe (though I doubt it is Adobe’s fault). There is a class \\_f which has as its members all the f\\_ligatures. It is specified to kern only on the LEFT. But somehow, when the pair “f” and “quote” (also a class) got kerned, that value was applied to all the members of \\_f, even though that is a kern on the RIGHT. So, “Jeffi” (a nickname in a novel I’ve read) would have what amounts to a word space between the “ffi” and the apostrophe with the possessive “Jeffi’s”.\n\nI prefer to take control & only work with the features files.\n\n"
