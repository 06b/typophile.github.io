The Post Office, who was using [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) at that time, cancelled their commission at the last minute. Spiekermann's design went into hibernation. Interestingly enough, the post office did eventually change their corporate face—to [Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frutiger), which they still use today.\n\nAround the same time as the founding of [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop), Spiekermann and several of his colleagues revived their dormant design, creating FF Meta, whose first weights were released in 1991. Over the next 15 years, numerous more weights would be devised.\n\nFF Meta is named after the studio which Spiekermann headed at the time, [MetaDesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/MetaDesign). Meta is proud of the face, calling it the [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) of the '90s (quote attributed to Robin Kinross). Meta was designed for use at smallish sizes, but became more widely used by designers looking for a workhorse typeface with range.\n\n[FF Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/ff_meta/) is part of FontShop International's [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) library.\n\nMore history: [How FF MetaPlus Became FF Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/meta-morphosis-how-ff-metaplus-became-ff-meta/)\n\nSee also: [FF Meta Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FF%20Meta%20Serif)\n\n**Foundry:**  \n [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/meta)\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [What category would you classify Meta, Scala, and Thesis?](http://web.archive.org/web/20150320042644/http:/typophile.com/node/52083)\n\n",
