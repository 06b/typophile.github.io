The 't' is a contemporary Gothic style, similar to that used in [House Chalet 1980](http://web.archive.org/web/20140826172935/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet). I know Chalet is newer than the sample, but it is based on older designs that were probably photo-lettering types.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
