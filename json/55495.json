  "content": "Calling Paul D Hunt (and anyone else who cares to comment)...\n\nI have some questions on the subject of P22 Underground Pro, the answers to which might interest others too:\n\n(1) When it says that Underground is licensed to P22, does that mean that P22 Underground Pro sticks rigidly to the original which I assume still belongs to the London Transport Museum? Or did you redraw it entirely, and if so, why does it still belong to the LTM (if it does, that is) or is it now a P22 font? I realise the nuts and bolts of the arrangement with LTM may be sensitive information.\n\n(2) Where does P22 Underground Pro fit in with the New Johnston family which is what Transport for London now use? Is there a connection at all (other than having a common ancestor)?\n\n(3) In what ways does P22 Underground Pro differ stylistically/in appearance from New Johnston (is it just more faithful to the original?/is it the original and best?) or ITC Johnston which is different again and can presumably be classed as a revival of sorts? Do you see P22 Underground Pro as a revival?\n\n(4) How were the other guys who are credited on the pdf involved with the design?\n\n(5) Did the original Underground font really have the corners snicked off microscopically? What's the thinking behind that, if any?\n\nLove it, by the way, especially the pdf which has already been complimented in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/typophile.com/node/39734).\n\nFinally, is there a place on Typophile where this kind of information about individual typefaces can be found? It occurs to me that between us, there must be a lot of info about fonts that will disappear just as quickly as we do unless it is documented somewhere. Or are we just relying on what Wikipedia says? (This discussion may or may not warrant a thread in its own right.)\n\nFor example, I have some (albeit fairly trivial) information on one or two typefaces that I don't suppose anyone else knows. So where do I leave this info for posterity's sake? Wikipedia? Surely not.\n\nInterested in your thoughts.\n\nN\n\n",

      "content": "Hello Nick,\n\nthere are already two threads about P22 Underground Pro, at least:  \nIn addition to the aforementioned [Underground Unbound](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/typophile.com/node/39734), announcing the PDF specimen, there’s [Appropriate alternates or an anachronism?](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/typophile.com/node/38787), started by [Paul Hunt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Hunt) while the fonts still were in the making.  \nIf you want to share your knowledge, I think it won’t be a bad idea to add it to either of these existing threads. And I second Andrew’s suggestion, the Typowiki is a good place, too. Yes, anyone can edit the entries, that’s the idea. Just start here: [P22 Underground Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22%20Underground%20Pro). And then add a link to the list of [Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Typefaces).  \nF\n\n"

Major kudos to Paul, it's one of my favorites.\n\n(For the record I do not think it is anachronistic to add alternatives – surely it would be anachronistic _not_ to include them! Anachronism is most annoying when it is unintended.)\n\nAnother version of Johnston I have been seeing a lot of lately is [this.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/www.tfl.gov.uk/resources/corporate/projectsandschemes/artmusicdesign/pfa/images/anna-barriball/off-to-work.gif) A better image [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083231/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/alastairhumphreys/3246786637/)\n\nNotice the pinched tittle and vertical terminal on the 5. Anyone know which version this is?\n\n"

My rationale was that it is these 'imperfections' that give the face charm. New Johnston is a less-strict revival, but still retains many of the qualities of the original but has taken some liberties to improve the face for its purposes.\n\n4) Persons listed in the credits on the PDF beta-tested the fonts, gave feedback, critiques or lent images for the PDF.\n\n5) Not that I know of. The original type was a wood type, the nicked corners were incorporated to give a sense of softening of edges that might have been associated with the types having been made from wood. Otherwise, I included these as a design feature partially due to my own aversion of sharp corners.\n\nIf you have any other questions, you can post them here or email me:  \npaul (@t) p22 (d.t) com.\n\n"

      "content": "(1)  \nLicensing and design are two separate issues. The London Transport Museum granted P22 a license to use their intellectual property to recreate the original Johnston design for LT. LT has a very strong identity and IP protection. Even though the font was redrawn from \"scratch\", having the official licensing makes it an authorized \"product\". There are many reason this was the only way to go for this project.\n\n(2)  \nNew Johnston is the official face of LT as designed for them by Banks & Miles. It varies from the original Johnston in several ways.  \nP22 Johnston Underground was the basic font done in 1998. It is a very close facsimile of the original Johnston and doe snot follow New Johnston.  \nP22 Underground Pro is Paul Hunt's refined and expanded version of P22 Johnston Underground. It is less like the original Johnston than the first P22 version but more than New Johnston.\n\n(3)  \nOverlaps with above answer. Sure call it a revival.\n\n(4)  \nPaul did pretty much all of the Pro set on his own. I smoked Cuban cigars and stood over his shoulder saying: \"Hunt...isn't that damned thing done yet!\"\n\n(5)  \nThe corner bumping was something I decided to do for P22 Johnston Underground since we were working from woodtype specimens and I didn't want sharp corners at large sizes. It was an experiment to see if it would soften (and therefore make less digital) the overall feel of the font.\n\n"
