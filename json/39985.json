If you love Typophile, send $45. And, if it’s a true obsession, you can show it with a larger donation of $100.\n\nWhen you support Typophile you’ll receive a badge to add to your user icon. Let other users know of your undying sympathy (shield), love (heart) obsession (drop of blood) for Typophile.\n\nAlso, if you purchased a tee in the last 12 months we’ll send you badge to match your approximate contribution. Some of you made other significant contributions this year. You won’t be forgotten.\n\n [Read more](http://web.archive.org/web/20071214135922/http:/typophile.com/node/39993)\n",
