That is one reason SIL has started including them.\n\n> I believe font vendors should soon start to include CSS files with fonts that are intended to be used on the Web as part of the documentation.\n\nI had that same thought when I read your original post. Thanks for providing an example -- hopefully you won't mind if SIL uses it (or something derived from it) in future releases?\n\n"
