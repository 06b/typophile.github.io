I specifically am searching for something with the notches cut out of the letters. Would be great if the original could be identified, but if not, something close will be just as helpful.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [notched.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122605/http:/typophile.com/files/notched.png) | 18.17 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Sorry, don't know any font that could fit your needs as it. I'm pretty convinced (almost positive when it comes of Nike) it is a custom job. You best chance is probably to create your own, starting with a [College](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122605/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Acollege)/ [Athletic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122605/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aathletic)/ [Varsity](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122605/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Avarsity/)/ [Octagonal](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122605/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Aoctagonal/fonts/) Sans of your choice and customize it. Nike was also well-know for using [United HI](http://web.archive.org/web/20131119122605/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection) which I think could be a nice to start your customization on.
