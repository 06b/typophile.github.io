Some font families, such as Venus, Roemisch, Topografische Zahlentafel, include left leaning fonts and letters designed for German cartographic map production, even though they do not support Arabic characters._\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic\\_type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106034211/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic\\_type\")\n\n"

As Dan, Andreas and Andrew have explained, reverse italics (‘Linkskursiv’ = ‘left cursive’ or ‘Rückwärts Liegend’ = ‘lying backwards’) are often used in cartography, traditionally to indicate waters.\n\nF\n\n"
