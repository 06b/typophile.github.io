  "content": "I did some concept drawings for my \"art studio/company\". The name Eggroll Industries dates back to high school and my nickname is Eggroll.\n\nI want it to look a little retro/artsy and simple so it won't detract from my art. I didn't buy the font yet so I can't provide larger examples. These are all roughs. I think the finished version I'm going to use a scanner technique or print them so it has a screened poster feeling.\n\nI'm using a costume to brand myself. You can see a photo I took of me in it...long explanation.\n\nAnyways, feedback welcome!\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019101223im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Heroic_condensed_thumbs1-4_3977.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019101223im_/http:/typophile.com/files/silhouette-web_5178.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019101223im_/http:/typophile.com/files/art_3872.jpg)\n\n",
