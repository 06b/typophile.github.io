It has that Art Deco wackiness, but that /L/ feels sci-fi, and the /R/ reminds me of Star Wars and the old Chicago Reader logo.\n\nWith this type of face, I always appreciate it when the designer supplies a \"straight\" version, along with the more expressive forms as OpenType alternates. For instance, the two different /H/s and /E/s bring a welcome diversity.\n\n"

It definitely had some art deco as a starting point, but wanting to move it in a much more bold angular/contemporary direction.\n\nKeeping in mind that the slant-L might be a bit too much, I think it's getting reasonably coherent 'standard' letterforms, and vague ideas on distorting proportions/details on the alternates:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195633im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screenshot-2014-07-22-11_3571.54.06.jpg)\n\n"
