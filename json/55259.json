      "content": "<cite>Making the font with FontStruct is quite a task (+ I am not good enough).</cite>\n\nAs you've studied the structure of Mark Coleran's lettering closely FontStruct should not be difficult at all. A square is the default building block, plus having those spaces between the 2x2 squares will make it a lot easier to copy and paste sections between different letters. What is great is you can make the font in stages. Start just doing the letters you need. You can go back any time and eventually make as full a set of glyphs as you want.\n\n"
