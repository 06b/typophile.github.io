The source of anything 'creative' is surely the mind: we're just imitating God (made in his image). The tool that was first used to produce it is merely coincidental. It doesn't have to inform how things are now best done, or how they will be done better tomorrow using different tools. I guess someone wrote with his/her finger in the dust of the ground prior to any pen being made. According to your logic, it could be argued that the source of letters is some Neanderthal's hand with or without a rock in it.\n\nIf I have understood you correctly, I think you would also say that the 'source' of domestic lighting is fire. However, today's best and brightest lights today have nothing to do with fire. Hrant may or may not be the Thomas Edison of typography (only time will tell - it's said that it took Edison more than a thousand attempts before he got a bulb that worked). I admire Hrant for wanting to break new ground, that takes character and resolve, it's what enterprise is all about. I would be very wary of being the person who witnessed Edison's penultimate light bulb experiment and branded him a complete waste of time and space.\n\nI'm not sure why you push your pen argument so aggressively. Does it matter that much where letters came from? If so, why, please help me understand?

In my opinion some very bad men have fully justified their ends as valuable 'within themselves' and been objectively very WRONG.\n\nThat said, Hrant may turn out to be justified that what he is concerned with is very valuable, indeed more valuable than supposedly informative handwritten forms; who is to say what people will say of him in 500 years' time and good luck to him?\n\nI admire anyone who can draw a beautiful form with a pen. I admire Hrant because of his enterprise and boundary-pushing. If Thomas Edison walked into a bar, most of us would want to buy him a drink. Even if Hrant never has a breakthrough like that, one can't criticise him for his ennui with the pen. The guy is restless, eager to innovate and just got bored with it all, that's all. OK so maybe he's a little churlish to keep saying, \"Michael, I'm bored with the very thing that you cherish.\"\n\nCumlivski: I can light a bulb by riding a bicycle: No fire involved unless I was cycling _away from_ a fire, then it may even burn brighter!\n\n"

It's interesting that you see a computer as an equivalent to the pen. I'm not even sure when a pen became a pen and stopped being a stick.\n\nFirst, maybe I'm being naive when I say this but, the fact that certain letters are certain shapes is, for me at least, nothing more than an 'accident'. You can see this by the way two (phonetic) written languages with similar sounds may have completely unrelated shapes to describe them, e.g. Hebrew and Latin.\n\nNext, I think therefore that the skeleton of an individual letter (I'm not talking about stress or serifs or angularity or anything else) is arbitrary; that is to say, it ought not to make a difference if it had been initially described with a stick, with a pen or with another (equally) effective method of leaving a mark on another material.\n\nIt logically does not follow to say that the best method of designing a character must be driven by what someone's pen (or stick) did hundreds and thousands of years ago on a sheet of wax/papyrus/paper/a tree/a cave wall or whatever. That would be like saying to an aeroplane designer, don't forget that one of the first methods of crossing a large expanse of water involved carving out the trunk of a non-porous tree (forgive me if my nautical history is hazy). Technology is continually evolving. Don't try to tell me that Boeing think that several logs tied together with twine is even remotely useful when designing the next generation of hyper-efficient airliner.\n\nAn A is A-shaped. That the 'pen' was responsible for the skeletal shape itself is like attributing the _content_ of this post to the 'personal computer'. On one level, of course, it's perfectly true but not very meaningful.\n\nSo answer me this, which came first; writing or the pen?\n\nHrant, don't go! Surely not even you are saying that an A can be a different shape from an A. That's what an A is!\n\n"

The reason for this is simple: when it comes to the _purpose_ of type (not necesarily the same thing as why a given person makes type), which is to be read, we don't read the black bodies, we read the contrast between black and white. A tool that marks the black imposes a dysfunctional design constraint: a relationship between the two sides of the black; the relationship should be only between the black and the white - we must design the border, not the body. This is true even if one is \"minding the white\" when making the black; the pointless constraint remains, no matter how hard we try. In the worst case -like a font made directly from calligraphy- it becomes a master-slave situation; in the best case it's still an unequal marriage, thus non-ideal.\n\nThe shedding of the illusional \"skeleton\" concept is the key that lets type be more than merely where it came from - which btw is not just the pen, but a host of other marking methods, some much older than the pen. The pen is simply what has come to look prettiest to the greatest number of people, becoming crushingly mainstream, and thus elevated to a mythical stature, holding us back. We are worshiping a corpse.\n\nSomebody who refuses to see this (which is not the same thing as making non-chirographic fonts - I myself am still stuck on the black!) is generally simply afraid of what it implies about his body of work, or maybe of what it implies about his adored teachers.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, are you seriously suggesting that the traditional, received form of, for example, a letter A, is based on the remainder of the white space once it's been 'adulterated' by black? I always thought it was to do with 3 straight lines, to a greater or lesser degree. (I am open to being persuaded otherwise, by the way.) I'm not sure I warm to my methods of construction (whether or not they were influenced by the pen) being described as illusional (delusional?) but I do like your willingness to get out of the box that you perceive and to challenge the way people think if you sincerely think they've been hoodwinked, as long as it's not because you just don't like people, which is how it sometimes comes across to me at least.\n\n"
