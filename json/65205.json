How can I do that?\n\nI use FontLab Studio 5.\n\nThanks a lot!  \nSorry for my english!\n\nStefano\n\n",

      "content": "Piece of cake.  \nYou _do_ need to add some OpenType magic to the font, though.\n\nUsing 'liga' code for ligatures:\n\n`feature liga {\n # Latin\n   sub T e s t by T_e_s_t;\n} liga;`\n\nIf the program you are using supports ligatures, typing \"Test\" will automatically be changed to my quick-and-dirty \"Test\" glyph:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110527132809im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ligatures_4216.PNG)\n  \n(Left is Ligatures Off, right is On.)\n\nOf course, you are free to use any of the other OTF features, if you don't want to mess with 'standard' ligatures (e.g., put them in a stylistic set or in 'calt' -- contextual ligatures). Use the Opentype feature preview in FontLab to check if it works.\n\nI don't think the sequence \"mblogo\" could pop up in the middle of a regular English word. However, if you need to use a phrase that _can_, either don't use ligatures (as these are usually 'on' for all text), or check the OTF Feature File description on how to limit it to a single word. (Sorry -- can't recall, altho' I used to be able to recite it from memory.)\n\nIt is considered 'proper usage' if your new glyph name is composed of the singular characters that make it up, separated by underscores. I think this is best seen in PDFs; selecting and copying the \"Test\" glyph yields the _plain text_ \"Test\" again. You can also search a PDF for 'test', and it'll find both variants.\n\n"
