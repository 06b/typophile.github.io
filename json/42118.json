I knew what artslons meant and this place is all about efficient communication. Sometimes that’s offensive.\n\nNot everyone’s first language is English. Should we ignore posts for bad definitions/nomenclature/grammar/syntax? I don’t think so.\n\nYes ’SPQR’ is pretty ’efficient branding’ isn’t it. ’Gladiator’ had it tattooed on his arm and I thought, rightly or wrongly, “that is great branding”.\n\nCome back if you find out where the logo/escutcheon is from. I’d quite like to know.\n\n"
