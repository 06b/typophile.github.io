I even checked the free-font archive, DaFont, to no avail. Finally, I did a little tweaking on the file so that I got the letters black on a white background, and put it through MyFonts' [WhatTheFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110024925/http:/www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/), which yielded the answer. Once I saw what the font was, I understood why I couldn't find it with the proper keywords -- FF fonts typically don't have any, probably because they're relatively new to MyFonts, and there are a ton of them. Probably also because they're spending too much time on things like [Olympukes](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110024925/http:/typographi.com/000894.php), but we won't go into that here.\n\n"

Know whether it is original or copied and re-named. If it's a rip-off you should shun it like the plague.   \n   \nThen I would say you should see if it has design consitency. Are the letters the same height that should be? Are the strokes of the letters properly executed. Are the letterforms related in their shapes and the way stems intersect? Are the serifs appropriate-looking? Is the x-height consistent?   \n   \nThe last part is subjective and can over-ride the previous considerations at times: Do you like the way it looks when you use it in words? Are the letters spaced the way they should be? (Poorly designed fonts often don't have much letter-fitting or kerning done.) Is the lettering reflecting a strong style in a way that seems original, or is it just like 50 other fonts that use a similar gimmick, like square counters for a 'tech look' (blecchhh!).   \n   \nThose are some of the thoughts that go through my mind looking at a free font for the first time and trying to decide whether it's worth downloading, even at that price. To me if it's garbage, and I won't use it, what difference does it make if it's free?\n\n"

I think it's exceedingly rare to find a fully developed text font for free, with all the bells and whistles. It's different if you just need a few words.   \n   \nAlso consider how the font looks at various sizes. If it's well proportioned it should hold up at both small and large sizes. But again, depends on your usage.\n\n"

Check out Meade's huge [Street family](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110024925/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/n_s.htm) for an example. Most of the fonts in the family have 88 kerning pairs. These are pairs of characters coded within the font for custom spacing relative to each other. It's a time-consuming process and one way to check on quality. 88 is on the low end, but most free fonts have none. Character sets are full in the Street family.   \n   \nAlso see the incredible output of [Roger White](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110024925/http:/www.rogersfonts.org.uk/index.html). Kerning pairs vary from about 300 to 900-plus. Character sets are complete. The Sudbury family would be a good one to check out.   \n   \nAnother incredible free offering is Igino Marini's [Fell Types](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110024925/http:/www.iginomarini.com/fell.html).   \n   \nOh, and of course there's [Storm's Lido](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110024925/http:/www.stormtype.com/free.html).   \n   \nNote that some (all?) of these font families are free for noncommercial use only.\n\n"

It looks like a very nice typeface, and I have just downloaded it.   \n   \nHowever, in reference to Mike F's recommendation of Roger White's fonts, I have to say that browsing the collection showed a lot of heavily 'inspired' fonts. Sudbury, for example looks remarkably similar to Les Usherwood's fonts, especially 'Lynton'. Yes I see some differences, but the character of the font is not original, in my judgement. Many other fonts on his site also seem like re-named re-interpretations (to give the benefit of the doubt) of other exisiting fonts.   \n   \nFor me to be impressed by free fonts, I would like to know that they are really original work.\n\n"

      "content": "So it is.   \n   \nI notice you apparently edited out your following question about the ethicality of digitizing typefaces. Even though the question is gone, I have thought about this a lot, and since I raised the issue with my criticism, I would like to state my own personal position on it.   \n   \nI think a digitization is ethical if the typeface design is no longer the property of the designer or the foundry that issed it (in other words, a revival of an old typeface). If an authorized digitization exists of a newer typeface, such as those of Usherwood's Caxton, then digitization under a new name is unethical, in my view.   \n   \nSo what about the common practice of imitation of a successful design with an 'interpretation' or 'adaptation', or whatever other euphemism you choose? You can say it happens all the time, even among well-known foundries, and has throughout the history of type. I still would call those instances unethical, but because of the ridiculous copyright/patent issues regarding typefaces, they would not apparently be illegal.   \n   \nIf two designers revive the same typeface under different names, I guess it's up to the user's decide which is better and how much to pay for them. Neither should be worth as much as an original work, in my opinion. Alternate characters, kerning, and the fidelity and quality of the letterform renderings would all be factors in deciding which I would consider to be the best.   \n   \nMaking a few alterations to someone else's design and calling it yours is also unethical. That seems obvious.   \n   \nCombining elements of various other typefaces to create a 'new' typeface is a bit 'gray', but seems basically dishonest if it is represented as something new and not a hybrid of other designs. Nick Curtis tells you when he does this, and that I can respect.   \n   \nDoes that cover all the bases?\n\n"

      "content": "Well, Mike Y., when I discovered Mr. White's body of work some time ago, I knew that it would be questioned somewhere down the line. It's a reasonable thing to do under the circumstances � as long as one doesn't yell, \"Pirate, Ripoff!\" in kneejerk fashion without knowing all of the facts. Your moderate, tactful approach is appreciated (and quite rare here).   \n   \nI had questioned the legitimacy of these fonts myself and chose White's Plymouth � a digitization of Abbott Oldstyle � as a test font to query the man about.   \n   \nI saved his response for just such an occasion:   \n   \n--- R. White Quote ---   \nMy fonts have all been developed from the sample books and in some cases wooden blocks found in the attic of The Benhill Press, a local printing firm in Rugeley, Staffs, England. The sample books, trays of metal type and hand carved wooden blocks were used on very old fashioned printing presses up to the mid 1990's when the company finally succumbed to modern technology.   \n My part in it was to convert some of the less common typefaces from hot metal to electronic versions. To this day there are at least ten of my fonts which, as far as I know, are the only source of electronic versions, fonts such as Rosart, Fry's Ornamented etc.   \n My method was simple. I had printed, by Benhill Press, several thousand sheets of paper with a 1 millimetre grid on it printed in pale yellow. Every character in every font was hand drawn onto a separate A4 sheet of paper. The grid enabled me to get the correct proportions for each character. When the set was finished I photocopied them, and because yellow does not copy on a photocopier I was left with a clean image on a sheet of paper. In the early 1990's, when I started this work, 600dpi scanners were the best available, and each character was scanned as a bitmap. These were then imported into a package called Type Designer which was developed in Germany by Manfred Albracht. Bear in mind also that Windows was still in versions 1 and 2 and multi-tasking hadn't really taken off at the time. Having imported the characters one at a time into the font the outlines were cleaned up by hand before the fonts were generated. Hinting and kerning pairs were then added manually to fine tune the resultant font.   \n The sample books at Benhill Press only identified about 50% of the font names so often I didn't know what I was working on. When I was working on wooden blocks I had to think in reverse because I was looking at the block which produced the printed character rather than the finished character itself. I named all of fonts that were not identified, Plymouth being one, after British towns and Cities.   \n Four of my fonts, Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham were developed from standard fonts but included the accented characters which are used in the Welsh language, but which are not included in the ISO character sets.   \n Benhill Press was established in 1876 in the town. The books which I worked from had been prepared in the 1950's, and many of the typefaces had been in use for many years before that. The books were all at least 40 years old when I started my work and you also need to bear in mind that there are differences in copyright laws between different countries. Generally, in Britain, copyright on a design expires after 25 years, so none of the designs which I worked on could possibly have been still in copyright.   \n   \nSo there you have it. Best wishes, Roger White   \n-- End R. White Quote --   \n   \nThat still leaves us with Sudbury/Caxton � a relationship I was ignorant of. The digitizations of the two vary in many respects. I certainly don't believe Sudbury to be a renamed Caxton. Surely a portion of my own ignorance was at work in this case. Quite possibly others of these fonts are in the same boat.   \n   \nThere's a disparity between Mr. White's statement that, \"The books were all at least 40 years old when I started my work\" and Linotype's date of 1981 for Caxton. The Linotype and MyFonts entries infer that Caxton is an original design by Mr. Usherwood. Does anyone know if this is the case � or is Caxton an interpretation of an older typeface? Can anyone from Britain confirm that 25-year design copyright expiration? Does it apply to fonts?\n\n> * * *\n> **quote:**\n> \n> Does that cover all the bases?\n> \n> * * *  \nI think so. You even covered the offenses of some major foundries � Monotype being an egregious example in the not-so-distant past.   \n   \nI've brought up these major foundry offenses here before. Offenses that were willful and resulted in fonts that brought in lots of money (the entire point in creating them). The topic yields total silence from the elitists here. And yet a minor character few people know about, who digitized a few fonts and gives them away for free offends (it appears � and likely out of ignorance) and the cry goes out (I'm not speaking here about this particular thread). Hypocrites! If I had to choose between a major type foundry, say Monotype, and Roger White in a battle of character and ethics, it would not be a tough choice.   \n   \nThank you, Mike, for the well thought out statement of positions. I agree with pretty much all of them. Hopefully, I've not offended you too much with my own offshoot. I'm truly capable of your tact, but not here. The elitism and hypocrisy is just too thick. Yves not long ago denied any elitism and I laughed aloud.   \n   \nNot a single comment on those splendid Fell Types. Of course not. They're free. They must be bad, bad, bad. 'Nuff said.   \n   \nObviously, I'm burning my bridges in this forum with this thread (Hey, I just heard several sighs of relief!). I've made myself a pariah � mostly by voicing occasional dissent. It's not tolerated here.   \n   \nTrust me nonposting lurkers here, there are gray areas of font copyright/parentage that are entered into by font makers at all levels. In this forum, however, if that font maker reaps an income from the font, attends typographic conferences, is a known name in the design field ... well, such an incursion is overlooked. Nary a word is said.   \n   \nIf, however, a font maker opts to offer the font (an equivalent incursion into that gray area) for free ... well, he/she is beneath contempt. The font maker and the poster are asses. Posts and links within them are deleted.   \n   \nThink Nick Curtis here. Not the likes of Southern Software with their \"1500 (Renamed Commercial) Fonts\" for $15. See Mike Yanega's statement of positions again if you're confused.   \n  \n\n"

In the not-too-distant past, people paid an arm and a leg for typesetting (got their money's worth in terms of quality). Now the client assumes typesetting is part of the designer's job, and included in the fee.

I know perhaps we have gotten a tad off the 'Type Identification Board' topic, but those issues are ones we all have to deal with and make our own judgments about.   \n   \nThe information about Roger White's fonts is interesting, but it does seem to leave some questions about the originals he was working from. As you say Caxton isn't as old as he stated, unless Usherwood arrived at Caxton in the same way Roger White did, by digitizing something older. In the 'Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces' it says: \"Design prepared originally for Typesettra Ltd in Toronto, a design studio owned by the late Leslie Usherwood (1932 - 1982). Rights in the typeface were assigned to Letraset in 1981.\"   \n   \nI don't know how the typeface exists in England in metal form before that period, but maybe there is an explanation. I am also more intrigued to review the other White fonts and see how they match up with other typefaces historically. I know there was a Baskerville, and this can be a valid revival, but I prefer revivals to use the original name, so that we know what they are based on.   \n   \nAnyway, once more, I echo Yves words _\"don't you go anywhere Mike\"_.\n\n"
