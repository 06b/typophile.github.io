I’m not sure if I did.  \nWhat was totally weird or profoundly unusual was the person wanting the ID was offering a $25 reward.\n\nVLLG Traitor was suggested—close but not it.\n\nAnyways I found it the exact match:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100807040400im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FontNeeded_6030.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100807040400im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sample_boback_6323.gif)\n  \n [http://baselinefonts.com/launch/introducing\\_boback-5.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100807040400/http:/baselinefonts.com/launch/introducing_boback-5.html \"http://baselinefonts.com/launch/introducing\\_boback-5.html\")  \n [http://baselinefonts.com/launch/contact\\_us/index.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20100807040400/http:/baselinefonts.com/launch/contact_us/index.php \"http://baselinefonts.com/launch/contact\\_us/index.php\")\n\nBaseline’s website is all messed up. I’m not sure of the font is called Jamiroquai or Bobeck.\n\nAnyway. There it is.\n\nahahahah!\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\nPS... I am not even sure if anyone else got it right. Oh, well, just being thorough.\n\n",
