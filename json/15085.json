Many style guides focus on standards of writing instead of production. Here are a few:\n\n[The Economist journalist style guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131142707/http:/www.economist.com/research/StyleGuide/)\n\n[Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina Corporate Style Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131142707/http:/www.bcbsnc.com/inside/style-guide/)\n\nLinks to [various sites using style guides](http://web.archive.org/web/20150131142707/http:/tc.eserver.org/dir/Style-Guides&skip=0) or information on starting a style guide.\n\n-------------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style guides!\n\n"

I don't know if you're designing a magazine, if so, go down to your local bookstore and purchase an armful of magazines and study the layouts, grids, etc. I am not suggesting plagarism, or copying, but studying and learning. There are also a number of good books out there on grids, and grid systems, but none that I know of that deal exclusively with magazines.\n\n"

This allows lots of different text column widths for features and departments, while also allowing white space to be managed in a organized way.\n\n"
