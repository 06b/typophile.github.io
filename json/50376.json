I’m not sure if those (the jewel boxes) were coloured as well, but if not then they definitely had coloured inlays. Some of the colours I’m sure they had are yellow, orange, red, blue, lime green, black & white (probably also pink & purple). The digipaks also came in plain cardboard.  \nI know I haven’t given much to go on, but that’s pretty much all I can remember about the site (which is also why I’m having so much troubles finding it).\n\n"
