      "content": "There are a couple of different ways to encode Supplementary Plane characters in fonts.   \n   \nThe very latest version of FontLab (4.6) has a mechanism to write the appropriate format of cmap table; this mechanism obliges you to _name_ glyphs using their Unicode 32bit scalar value, e.g. u20050. When generating the font, FontLab will read these glyph names and write the appropriate cmap table entries. Note that I have not tried this myself.   \n   \nAlternatively, you can pass your fonts through Microsoft's free VOLT tool. VOLT is intended for adding OpenType features to a font (and you may need to add at least one feature: I've never tried passing a font through VOLT without adding any features), but it also rewrites the cmap table. In VOLT's Glyph Edit window you can assign and edit Unicode values for individual; note, however, that in VOLT you need to use surrogate pairs for Supplementary Plane characters, not scalar values.   \n   \nYou will probably find this [scalar\\<-\\>surrogate convertor](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123301/http:/trigeminal.com/16to32AndBack.asp) useful.\n\n"
