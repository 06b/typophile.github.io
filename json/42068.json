Surf to [Unzipped](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220041004/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=272), declare your love for a FontFont (only FontFonts apply!) and win a full official license to four (4) weights in OpenType format of that FontFont (for example Regular, Italic, Bold, Black). This love declaration can take any form you like: a poem, an image, a short text, whatever you feel like creating. Just make sure that I don’t have to do anything to post your entry in the gallery which will be appended to [this post](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220041004/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=272) (see technical details below). The best/most original/most beautiful entry wins.\n\nThe contest starts now and ends tomorrow (Friday) night February 15th at midnight. But there is one catch — we want at least sixty (60) submissions or the contest is void, annulled, nihil, zilch, nada. Fortunately you can enter up to three (3) submissions, so in theory if twenty very motivated people compete we’re good.\n\nThe contest is open to anyone, FontShop customers and non-customers alike, students and professionals, men and women, straight and gay, all races, all religions, no restrictions, no boundaries. So get busy in the name of love, you’ve got a little under 48 hours! And remember — sleep is highly overrated. ;)\n\n**Procedure**\n\n**Send me an e-mail** (unzipper{at}fontshop{dot}be) with “Valentype” and the name of the FontFont in the subject line. Include your name and address in the message and your love declaration in attachment.  \n**Poems or short texts** should be saved as text or MS Word format.  \n**Typographic art or design** must be saved for web (_Save for Web..._ command in Adobe Photoshop) as JPEG High Quality RGB image, measuring exactly 440 pixels wide and minimum 100 to maximum 500 pixels high.  \nThe file name must read “YourFullName\\_FontFontName” (plus the file extension of course). Substitute “YourFullName with your actual name (no spaces) and “FontFontName” with the name of the FontFont you covet.\n\n",
