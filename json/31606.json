  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI've been trying to post a new topic, but I've been having some problems attaching my file. I've made a new font & even though there's nothing new to it, I do like the outcome. Now my question is if it's actually worth kerning (since there's nothing new to it & I really dread the process of kerning) & if so if any of you have any tips on kerning?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [NewFont.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123111715/http:/typophile.com/files/NewFont.gif) | 14.43 KB |\n| [TextExample.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123111715/http:/typophile.com/files/TextExample.gif) | 3.04 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Please show us some text set in it or better still, show us how you think it might be used if not for text. It's hard to critique a face outside of a context. I think there are some fixes to do before kerning. Maybe not too. Seeing how you plan to space it matters too - spacing and shape relate to each other. It seems a little wide in your sample. Or have you just not thought about that aspect yet? It does seem like it's worth going after a bit more even if it just ends up just being a learning experience. You can't know if it will go 'all the way' yet. And I think that's okay. The style is a good one to be working on just now it seems.\n\n"

      "content": "- Why not connect the dgbqp to their vericals sooner so the counter shape is less completely round?  \n- A related point the joins on those same letters & the joins on the rnm seem a little clotted or heavy  \n- The m & w seem overly wide to me. I am not suggesting a big change - just a small one.  \n- The k feels awkward to me.  \n- The ascenders are so short they are beginning to a little cramped to my eye.  \n- the h seems odd with one leg lifted like that. Why is it like that?  \n- The weight is at the top & bottom rather that the two sides. Is that because the face is so geometric & you have not accounted for the illusion that creates? Or is it on purpose?  \n- The counter on the 4 seems small.  \n- The 3 needs to be reworked. It feels awkward.  \n- The paces between words seem too big and the kerning between letters seesm too tight.  \n- The dots on your puntuation are too light.\n\nI like the way your s seems to be top heavy & yet balances. I ca't tell if it's going to be okay in the long run yet since there is no PDF but if you can carry it it could be a nice feature and point of difference with other fonts of this kind. I suggest setting more text with it and seeing what combinations are uncomfortable. If you want I can send you some pangrams to try. In general though it is holding together nicely. I like the size of the opening on your c. It feels just right. I really like your y. I would try to be sure that other glyphs fit nicely with it litterally and in terms of matching it's 'feeling'.\n\n"
