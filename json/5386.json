The subject of the photo was late, or getting his make-up done, and I stood in so the photographer could check the lighting and kept the Polaroid. I thought it might make a good pic for Typophile, but when I cropped it, it struck me that it looks just like a publicity shot. So I autographed it. :-)\n\n"
