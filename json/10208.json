That page is already 2/3 full, and thus the (long) footnote runs over by 7 lines. Thus the very last page consists of nothing but the 7-line run over. There are only 9 pages (10 with the run over), so I can't realistically run the other pages long without it being obvious.   \n   \nAny ideas?\n\n",
