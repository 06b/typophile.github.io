  "content": "Can anybody please help? I have written 3 books for screen reading using Geneva as my preferred font, originally on OS9, later in OSX but in Appleworks 6. That program allows Geneva as a screen font, and enables Bold / bold italic as options.\n\nNow I'm trying to export this as a DTP layout into Pages, and find that Bold Geneva does not exist in the OS, and that, somehow, these more modern programs refuse to 'fake' it. Am I missing something? Did Bold Geneva exist under OS9? (Of course my Intel Mini refuses anything to do with OS9.)\n\nHow then is it possible for Appleworks to fake it under OSX, but no other program?\n\nI know that I could reset the whole 90 chapters in Verdana etc., but I have always preferred 12 pt. Geneva for simplicity of reading.\n\nI have failed to find any way of downloading a Bold (etc.) suitcase.\n\nHelp please.\n\nThanks GS\n\n[gs@topartists.co.uk](mailto:gs@topartists.co.uk)\n\n",

Carbon was a workaround devised by Apple to make sure there were lots of apps for OS X when it was first launched. Older programs could be updated to work with OS X by simply recompiling to Carbon, instead of starting over from scratch.\n\nPages is built with Cocoa, the \"native\" OS X API, which generally doesn't do fake type effects. You can tell when an app is Cocoa-based if it includes the system-wide \"Fonts\" window for choosing fonts, as in Pages.\n\n"

      "content": "You could get an effect similar to a pixel shift in Pages by using the shadow effect in the Font window. Set the angle to 0°, drag the opacity to 100%, and the blur to 0. Then adjust the offset as needed. The resulting effect could be set up as a style, or you could redefine the \"Emphasis\" style using this psuedo-pixel-shift effect. It works okay if you save as PDF for viewing on-screen, but has a double-strike appearance if you print it on a laser printer.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120108082316im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PagesScreenSnapz001_5519.png)\n\n"

And by about a thousand other things Apple’s horrible UI designers have done with the operating system. It’s still better than Windows, but the people responsible for arbitrarily dumbing down Apple’s software need to be run out of Cupertino on a rail. Hopefully Google’s OS on netbooks will do enough damage to Apple’s netbook line that Jobs starts taking software design seriously again.\n\n"
