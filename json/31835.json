      "content": "The two closest typefaces I can think of would be Verona (Stephenson Blake, 1948 - but based upon a 1904 typeface) and Motto (Morris Fuller Benton, 1915).\n\nVerona is the best, but the only digital version I'm aware of was made by Mike Allard back in 1992. His fonts are [collected at TypOasis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404125933/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/denada/dn1.htm). Unfortunately, when he sent his fonts to TypOasis, he seems to have forgotten his version of Verona - which he called RomeoDN (\"I think that’s all I've released... I haven’t been keeping good track!\").\n\nI'll send a copy of RomeoDN to Petra, who owns TypOasis. Hopefully, it will appear there before long.\n\nThere are two versions of Motto that I'm aware of. One is [Paul Lloyd's](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404125933/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lloyd/index.htm) Queen Empress. The other was digitized by Dan Solo and is available as Motto on the Dover [24 Calligraphic Display Fonts CD](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404125933/http:/store.doverpublications.com/048699502x.html).\n\nLastly, there's Ray Larabie's [Mikadan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150404125933/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/mikadan/). This is sort of a hybrid of the two typefaces. The advantages are that Mikadan is technically better made than the rest and more readily available.\n\n"
