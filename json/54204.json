  "content": "Hi,  \nYou may remember that you guys helped me design the \"Dorsol Plants for Seattle City Council\" logo a few weeks ago.\n\nI just posted the website yesterday. It shows the final version the candidate and his campaign manager approved. I think the white and shades of green look good set into the earthy color scheme.  \n [**Dorsol Plants website**](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821073413/http:/dorsolplants.com/)\n\nHere is the website of one of young Mr. Plants' opponents:  \n [**other candidate**](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821073413/http:/www.bloomforcouncil.com/meet_david_bloom.html)\n\nMr Bloom has a long resume, but the graphic design kind of sucks, don't you think? He doesn't even have a proper logo, just the title set in Gill Sans. The welcome page isn't pleasant to look at...but maybe that's just me.\n\nThoughts?\n\nDina\n\n",
