I was however talking about the MSN Group (which I applied last week), and was not aware of that it’s the same people behind the two. I thought these groups were run by non-officials, not the people of Microsoft. Sorry if my topic sounded harch or something (it’s my bad english – it was supposed to sound humourous).\n\nNow I see however, that maybe my mail to Microsoft did it – I got approved for the groups :)\n\nMany thanks for that, and apologies.\n\n"

I'm a little concerned that since the page hasn't been updated for over four years it may have dropped into disuse.\n\nIf this is the case; can anyone recommend any other tools for checking the validity of a TrueType font?\n\nMany thanks for any help.\n\n"

[Apple ftxvalidator](http://web.archive.org/web/20120305231543/http:/developer.apple.com/textfonts/Fonttools/), which is part of the free Apple Font Tools suite for Mac OS X.\n4.
