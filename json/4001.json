This is a good way of judging the relative positions of different characters without drawing a bunch of guides.   \n   \nIn FL3, and again in FL4, I flip through the glyphs, and each glyph gets centered in the glyph window. This is good/bad. However, I've noticed that \\*sometimes\\* the left side-bearing does stay put between glyphs! I noticed that there is a tiny lock icon in the ruler at the top of the side-bearings and at the end of the baseline. Does this have something to do with it?   \n   \nI emailed Pyrus, haven't gotten an answer yet. I know, I know, rtfm. I did (skimmed really fast looking for screenshots of that little lock). Anyone have any ideas? (now preparing to feel really stupid)\n\n",

I especially like the fact that you're included \"hybrid\" figures and multiple sizes of caps (except maybe 3 sizes is enough - few people even notice this stuff anyway).   \n   \n\\* [http://www.m-real.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20050524123408/http:/www.m-real.com/)   \n It's square (which is nice), and printed on too-fancy paper (not nice), and the previous issue was called \"Black and White\" - right up my alley. The current issue is all color photos - deathly boring.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
