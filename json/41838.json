The walk-throughs I've found have all involved editing formulae and all sorts of wizardry that would be well beyond my client's office staff.\n\nNB, manual letterspacing is probably out as well. These are busy people!\n\nAnd of course, subject to the license I could modify the fonts for them, but I can't believe there isn't an easier solution if the glyphs are in the font already ...\n\n",
