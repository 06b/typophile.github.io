  "content": "I am currently workingon an identity for a company called Ready... Set... Dinner! (exclamation theirs - I'm not quite THAT excited). They recently changed their name from Ready For Dinner - (what a stretch). Anyway - for background - they are one of those places where you go and prepare like 12 entrees at a time (they do all the shopping, prep work and clean up) and you take home the 12 entrees to freeze and then pop in the oven - Since you made it yourself you know its fresh, \"homemade\", and adjusdted to your personal tastes (for an additional fee you can pay them to assemble the meal). Anyway - it is a new concept to our area (Louisvilla) and the owners already are ready to franchise into Chicago and a couple of other cities around here. I have attached their original logo and my first few drafts - let me know what you think. A couple of the elements (such as the chef hat in 2 or 3 of them) were requested regardless of cliche (but oddly enough among their competitors its about the only \"food\" symbol that hasn't been used.   \n   \nThe logos should be upbeat - the branding style will be coming along - already a couple of her competitors have latched onto A) the Williams Sonoma look or B) the kitchy 1950's I Love Lucy look - we will probably be avoiding those just for differentiation - so we are going for a more laid back look. They asked that I not focus on Ready...Set...Go as rushing or hurrying so clocks and speed were not part of the concepting   \n   \nLet me know what you think - A couple of them I am not sure about type arrangement in relation to logo and I am not sold on all of these fonts, but Its been in our office - but not in my worklog - (hmmm how nice is that) for a pretty long time (about 3 weeks) and the customer is aching to see proofs - so I will probably go with these for now, but would like some objective eyes on ways to tweak them in the next month or so...   \n   \n   \n1) Here is the original logo (only about 2 years old - I'm not sure who did this one)   \n   \n2) Trying for a kind of swooshy \"Panera Bread\" kinda thing - not really sure I like it   \n   \n3) This one would go with the tag line \"Meals like Magic\" It really is a leftover idea I had when we were batting around the name Abracadinner! But we liked the concept so here it is...   \n   \n4) This one is really a take on their original logo - keeping the chef hat, but bringing it a little more current in style. This one reminds me of a mayonase label...   \n   \n5) I think I like this one best - clean and elegant more my style, but maybe too WilliamsSonoma. However - the client did tell me her favorite magazine is Real Simple - so... It my fly... Any ideas on how to make the icon in the middle more obviously a switch to set an oven without going overboard?   \n   \n6) The customer asked for one that says Ta-Daa! I'm not really big on that concept but this is pretty close to what I sketched in my book - didn't flesh it out cause I think it won't make it past round one (shame on me)   \n   \n   \nThanks guys for any input....   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818051407im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41919.jpg)   \n ![RSD2](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818051407im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41920.jpg)   \n ![RSD3](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818051407im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41921.jpg)   \n ![RSD4](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818051407im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41922.jpg)   \n ![RSD5](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818051407im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41923.jpg)   \n ![RSD1](http://web.archive.org/web/20050818051407im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41924.jpg)\n\n",

It would look great on the side of a vehicle.   \n   \nBefore I read your explanation, I thought the icon was a timer (the word set could go either way, timer or oven knob). Maybe you could try using the negative space to create a slim white vertical line above the knob (showing the off position), then the knob (which I think usually turns to the left) would look like it was rotated from a set position, rather than a ticking timer.   \n   \nHave you tried a version where the icons are at angles. I realize it isn't as \"Real Simple\", but it might be worth exploring. Right now they look a little rigid, but the curves of the colored boxes is a good contrast.   \n   \nGood work.

I also felt like it might help if it was pointing at a temperature that was a little closer to where one would bake - in the other version it would be barely defrosting. Is that important or do you think the directional aspect of having the arrow help guide the eye through the logo outweighs that? Also - I didn't put a space after the elipse which though its wrong gramatically they felt it kept it together as one company name better so we're trying it on both ways, not sure where we'll land there...

      "content": "The real target market is soccer moms and the icons in number five are following the process. Mix it up (used the blue for that one because it is the stage where it is frozen), then cooking with the oven dial (warm orangy color for cooking) and then dinner - plate and fork - they want to really focus on getting the family back to the table - hence the place setting versus a steaming covered platter.   \n   \nThey want to show that the experience is hassle free - you don't have to shop, you don't have to prep, you don't have to clean - you just show up, mix the stuff up to your taste, take it home (frozen of course), bake it and serve. We found that showing any kind of representation of the taking the food home connotated delivery so we've kept the cars, wheels, bags, etc. out we also found that indicating anything about freezing visually made people think more of tv dinners which this is trying to get away from..   \n   \nThere also needs to be a sense of levity that cooking dinner doens't have to be a chore, but can be a rewarding experience one with a good deal of satisfaction.   \n   \npaul - originally I did have the plate in the middle with a table in the far right (or a smile with a yum-yum tongue) for that exact reason \"set the table\", but the two became redundant and nothing was showing the rest of the steps well. So set the table became set the temperature or set the oven and voila thats what we have. So the icons are Ready - get the dish ready by mixing the ingredients, Set - Set your oven at home and put it in, Dinner - enjoy the meal. And the concern over the oven knob is one that I already have - even with the tic marks does it still not get across the idea of setting an oven? Not necessarily a literal translation, but just the idea.   \n   \nDan - Sorry - I was asking about the retro type - were you just referring to the type in #2 & 3? What I call the I Love Lucy look? I'm not altogether sure about that font myself - especially with two big competitors doing the 50's kitch thing.   \n   \nNow the owners of the place that I work are both soccer moms - they are \"everyone's demographic\" - young, upper midclass, drive SUV's, very attractive, stylish, career oriented , the whole nine yards - and they \"got it\" (they weren't in on the concepting, but they do know what the company does).   \n   \nThere is also the question of differentation - since these ladies will be franchising this across multiple cities (louisville, chicago, maybe stlouis) in the midwest - it needs to be differentated well from the competition which have used things such as, steaming dishes of food, dinner bells, a single plate, 1950's kitch, etc. Oddly enough - the chef's hat is the only clic� that isn't used.   \n   \nEveryone is only commenting on number five - the owners might choose one of the others since this style may be too similar to others out there. Are the other two that up for consideration (magic spoon (3) and chef's hat with spoon(4)) just not worth sticking with - should I go back to the drawing board for those concepts? I personally like 5 the best because it is cleaner and I think conveys a more total message, but there is only so much you can really show in a mark.   \n   \nA lot of this company's story will have to be told through the branding process that just can't be summed up in a mark that is clean and simple - but I think that is the case with many companies the logo itself is the key to the personality and function of the brand but rarely can show the entire process...\n\n"

      "content": "Hugh -   \n   \nThanks for the detailed explanation about the co. . .   \n   \nI think everyone might be commenting on #5 because it is by far the most successful logo. Although the timer may not be instantly recognizable, IMO all of the images you are using in the \"boxes\" work well. I am not sure about the font, I would like to see you try some other choices; you also might want to think more about the color . . . I \"like\" the colors and I like the concept behind them but something to keep in mind is that blue is the \"least appetizing color\" (it seems that might be a bit magnified when used in combination with that shade of green) -- i would say the overall feel of the colors do not represent food/dinner/appetizing. They do, however, communicate the aspect you mentioned about dinner not being a chore . . .   \n   \nAbout #3:   \nI am just not sure about this one . . . reminds me of the television show Bewitched. Perhaps with a different font the overall logo would work better, i am not sure. I agree with Scott, just the spoon makes me think of soup.   \n   \n#4:   \nThis one is the weakest of the three IMO -- it looks very generic. Not crazy about the font . . . overall, this one just looks cartoonish, childlike.   \n   \nI personally thought the icon of #2 worked well (the next best after #5), perhaps you could try combining the feel of the icon of #2 with the concept of #4.\n\n"

The boxes would remain the same as they are currently. Anyway, it might defeat the simplicity that you have now.   \n   \nRE: Alternatives - I already voiced my opinion of #3, but #4 has potential. I think the thing that bothered me about it in the first place was the inconsistency of line quality�the border and hat have very smooth lines, but the type has rough lines. Sometimes this works for contrast, but I'm not lovin' it here. The color scheme is not working for me either.

It is the 3 icon idea and the box concept (the one that looks like a jar label)   \n   \nCustomer requests were to pump up the color a little on the 3 icon and she needs to see the tweaked oven dial - she's not sure she's sold on that being the middle one - she thought like I did and one other poster here that the plate could be in the middle and some sort of food at the end - I told her it felt a little redundant and she kinda understood that, but I may still need to show here a proof.   \nShe liked the typeface (futura) but wasn't sure about all lower case - I told here it made it feel infinitely less formal and accentuated the circular shapes that are echoed in the icons. I may still have to show her - I may also play with a similar font, but I really want absolute circulars to keep it open as well as echo the circles in the logo. Scott: the Chalet was an excellent suggestion I love that font as well! Might add a little more flavor while keeping it in the same feel or possibly kabel or avant garde I just need to look at them   \n   \nAfter seeing the concepts - her partner recalled seeing another logo similar to this on another sight (untrademarked) - it had been pretty poorly done, they felt, so they hadn't listed it with their competitors that I should look up - therefore - how suprised was I to find something similar to his already out there. The other logo is not focused on the process as this one is and is rather more \"homemade\" looking. They aren't sure if the logo will be franchised or not, but from the look of the site - it is probably a regional only company. The owners of teh company didn't seem too uncomfortable with the situation - they weren't sure it would be a problem, but I don't know if that is just because they want to be done with the process or if they really don't feel competitive with this other group. Our account rep for them feels like ours is different enough that we should go with it - and I do feel that with branding and style we will be differentiated enough that there won't be confusion which is the goal - but there is that \"pride and plagerism\" and honor among theives thing that I don't want to be ripping off someone else's logo. What are everyones thoughts about that?   \n   \nOn the second one they like it because of its similarity to their old logo and that it is different than any other one.   \nI am going to also play with fonts. Scott - I hear what you are saying about the smooth rough contrast, but a really want a fun feel to this one with type that almost feels like its part of a salad being tossed or ingredients being mixed - think Muppets' sweedish chef - but I may be off base there - gonna try spumoni and maybe a few others - I may hate them - any suggestions for something that will have a similar fun feel but may be a little more streamlined? also the colors will definitely change on this she felt it was a little too old feeling for her so we will try it in some brighter colors. Their colors historically have been blue and orange and they really would like to stay there - already have the floor and walls done in those colors and are building a second one with those specs - we had the conversation about a fesh coat of paint being a heck of a lot easier than trying to force colors that may not work for your branding down people's throats and she relented, but wants to at least give it a try.   \n   \nSo - there we are - going to work on those two concepts tonight and over the weekend. Thanks for all the help so far.\n\n"
