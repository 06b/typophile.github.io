My best suggestion involves two fonts: [Alternate Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828053618/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alternate-gothic/) for the letters except for the O, and then something like Chank’s [Nicotine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828053618/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine/) for the O. I picked that because it was one of the cheaper fonts I could find with that O shape.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
