  "content": "I have been converting fonts from PostScript / TrueType that I originally designed in Fontographer to OpenType fonts using Font Lab 5.0.4 MAC version.\n\nIn Fontographer, a CORRECT path direction is defined as having the outer contour or path of a glyph running clockwise, and the inside counters of a glyph running counter-clockwise. An INCORRECT path direction will result in the character looking heavy.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709155106im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pathdirection_6532.jpg)\n\nIt appears to me that FONT LAB has the paths running in the opposite direction from Fontographer. Is this true, or am I reading it incorrectly?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709155106im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pathdirections1_4611.jpg)\n\nDoes it matter which direction the paths are created so long as the counters run opposite to the outer contours? If so, which is correct... the way FONTLAB defaults, or the way FONTOGRAPHER says paths are correct?\n\nThis is a matter of curiosity AND I need to know before I go into over 700 glyphs to make sure they have correct paths.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRL\n\n",

If I select all characters and then select Contours \\> Paths \\> Set PS Direction, the contours which have changed are indicated by a black bar at the top of the affected glyph box. When I save the changes, the black bars disappear, as they are supposed to. But if I perform the same operation later, several of the previously-corrected glyphs show the black bar AGAIN, even though nothing has been done to the highlighted outlines in the interim. As I said: rather odd...\n\n"

After I asked the question, I did some testing... Generated a font in Fontographer as both a PS file and a TTF file. Looked at them, and the paths were different, but consistent in each font.\n\nI still wonder why FONTLAB would render PostScript paths in the opposite direction from what Fontographer calls \"correct\" path. Or am I just misunderstanding what those little arrows in FontLab are actually pointing toward?\n\nRL\n\n"
