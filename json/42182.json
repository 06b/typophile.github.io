My point is that the enduring popularity of the Avant Garde Gothic alternates has apparently inspired some modern designers to offer similar alternate characters. The Avant Garde alternate letters are about 38 years old, so if they are ’trendy’ then it’s proof of the cyclical nature of design tastes (and what happens when younger designers ’discover’ and appreciate the classic typeface designs).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

And I was here when those original buildings were new—ugh! Endless cyclical stupidity!\n\n"
