  "content": "Greetings, I am new on the forum and I am looking for this source since days ago. It is from a Star Wars comic “Jedi Quest” published by the editorial Dark Horse Comics in 2001, although they have also used the same font in many other series. I have looked and looked at hundreds of sources, but I do not find any similar. I would be very very grateful for your help.\n\n[http://img278.imageshack.us/img278/4827/starwarsjediquest02243fz.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102153956/http:/img278.imageshack.us/img278/4827/starwarsjediquest02243fz.jpg \"http://img278.imageshack.us/img278/4827/starwarsjediquest02243fz.jpg\")\n\n [‹ (x) IKKS / Reset Outerwear - Clarendon Ext / Lucida Sans, MS Trebuchet {George, Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102153956/http:/typophile.com/node/14926 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for typefaces similar to the Allianz logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102153956/http:/typophile.com/node/14923 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
