  "content": "Dear typophiles,\n\nI'd like to debut my last typeface called Mayonez, a serifed family that attempts to balance seriousness and friendliness. This type was thought for headings and big applications. I hope you like it.\n\nTake a closer view at [Behance](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212128/http:/www.behance.net/gallery/Mayonez/12663083) or purchase it on [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212128/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sardiez/mayonez/) and save 50% until January 5, 2014.\n\nBest wishes,  \nSergio Ramírez\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212128im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typo_poster_4649.jpg)\n\n",
