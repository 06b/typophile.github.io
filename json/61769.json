  "content": "Hi There,\n\nI've been asked to put together a corporate identity for a family friend. he's starting a new business and needs me to put together a complete corporate identity. As well as stationary, he's also going to need a brochure outlining service offering and website.\n\nAs far as layout and web goes thats something i'm very good at as i'm an artworker by trade. My weakest area is initial conceptual design, I need to come up with something professional, modern, clean, simple and friendly. This is my first concept and I needed some critique and advice to push me forward through the part I find most difficult.\n\nThe image added gives an overview of where I am at the moment, right now i'm struggling with using a mark or not. I want to stay away from cliche financial symbology and japanese influences. I want to kind of focus on 'growth' both for the company in terms of growing their business and the customer in growing their income.\n\nAny advice, inspiration and critique no matter how brutal would be very much appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201122802im_/http:/typophile.com/files/prosperity.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I think you've got a great start and the leaf and green certainly communicates 'nature' and 'growth'. The ultimate challenge will be in the quick viewer thinking this is an environmental or agriculture company. Blue is popular in banking because of the psychology of color and it being tied with 'trust' and 'integrity'.\n\nSuper Technical: In the top logo the stem is on the left which makes the leaf appear to go down and to the right. Not sure you want to visually imply that for a financial company. ;)\n\nAlso the reversed logotype and tagline in that option is way too small.\n\nOne tip if you haven't done this... turn off the computer and grab a pencil and paper. Sketch out a bunch of different directions this can go and then eliminate the weakest concepts until you're left with 2-3 solid solutions.\n\nBeautiful work so far!\n\n"

      "content": "If you are going to use a leaf (which i like, it breaks the mold of finance i think) direction is definitely important. Like the person before me says, the line of the leaf stem seems to be going downward.\n\nId flip the leaf horizontally, so the stem is gradually going upwards. This could represent even more growth, or moving forward.\n\nAlso, I agree that using a green leaf may initially cause viewers to expect an environmental company. But again, I like the idea of a leaf. There could be a few possible fixes for this, such as changing the color of the leaf. Making it a non traditional color could possibly disconnect it from the environmental image while still maintaining the strong leaf symbol. If that makes any sense. I hope it does.\n\nAs for the wordmark, I love the way it ties into everything. I think the text works well. Not completely organic, but it does seem somewhat friendly and free-flowing, while still maintaining the structure you might want as a financial group.\n\n"

With regards to the leaf vein you couldn't have been more spot on I should have seen that myself :) Making the changes you mentioned alone makes a huge difference as you can see in the attached image. I'm gonna thrash on with this to see how far I can take it.\n\nThanks again and if anyone else feels like leaving anymore inspiration feel free.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201122802im_/http:/typophile.com/files/prosperity_6124.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Simple, clean, and professional. Big improvement and by flipping the leaf you get people to read from left to right as it moves their eye up, which helps communicate the \"growth\" aspect you're looking for. You also have a subtle leaf shape repeated in the descender of the \"y\". You also see it rotated 180 degrees in the \"e\". Nice.\n\nCan you explain the meaning of the period at the end of the wordmark? Not sure what to think about it... part of me feels it distracts and grabs attention but it's just a touch different.\n\nPsychology of Color: Blue  \n\"Blue calls to mind feelings of calmness or serenity. It is often described as peaceful, tranquil, secure, and orderly.\n\nAsk people their favorite color and a clear majority will say blue. Much of the world is blue (skies, seas). Seeing the color blue actually causes the body to produce chemicals that are calming; but that isn't true of all shades of blue. Some shades (or too much blue) can send a cold and uncaring message. Many bedrooms are blue because it's calm, restful color. Over the ages blue has become associated with steadfastness, dependability, wisdom and loyalty (note how many uniforms are blue). People tend to be more productive in a blue room because they are calm and focused on the task at hand. Some studies are showing that weight lifters can lift more weight in a blue gym - in fact, nearly all sports are enhanced in blue surroundings.\"\n\nTell the client that is why you selected blue and you'll sound like a genius. ;)\n\n"

      "content": "The blue makes it look like a Gas flame.  \nLooks particularly like the one colour version of the British Gas logo.  \nBlue also conveys a cold feeling in my book. I also don't know anyone who has a blue bedroom. Unless they're six years old, and want it blue to support there team, or because they're a boy, and have a sister who's room is pink.\n\nIt also misses the fact that your graphic is a leaf, which grows.  \nProsperity is about the light at the end of the tunnel. The golden sunrise, a promising future. Sorry but the blue is way too cold to convey that, maybe try making it a hint more green. As we perceive money to be green.  \nI'm also unsure of the full stop.\n\n"
