  "content": "Hello fellow typophiles.  \nI really need some help specifying a typeface for a publishing project.  \nHere is an outline of the brief:  \nWe are compiling a book on British graffiti art for a UK publisher predominately for the European market, I want the design to be subtle, sophisticated and demonstrate a good understanding of type.  \nAs the content is very elaborate and of course about typography in its most abstracted sense.  \nThey layout and structure for the book is essentially like an art book.  \nSo I ’m NOT interested in ’urban’ or funky typefaces.  \nThe intention is not to over-design the publication merely frame the content in a serious and respectful manner.\n\nThe book is about 2 thirds photos to copy, it requires section starts, subheads, captions, pull quotes and body.\n\nNeither do I require it to be quintessentially British, so no Gill or Futura [although the pun was nice]\n\nI do like the idea of referencing the NY subway system [as it is the origin of modern graffiti] Akziden Grotesque is the closest I could find to ’Standard Medium’ it looks o.k for heading and subheads but not too hot for body or figures.\n\nSo far I have tried ’univers’ not helvetica [as I think never use it, I hate the uppercase R.  \nI have looked at the foundries below to no avail.\n\nProcess  \nVillage  \nAlias  \nLineto  \nThe foundry  \nFontSmith\n\nAlso it may be worth mentioning to you guys over the pond, I have set the grids including baseline to metrics because of ISO paper sizes [I’m not going to get to into why I think type should not be specified in imperial for a metric based production methods here] but if we could find something that has been designed with metric use in mind all the better, but not a deal clincher.\n\nPLEASE HELP!  \nI’m at my wits end, we have a meeting with the publisher at the end of the month and I want to go prepared.\n\nAny further questions feel free to contact me.\n\nI will credit the forum / site in the book.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nMr Brown\n\n [‹ Vi ligature](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123031943/http:/typophile.com/node/27547 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Fonts representing Old Italy? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123031943/http:/typophile.com/node/27353 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
