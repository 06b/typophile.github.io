CreativeHotlist might be a good spot for getting in touch with other agencies or corporate contract jobs. and AIGA LA might prove to be a strong resource (I hate designer socials, so I didn't try).\n\nbest of luck to you. your work is quite good, and the writing on your site should win over any sensible business person.\n\n"

I assume that you're a designer first and a businessman second. Most of the people you deal with will probably be business people first. This means that:\n\n100% of your clients will be honest, likeable individuals when you discuss their initial requirements.\n\n40% of your clients will need two or three reminders before they remember to pay up.\n\n25% of your clients will have a book keeper or accountant who goes on holiday for three weeks whenever you submit an invoice.\n\nOne or two of your clients will just refuse to pay.  \n(If the legal system in the US is anything like it is here in the UK, don't waste your time chasing debts. Either write the debts off, or hire someone big & scary)\n\n"

      "content": "Dan,\n\nCongrads on going out on your own in a new city. big challenge.\n\nAll the advice is good - most of it can be summed up as make lots of noise and eventually momentum will begin to work in your favor.\n\nCan I suggest that you take a little more strategic approach?\n\nSit down and figure out what your position in your marketplace should be - based on who you are, capabilities, where you succeed, what kinds of clients are you successful with and what do these clients look for in a design firm - that is for starters.\n\nAnyway, figure out what you can deliver on and who is an ideal fit. That fit needs to include who is able to appreciate your value and is willing to pay for it. Once you have a profile of the ideal client start researching your market to identify actual companies that fit your target. Create a database of these potential clients - call them, ask for who buys your type of service there - get name, title and phone number. no need to talk to them yet, just get info at this point.\n\nOK - now that you have an idea of your perfect client, a list of potential perfect clients and some free time on your hands ... begin to work out what value these clients are looking for - NOT what you have to offer, but what value they want. (If this does not click, get some books out on value oriented marketing etc.) Figure out that value - it may be different for each one or all the same. You gotta figure it out. if it is different for each, you may have been too broad in identifying your target. Keep it tight for starters - you can always broaden once you have some success under your belt.\n\nNow, you have your value identified, create a message around that value - tell them how you offer the value they want. this is your mantra. hammer it home. Any contact you have with them should communicate this value - phone calls, direct mail .etc.\n\nYou have a number of references here on self promotion and marketing, so I will not go through a step-by-step on that. The key here is:\n\nIdentify your target based on fit  \nIdentify the value your target wants  \nCreate messaging around that value\n\nMarch out your marketing machine. Unleash your campaign - and don't just rely on a one-off effort. Soften them up with a post card, make a phone call, get a portfolio review, send off a white paper that you wrote (make sure it is value oriented!) and book orders, baby!!!\n\nAlso, key - I am begging you not to sell on price. You live by price you die by price. No need to step on their neck and take advantage - that is wrong and bad business. but, charge a fair rate and get paid for the value you offer.\n\nGasp ... one last thing, I do not agree regarding earlier comments about business people not wanting to pay and 25% of them screwing you over. That may be someone else's experience, but it is like marriage and divorce - rarely is it just one side's fault. I \\*rarely\\* have a client that does not pay - rarely. We work with great people and we do great work. We deliver and they pay. Everyone is happy. Out of a million in sales this year I am out about $1,200 and that is because the company went under. Not bad odds if you ask me.\n\nOk, enough outta me - all the best Dan!\n\n--  \nMike\n\n"

They had to replace a line of text in a job, and didn't have the font Romic.\n\nNeither did I, but that didn't stop me! I bought the font from Letraset on a Mac disk, paid $40 to have it transfered to a PC disk, and used a PC to Amiga disk reading program to get it onto the Amiga. Then I converted it to an Amiga font with a PD utility (Amiga's had a utility for ANYthing back then) and I typeset the line of text they needed.\n\nThat was 1992. Today, we do over $20k a year business with that same (my very first) client.\n\nMoral of the story...\n\nGetting business means solving people's problems. You are never loved or needed more then when you are solving a problem for someone. All you need to do is let the world know what problems YOU solve. \\*HOW\\* you do this is the subject of many, many marketing and business books, but once people know you can solve \\*their\\* problems, they will come to you.
