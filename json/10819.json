The quizmaster (me, again) reserves the right to disappear for extended periods of time to undisclosed locations and may not be required to reveal his whereabouts during this time or upon his return. During such times, general anarchy may reign on this thread, which should be understood as a salutary opportunity to execerise individual and collective responsibility. New rules may be invented during this time by any participant, and may enter into force by majority vote or popular acclaim. The quizmaster (you know who) reserves the right to overturn such rules on his return, but has enough faith in the anarchist project to hope that this will be unnecessary. Dancing is, of course, permitted.\n\n"
