I signed-up to it last week per Jim Gallagher’s recommendation toward Font Validator, and have yet to receive a notification.\n\nIt appears this is the only way one can download the program - understandable, coming from MS.\n\nUnless anyone is aware of another validation tool? I use TTX.exe quite a bit, as well as TTFDUMP.exe, but to me these tools are not quite giving me the kind of feedback I’m interested in.\n\nAnd suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n [‹ Bible Centaur](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145354/http:/www.typophile.com/node/6588 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [There's a new SOTA in town ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145354/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34518 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
