  "content": "Ok, so the spreads we are working on use some hand lettering. We do not want the lettering to appear scratchy, wobbly, awkward, punk, etc. We would like the forms to be considered and resolved yet appear to be made using the hand. So here is my question:\n\nAny suggestions on what the the best paper and ink combination would be for the final drawings? We would like crisp edges and lines with no ink bleed in the scans. Currently we use Bienfang Graphics No. 360 paper and Micron pens. Is there anything better? Thanks.\n\n",
