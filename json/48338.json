I have looked through a bunch of rounded samples, and could not find any mixed versions like this...  \nany more help would be appreciated  \nthanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122112809im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/superstudio_3740.png)\n  \nSuperstudio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122112809im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/typ1451_5520.png)\n  \nTyp1451\n"

I have checked AG book rounded, Arial, Bryant, VAG, Superstudio, TYP1451... They are all nice, maybe now I am being difficult  \nbut it has made me realise how unique this spec really might be, the mix of rounded and right angles is really modern and not as soft as normal rounded versions...  \nhelp?\n\n"
