I found the choice of typeface to be quite interesting -- it seems to be an unusual marriage of Futura and Akzidenz-Grotesk.

      "content": "Unfortunately, don't have the answer, was not even able to find this poster online (sure about its originality?).  \nMainly because of single storey /a and cross-shaped /t, [AG Schoolbook](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/ag+schoolbook) comes to mind but that's far from it either. There's also [AG Old Face](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/ag+old+face) and [FF Schulbuch](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-schulbuch) but still not matching.  \nReminds me a lot of [this previous discussion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/typophile.com/node/95908) about 2012 edition of Whitney Museum Membership Calendar font. It was identified as Mike Gallagher's [Gross](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/mikegallagher.org/gross.html) which actually does not look like it at all... But the one from your sample and the one on Whitney Museum Membership Calendar looks pretty close, some kind of textbook/infant version of Akzidenz-Grotesk.  \nSome alternatives: [Mark](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/mark) FF, [Brown](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/lineto.com/The%20Fonts/Font%20Categories/Text%20Fonts/Brown) and [Circular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular) LL, [Galano Grotesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/rene-bieder/galano-grotesque) RB, [Zirkel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ondrej-kahanek/zirkel) OK, [Nanami](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415002007/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/nanami)\n\n"
