  "content": "Hey everyone!\n\nI'm embarking into uncharted territory and would love some help if anyone has experience or knowledge in this area. What I'm looking to compile is a list of the top 8-10 design or type related book publishers. This publisher would probably have to be in the United States, but I can still look into foreign publishers. I've been asked to help gather information that will hopefully lead to the publishing of an art book of sorts, filled from end to end with custom type.\n\nMy only find so far is: [http://www.watsonguptill.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110501072708/http:/www.watsonguptill.com/ \"http://www.watsonguptill.com/\") The obvious plan of attack is to hit the more design oriented bookstores, but I figured that I could throw this into the Typophile mix to see how you all feel.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
