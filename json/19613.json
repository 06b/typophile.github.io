I for one have never heard of that…  \nI having spent parts of my childhood and youth in former Eastern Germany, cannot remember a newspaper of that time with it’s body being set in sans, i also have held a few issues of Pravda in my hands, and these were set in serif cyrillic completely…\n\ni think that “the communists” - if you refer to the soviet union that is – were busy enough getting people in the vast rural regions of the soviet union to read at all, i.e. fight illiteracy, than being concerned with sans/serif issues.  \nEven more, under Stalins reign there was a clear tendency against modernism (as in the Russian Avantgarde of the 20s) towards neo-classical, almost reactionary forms in design, architecture, etc. As is perfectly examplified by the history of the Palace of the Soviets in Moscow. Under Stalins leadership a bombastic neoclassicism was established, especially in architecture. Most of the comminist leaders in the last century showed a scaringly bourgeois taste with a bit of megalomania thrown in…\n\n"

But your description gives the impression that these psychologists, and perhaps Bouma himself, believe word recognition to be centered on recognition of such shapes, ’rather than by identification of individual letters’, and this is not the case. Rightly or wrongly, the majority of cognitive psychologists seem to embrace the parallel letter recognition model.\n\n"

The reasons for this are ideological and nationalist, and also practical because it makes it easier to control what people read. Most of the North Korean publications I have seen are set in gothic (’sans serif’, low contrast, geometric) hangul types, but I don’t know if this is ideologically encouraged or simply an aesthetic preference.\n\n"

      "content": "_I must say that we can’t mistook legibility with readability. These are to separate things._\n\nThis is a common assumption among typographers, reflected in our use of terminology, but it may be begging the question. If the parallel letter recognition model is accurate, then there is little distinction between legibility and readability, at least at the level of type design. At the last Thessaloniki conference, I asked Kevin Larson and Mary Dyson how they, as psychologists, used the terminology. Kevin said he made no distinction between legibility and readability, although tended to use the former term, and Mary said she thought of readability as a document design and language issue, not a type design issue.\n\nAlthough we often claim there is an important difference between legibility and readability, the consequence of this is simply that typographers have largely stopped using the term legibility. We only talk about readability, because we think that legibility refers to something that isn’t very important.\n\n"

Partly it is, as you say Mary Dyson said, a matter of document design. If one uses excessive measure, small type, and zero leading, it is easy to produce a pretty unreadable but quite legible document, by the above definitions.\n\nI also think, though, that it is a matter of type design, and not only of how type is used. Most people find high contrast faces such as Bodoni at small sizes hard to read, even though they are perfectly legible. Similarly, italics, which are just as legible as roman are I believe even tested to read more slowly. Also all the ’optical size’ adjustments on the Adobe fonts have this function of enhancing readability. The larger optical sizes are perfectly legible at small sizes, they are just not as readable.\n\nCurrent widespread practice in type design will tell you that legibility is a requirement for readability, but it is not sufficient. If reading science hasn’t yet caught up with the advantages of the well estabished practice of optical sizing, for example, then it needs to work on it. Because they are not working on it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist.\n\nThe distinction is not question begging because it reflects people’s experience across a huge range of people and cultures. The distinction between display and text type, the greater readability of roman over italic, the hundreds of years practice of optical sizing, all these are facts. The task of science is to explain observations, not dismiss them.\n\n"

Now, as you say, the parallel letter view is generally accepted. Peter argues that this acceptance is a result of the ‘bouma shape’ view not being sufficiently developed.”\n\nThe first appearance of the term ’bouma shape’ in the psychological literature on reading is in 1983 and is to be attributed to Insup Taylor and M. Martin Taylor. Insup Taylor was part of the Division of Life Sciences at the University of Toronto, and M. Martin Taylor was at the Defense and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine in Downsview, Ontario, just outside Toronto.\n\nEarly researchers in reading identified ’whole words,’ ’word forms,’ ’total word forms,’ or ’word configurations’ as being the ’units of perception’ in reading.\n\nIn testing this ’holistic’ approach researchers relied on a concept of ’word shape’ that defined word shape as ’outer contour’or ’envelope structure.’ Another definition defined word shape as the raw pattern of neutral, ascending and descending characters. In these formalizations ’dog,’ ’beg,’ and ’leg’ have identical word shapes.\n\nWhen ’word form,’ ’total word form,’ or ’configuration’ are formalized in this way as a basis for empirical testing, it becomes clear that, as one researcher put it: “word shape is not in good shape for the race to the lexicon.”\n\nI tried to argue that the rejection of the ’holistic’ approach, and the concomitant ascendence of the view that letters are the ’unit of preception’ in reading, was premature because it based empirical testing on a poor formalization of ’word shape,’ and that Insup and M. Martin Taylor’s use of Herman Bouma’s letter-confusion data to define something they called a word’s ’bouma shape’ might provide the basis for a richer notion of ’word shape.’\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504031544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/%5D%5Bimg:)\n\n"

Another would be fatigue—meaning not only eye strain, but also just feeling tired of reading. I think there is a ’brain weariness’ as well as an ’eye weariness’.\n\nBy comparison, legibility tests would be eg. how quickly a letter is identified, and how easily it is confused with another letter. Because legibility and readabily would be tested in different ways, they are certainly different conceptually. To what extent legibility contributes to readibility or even subsumes it is a matter for testing.

Are the letters designed in such a way that we can readily make out their identities, or the identities of the words they make up? Are the letters designed in such a way that we can readily tell them apart? Mostly discussions about legibility have to do with thresholds. A highly legible type affords disrimination at larger distances, smaller sizes, lower contrasts, compromised illumination, against higher levels of background noise, with greater blur.\n\nIn discussions about whether the letters in a font combine well to promote rapid automatic visual wordform resolution, efficient saccade planning, a pleasant, perceptually effortless reading experience exacting low attentional resources, I tend to use readability. What we are used to plays a role, but there are also ’harder’ determinants like spacing and formal familiality or fit which play a role.\n\nHowever the epistemological status of concepts like legibility and readibility is such that the matters they evoke resist formalization and quantification.\n\n"

It was inferred that because of the way our eyes are constructed, and the ways in which people read with jumping eye movements, that serifed text is easier to read because those little finishing strokes to letters aid the eye’s progression from letter to letter, and improve reader’s differentiation of word shapes.\n\n“In contrast to this earlier research, our recent testing of documents shows that in the 1990s there is no difference per se in ease and speed of reading and consequent understanding between serif and sanserif letterforms.
