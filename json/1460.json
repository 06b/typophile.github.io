And is there a difference between plagarism and inspiration?   \n   \nAs the author of that design I can tell you that my starting point was the bumper sticker, \"if you're reading this you're driving too close,\" as well as a somewhat wittier ad I saw a couple of years ago (I can't remember where or for what) that said something about \"...if you noticed the poor kerning between the _e_ and the _r_ you must a designer. (Greg,if you recall seeing it recently as you say, let me know where, I'd love to see it again...perhaps they were inspired by the same sourse as I)   \n   \nSo, the question is, is it a total ripoff, or is it a new idea built on different ideas from the past?\n\n"
