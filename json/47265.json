  "content": "Good clean typography is a fundemental skill of any designer. Most designers believe they have good typography but in my experience it is something which is developed through time and experience. I think we all begin our design lives with a desire to be outrageously creative, and only as we mature, begin realise that simplicity and structure is just as, if not more important. In this article, I will go through some simple steps to acheive good clean well structured typography in Adobe Indesign.\n\nThe first step is to choose your typefont. In this case I have chosen a simple standard font of Helvetica Neue. I have set it up at 10pt size and 12pt leading. It is important to consider legibility at this point. I try not to go below 9pt for any brochure or printed material, but if the document is to be viewed digitally such as a pdf, it is worth doing it larger.\n\nNext choose how many columns you want the page to be. Here you must consider aesthetics and legibility. Columns are important as they help give the page more structure, but also make a printed document easier to read. Studies show that 8-10 words per line is the most legible and I have tried to reflect this by choosing a 4 column layout. Also, consider border dimensions and the space between the columns. It is common for the space between columns to be half of the border length. In my example I have chosen a 10mm border and 5mm between the columns. Already we see that the page is taking shape. As I have already said, I believe structure is the key to good typography, and these four columns and borders will provide the structure for the entire document. If it is a brochure it will help bring consistency to the whole thing. Images and quotes could should all submit to this grid.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/4-column-grid_4039.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/text-4-col_6327.jpg)\n\nSo we have set up a grid vertically, the next step will be to set up a horizontal or baseline grid, which all our text will stick to. This is a key factor to good typography and InDesign is a great bit of software as it has all the tools to makew this process simple. We have already chosen our leading (12pt) so we will set up a grid to reflect this. Go to the top bar menu InDesign\\>Preferences\\>Grid. This menu box should display.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/grid-setup_5138.jpg)\n\nStart the grid at 10mm in accordance with your borders. Type into the Increment Every box, 12pt in accordance with your type leading. Press OK. The grid is now set up, to make it visible, go to the top bar menu again, View\\>Grids and Guides\\>Show baseline Grid. You will now see guides running across the page horizontally at the same leading as your type. Now make your type stick to the grid. Bring up the paragraph display box, Window\\>Type and Tables\\>Paragraph. Select your type box and click on the Align to baseline grid button in the bottom right hand corner. All type lines should now stick perfectly to your grid lines. All further type we will insert from now on will also be made to align to this grid.\n\nNow we will add a heading. The key here is to set the leading up that it will align nicely to our already set up baseline grid. I have set my title at 95pt with a leading of 72pt. Basically I have made the leading to be a multiple of the 12pt our baseline grid is already set up to. This way each line can naturally line up with a line of the body text. The title size also allows it to sit nicely and not overlap at all. If the tops of letters such as h is hitting a lower curve of a g it can reduce legibility and also make it ugly. Don’t forget to click the Align to baseline grid button on the paragraph formating box again. Also select a text wrap so the text will not overlap the heading but flow round it. It should look something like this.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/add-title_5591.jpg)\n\nI shall now add an introduction paragraph in the exact same way. This time I will select 24pt leading, again a multiple of our 12pt grid. Align it to the grid and it should look something like this…\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/last_3511.jpg)\n\nAs you can see, everything is aligning perfectly giving the page a neat structured feel. In most cases I try to keep the alignment consistent, but in this case I have been a bit creative and made the intro and title right aligned to stick to the body text paragraph and give a crisp centre line.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/finish_4372.jpg)\n\nSo thats it, I have waffled on long enough. Hope you enjoyed this tutorial.Typography is a massive subject, and this article just includes some of the things that have helped me. Please let me know if it has helped you at all. What can I do to make it better?\n\n",

I’ve included a screen capture of the final grid. The layout grid, combined with InDesign’s underlying baseline grid aligns the type perfectly within each unit. I’ve departed from the treatise by using the x-height and baseline to size my grid unit. It’s a visual alignment that is far easier to do now than when the book was written. The gutter allows for a single line caption under each image. The final product is an 8 by 10 inch proof sheet for 35 mm images. There are many products on the market that do a far better job of making a proof sheet. I was working at an understandable example of the underlying structure. It’s somewhat complicated to explain how I set this up, but if there is enough interest, I’ll give it a try.\n\n-Bill Lomax\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Grid_5072.jpg)\n\n"

For anyone interested, I created a grid system for web work that incorporates a 10pt baseline grid.

      "content": "Hello Roger,\n\nWhat’s different about my sample grid is that it is specific to the body copy font. Helvetica Bold Condensed would be a horrible choice, but it works for this one task. If I substitute Garamond, it will not fit the grid correctly.\n\nThe short version of how is that you need to know the exact x-height of the font. Most commercial fonts have a UPM of 1,000. If your font has an x-height of 395 (Arno Pro regular), then at ten points the x-height is 3.95 points. My example row is eight lines deep. The height of a row is: 7x leading (12 pt) + x-height = 87.95 pt. The horizontal alley (gutter) is: 2x leading (12 pt) – x-height = 20.05 pt. Set Preferences \\> Grids \\> Baseline Grid \\> Start: 3.95 pt (x-height) | Relative to: Top Margin | Increment Every: 12 pt (leading).\n\nThen it’s a question of using the numbers to set up rows and gutters.\n\nYou can make a very close approximation of the x-height by turning an “x” of your choice of font, at size, to outline. Then ungroup it and use the Direct Selection Tool to draw a marquee around the “x”. Drag ruler guides to snap to the x-height and baseline. Measure the distance between and you have your number.\n\n-Bill Lomax\n\n"

      "content": "YOTS,\n\nThree isn't necessarily THE magic number, but rather a catchy reference to the old School House Rock jam. Anyway, the base three approach is essentially the same rationale as your base 5 or 10 system for web.\n\nSince there are 72 points in an inch, 12 points in a pica, six picas in an inch, etc., the math rounds out nicely. You need to be judicious with type, but the base three system can be quite effective at slaying massive, disorganized, beastly documents.\n\nImagine a newsletter that utilizes a variety of type styles: headlines of varying size, subheads, body copy, bulleted lists, bylines, and cutlines. Column widths aside, you can start by establishing body copy with, say, Adobe Garamond, 10/12. Pretty standard so far. Move on to small headlines: Trade Gothic Bold Condensed, 16/18. Large headlines: Adobe Garamond 36/39. Cutlines: Trade Gothic Medium 7/9.\n\nYou get the idea. The base three system is really no different than using any other baseline gridwork, just that it seems especially versatile. Actually, the sample grid system in this tutorial could just have easily used a three point baseline grid.\n\nDOGG : : :\n\n"

      "content": "The most important thing is to find a common multiple, whether using base 3 or something else. Always start with the text size, but if you need smaller captions, footnotes etc, you need smaller steps than 12pt. If your captions would be 7/8pt, you could use a 4pt baseline grid, if you need 7/9pt, a 3pt baseline is good.\n\nThe smaller you get, however, the more difficult it gets for the reader to discern the inherent discipline a grid brings. Based on multiples of 3pt, headlines have a lot of flexibility, more than you’d want for a newspaper. If you work in metric, remember that 3pt is just over 1mm – a grid unit that Müller-Brockmann et al would have considered to fussy. Sometimes it is easier to work with metric grids, especially as the page size would also be metric.\n\nUnfortunately for us European mm-heads, both Indesign and Quark quietly convert metric input for leading (which isn’t leading, but line-spacing) back to points and you end up with strange decimals in the menu. But you can ignore them.\n\nThe size of your baseline grid can help lining up type (and images), but it can also be a style issue. If your grid is coarser, increments will be more noticeable and the grid will become a design feature. working with a small common unit of line-spacing is like constructing a building with bricks: while they are too small to count, all the features (windows, doors, transoms, steps) of the facade are multiples of a brick, the baseline of the building, as it were. That gives it an honest, quiet authority that we seem to respond to. This also works with other materials, but like a coarser baseline grid, building with larger concrete slabs or glass panels would become more of a style than using those small bricks.\n\nThe space between columns also depends on the way you set text. If you justifiy (which i wouldn’t do for narrow columns with less than 35 characters) the type, the channels need to show more white than for unjustified text where only a few lines will ever make full measure. I never draw space between columns, but indent my text from the right, so i can adjust that space between columns individually. That way, i can also cheat and sometimes widen a column by a fraction in order to bring over the occasional word – widow or orphan. So far, nobody has noticed that little trick in any of the work i have done.\n\n"

Them go to the \"h\" box (height) and type \"10+25%\". You'll get a 10x12,5mm rectangle, because you told InDesign to calculate 25% of the hight and add it. That works in every unit, namely points in the bodies of typefaces and leading.)  \nImagine you set a 10/13pt text as a base text to build your baseline. For captions, deducted from it, you can calculate a leading ratio for the body of the caption, like 6/13-25%pt. This will result in a caption text 6/9.75pt and you be sure to align the grid in every four lines.  \nSummary: write down the units you want in the boxes: pt, mm, cm, p  \ncalculate by association 12+25%,12\\*1,25pt (multiply by 1,25, which is equal to add 25%), 12/2 (divide by 2), etc. You will see how helpfull it is.  \nHope it helps...\n\n"

Admittedly, it has a lot of shortcomings as it was built for a very specific task. That being said, I've since used it to set up grids for other print projects and it works well-enough.\n\nYou can see a bit of it on my website [www.sincerelyross.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411053852/http:/www.sincerelyross.com/ \"www.sincerelyross.com/\") (under Grid Generator)\n\nIt does essentially what is described above and is also based first and foremost around the choice of leading (thus typeface and size). One difference at this point is that it is not as concerned with the x-height, though I can see from Grid's comment why this might be a valuable thing to incorportate. It started out as a means to create totally proportional grids and page formats (according to Van de Graaf and Tschichold's analysis of traditional page models) though I have since added the ability to specify things like margins, page format, etc manually.\n\nI'll try to post back as it develops.

      "content": "I've read this thread with great interest but still struggling to work out how I can reconcile this with working in mm - it seems perfectly geared up to working with inches. I suppose like everyone using metric measurements as default, I'm looking a standard way of setting up documents in InDesign based on working with DIN-standard paper sizes, but keeping points as the units of measurements in the baseline grid and gutters ;o)\n\nTo me, 6pt baseline grids look like the way to go - I think there's enough flexibility there but visually I don't think there's enough visual structure in using less than 6pt. I just don't like full line paragraph breaks, I think the distance looks too wide IMHO.\n\nI reckon the best way seems be to set document sizes and margins(possibly?) in mm and everything else in points? To me this logically seems the best compromise. That would mean ignoring Picas though as 1 pica = 12points, I might as well set up a 6pt document & baseline grid in points not half-picas?\n\nI wonder if anyone can shed some light on how publishers in Europe handle this, given the amount of content they have to order and structure with DIN-page contraints.\n\nAnyone any ideas - is there a better way to do this?\n\n"

      "content": "Duckworth\n\nI guess it depends how happy you are working with different units, do you mind seemingly random values in mm when working in points/do you like to work to three decimals places etc. I don't think there is a way to reconcile DIN paper size with the point system exactly, no magic math as such, but you can make strong layouts with a bit of tolerance between the two systems. I usually do as you say and have the document set in mm and the type in points, I wouldn't worry about picas.\n\nIf you base your grid on metric measurements it will result in long values when converted into points, but really that's not a problem for a complicated job as you can quickly add these values to style sheets, save you typing them. It is possible to have atom splitting measurements in InDesign which allow the paper size and point sizes to come together with very very small discrepancies.\n\nThe best book on grids and baselines IMHO is Raster Systeme/Grid Systems by Josef Müller-Brockmann. It took me a long time to get into it but it does have fantastic advice on dividing up pages precisely. The example he employs is a DIN page and the type is in points, so it might help you with your question.\n\nHope this helps\n\n"

I compromised by keeping text and baseline grid in points, and document size and margins in mm. Pragmatically, that seems to be the way to go.\n\nThanks very much for the book recommendation - it looks great, so I've ordered it!\n\n"
