  "content": "We're pleased to announce the re-release of two breathtaking new fonts from the Filmotype Font Library.\n\nInitially designed in the early-to-mid 1950s, Filmotype Ginger helped usher in the Mod typographic stylings of the early 1960s visual aesthetic yet it retains a classic and timeless feel. This classic Sans Serif face joins the Filmotype Glenlake font as one of our Gothic revivals.\n\nAmong the very first handwritten script fonts offered by Filmotype in the beginning of the 1950s, Filmotype LaSalle was designed by Ray Baker, a former Lettering Inc employee at the time who named the face after LaSalle street in downtown Chicago.\n\nBoth faces were developed from the original filmstrips and include a full international character compliment, automatic fractionals, ordinals, and a host of alternate characters and ligatures to allow flawless typesetting in dynamic OpenType format.\n\nWe're pleased to share the re-release of these amazing original designs from the 1950s and hope you'll find them to be a perfect compliment to your design toolbox.\n\nYou can purchase, preview and discover more about these faces online exclusivly at Font Bros!\n\nSee 'em here: [http://www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013093702/http:/www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php \"http://www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php\")\n\nWarmly,  \nStuart\n\n",
