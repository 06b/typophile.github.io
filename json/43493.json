Are these ripoffs or something? And if so where can I get the proper Helvetica from?  \nI am so confused and can anyone give me a answer?\n\n",

To add to what you were saying about the film Helvetica.....I did a test on one of the posters used for the film and I am convinced the font used for it is Helvetica Neue. Helvetica Neue bold matches it but helvetica bold doesnt. Could this be right?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130108020521im_/http:/typophile.com/files/helvetica-poster_4215.jpg)\n\n"

What’s used in the above [poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20130108020521/http:/typophile.com/files/helvetica-poster_4215.jpg) is certainly the _Neue_ variety. Historically, there were so many [Helvetica versions](http://web.archive.org/web/20130108020521/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/font_rend.php?idt=f&id=19880&rt=a&rs=388) developed, adjusted, customised, &c., for various typographic media and uses. None of them compares to the original Helvetica Medium, née [Neue Haas Grotesk halbfett](http://web.archive.org/web/20130108020521/http:/typophile.com/files/haas01.jpg).\n\n"
