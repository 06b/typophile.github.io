Give me some feedback about it. i've still got some special letters left to buid at least.\n\n",

Overall,   \nyou might jazz up the glyphs a bit, look for   \nsome other non-traditional solutions.   \n   \nWhat's the significance of the name...or is it a mystery.\\*   \n   \nbj   \n   \n\\*badpun\\*sorryitslate\n\n"

Keep the monostroke version, but try doing this different stroke weight distribution.   \nAnd, BTW, what's that under 5? Looks like a half-smiley... :- )\n\n"
