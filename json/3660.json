But I can't find pdf's of anyone else's, and so I was wondering whether they're all the same or if one is considered better.   \n   \nAlso, does anyone think it's a bad idea to design a philosophy journal using this font? I really like it -- I was recently drooling over an old copy of Heidegger's _Nietzsche_ that I'm pretty sure was set in it -- but then again I'm not very experienced. (The feedback you guys gave on the newspaper design 6 months ago was helpful so I'm trying again.)\n\n",

This isn't surprising, if you consider the cultural and political milieu of Britain at the time, and contrast it with the revolutionary circumstances of the continent. Romanticism in British art and literature never strayed very far from the lyric and retained strong neo-classical elements throughout the 19th century.\n\n"

The national cultures were not isolated, and artists and scientists were very interested in what was happening elsewhere. The Jacobin newspaper \"Gazette..\" was printed with Baskerville's type, for instance.
