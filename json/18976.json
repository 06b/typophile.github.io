  "content": "I'm looking for a font similar to the one in this image. I hope the attachment shows up(!)  \n[also see the logo \"Sunbelt\" at: http://www.sunbeltsnacks.com/]; if not, I think that it is **Textile** , an Apple font. Can anyone suggest a similar font in a Windows format? The closest I've found so far is called  \n**Rostrum** ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/rostrum/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104171605/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/rostrum/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/rostrum/\") ). Another somewhat similar one is  \n**Challenge Bold** ( [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/challenge-bold/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104171605/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/challenge-bold/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/challenge-bold/\") ). Neither is as close as I'd like.\n\nI see this font used very often on food packaging - cereals, etc - and that's the look I'm after.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks so much,  \n- Paul\n\n",

No coincidence, as both were created by by Kris Holmes. It would have required some artificial bolding.\n\nNever mind that, though. I just happened across the recently released [Lucida Big Casual T Demi Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104171605/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/lucida-big-casual/) - which is a veritable match for Textile.\n\n"
