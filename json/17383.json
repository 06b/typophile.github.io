  "content": "I'm a student studying graphic design at algonquin college. I am currently trying to develop my first font, and was hoping to get some comments on what I have so far. I wanted to make a modern looking serif, so i modeled the curves after Eurostile, condensed it, and added some serifs. I also distressed it a little bit, to make it look like it is from the pages of an old book. I want to make sure that my font doesn't look too much like eurostile.\n\nAny comments would be much appreciated.  \nThanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [chester.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123234344/http:/typophile.com/files/chester.pdf) | 55.56 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "• lacks subtlety & detail\n\n• for grunge to be convincing it has to look detailed and natural. As it is your grunge finish looks contrived and phoney\n\n_I also distressed it a little bit, to make it look like it is from the pages of an old book._\n\n• a \"modern-looking serif\" that \"look[s] like its from the pages of an old book\"? (scratching head) That makes it contradictory and hard to justify as in terms of style and appeal. A lot of designers won't see the sense in the combination.\n\n• you really need to define the purpose of the design. What kind of subject matter or context would it be used for?\n\n• ask yourself, \"Does the world really need a grunged-up Eurostile with ad-hoc serifs?\"\n\n• serif positions and the lack of authentic humanist/antiqua features won't please most roman type buyers (when in Roma, do as the Romans do)\n\nBest regards  \nj a m e s\n\n"
