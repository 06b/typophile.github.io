Albert Boton has actually designed 3 different typefaces in this category: Elan, Agora from Berthold, and Memo. Also check out his recent FF Page Serif, which has low contrast and chisel serifs. For that matter, his Pompei has more contrast, but also tiny flare serifs. It reminds me a little of Perpetua.\n\n"

It is a fascinating design, experimental but very disciplined and successful, without any of the 'frankenstein' character of some of the post-modern stuff. The story in the PDF on the Storm is interesting. I wonder if it influenced Rotis?\n\n"
