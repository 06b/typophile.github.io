Its pretty bold to ask someone to create artwork from a font they don't have and have it sent to them. Its a twist on \"can you send a font to me for free\".

I'm no goddamn weasel.   \n   \nI never _wanted_ to have a long-winded discussion about all this shite because the absurdity in that only makes me more disappointed in you. The absurdity is in the fact that it would take you five minutes to help a stranger who politely asked for help if you _were_ able to provide him with the outline, but instead you choose to use your \"valuable\" time on talking out of your asses. This is what prompted me to write the original comment in the first place, so absurdity laughs me in the face when I see you continuing being totally clueless.   \n   \nI do mind answering a few questions for two reasons. First of all, no one answered, or even tried to answer _my_ question, so I don't feel like answering yours. Second, I've heard \"What do you do for a living?\" argument a hundred thousand times before and you don't have to waste your time convincing me that the world revolves around money -- I know that already, and I do need money to eat and be able to talk to you.   \n   \nBy asking me about what I do for a living, you are only proving my point. You think about money and even want to talk to me about money. Well then, why the fück don't you just say it? I mean, if you see nothing wrong with measuring everything with money, why don't you just stay cool and answer my question like this: No, I can't think in terms of anything other than money. Than we would agree and no one would get hurt. How about that, eh?   \n   \nIf you want to talk about money, go talk to Meredith -- she seems to be more than willing to put words into my mouth. If you ask me more question, I'm sure she'll be glad to answer them for me.   \n   \nYou don't have to call me mister to pretend to be polite when you aren't. I don't have the courtesy, but neither do you, so let's just cut the crap, shell we? I'm not insulting you on purpose, but you _are_ being insulted by my honest opinion about you. You can change that opinion, if you wish to, or care -- it's mostly up to you.   \n   \nI don't \"barge\" in here. What is this, some kind of small, snobbish, private cocktail party? Am I supposed to crawl or squeeze in here? This is a public forum were I chose to voice my goddamn honest opinion. If moderators feel like it, they are welcome to ban me from here. And by the way, if you weren't all singing to the same stupid tune, I probably wouldn't have my voiced opinion the way I did. Do you realise how cliquish you all sound?   \n   \nMy whole point, if you still haven't realised it, is that you should be nice to people around you when you can, when it doesn't really cost you anything. When was the last time you helped a old man on the street to carry a slightly heavy bag? I can argue that it does _not_ take much to provide someone with an outline, if you have what it takes. If you can't help, or don't feel like it, just go by. I don't _care_ whether you roll in the money or not, but when you start talking about charging money for five minutes of your time, you are making an arse out of yourselves. We are not talking about greed here, but arrogance.   \n   \nI'll comment on the original post that started this thread: It's not illegal to make an outline of a typeface and share it with someone else, nor do I think there is anything ethically wrong with that. Comparing an outline of a few letters with a font sounds like a bad joke -- there is much more to a font than that. It's almost an insult to someone who actually _has_ created more than just a few letter outlines. It's not bold to politely ask for free help as the guy did. If anything, it's _daring,_ and I wish there were more daring guys like him.   \n   \nTo Yves: No, the typography section on my webpage is not my idea of being funny. In fact, I haven't written anything more boring than what you can read there. There are even some factual errors in there, like the claim of non-existence of system-wide font substitution in Win2000, but I'm too lazy to correct all that shite. On the other hand, I don't take myself too seriously, so you are welcome to laugh at my boring babble if you think it's funny.   \n   \n(I don't understand -- if everyone disagrees with me, who the fück voted my first comment so high? Should I suspect you guys for pulling off some kind of prank on me? I don't think this is amusing.)\n\n"

If you do work honestly as a designer or even as someone who designs type, you always end up underpaid, except if by some magic trick you end up being the next Neville Brody, David Carson or Stefan Sagmeister. You always put love in your work and do the details and stuff like that ... an no client ever pays enough for that. You don't become a designer for the money... and if anybody does, he or she will end up disappointed. As with any craft, I guess. You do it because you love your job.   \n   \n\\>you should be nice to people around you when   \n\\>you can   \nMost folks here are -- check out the typograhic ID section, It takes TIME to identify typefaces for the people asking here... and while other companies charge money for font identification, here it IS free.   \n   \nThe problem here is that the initial poster from MyFonts.com isn't willing to spend 35 $ or whatever it is on Charlotte Sans and NETWORKING SOLUTIONS LTD. doesn't sound as if he's doing a work-for-free or thing or a student job here, does it? And for a simple sample, there are enough type teasers on the web -- as on the Fontshop site -- to get a gif of the visual feeling of Charlotte Sans, but no, he wants a useable and scaleable and editable EPS -- ergo he wants to save money on not buying the font.   \n   \nIf he were a student or would make clear that it is pro-bono work, he'd probably gotten his outline. I've yet to meet a small-minded and petty type-designer.   \n   \nI agree with your initial POV, that people should be nice to other people, but most remarks here didn't strike me as arrogant or mean-spirited but rather as tongue-in-cheek until you kind of PO'd Yves and some others.\n\n"

This gem, \"I fully appreciate Isaac's posting on my site now but I would say that photography definitely has far more imagination than a simple few words of a font,\" only furthers the impression that you don't understand the point (from my perspective).   \n   \nA) The typesetting (or copying, as you put it) is only _part_ of the equation.   \n   \nB) The font _as a whole_ represents a lot of time and energy and creativity.   \n   \nYou indicated in your original post that you wanted to circumvent the purchase of a font that you recognized and costs only $40. Why not add that negligible cost into your bill? The time spent on the purchase and typesetting alone should cover it anyway. Redrawing a font that isn't made of basic geometric shapes is time-consuming and difficult, and will just result in a sub-standard product anyway.   \n   \nYour needs are understandable, I'm put in that position occasionally as well, but you've stumbled onto issues that are large and long-running. If you want to people to understand your needs and your situation, then write clearly and completely next time. Just asking for free font outlines and typesetting without explanation doesn't garner much sympathy.   \n   \nI'm also curious what 'imagination' has to do with anything, as well.\n\n"
