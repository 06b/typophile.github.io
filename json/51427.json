Advice re: type design can change depending on several factors the more important one of which is probably the purpose of the font.\n\nMy advice is don't look for rules. Instead look for complex relationships of factors and tendencies.\n\n"

Stuff like that. It's almost enlightening the first time you do it. :) Pick a font that you are sort of going for. So say baskerville for a nice old style typeface, or helvetica if you want to go all swiss designy like.\n\ncourtney\n\n"

Stop bashing artists because **there is an art to design**. Type design involves both strong design skills and an agenda devoted to design, and type design involves artistry. Get over the art part and stop referring to it. It's starting to get boring and you're starting to sound like a parody of yourself Hrant. No really.\n\nArt is neccessary, and this is coming from a guy who is very big on design.\n\n_think about what users need, not what you feel like creating._\n\nI did both, and will keep doing both.\n\n_But note that what users say they need isn’t necessarily true._\n\nUsers are mislead by market trends and the persuasive powers of peerage.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
