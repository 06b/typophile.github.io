I tried myfonts.com briefly but it only suggested Cheltham and Goudy, which I don't think will be close enough for my clients taste. Anyone have some suggestions?\n\n",

They were, and still are, at Lanston. We cut punches for Monotype composition.   \n   \nThese patterns I believe to be the only in existence. The others were lost in his fire at Deepdene.\n\n"
