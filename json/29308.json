I’m just not sure that this oldish stuff expresses anything in relation to the contemporary music (modern minimalism) that Glass creates.\n\n"

      "content": "I think in genereal you need to pay a lot more attention to your body copy. If you are choosing to justify the text then you need to pay speacial attention to where you hyphanate words.\n\nIn the introduction ’collaboration’ and ’process’ are hyphanated quite badly. When hyphanating words try to use the syllables within the word. ’collabor-ation’ and ’pro-cess’.\n\nSomething else when justifying text is making sure that the tracking between each word is consistent. If you look at the third paragraph in the introduction, and compare the first sentence’ tracking, compared to the last sentence’ tracking, ending in ’Laurie’ you will see that the word spacing is much tighter in the first and looser in the last. TO remedy this you need to play with taking words over, and taking words back from each line, and this is where the use of hyphans becomes important as they help to create an evenly coloured page.\n\nDue to the short line length you may find yourself adding many hyphans, here I suggest, that due to it being the introduction, there may be an opportunity to replace certain words with others that are of the same meaning but different lengths.\n\nI have just set a 200 page book and that was justified, it took at least a full few weeks to go through it and tweak every line.\n\nJustifyling lines requires a lot of patience, as does all typesetting, but it is worth it in the end, gives you something to be proud about.\n\nGood luck\n\nMatt\n\n"
