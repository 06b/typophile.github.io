      "content": "/H, /K, /X, /V, /Z are too wide. /M and /W are too narrow. Get rid of the /C with the straight side and use the rounded /C, but fix the upper left curve. Upper right curve of the /D, /G, /O also need work. To help you see the imbalance, flip the glyph upside-down when you look at it; errors become much more apparent.\n\n"
