The client is looking for something that communicates that home madeness of it.\n\nI’m not sure there is a problem really...I’m just looking for a font that gives off a home made feel...sorry I can’t be more specific. Maybe if anyone has any direct questions I might be able to be of more help!\n\n"

      "content": "I would go further and suggest that drawing the letters by hand to match the rest of the design is probably the only way to go. Of course, you can base the letters on existing type, but I’d say that having the proper hand-lettered look is even more important than the form of the letters.\n\nIf you aren’t confident about lettering, I’d say pick a typeface and draw it on the banners by hand the way you drew the rest of the design. Don’t fret if you can’t duplicate the type perfectly, since you are going for the home-made feel anyway.\n\n"
