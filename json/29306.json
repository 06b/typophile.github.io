(the \"N\" should be a clue)  \n [http://www.psyops.com/html/library\\_crash.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015003256/http:/www.psyops.com/html/library_crash.html \"http://www.psyops.com/html/library\\_crash.html\")\n\nUnfortunately, this only comes in numerals.

To match the serif, an obvious choice would be [Clarendon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015003256/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=clarendon&image.x=0&image.y=0). For a less obvious one, I'd look at [Egyptian 72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015003256/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=M.206.0.2).\n\nSkylar\n\n"
