DeVroye also has a page on his site from Inland showing the name as Poster Latin Antique but I don't know the date of his source. McGrew says Stephenson Blake also had a version available in the 50s/60s. A quick search did not turn up a digital version.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks George for spotting the Inland source.  \nJaspert's \\_Type Encylopaedia (1970) shows Latin Antique from Monotype but the letters are narrower. It also mentions Stephenson Blake as a producer of the font.  \nSo the1946 publication could well have used the BB&S type inherited from Inland.  \nLatin Antique was in the 1897 and 1907 Inland catalog. Poster Latin Antique disappeared between the 1897 and 1907 catalog. I can't see much difference:  \nHere is Poster Latin Antique:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414232348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PosterLatinAntique24ptInland1897_4472.jpg)\n  \nHere is Latin Antique:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414232348im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LatinAntique24ptInland1897_4048.jpg)\n  \nI agree that there is no digital version of the Inland design.  \nDon \n"
