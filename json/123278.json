Maybe even the two arches are of different widths?\n\nThe /f and /t still strike me as too narrow.\n\n"

It's especially difficult width g,p,q because I want to accentuate the corner were the stem is cut of but that causes them to lean a little bit so it's a matter of finding the right compromise.\n\nm+w were perfectly symmetrical (photoshop rendering isn't always 100% accurate) but now I've tried making the m asymmetrical (apex, not width).\n\nI've also made f+t a bit wider\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/gidolinya\\_6224.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112050/http:/typophile.com/files/gidolinya_6224.png \"http://typophile.com/files/gidolinya\\_6224.png\")\n\n"

The joins were already thinned but I think i thinned them even more in the latest version.  \nProblem with /w is that my attempts on designing it like the /v has resulted in the /w being too wide.\n\nLatest update:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112050im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gidolinya2_3934.png)\n\n"
