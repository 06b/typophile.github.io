The exit on the a reminds me of Renaissance serifs, but the overall feel is kind of a friendly Realist type.   \nSpecifically: I like the two storey a better than the single one.

I just noticed that the lc e seems to be tipsy - I can't figure out whether it is tilting forward or backward. It may be that you have attained a perfect equilibrium with it, but there seems to be almost a tension, and maybe that's what you were hoping for. I don't see the B leaning backwards, but Jon may well have more refined eye on that one.\n\n"

The angled terminal on the A, and the foot of the R definitely suggest the same for the M. The uc S I like a lot, especially the taper at the ends. It looks like it may be tipping backwards ever so slightly (though I'm beginning to think it's me that is). The g is better too.   \n   \nJon\n\n"

Of course, this is the opposite of what Jon says, and counters your strategy of angled baselines for angled legs. The \"a\" evolution has given you a better character, but the counter looks smaller. I'd like to see it among other letters. Cool.\n\n"

Right now you have thick, thin, thin, thick. The traditional goes thin, thick, thin, thick. It can be minute modulation, but I think it will improve.   \nE: Hard to tell about the arms, they look like they might not be exactly horizontal based on the anti aliasing. The top arm may be a bit light.   \ng: Maybe less angle in the waist?   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
