A couple of annotations:  \n- Even if it’s a geometric design, I think you should address the top-heaviness of the |8|, since you already made other optical adjustments like overshot.  \n- Personally I find the heaviest weight a bit jarring in the open glyphs.  \n- Not a fan of the bump in |6| and |9| either, where the stem joins the loop.\n\n"
