  "content": "I've been designing fonts for about a year now, pure hobby. I've always felt that, because I was never properly educated in type design, I'm missing out on a lot of stuff. Nevertheless I try. In the last weeks I've come up with this design, inspired on the beautiful typefaces by Gerard Unger. Like his type, I'd like to give it a feel of (post) modernism and clarity.\n\nLike I said, I'm not a professional, not even an educated type designer. However, I'd like you all to comment, good and bad...\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Gerard 3.0.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714014123/http:/typophile.com/files/Gerard%203.0.pdf) | 221.26 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "You've either made superb progress in type design over just a year, or you're staying too close to Unger\\*. He's a great role model in type, but I still think most individuals can contribute much more from themselves than from imitation. The question of what's too close for comfort is a classic and thorny issue in type design, and requires great introspection as well as listening to advice. But quite possibly I'm making a mountain out of a molehill!\n\n\\* I'm not an expert in Unger's work so I can't pinpoint too much.\n\nAnyway, of itself it's quite nice.  \nThe weakest glyph is the \"j\" - it needs a braver descender.\n\nConcerning self-education: many of our great names in the craft have been self-taught. There are pros and cons (just as there are with formal education) but I have to think that in this age of 100,000 fonts it nicely promotes originality. The main problem is that you can take a few extra years to get to the same spot (although the journey might very well be the biggest prize).\n\nhhp\n\n"
