You are going against expert craft knowledge to follow a scientific hypothesis of non-designers that is likely to be refuted, in my view.\n\nI do like somewhat looser spacing than is the norm now, and you have done that. But to me the eyes say that the more even color of the traditional method makes for more comfortable reading, though we are talking about very small differences.\n\nIn display, the traditional spacing is aesthetically better, I think. To me, your bolds here look great in display, but the regular weight not so much. I suspect this is partly because in the bolds the rounds look squarer, so that the idiosyncratic spacing method doesn't hurt as much.\n\n"

      "content": "Bill, you missed something. Letterforms and spacing depend on each other. Increasing sidebearings of rounded letters is just a logical – or if you prefer: visual – consequence of flattening their sides. Nick made rounded letters’ sides less round, a bit flatter, more like straight lines with a slight rounding towards top and bottom. Therefore he needed to treat them more like straight lines in terms of spacing too and increase sidebearings. You can easily make the experiment with any typeface, regardless if serif or sanserif. Make a round Gill-Sans-like _o_ and space it properly between _n_s. Then make a flat-sided DIN-like _o_ and space it properly between _n_s. You will observe that the DIN-like _o_’s sidebearings end up being bigger than those of the Gill-Sans-like _o_. This is all. Because it is a rather trivial everyday type designer thing I guess I would not have mentioned it at all – or may have mentioned the letterforms but not the spacing.\n\n"

The rounds of the bold look more square than the rounds of the regular, as I said. So that Nick's idiosyncratic method doesn't hurt as much in the bold. Of course the counters in the bold are different as well, and they also affect ideal spacing. I haven't compared the regular and bold one over the other.\n\nIn any case, to my eyes in the regular the round characters are a little too loosely spaced compared to the other characters, for achieving even color. At text size, I don't know how much this will affect reading comfort. My suspicion is not much, but still some. I do think it is an aesthetic drawback in the regular, as for some reason visually even spacing does usually seem to look prettier.\n\nNick, on screen, I think looser spacing is particularly helpful—that was one of the things Carter did in Verdana. I'm skeptical that your change in the relationship of rounds and straights would help, but I'll have to check it out.\n\n"

So yes, he didn't do it because of Larson, and is just using Larson to bolster what he did.\n\nBut Nick's method here is a conscious departure from the tradition reflected in Tracy's Letters of Credit—and Tracy is reflecting long standing type lore, as reflected in the Linotype community. So contrary to what you say, Nick, it is deliberately going against expert craft knowledge. Now Nick, you \\*are\\* an expert craftsman, and so you may know better and may be innovating here in a positive way. Each person will judge that. Personally, I think your method detracts, at least in the regular weight, from a wonderful design.\n\nNow as I said, I do like looser spacing; I also did looser spacing in my Williams Caslon Text.

The Incunabula method of moving the heavy part of round strokes away from adjacent letters, by angled stress. Goudy recognized this technique and revived it, assiduously (top specimen).\n\n2.

I am strongly in favour of Kindersley's way of thinking which has its roots in lettering – balancing inner space of glyphs with intra space.\n\nTo my eye Richler has excellent spacing, overall. And I guess that tightening with a general value when typesetting could compensate for personal taste without too much loss of quality of color.\n\n"

      "content": "Bert, you imply that somehow Tracy is ignorant of lettering principles, and is proposing a method at odds to Kindersley's goals. But that is the opposite of the case. They are totally in agreement with balancing inner and intra space. Tracy \\*begins\\* his section on spacing by quoting Harry Carter: \"The success or failure of a type is very much a question of getting a good balance of white inside and outside the letters.\" And of course G. Noordzij also emphasizes the need to balance counters and letter spaces. My point is that expert craft knowledge is unified on this point.\n\nNick, your appeal to looseness doesn't address my point. I explicitly said that I like the looser setting. The looseness of Bodoni is not appropriate for an old style for various reasons, but that is not the issue I have raised. The issue is \\*uneven\\* color. You write in your PDF, \"In the traditional Antiqua, the sidebearings of rounded letters are narrower than those of the straight, producing a modulated rhythm. Richler, however, has squarish curved letters with wide sidebearings—  \nadopted from the sans serif genre—and a contemporary regularity.\" You seem to indicate here that you deliberately made the sidebearings of rounded letters close to the same as the straight, as well as doing a looser spacing.\n\nThat is what I think is also shown in your example, and which I think is less than optimal. Now, again I will repeat I know that a less round letter usually asks for a wider side bearing. However, here you go too far, and in a way that doesn't follow Bodoni—or Tracy, Kindersley, or Noordzij, in my view. That is because the amount of the side bearings should reflect the inner volume, here the between-letter volume is greater than that within the letters. In your examples of Goudy O.S., Bodoni and Richler, the first two are much more even, to my eye. In yours, it seems to me that compared to the first two, the space between the 'nd' is distinctly bigger than between the 'in,' and there is a distinct gap between the pe.\n\nAs I said, feel free to disagree, but at least disagree with what I am actually saying. I am not complaining about looseness, but unevenness. That is also not removed by tracking.\n\n"

It changes the variables in the principle at issue, the principle I have in mind anyway.\n\nIn fact, as Tracy mentions, straights generally are best closer together in sans precisely because of the way that the presence or absence of serifs affects spacing. This may make the side bearings of straights and rounds a bit more similar in sans, but it doesn't mean that spacing serif like a sans, which seems to be your concept here, is a good idea. On the contrary, if Tracy is right, and I think so, it seems sub-optimal, which is what I'm arguing.\n\nTo me Tracy's analysis also implies that the relative proportions of letters in a sans should be somewhat different, but that is another issue.\n\n"

The spacing of DIN seemed an appropriate reference for a squarish antiqua, because DIN is kind of squarish. I wasn’t interested in benchmarking Richler against Melior or Eurostile, Pool’s DIN has the ethos, the zeitgeist I wanted to tap into.\n\n_…as Tracy mentions…_\n\nTo my mind, “craft knowledge” is tacit and not theoretical—it can only be developed, demonstrated, and seen. That is why type design is a craft and not engineering. Craft knowledge is not the same as “type design theory”.\n\nI prefer to ﬁgure things out for myself, by trying my hand at different genres of type, developing new ideas. I’ve designed faces, sans, sans serif, whatever, with many different spacing strategies. It’s a matter of taste and judgement, there isn’t a general theory which ﬁts them all like a glove, that’s not the way type design works. And it doesn’t allow for change or progress. So all this talk about “sub-optimal” is nonsense. Either the type works or it doesn’t, it creates its own interpretation of the rules. And, because it’s a tool, much of its performance depends on how people work with it.\n\n"

But that doesn't mean that it can't be made explicit and articulated, or that it becomes less valid if you do.\n\nI don't know whether anybody articulated this principle of equal spacing between and within letters before WWII, but a number of people have since, and that doesn't make it less valid if you articulate it.\n\nYou write: \"So all this talk about “sub-optimal” is nonsense. Either the type works or it doesn’t, it creates its own interpretation of the rules.\"\n\nWell maybe this is where our thinking about these matters diverges. I think there is a strong influence of our mind-brain apparatus, which does put real constraints. For the principle I have referred to in this thread, I think even color removes 'noise' and so that the letters are more purely 'signal' to the brain, and so easier, more comfortable to read. This seems to affect aesthetics too—though there are a lot of competing goals for display type, which may sometimes override.\n\nThere are also competing demands on spacing, one of these being to keep letters, especially heavier parts of them, from being too close. Reconciling the different demands is something the design ideally does. I certainly don't think there is just one way to do it. There are \\*ranges\\* within which different compromises can work, but I don't think the ranges are infinitely elastic.\n\nBy the way, my bringing in vision and brain processing here may be my thing—I caught the virus from Peter Enneson—but the idea that there are optima in spacing is conventional. I am following Dwiggins, Tracy, Kindersley, Noordzij. Nick may be right about it being \"nonsense\", but he's the outlier here.\n\n"

I think they make the case very well, except that to my eyes they support the point that I'm making, and not yours. In the 'point' case, I agree with you that the po may be a bit too tight in Melior, but to me it's definitely too loose in Richler. With the serifs removed, yes, Richler looks more even than Melior without serifs. But with serifs, Melior looks more even. To me that just makes the point: using a sans approach to spacing serifs is a mistake because you get uneven color in the serif, where you would get even in the sans.\n\nYour 'independent' examples to me show Goudy O. S. and Bodoni have more even color than Richler regular, when you think of 'even color' in the sense of Harry Carter, Tracy, Kindersley and Noordzij—and others. Their concept is different from just \"without spotty clots appearing in text wherever heavy strokes are too close together,\" to quote you. Theirs is a more general concept of evenness of grey, having to do with the balance of whites within and between letters. Kindersley, for example, was willing to tolerate overlap of strokes in adjacent letters to get the overall greater evenness of color in his way.\n\nSo maybe what we are disagreeing about is which concepts of 'evenness' are appropriate guidelines. I think that both the Tracy concept and avoidance of too-close strokes in adjacent letters are good goals. And the two goals can be in tension with one another, depending on the design. To me alphabets optimally are best designed so that they fulfill both goals.\n\nAt any rate, congratulations on an innovative and delightful design.\n\n"

Along comes Richler, a much more economics-friendly Rabenau... serious... but subtly quirky touches... we are still courting... but I must say Richler seems to have a unique voice that I have yet to find its equal... will post a sample here in the coming days...\n\nAgain, thank you.\n\n"
