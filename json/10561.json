Font ID software doesn't even come close so I am guessing it is a recent font (2003-2005?)...   \n   \n ![Nascent](http://web.archive.org/web/20070312013258im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70757.jpg)\n\n",

The lowercase a, i, t and (arguably at least) y resemble the corresponding letters in Botanika standard roman (first sample below); while oddly, the lowercase g and l resemble the corresponding letters in Botanika alternate (second sample).
