The letterforms right now are handmade, and I like the weight and height of them, but I need to replace them with a real font that complements Chaparral.

Really?  \nAnd why you choose Chaparral Italic, if you’re going “that hard way”?  \nFourth, design a logo in 0/1 first, means black on white. Later on, you can do all Illustrator offers …\n\n"

      "content": "Maverick, I wouldn’t be too quick to disregard Pom’s comment. He is suggesting a design process that has proven to be very effective by many designers. It will be most effective when you are combining the typefaces. I also agree that the “techie” style you have doesn’t make much sense for a Christian audience. Unless we’re missing something, it would be more useful for us to critique your work if we had more info on the brand.\n\nAs for type, here are a couple of combinations that I think can be useful (I don’t think Chaparral is right for what you’re aiming at):\n\n- Gotham and Sabon (small caps)  \n [http://www.typography.com/fonts/font\\_overview.php?productLineID=100008](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093819/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008 \"http://www.typography.com/fonts/font\\_overview.php?productLineID=100008\")  \n [http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093819/http:/www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html\")\n\n- Avenir and Baskerville  \n [http://www.linotype.com/72/avenir-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093819/http:/www.linotype.com/72/avenir-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/72/avenir-family.html\")  \n [http://www.linotype.com/749/itcnewbaskerville-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093819/http:/www.linotype.com/749/itcnewbaskerville-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/749/itcnewbaskerville-family.html\")\n\n- I also like Omnes (sans serif), but not sure what to pair it up with.  \n [http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205093819/http:/vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/\")\n\nGood luck.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Patricio,\n\nAs far as the design process goes, I have always started in black and white and do find it very helpful. I’ve attach a black and white version incase the color and texture in the first preview are too distracting.\n\nI’m actually reviewing the logo as well as all the other design work with a separate group of people, so I’m not looking for a critique on this form. That’s not to say that I can’t appreciate some suggestions, but Pom’s comments were hardly constructive. To compound matters, much of the work I’m doing won’t be going public until the end of next month so I don’t feel comfortable providing more information on the brand, except that we’re going for organic, fresh and current.\n\nThanks for some of the font suggestions, I like the general direction and they all fit the bill of being contrasting yet complimentary. Do you mind explaining why you feel Chapparal isn’t right?\n\n"
