Is there any typefaces that fit the bill best in your opinion? Is there any methods of presenting I should consider? Is there any good samples of well designed lonely hearts ads to refer to?!  \nWe are thinking some subtle red colours will combine well with the black typography maybe, so creating a sense of romance?  \nOnce the design is complete the page will be printed on tabloid paper and shot in a certain setting to give this the desired feel, so maybe a red light shinning onto the paper surrounded by candles?...\n\nI hope you get an idea of what is we are trying to achieve and can help in anyway possible!\n\nThank you\n\n",
