  "content": "I realise that in this day and age one is probably expected to have a moderately larg browser window, but nevertheless I like to use my brower non-maximized. This causes the right menu bar to overlap with the forum listings and the top menu with the top-left logo, as shown in the attached screenshot.\n\nOne possible solution to the forum listing issue is to make `#squeeze` be `overflow-x: auto`, which requires me to scroll horizontally to see the rightmost parts of the table, but that's perfectly fine. The top menu seems a bit trickier to do something about with the current CSS, which seems to rely pretty heavily on absolute positioning. The top menu isn't that much of an issue though, so feel free to ignore that.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [2015-03-05-115302\\_934x729\\_scrot.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317145218/http:/typophile.com/files/2015-03-05-115302_934x729_scrot.png) | 129.09 KB |\n\n",
