The PDF has a note that reads.\n\n———  \nThis font is Helvetica, where the measured cap height is 72% , and the x height is 52%, of the specified font size.Thus when you select Helvetica 20 point, the cap height is 14.5 points, and the x height is 10.5 points.  \nThis proportion can generally be regarded as “standard”, and the sizes shown can be used with most fonts.  \nFollowing are cap height percentages for some common fonts (these might vary according to font manufacturer):  \nAmerican Typewriter 66%  \nAntique Olive 75%  \nAvant Garde 75%  \nBenguiat 66%  \nBodoni 70%  \nBookman 69%  \nCentury Schoolbook 72%  \nClearface 69%  \nFranklin Gothic 70%  \nFutura 75%  \nGaramond 62%  \nGill Sans 67%  \nLubalin Graph 72%  \nNews Gothic 77%  \nOptima 69%  \nTimes 68%  \nUnivers 70%\n\nTo precisely determine the size for any font, use the line spacing gauge on this ruler to measure the cap height, and divide it by the cap height percentage of the specific font.  \n——\n\nCan a typographer help me to understand this please?\n\nthanks\n\n [‹ Shape of things to come](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122185735/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39905 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Throhand Italic ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080122185735/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39894 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
