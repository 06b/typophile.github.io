  "content": "Please check out my first font release, Grey Sans!\n\nGrey Sans is a contemporary sans with an angular design. Routed in both modern geometry and historical handwriting, Grey Sans bridges the gaps of neutrality and warmth, precision and humanism, and serious and fun. Grey Sans covers the grey areas of typeface design.\n\nAvailable at:  \n [MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/greyscale-type/grey-sans/) | [Fontspring](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/greyscale-type/grey-sans) | [YouWorkForThem](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/font/T4209/grey-sans) | [HypeForType](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/www.hypefortype.com/grey-sans.html) | [Fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/www.fonts.com/font/greyscale-type/grey-sans)\n\nThank you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [MF-poster-01.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/typophile.com/files/MF-poster-01_0.png) | 35.07 KB |\n| [MF-poster-03.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/typophile.com/files/MF-poster-03_0.png) | 37.41 KB |\n| [MF-poster-04.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/typophile.com/files/MF-poster-04_0.png) | 51.98 KB |\n| [MF-poster-05.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/typophile.com/files/MF-poster-05_0.png) | 43.44 KB |\n| [MF-poster-08.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415105404/http:/typophile.com/files/MF-poster-08_0.png) | 59.81 KB |\n\n",
