Would the digital and print seam of typography be wiped out? Will we have interactive ’print’? Or will something else weird happen? Like fonts embedded with enhancer animations that play whenever the font is loaded/seen. Or embedded complimentary voice overs for readers. We won’t be designing typefaces anymore, people. Today is the dawn of the typebody.\n\n [‹ Helvetica Serif?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118191412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33209 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Interesting packaging design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118191412/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31911 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Holmes deduces where a murder has just occurred by carefully following a bullet’s trajectory to a house across the street. Watson tells him he already had figured that out because of all the police standing outside the house.\n\n"
