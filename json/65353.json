Can't remember if I asked about Renaissance Hotels' new identity or not (my memory's not what it used to be), but I've now got a much higher resolution copy of the logo, and was hoping someone out there might be able to help me identify the fonts in this, as what I _was_ using now looks completely wrong.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014062459im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Renaissance_4116.jpg)\n\nAny and all assistance is greatly appreciated!\n\n",
