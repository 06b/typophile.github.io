      "content": "Using Erik's comment I hunted through the samples in 'Dutch Type' by Jan Middendorp. Unfortunately, typeface samples in that otherwise great book are of widely varying usefulness and completeness. The only typeface I saw that I thought had something of the look of the sample was Just van Rossum's 'Gak Serif', which was a custom job for GAK, the Dutch government insurance agency. However, the sample has too few letters to see more than the similarity in the serifs for the lower case. I couldn't find any samples of it online either. Gak serif is wider than the Delta Whiskey lettering, but we know how easily width can be adjusted. I'm not saying Gak Serif is the answer, but possibly it is a van Rossum design ('shared DNA' rationale used in the Gulliver thread). It seems unlikely to me that Delta Whiskey would have custom type designed for them, so I really doubt my own answer, but wanted to say what I found from searching that book of Dutch Type. One thing that was apparent was there seem to be relatively few Dutch slab serif designs.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
