Maybe its my ignorance but i found a corner circled in red a bit annoying.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720002910im_/http:/typophile.com/files/francker-typophile_6496.png)\n  \nPlease take a closer look and tell me why this letter is constructed that way? Is there any other solution which will help to get rid of the \"corner\"? \n\nThanks in advanced for all your comments.\n\n",

      "content": "You would probably have to ask the designer “why?”—but it appears to me that he/she was recycling the design of the X. In any vector drawing program, it's not terribly difficult to extend the slanted sides down so that they meet the stem, if that's what you're after.\n\n"

      "content": "_…why…_\n\nWhen stems cross, they create a dense, thicker area.  \nThis is especially apparent when they cross at an angle, because the acute joint “ﬁlls in” one way or another.  \nType designers have traditionally addressed this issue in letters such as Y by tapering the angled strokes (check out Frutiger Black to see this method vigorously applied).  \nHowever, in Francker it appears that the designer would prefer to keep the stems of an even thickness, so has devised other means to alleviate the heavy spots.  \nOne of these is to offset the “chevrons” in X (Frutiger does that too), and, interestingly, another is the “notched” technique in the Y.\n\n"

      "content": "@design-invader: The 'corner' is there due to the reasons that you and Nick Shinn have already mentioned.  \nDue to the superellipse-inspired design and the spurless lowercase letters, the characters of Francker generally look quite big compared to those of other more tradionally designed typefaces. To match the overall look of the typeface I wanted to keep all the angled strokes of letters such as A, K, R, V, X and Y of an almost equal thickness, with only a small taper for optical reasons. An extreme taper of the two angled strokes of Y and no 'corner' would lead to too much white space in both sides of the character.  \nEspecially in the heavy weights the characters become very wide compared to their height and therefore it was not a good solution just to extend the strokes of the Y as shown in your example - the letter would look to much like a V and have a big dark spot in the middle.  \nThe inspiration to the 'notched' design of Y comes from the small letter y where the left stroke, in some typefaces (including Francker), is connected to the right one so that there becomes a 'corner'.\n\nAnnoying or not - I personally think I have come to the best solution for the Francker Y!\n\nRegards,  \nAnders Francker  \nDesigner\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720002910im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Y_4050.jpg)\n\n"
