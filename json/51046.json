Sebastian Nagel from Austria extended the original drawing to 7 weights (black, extrabold, bold, semibold, regular, semilight and light), with full coverage of the Latin 1 character set. All fonts include small caps and alternate characters.\n\nMore information can be found at:  \n [http://www.fonts.info](http://web.archive.org/web/20090913130537/http:/www.fonts.info/ \"http://www.fonts.info\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [iwan1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090913130537/http:/typophile.com/files/iwan1.jpg) | 93.47 KB |\n\n",
