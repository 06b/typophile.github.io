They wanted to upgrade their identity to reflect the perfect, polished, and remarkable events they cater. They have a lot of name recognition in their geographic area and are also very proud of the personal attention that each event gets from their staff.\n\nI'm happy with the main \"Russell Morin\" type -- I slightly modified a very beautiful typeface and added some elements of the owners signature into it. Though, if you have comments on that, I'd love to hear them (I'm certainly not a type expert). I'm having the most trouble with the treatment/typeface/size of the \"fine catering\" tagline. I just can't get it to seem to work in a sophisticated enough fashion. Please help me out!\n\nThanks a million!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110210220406im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RM_logo_6140.jpg)\n\n",

Alone, the R doesn't resemble an R, you might want to play with the curve from the top of the R to the bottom of the leg as it extends under the u.\n\nFor the tag... I'm assuming you're using Copperplate Gothic, which is a nice choice. I'd move the tag below the signature, centered and shrink the size to almost half the width of the signature. The space between the signature and the tag should be equal to about 1.5 the tag's size. (So, if the tag was 12 points, the space between the tag and the signature would be 18 points.) Centering it, will also give the signature a nice balancing point.\n\nThe color seems very light. If you were to convert that to grey scale, it would probably be equal to 10-15% black, that's too light. Consider bumping up the saturation.\n\nIt has a nice look to it, it's really at the tweak stage. I'd be interested to see your other iterations before they picked this one.\n\n"

I worked many years in five diamond catering, and it's refreshing to see a brand without an ornate crest or bow tie. I think the extra touch of sophistication you're looking for may be found in the media - 100% cotton paper and embossed letterpress printing.\n\nEileen\n\n"

We went through a name change with them and they just couldn't lose the Fine Catering.\n\nI'd love some typeface suggestions for the \"fine catering\" tagline -- I'm okay with the Copperplate but I don't love it and feel like there could be something nicer out there that I'm totally overlooking.\n\nHow could I have not even considered letterpress for this logo? It was totally off of my radar. Thanks for the suggestion it is really meant for it. I do agree, though -- the strength in the logo is closely tied to how it is held up by the medium's it is printed on and the other surrounding design elements.\n\n"

I think the height of the font will help readability when scaled and if it is scaled really small I'll lose the \"fine catering\" tagline. Similarly, though, I am worried that the serif's of Copperplate won't read well when scaled down. Perhaps that was my initial hesitation with Copperplate.

Russell and Morin seem to have a different rhythm going on (the Russell seems less consistent, the Morin has a steady rythem). I know this is a hybrid between Cezanne and a real signature, but it needs a little more refinement to feel like it came from 'one' hand. On the other hand, I liked the first design and its colours. The rectangle to me says 'table' or 'fine linen'. And, though I like Topaz, in this case I prefer the Copperplate –&nbsp;has a little more character and because it is a wide font, acts as a nice support/line (so no line).

Why – it looks elegant/distinctive, and you can space out this way condensed styles much better, and a \"line-feeling\" you can add with the use of SC.\n\nYes i agree, the tagline should smaller in size. For a useful logo system, you should design different versions of the logo for different sizes, etc. If the client pays for it …  \nJust my 2 cents.\n\n"

In addition, you might either drop it a bit to let the eye air it out or, as another designer suggested run a rule and drop it centered.
