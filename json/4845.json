  "content": "I was just wondering whether any of you guys recognized this face? To me it initially looked like bembo but it doesn't quite match. The question mark character is completely different, similar to MC's Galliard or Dante. I've looked at the aldus-like types such as Iowan, Dante, and some other garalde faces but can't find a match. Distinctive characters are the upper case Y, the ?, and the B, whose crossbar doesn't quite reach the stem. It looks so familiar, perhaps because of the similarity to the aformentioned faces but also perhaps because, like my [Fritz Quadrata blunder](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209134027/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35876.html), I'm losing my mind.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209134027im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/36319.jpg)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209134027im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/36320.jpg)\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; WomensBiz.us - Franklin Gothic {Mark S, James, Franz}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080209134027/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4847 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; Clarendon sans?
