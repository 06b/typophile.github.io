At first I thought some Garamonds have the same kind of W, and the S serif is similar, but the P was the problem. The closest font I could find that seemed close to the W, P and S was [Rotation](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060550/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/rotation/), but it seems to have less bracketed serifs. Either squooshing (horizontally) or stretching vertically, would possibly increase the similarity. That’s the best I can suggest so far.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
