Their mark should be a reenforcing. If you want to use the N as the focal point, then you may want to look at a Serif font with bit more curvature that allows you to incorporate at the P shape hinting. San-serif offer that precision of 90 degree lines, but really that's a big stretch.\n\nAs for why Penguin Books' logo is successful is because the Penguin is usually printed on a book, thus you don't really need to reiterate the book aspect of the book. When you see them as a sponsor of an event, I believe they have the Penguin logo with their name spelled out as well.\n\n"

So I have ultimately decided against using it and go with a wordmark instead. I'll post it separately in a bit.\n\n@litera: P+n _is_ a deliciously simple mark, I agree with you :-) It'd be a shame not to recycle it for some other project.\n\n"
