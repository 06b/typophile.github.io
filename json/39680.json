  "content": "This year, Sears brought back its old “Wish” catalog that was absent for 14 years, visiting a Sears store over the weekend I came across heavy promotion of their entire “wish” theme, there must have been close to a hundred red in-store signage boards with the word “wish” prominently in the center, inspiring the holiday spirit and nicely decorating everything throughout the store.\n\n“wish” :) I could’ve made a picture of these posters for you to ID the font, so here is a banner I found online using the same script font.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Sears Wish.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219155803/http:/typophile.com/files/Sears%20Wish.jpg) | 30.67 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Neutral grotesque on Michael Maltzan Architecture poster - Akkurat {Simon H}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219155803/http:/typophile.com/node/40131 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Swash font used by Phoenix Home & Garden magazine - Incognito {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219155803/http:/typophile.com/node/40120 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The style reminds me very strongly of [Rob Leuschke](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219155803/http:/www.typesetit.com/index2.html)’s work, and it’s possible he did this lettering for Sears, since he does a lot of custom work.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

There are roughly thirty of us looking at these posts at any given time, and if no one came up with other ideas this suggests more strongly that this is custom work.\n\nI think you might see why I suggested [Rob Leuschke’s](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219155803/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Leuschke) work if you go to this link and type in ’Grant a Wish’ as the test drive phrase. While the details of each font are not consistent with the Sears lettering, to me the lettering style seems to fit Rob’s work. I know it’s just a hunch, but I think it’s a reasonable one. Sears certainly has the means to hire someone to letter three words for all their holiday marketing, I would think. This way no one duplicates your look exactly, but Leuschke’s work is where I’d start to find something that you would perhaps mistake for it, if you didn’t have them side-by-side.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I guess I need to get out of my bubble...)\n\nMy next move will be - since I’m so love stricken by this script - to go back to the Sears store with a digital camera and attempt to capture some nice shots of the signage without being caught by security... will let you know.\n\n"

      "content": "Sam, I see your point about the ’a’, and you could be right that it’s a font, but that doesn’t mean it’s available, if it is a custom design made for Sears. We’re all fanatics here, so asking the potential designer is one thing we might try to do if we’re stuck. Now if someone knows the Sears Art Director, that might be another avenue to try.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
