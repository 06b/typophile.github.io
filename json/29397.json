  "content": "Hi,  \nI recently purchased the [BELLO](http://web.archive.org/web/20131031221534/http:/typophile.com/wiki/BELLO) typeface by [Underware](http://web.archive.org/web/20131031221534/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Underware). Its a great typeface but I am having trouble accessing the ornaments.  \nI seem to be able to get the starting, ending swashes but not the ornaments? Can anyone who has this typeface help.  \nI need it desperately! Thanks!\n\n",

Going through the Glyph palette in InDesign you should have access to every individual glyph, but I'd guess that the auto-replacements are either discretionary ligatures or contextual alternates, both of which can be \"turned on\" in the Character palette.\n\n"

On the crazy chance that this is what you mean, just put your cursor in your text box and then double-click on the glyph you want in the Glyph palette. Shazam.\n\nIf that's not what you meant, sorry to state the obvious.\n\n"
