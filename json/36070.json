Of course, a transparent gif has that ugly white line. This page will have a flash gallery on it. Is the only solution is to make the whole page a flash page?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091023125903im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gallery_6486.jpg)\n\nThanks,\n\nSharon\n\n",

Nice thing about it, with it you can code properly CSS 2.0 (CSS 2.1?) for all standard compliant browsers and via conditional comments you can solve nearly all problems for IE with it (transparency, box-model bugs, attribute selectors …)\n\nThere is a quite simple javascript to solve this transparency problem for IE, too. Search the web for “IE transparency image”.\n\nI use transparent png-24 format instead of gif.\n\n"

      "content": "A gif does not have to have “that ugly white line” around it. If you set the matte to black when saving the gif, then the antialiasing will blend to black, and not to white. you will still have a blackish border around it where the background is lighter than black but this will be better. You might even find a darker gray that works.\n\nBut why limit yourself to GIF. Slice up a JPG and make the rollover from that. If you position things correctly the background of the jpg will line up with the image behind, and transparency is not needed.\n\n"

JPGs will never match the background color perfectly and tend to add artifacting to areas of high contrast (namly type). A gif will work fine.\n\n"
