So, I'll ask outright here:\n\nWhich company (such as T26, Veer, Fonts.com/Monotype, etc.) would all of you professional typographers recommend as far as licensing fonts? Is doing it on your own better? It'd be nice to get a pros-and-cons type of comparison so that more informed decisions could be made next time.\n\n— Josh\n\n",

But some well informed people suggest me to stay from it and don't join fonts.com. Maybe the documents are a bit outdated, but they are no secrets.\n\nAfter all, the big issue I miss on the side of the big distributers is, they don't see us as partners! A lot of the type designers are well qualified technical font developers too. They deliver a \"ready for shipment\" product. But in general, their contracts are written in a manner of taking out a maximum of your rights. Some of them are essential goods and not necessary for a simple online distribution.\n\nFor a pure online distribution its not necessary to give the rights:\n\n- to modify and convert your fonts  \n- to customise your fonts for \"their\" clients  \n- to bundle your fonts with other products to \"new\" products (e.g. CDRoms, OEM-bundles, font colletions)  \n- to sublicense it to other \"distribution partners\" of theirs\n\nSo in the light of this, out of the big five, I can recommend MyFonts.com only.\n\n-- [astype.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416071858/http:/www.astype.de/)--\n\n"

      "content": "We should make the distinction between a \"foundry\" and a \"reseller\". Basically, you have two options:\n\n1. Submit fonts to an existing foundry (i.e. Emigre, FontFont, Font Bureau, ITC).\n2. Create your own foundry and sell those fonts through resellers like MyFonts, FontShop, Fonts.com, and Phil's Fonts.\n\nIf you have several fonts ready to release and wish to create your own label (option 2), there is no reason you need to be limited to one of the resellers. Just remember that there is a lot of work besides font creation that goes into creating your own label - writing and maintaining a EULA, for instance.\n\nThere are other advantages to going the first route. An exclusive foundry like FontFont will do the distribution and promotion for you (with your input and collaboration, of course). Your work will be advertised around the world in various outlets and in printed catalogs, and it will be attached to a trusted, established brand. In most cases, the foundry will be carried by more than one reseller, further extending your reach. Some foundries will also help you complete the development of your fonts.\n\nSome like to release their early, more experimental work for free or through MyFonts. Once they've cut your teeth and created something they feel really confident about, they look to an established label to help it sell well.\n\nMany designers release work through various foundries throughout their career (Xavier Dupré, Akira Kobayashi, Jim Parkinson). Sometimes a certain style simply fits in one foundry's library better than another's.\n\nMuch of this decision depends on how much time and effort you're willing to put into promotion and business, and what type of fonts you've created. Tell us more.\n\n"

Everyone takes a cut and you the designer are left with the short end of the transaction. Even if you are promised a particular percentage, you have to remember that the reseller may sell to another reseller who then bundles your fonts to another reseller.\n\nEarly im my career I Iicensed some fonts to FontHaus, boy, ya gotta love those $3.25 royalty checks. I have a whole bunch in a pile on my desk uncashed. They are worth so much more as a reminder. And those ITC royalties, wow!\n\nMy advice is to manage your own intellectual property. An e-commerce web site, a EULA, some marketing, yes it all costs money, but what is that old saying about spending money to make money. But only if you are serious about making some money in the type business. And don't pay any attention to all those Typophile members who keep carping that you can't make money doing type. Those are the people who haven't figured out how to do it.

      "content": "Well, Josh...you are asking questions that I did years ago. I can sympathize. But I think I have a unique perspective on this.\n\nI released my first few fonts with T26 several years ago and continue to release with them. I was so eager, so willing to do whatever I needed to get published. Despite what anyone says, how they put it, or whatever degree of cool bravado they might toss out...it's really cool to see your fonts for sale, to see them being used, to see them in print. In time, that cool factor evolves into 'what can I do to make more money, what can I do to get recognized more' and so on. I think people on this post have offered some great advice, but it is important to realize...you ultimately can control this. I sell my work with T26, Veer, MyFonts and my and Silas' new baby, TypeTrust. I appreciate them all.\n\nI have tried it all. Small foundry, large foundry, self-publish...they all have their benefits and each has benefitted me. The attitude I have taken of late is that I love type and I want it diefied and its creators as much as possible. Greater attention to detail, perfection of the craft, finding niches that I can explore creatively, using my resources to create a platform that I can present my work and others that truly showcases the artist's work. It sounds a little over blown, but it is an exploration...the same as picking up the pencil and sketching something out on paper to see if it works....sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nThe important thing to realize is that there really isn't one right answer. Just keep trying, know that you will never do your 'best work' with any one arrangement, and sometimes even the coolest typeface won't make you a dime and the one you spent the least time on will buy you a car.\n\nKeep sketching. Every 'successful' type designer started somewhere.\n\n"
