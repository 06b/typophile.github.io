Here is the earliest version of the logo I could find—it was in use from 1948 to 1996:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918030358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dporthault_1948_1996_5710.gif)\n\nHere's the mark from its 1984 Canada trademark registration:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918030358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DPorthaultCanada_1984_4542.gif)\n\nHere's how the mark looked on the company's website in 2003 (via archive.org):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918030358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dportaultApr2003_5818.png)\n\nAnd again in 2004:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918030358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DPortaultJul2004_3893.png)\n\nThe company was sold in 2005, and I could get none of the archive.org links to work for 2005, 2006, or 2007. February 2008 is the first instance I could find of the logo in it's current form:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918030358im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dporthaultFeb2008_5138.png)\n\nBased on this progression, I think it's pretty clear that the logo has been redrawn and refined from earlier versions (the most noticeable difference over the last decade being the removal of the horizontal foot on the P and the redrawing of the crest). I suspect the original was based on Daniel Porthault's own signature (or one drawn by his wife Madelaine, who was the creative force behind the company).\n\n"
