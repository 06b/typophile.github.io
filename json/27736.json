I might think that Adobe's Garamond Premiere Pro is the best serif typeface on Earth. But another poster might point to FF Maiola. Or Palatino nova, or Sabon, or a typeface from Steffan Hattenbach's MacRhino collection.\n\nWhile there are certainly a number of typefaces that \\*I\\* would definitely say are not the best serif types on the planet, this wouldn't be helpful either. The best typefaces are tuned to specific periods, moods, media, environments, and printing technologies.\n\nAre you looking for a font for corporate identity, a novel, a newspaper, a website, a logo, or something else? For each of these uses, you'll still get different answers from most Typophile posters here, but at least the answers, like the question, will be more specific and help you make the right purchase and create the best design.\n\n"

I really can't decide between those three. Although it seems to me that most people here on Typophile prefer the first two I listed. I'm not very knowledgeable about Baskervilles anyway.\n\nMrs. Eaves, however (which is considered a play on Baskerville), is NO Baskerville, no matter what anyone tells you. ;-) If you want that low x-height whimsical charm of Mrs. Eaves but with spacing that actually makes sense (in terms of extended text), then have a look at Emigre's Tribute, which is quite a gem.\n\n"

      "content": "Funny, I have seen Stone Serif very little over the years, and Minion a lot. Stone Sans is used somewhat more than Serif, though. More important, Stone Serif looks new, and a nice surprise, to my clients. For them, it's all about what works well at 9pt, instead of blooming only at 10pt or up, as so many alternatives I admire tend to.\n\nMvB Verdigris and Sirenne Display are quite interesting.\n\n"

I can see that it could work very well at 9 pt, but at the larger size in that book, I didn't find it so nice.\n\nWalter Tracy writes \"For my own taste, if x to h is a proportion of acout six to ten a face will look refined and pleasant to read. If the x height if much less than that the face may be stylish but will be unsuitable for a long text. A larger x-height conduces to dullness.\"\n\nI think Tracy got it right, and that Stone Serif is a bit lifeless. I see it was finished in 1987, when I think the huge x-height fashion was still in full swing.\n\nSo: suberbly crafted? No doubt. Ideal? No way. Just reading about it, I would think that Stone's [Cycles](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417144449/http:/stonetypefoundry.com/html_pages/CyclesOverview.html) would be more of a candidate.\n\n"

      "content": "Many of your objections to Stone Serif would be solved by an Open Type Pro version with optical sizes like display and subhead. When Stone Serif was new, typositor strips were still being used, and for that market Stone released a display weight of the book and book italic. Today, walking past a hardware store, I saw a box design that used the typositor display, roman and italic, and it was just beautiful. Can't help you with the large x-height, though: unfashionable here, perhaps, but loved to death by clients--and it's not hard to figure why. One curiosity: the Serif book weight is actually tagged \"medium,\" which suggests there's a Serif Light stuck in Stone's desk...??\n\n"

Both book and medium weights are available for text, very subtly different, and both quite beautiful. This family really deserves careful consideration for workhorse use, as does Linotype's Sabon Next. Josh's website doesn't sell Freight Text very well; on the \"set your own sample\" page, you can try it yourself.\n\n[http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417144449/http:/www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php \"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freighttext.php\")\n\n[http://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417144449/http:/www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html\")\n\n"
