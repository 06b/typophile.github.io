  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’ve just practically rebuild my home and added a room as my workspace. I would like to decorate that room with as much info about type as possible. I’m just starting an interest in typography and thought that that would be a nice way of learning more about type.\n\nI’ve seen many posts here with links to other sites where they have pdf’s of families and general info or pictures. I would like to collect as many as possible to put up the walls and also to have them on the computer for research.\n\nCould anyone please give me some links to interesting typographic pdf’s or images (high res preferably).\n\nI found for example some on dutchtypelibrary.com, dstype.com, fontshop’s fontmag (takes a bit longer then a download, but sounds interesting enough), fontfont.com, etc.  \nI think you know what I mean. I will be browsing the forum for the next couple of hours for interesting links and downloads.\n\nI do have a couple of books about type, but I wouldn’t want to cut pages out of them to hang on the wall, so I’m just looking for free downloadable interesting things (I am a student so free things always sounds interesting for some reason) =)\n\nThank you so much! any help will be very very much appreciated!!!\n\ndav2.\n\n",
