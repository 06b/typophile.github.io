  "content": "Hi,\n\nThis is Chile sans, a typeface for identity and reading. This \"new\" font its different form my past chile sans font with inverted contrast(who will be in stand by). Well, the concept behind the face is to make a font to be used by chilean graphic designers.  \nI will post advances for my new Chile sans font from today to the letras latinas 2006 exposition. The font include:  \nRegular, Bold, Italic, headline and Icons.  \nThis is the current version of Chile, in headline. Your comments are welcome as always :)\n\nmh\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [File](http://web.archive.org/web/20150309124033/http:/typophile.com/files/drupal_21) | 13.34 KB |\n| [File](http://web.archive.org/web/20150309124033/http:/typophile.com/files/drupal_22) | 13.34 KB |\n| [File](http://web.archive.org/web/20150309124033/http:/typophile.com/files/drupal_30) | 13.34 KB |\n| [chile reg ital.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150309124033/http:/typophile.com/files/chile%20reg%20ital.pdf) | 30.02 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi,  \nDid you change the space between the uc 'C' and lc 'h' in your (white on red) user picture? It looks slightly different to the 'Chile' in the (white on black) sample you provided. The C|h and the l|e do need a little less whitespace, I would say (also compared to l|a at the beginning). The S|a|n looks a bit odd (does the curved stem of 'a' need more whitespace to the right?)  \nOverall, it looks very nice, I like the rounded caps and the low height of the uppercase letters.  \n– is 'Chile Sans' the proposed name of the font? I doubt that there are intrinsic values of nationality to a typeface, but this is your decision, of course.\n\n"

A la verga con el inglés, Miguel la neta admiro mucho tu trabajo y a esta fuente se le ve un aire sofisticado pero la verdad no me gusta mucho, sera cosa personal, ¿no podrías mostrar el peso normal?\n\nA ver si este año me quito la flojera y el miedo y mando algo a letras latinas.\n\nSaludos.\n\nHéctor\n\n"

      "content": "Stephan,\n\nThank you for your critique on the space between gliphs. I try to upload a pdf but it seem that typophile was a bug when i did. I will upload it tomorrow. About the name of the font, i will keep it. What is the difference using a name of a person, city, country or planet? My intention is to bring Chile to Chilean designers. About the design, it is inspired on early sans serifs, vernacular fonts (tipografia.cl old site) and of course, teh amzing work of Teff and Underware.  \nNow in spanish: Este trabajo ser{a mi primer intento serio de una tipografia para textos impresos que mostraré en Letraslatinas 2006, lo que me tiene muy motivado, pronto les linkeare a un blog para recibir mas comentarios de diseñadores.  \nThis month is the independence of Chile, on september 18, what an amazing time to show the proyect too :)\n\nBest,\n\nmh.\n\n"

      "content": "Really interesting typeface. Overall I like the personality of this type face.  \nI'd suggest few things :  \na: seems unbalanced. Probably the top is too long to the right or the bowl is too short.  \ng: the connection between the two storeys is too in the middle. His ear would be better if it had an other terminal, something like «a» or «s» terminal?  \nr: I would rework the top terminal. May be like the terminal of the «t».  \nB,R: the top bowl is too big compare to the bottom one.  \nH,E,F : the middle bar is also too low.\n\n"

The 2004 typeface is not only innovative, it is funky and well crafted; the new one is just cutesy, too soft.  \nAnyway, the proportions remind me of [FF Quadraat Headliner](http://web.archive.org/web/20150309124033/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep?cview=P71923Q&clist=PQ).\n\n-- [omine.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20150309124033/http:/www.omine.net/)\n\n"

O sea, tipos como estos responden a un caracter mucho más moderno y no respetan tanto las proporciones historicas, sino que buscan la logica.\n\nYo respeto mucho los tipos antiguos como gill sans, futura, las garamond, etc, pero en verdad... han sido superados.\n\nNO quiero ser sacrílego, pero tu tipo lo encuentro muy superior a los que están en uso actualmente, vigentes y \"superestarificados\" en muchos catálogos.\n\nAnimo que me gustaría verlo luego trerminado y en uso\n\n"

I want to fix it a little if got problems with legibility, but the idea is to mantain the proportions from humanistic a and e counterforms equal for the mixed open and close counterforms from A, R, etc.\n\nEduardo: The previous effort will be a different font, with a new name. Now Chile sans its too soft because of the friendly appearence that i want to add on it, specially to make a great difference with other sans fonts like Meta, who are more serious, i will keep the idea to use sans for signage for example, but with latin cute tasty favour, just like vernacular Chilean signage.\n\nBest,\n\nmh.\n\n"

Ok, in Spanish it's \"letra grifa\": in homage to Francesco Griffo, cut for Aldo Manuzio, Venezia, Italia. Don't know if Chile could be represented, but surely I would not identify Miguel's work with Africa or Germany.\n\nThe Question and Exclamation Marks look somewhat close to the ones in Alejandro LoCelso's Australis (which is definitely good!). Do they come from vernacular forms?\n\n"
