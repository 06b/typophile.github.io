  "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI’m doing some research regarding newspaper design. I was asked to help someone clean up a monthly newspaper about Wine.  \nThey are currently using Times New Roman for the body text and Futura for titles and so on.\n\nCan anyone recommend a serif typeface suited for the body text that would also include Romanian diacritics/accents ? As well  \nas a sans serif typeface that would work with it ?\n\nCheers,  \nVlad\n\n [‹ Design and Spacing of Divided Letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905035538/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44211 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Arial in Movie Poster Typography? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905035538/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44204 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "The ideal newspaper text typeface to handle Romanian diacritics would be Greta, which Peter Bil’ak designed specifically to overcome problems with setting heavily diacritical languages in newsprint. To go with Greta you could try Bil’ak’s Fedra Sans. There are terrific display versions of both Greta and Fedra on Typotheque, as well, that you could use to replace Futura.\n\nBut really, a bit more information on the newspaper might be useful. Who is its target audience?, How does it perceive itself?, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "Greta does look like a nice font. Be aware that it \\*looks\\* like it doesn’t set as many characters-per-pica as Times (few fonts do), so if space is an issue, you might have to make some compromises.\n\nAnother consideration is whether the newspaper is to be available in PDF format. Some foundries prohibit embeding the font in a PDF, some allow it with restrictions, some allow it but require a further license.\n\nFor example, Greta’s EULA is livable; they do allow embeding the font in a PDF (with a quite reasonable restriction), but it looks like an extra license is involved.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
