Well, it doesn't seem to be free, apparently you can buy it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114171855/http:/www.linguistsoftware.com/tech.htm) as part of a bundle for US $99.95.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying this, I think you should replace it with Eric Olson's [Bryant Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114171855/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcon/index.html), it costs $99.00 for 4 weights. You'd save 95 cents and gain a lowercase as a bonus. :^D\n\n"
