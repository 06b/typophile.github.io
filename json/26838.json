The San Francisco Center for the Book is presenting a symposium at CCA this Saturday, Sept. 20, to coincide with its current exhibition of French design legend Massin's work.   \n   \nI posted a press release here on Typophile in the News & Events section. Starts at 2pm at CCA. Reception at SFCB to follow the talks. Free event, open to the public.   \n   \nSOTA's a proud sponsor ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162900im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) I won't be able to make it, but I hope to hear reports from any locals who can attend. Should be another great event. Go to the SFCB website at [http://www.sfcb.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162900/http:/www.sfcb.org/) to get more details.\n\n",
