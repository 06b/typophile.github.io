Tickets consist largely of type that is variable (destination, time, etc) and are probably printed on specialized equipment that may have limited font options. You may need to \"italianize\" the tickets via color and design rather than font choice (except for pre-printed portions of the ticket).\n\n"

The only differential is the logo of the operator in the top-left. The printers are thermal, so its black print only. If you want to find out more, I suggest you ask nicely at the train station if they can tell you the name and model of the printer, and who makes it, you should be able to get more information on their capabilities (or lack of).\n\nAs a lot of rail operators are moving to e-tickets, you might want to consider a redesign for those instead as you would (potentially) have more flexibility (color, format, etc.).\n\n"
