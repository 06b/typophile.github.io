For example, a foundry sell a font to a company, and embed an i.d number inside so that, should it become circulated illegaly, they’d know who let it loose?\n\n [‹ Small release of several python scripts](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629064256/http:/typophile.com/node/17596 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [quark 6.5 problems (osx) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629064256/http:/typophile.com/node/17619 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There are a million fields in the type info: Copyright notice, Info, etc. Different fields are used by different formats, and maybe someone can clear up which go with which.\n\nBut, you can put your client’s name somewhere in the copyright notice field, as Font Bureau did (still does?). It would require either generating fresh fonts for every client, or decompiling and recompiling (using TTX for example) the fonts with the new info inside.\n\nNote that if you can add this info, your client or a pirate - if they know the tag is there, and are looking to cover their tracks - can remove the tag using TTX or importing, tweaking, and generating the font using a font creation software such as FontLab.\n\n"
