      "content": "Hi Sandy,\n\nI work at Linotype, and we produce and distribute the Avenir typefaces.\n\nAlthough he have a number of Cyrillic typefaces in our library, Avenir does not have a Cyrillic character set or a specific Cyrillic companion. However, depending on your project, you could get some more precise information from our Sales Department.\n\nPerhaps your client would benefit from a custom cut of Avenir that include Cyrillic as well as Roman characters. Or, we might have something that would work well with your needs already, saving the need for custom work; I cannot speak to these specifics myself. But our Sales Department staff can. They are available via e-mail at [info@linotype.com](mailto:info@linotype.com), or by phone at +49-6172-484-418.\n\nI can also try to answer any more general questions you might have here in the forum, but our Sales staff can give you the specific answers you probably need for your client. I recommend getting in touch with them directly.\n\nSincerely,  \nDan Reynolds  \nProduct Marketing Department  \nLinotype GmbH\n\n"
