  "content": "I'm usually pretty good at IDing scripts, but I can't put a name to this one. I thought it might be Burgues, Compendium or Zaner Four, but the characters (especially for the fancy caps) don't seem to match up. This is the first script I've seen with a roman numeral glyph - although that could be faked with three slashes and some extra swashes.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150325071250im_/http:/typophile.com/files/carter_fred_5_6699.jpg)\n\n",
