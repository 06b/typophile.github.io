Thanks for the help Don!! :)))  \nI noticed the 'e' in Futura Extra Bold that's why I posted the picture here to identify the correct font!  \nYou've made quite some work of it! :)  \nThe unstretched version really looks like Futura although I like this 'e' more then the original...\n\nHere's another picture of a different product of that time made by Moog:  \n [http://3.bp.blogspot.com/\\_rScBRKlTdoE/TAGeXU8aV1I/AAAAAAABFyw/sQME7\\_mf4x...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111704/http:/3.bp.blogspot.com/_rScBRKlTdoE/TAGeXU8aV1I/AAAAAAABFyw/sQME7_mf4xU/s1600/P5280013.jpg \"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/\\_rScBRKlTdoE/TAGeXU8aV1I/AAAAAAABFyw/sQME7\\_mf4xU/s1600/P5280013.jpg\")\n\nHere I also like the lowercase 'g' more then in the Futura Extra Bold. The 'y' seems just a bit different too.  \nThe rest seems to be similar when scaling the whole 50%.\n\nThe Ol London font is a nice find too!! Maybe I'll just go for that one!\n\nThanks Don!\n\n"
