Is that the case?\n\nOr is it a case where they are using an unlicensed copy of your font?\n\nWhat you do, or can do, is dependent upon the situation. More information is needed.\n\n"

It is a design and branding company, and Nación, rather than being the name of a typeface, is the name of a housing project for which they're providing a brand identity.\n\nSo they might be _customers_ rather than unfair competitors to the designer of Chiavari, and only garbled web links to this use of the typeface made it seem like that company was in the typeface design business... sort of.\n\n"

I think your best course of action would be to contact Anagrama and provide them with complete documentation that it is your original work being sold to them. If they are like most reputable firms they will quickly back off from using it if that is what you want. They may also provide you with more information as to how they came to use it which might be of help to you.\n\n"

First thing to do is write a firm but gracious letter asking for an explanation, and outlining your expectations. In terms of expectations, I would set a price for Chiavari and put forth that either purchasing it or switching fonts would be acceptable (noting however that your lack of publication does count against you here).\n\nBTW:  \n1: How come you won in 2012 while the font was from 2009?  \n2: They could have also seen it here: [http://typophile.com/node/90125](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123064341/http:/typophile.com/node/90125 \"http://typophile.com/node/90125\")\n\nhhp\n\n"
