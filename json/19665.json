When you look at a sample on myfonts it’s surrounded by white. Also they don’t put those lines behind the fonts as often. I understand why they are there - copyright protection - but still it makes the font harder to view. So when I’m doing a quick font search or just want to look at a sample (unless I have the font and can look at it in my font software) I tend to go to myfonts.\n\nI hope that helps. Like I said, I do my shopping at your site.\n\n(I’ll add that one of the things that bugs me about myfonts is that when you click on the f ont they take you to the “font sample” the cascade, rather than the test drive or the character map which would be more useful.\n\n"
