  "content": "Dear fellow Typophiles,\n\nMy idea is to create a logo that can be used on products and things that are made in Latvia (Northern Europe). Logo has to be easy to print/burn/sew on **any type** of product or thing.\n\n**Here is what I have come up with -- [madeinlatvia.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/madeinlatvia.org/)** ( [initial draft](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/madeinlatvia.org/draft.jpg)).\n\nThings worth knowing:\n\n- Latvia is [located](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia) near the Baltic Sea. It has lots of white sand beaches and [wide open fields with blooming meadows](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/tags/latvia/interesting/) and birch and pine tree forests that take up almost 50% of the territory.\n- Latvians have inhabited that territory since 900 AD, while the recent history made us live _under the flags_ of various foreign superpowers of which the last one was the Soviet Union.\n- Here are some examples of the [traditional folk clothing](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/zagarins.net/Latvjuraksti/Kurzeme-Zemgale/index.html). Most of the design patterns [used in clothing](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/zagarins.net/Latvjuraksti/Krekluraksti/index.html) and [architecture](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/zagarins.net/Latvjuraksti/Z%27ogi_jumti_durvis/index.html) were based in pagan beliefs.\n- A lot of the [today's graphic design](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/www.flickr.com/search/?q=latvian+design&page=2) influence comes from the Soviet times.\n\nConcepts used in the logo:\n\n- _MADE IN_ and the thick line below it forms a Latvian flag (two horizontal stripes divided by one white stripe -- 2:1:2).\n- Typeface design influenced by [Laima chocolate](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/www.laima.lv/) logo, [Sakta department store logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/3.bp.blogspot.com/_EHbf-gkQ3Hc/R6yeCQwPJBI/AAAAAAAACFk/97nolH2WujA/s1600-h/sakta.jpg) and [the Sea](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/evansphoto/494970221/).\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on the typeface and the spectrum of emotions this logo creates. Thank you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [draft.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/typophile.com/files/draft_0.jpg) | 56.81 KB |\n| [made-in-latvia-logo-default.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/typophile.com/files/made-in-latvia-logo-default.png) | 13.17 KB |\n\n",

The idea, however, is that the color accent of the logo can be adjusted to fit the products' color scheme. The particular green comes from [this impression](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/melnaapantera/2700888128/) of the country.\n\nHere it is in burgundy:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140831074239im_/http:/typophile.com/files/made-in-latvia-logo-flag_5266.png)\n\n"
