  "content": "Ok. I need to do this job for my university and i need some help. Skol is the biggest brazilian beer. It has 30% of market share which is 475million litters/year. This is their logo.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042600im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39957.jpg)   \n   \nSkol is considered, above everything, one of the coolest brazilian brands and its target is 18-24 years old. In my opinion this logo is a bit outdated, as far its positioning is concerned. So if you agree how could this brand get a new face? If you don't, how to make this logo look better?\n\n",

Give us something to critique. Showing the current logo and saying that it looks outdated, then asking us how to update it is a bit of a cop out. Do some work\n\n"
