      "content": "To get back to the original question, I hunted through my old PhotoLettering catalog and found a raft of closely related styles to this lettering by lettering artists by the names of C.E. Coryn, Tony Stan and Ed Benguiat (!). One of Coryn's called Coryn Didot had a very similar 'g' except it had a normal 'ear', instead of this straight line. The 'y' was with a much longer, conventional tail. Which brings me to an observation about that y in the copy that Grant liked. Doesn't it look out of character? I think that was 'built' (mutilated) to keep it from cutting into the artwork below.   \n   \nI don't know much about how PhotoLettering's (or their competitors') types were designed and made, but my presumption is that customized versions could probably be ordered the same way you do with digital fonts today.   \n   \nDid Dwiggins do film type? Or is that a silly question? (I suppose a set of good drawings would be what you use for film type or metal type designs, in the era of this ad.)   \n   \nAnyway, if anyone has any old film type catalogs, that might be a place to look for something more like this type.\n\n"

      "content": "Yves, if this is truly hand lettering, it's remarkably consistent. The effect of the lettering in the ad isn't the issue, in my comment about the 'y' -- it's just that that letter seems inconsistent (stylistically) with all the other letters (See the 'y' in the checklist copy? That's probably the normal y for this typeface). I also can't help feeling that it isn't a very attractive typeface, with its mix of rounded and sorta wedge serifs. The overall impression (to me) is a bit like ITC Fenice that couldn't decide what kind of serifs to use -- ruled, teardrop or triangular, so it used them all.   \n   \nI realize such judgments are just my opinion, and I agree that this is wonderful draftsmanship if it is hand-lettered. If it was digital type, I wouldn't buy it for my collection, is all.\n\n"

However i am not so fond of the digitalizing on CD of their music...   \n   \nand sorry Yves for bringing music into this forum!   \n   \n   \nfinally... yes i would buy the automatic Gas range font if it was digital... so watch out Yanega... i may give it a try.. making a digital version of it of my own... and i promise you needn't buy it...   \nand Thanx for a great comment about the lettering and y's   \nThis is why i like being here at Typophile! Here's so much knowledge and interesting posts + posters..   \n   \nand i think the y rocks... because it is so different from the others. even looks a little Hebrewish letter..\n\n"

I like oddities in type at least as much as the next person, it's just \\*this\\* type that doesn't appeal to me. My favorites types are ones that look hand-drawn, but that doesn't mean I like ALL hand-drawn types equally well. In fact part of the problem for me is that is \\*doesn't\\* look hand-drawn, because it is so precisely done. Goudy designs have 'irregularities', this one just has things that look out of place (to me).   \n   \nIt's OK for us not to be unanimous in adoring this lettering isn't it?   \n   \nBTW, nice paste -up of my name .

I thought we were all friends here, but usually when I got called 'Yanega' instead of Mike it was in work and/or in annoyance.   \n   \nSome hand-drawn fonts I like are those by the late Phill Grimshaw (Kallos, Obelisk, Tempus and a list of script fonts), Timothy Donaldson (Humana family and a list of script fonts) and Carold Twombly (Lithos and Nueva).   \n   \nThe Photo-Lettering Catalog is called \"Alphabet Thesaurus Nine Thousand\" and is copyright 1960, published by Photo-Lettering & Rheinhold Publishing. It breaks the works of about 120 lettering artists into 58 categories, in 18 major style groupings, spread over 740 pages. The only bad thing about it is that the type showings are not complete typefaces -- they are just lettering samples. I bought it from Oak Knoll Books, a great source of font treasures.\n\n"

I suppose the curve could have gone the other way and made a cup on top of the stem. Why couldn't you make your own Y, and what would it look like?   \n   \nIf there are too many Mike's for you, you could call me \"Fishboy\", which is a nickname I use. (I have always been a fish classification fanatic, and I have as many books on fish as I do on fonts. It's no coincidence that I picked Bowfin as part of my business' name -- the Bowfin is the sole surviving member of an ancient, once widespread family of fishes (Amiidae) that arose in the Jurassic era. They still thrive in the Eastern part of the US. Even though I moved to the West, I can relate to a fish like that.) :-)\n\n"
