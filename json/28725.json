  "content": "Hi,\n\nMy unit (publications) is participating in a University-wide endeavour to measure success. In short what this means to me is that I have to provide my supervisor with the criteria by which he is to measure my personal success, as well as suggestions on how to measure the success of our unit as a whole.\n\nSo I'm wondering how you all are measured or evaluated in your jobs. What elements are taken into consideration? It would be most useful for me to hear from people who hold editing/proofreading and page layout positions. Obviously, certain factors will be company-specific (ensuring that the success is in line with company goals), but what else? Is your performance evaluated based on how correct the publications are? How many typos slip by? What about measuring success at being creative?\n\nAny input would be appreciated!\n\nThanks,  \nKristina\n\n",

I suspect things like cost control and \"customer service\" are much more important (to them) measures.\n\nLinda\n\n"

He told me that the test was like the math problems of old, i.e., a scenario is given whereby such and such person purchases a certain number of items, etc., and the proofing test involved finding numerous repeated items such as too many or too few spaces between words and sentences, numbers that should have been spelled out, Romans that should have been Italics and vice versa, and misspelled words. Apparently $40K was too much to ask.  \nI am not sure if this was the place but you could try them, [http://srcweb.berkeley.edu/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110814213430/http:/srcweb.berkeley.edu/ \"http://srcweb.berkeley.edu/\")\n\n"

I do, however, work on a contract basis so have to keep reapplying for my job year after year, so I would imagine that if I sucked then I wouldn't get rehired.\n\nI tend to measure my own success by whether the client is satisfied with their job, if it's delivered on time and if it's something that looks professional, is a bit special and functions well, vague huh. I am annoyed if I take too much time for a job that should be done more quickly, I am even more annoyed if I take more time and the result still sucks. I worry that sometimes jobs I would like to (and need to) be giving more attention to suffer because of other more pressing (but ultimately less important) jobs that monopolise time.\n\nMy employer probably mostly emphasises time = money and likes to see things done efficiently but she also appreciates that good design/typesetting/editing takes time and is not overbearing about the former but gently (thank God) reminding of my real world obligations. She is also very encouraging about design that she appreciates which usually matches my own tastes.  \nhope this helps\n\n--N\n\n"

Does the publication’s design/language fit its intended purpose?\n\nAre my writing, editing and designs up to the standard of excellence the University wishes to project?\n\nAccuracy  \nDo my publications contain errors and typos? How many? What (if any) impact do my errors have, financially or otherwise? Have I done my best to ensure accuracy?\n\nAdaptability and responsiveness  \nAm I flexible and able to adapt to new/changing technology, methods, and target audiences as required, and within reason? Do I set reasonable limits?\n\nDo I use creativity in solving problems?\n\nDo I strive to improve? Do I improve? Does my work address/correct issues raised with previous publications? Do I correct my mistakes and take steps to ensure similar errors do not recur?\n\nOverall contribution  \nHow am I to work with? Am I flexible (again, within reason) with regards to work schedules and tasks? Do I assist the team or do I hinder? Do I set necessary limits?

(I believe K. was submitting the faculty booklets in an award competition of some kind. This kind of response can tell us how we measure up against our peers, whether others in the industry think we’re doing a good job or not.)\n\n5-Self and peer evaluations.\n\n6-Checking admission statistics against the unit’s target areas for adjustments to be made in the future.

      "content": "Might be a little verbose -- I'd be tempted to turn \"contribute to or hinder\" into simply \"contribute to\" -- but certainly a good start.\n\nThe \"Are my writing, editing and designs up to the standard of excellence the University wishes to project?\" makes me a little nervous, though: if there's an extensive style manual that is rigourously adhered to, fine, but if there isn't, it become a pretty amorphous concept.\n\nI'd also want to see something in there that also mentions cost-effectiveness: for example, you find a way to do a great piece by creatively imposing it to print one side one colour and the second side four, instead of both sides four, and save a ton of money in the process. Doesn't hurt to qualify being able to improve the bottom line.\n\nAs someone once remarked to me, \"The person wanting this job done will want you to do it fast, right, and cheap. Always tell them they can only have two.\" Might as well get credit if you can get close to three.... ;-)\n\nFWIW, I don't envy you having to do this: I know it's the backlash from Enron, but trying to wring \"accountability\" from intellectual and creative processes seems to frequently result in a lot of BS. That's not to say that there shouldn't be some way to objectively measure the difference between two employees, but all this palaver about \"excellence\" simply strikes me as the latest management fad proposed by someone else with a book to flog.\n\nAnyone else remember TQM?\n\nLinda\n\n"

Sounds like MBA-buzzword-BS to me...\n\n_if I don’t provide the guidelines by which to assess my success, someone else will, and it may be along the lines of x number of mistakes gets me canned._\n\n\"x number of mistakes\" is not a measure of success: it's a measure of failure. Héctor is entirely correct: measuring success depends entirely upon setting goals and achieving them. Goals, according to standard MBA-buzzword-BS criteria, must be...\n\n- specific;\n- measurable; and\n- attainable.\n\nEach project is different; each project has different goals. Ideally, the person who hands you the project should draw up his or her OWN list of goals, and your success should be measured against how well you do or don't achieve THOSE goals. If you don't have a clear idea of what you're supposed to accomplish in the first place, you shouldn't be held accountable if the end product doesn't meet (or _exceed_, to continue the buzzword-BS argument) the requisitioner's expectations.\n\nOf course, this approach requires extra work from the people who want work from you, and it requires that their goals meet the criteria listed above. Chances are, even if you were to institute this regimen, you would have a difficult time getting complete, accurate and realistic information from your internal clients...which is why I said, at first, that it sounds like MBA-buzzword-BS to me...lofty, commendable, proactive, but basically marketing hype, and nothing else.\n\n"
