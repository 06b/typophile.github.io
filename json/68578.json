According to [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018053546/http:/www.linotype.com/6093/neueswift.html) on the Linotype site, Unger designed Swift 2.0 (now distributed by ParaType), which was refined into Neue Swift, as an Open Type design for Linotype.\n\nAs I read it the variations are very minor, and were made because of certain shortcomings of the URW Ikarus digitization tool first used to digitize Swift.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
