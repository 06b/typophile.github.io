It’s a nice combo of evoke (to produce or suggest through artistry and imagination a vivid impression of reality: a short passage that manages to evoke the smells, colors, sounds, and shapes of that metropolis.) and invoke (to call for with earnest desire; make supplication or pray for: to invoke God’s mercy.)\n\nI think evoke was more what you had in mind.\n\n"

This typeface family is the most humanistic sans serif design ever to come from Adrian Frutiger, and it has an interesting twist: lapidar alternates that may be surfed through with the help of OpenType-savy applications.</cite>\n\n"
