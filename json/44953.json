The art area is huge — about 6 feet by very tall — but the sentence has to be readable on the sidewalk and I don't know, across the street?\n\nThe sentences, about one each per window, are memories about the history of an area in the city, winning contest submissions. They'll also be part of an inside exhibit, and later a book. So history, first person voices, collective memory, lyric-poetry type stuff.\n\nI like the feel of Filosofia and Mrs Eaves italics for this, even ITC Century roman — but the first 2 are definitely not strong enough for across the street viewing. I need something strong and quirky. With multiple weights?\n\nSuggestions?\n\n",

You'd be safe and no doubt successful using it.\n\nI saw a window installation I liked the other day, the whole window was frosted glass and the type itself was left clear with a lot of negative space around it. Similar dimensions to your's as well, 6x6 Feet and the text was set in about 900pt.\n\n"

Consider the average height of a viewer/cars and other obstructions and placement/visibility above this level, contrast of the color in relation to the coatings/color of the glass and how the color of the glass can change based on viewing position. Sometimes a pearlized reflective vinyl can shift from neg. to reverse as the sun sets and the environment changes.\n\nFolowing Dave's direction, you could look at Lucida Fax. I've used Apex new in a similar situation, but I was following the lead of an existing book design.\n\n"

Since this is a quote - should we have quote marks around it?  \n3. Since MJ is the source - it should be a 1/m dash - with no space between the 1/m and the MJ\n\nand while I'm on it - since the second line has all that white space, it should be alright to move the source of the quote up one line. If this is large for display, and you want to fill three lines, I'd like to recommend then centering the source. Just a design thing.\n\nOtherwise, it's done! And fine!
