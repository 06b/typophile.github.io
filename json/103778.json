  "content": "I came across this a few years ago in a museum exhibiting a few pages from a 1950s edition of Picasso's bullfight drawings. Being no fan of either Picasso or bullfighting, the thing I found most interesting about this was the titling face used on the front page, particularly its `U`, which has its »straight« top part and its curved bottom clearly separated, and this separation empasised by serif-like hook-ish embellishments on both sides.\n\nThe guards interfered my trying to take a picture of it, but I found this blurry one online, from someone selling their edition for €6000,-.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014125500im_/http:/images02.olx.es/ui/4/39/91/1348309572_436853891_2-La-tauromaquia-de-picasso-Malaga.jpg)  \n [http://ciudadmalaga.olx.es/la-tauromaquia-de-picasso-iid-436853891](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014125500/http:/ciudadmalaga.olx.es/la-tauromaquia-de-picasso-iid-436853891 \"http://ciudadmalaga.olx.es/la-tauromaquia-de-picasso-iid-436853891\")\n\nWith some imagination, you may be able to see the hooks. If you can't, there's a poor man's (i.e. my) re-creation of it in the attachment.\n\nI'm not really looking for a digital equivalent of it; I'm rather interested in everything you may have to share about this face, and this particular style feature, about other faces that implement it, etc...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PicassoTitlingHookU.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014125500/http:/typophile.com/files/PicassoTitlingHookU.png) | 3.64 KB |\n\n",
