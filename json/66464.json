I considered this for Scotch Modern (the face shown in the examples here), but abandoned the idea as inappropriate.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033938im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tails3_5225.png)\n\nHowever, I am presently designing a more swashy typeface, and will include swash tails on tse and shcha.

      "content": "Interesting question. I doubt these non-Slavic Cyrillic letters ever used swash descenders, but I don't know much about them at all. I'd appreciate any information as well.\n\nAs for the De, even though the descending strokes end up looking similar to those of Tse or Shcha, I think of the underlying strokes as being fundamentally different. Taking away the descending strokes on De altogether would be extreme, but it will still be read as a De. But the strokes in Tse and Shcha are essential, and in the latter case it is the only element that distinguishes it from a Sha. It's like the tail of Q, which may be the only flamboyantly swashy detail in an otherwise sober Latin text design.\n\nIn swashy calligraphy, the De may acquire spectacular tails: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/7333287@N07/4062666519/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033938/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/7333287@N07/4062666519/) Of course, the handwritten form of lowercase de has a large tail, being superficially similar to a handwritten \"g\". But they feel out of place in designs for text.\n\n"
