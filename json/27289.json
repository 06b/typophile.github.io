I'm too lazy to draw them, didn't really have time to do it, so I started to look. But, then I remembered that Miguel (Sousa) had pointed us toward [some very handy scripts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060456/http:/rj-graffix.com/software/scripts.html) on another thread here at Typophile. I probably saved myself about 4 hours in using this script. :^) All I had to do was drag the folder of images from the desktop directly into InDesign (all import at 100% with the frames fitting the content), move the pictures around on the page to maximize the print area, select all the images on the spread, double-click on the script, select how I want them, click apply. Magic!!!\n\n",
