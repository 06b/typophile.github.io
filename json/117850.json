I find blackletter strangely beautiful (I say \"strangely\" because typically I admire legibility, and blackletter tends away from that ideal) but I have real difficulty classifying them into one of the four major families. (And then there are modern blackletters, which sometimes don't fit into any of them!) Part of my hope is that by looking at designs with certain constraints (like the monowidth or monoline mentioned) then I would better be able to identify the elements that are essential to that style. I'm still trying to learn about their history, as the difference between historical and contemporary letter forms, for example, still throws me. It can be hard to compare apples to apples.\n\nFurthermore, I like to include a healthy range of math symbols in my own designs, and I'm never able to make fitting ℭ/ℌ/ℑ/ℜ/ℨ because I don't understand them.\n\nAll that said, I'm looking for blackletter specimens to study, starting with fraktur. If someone has developed their own mnemonic system for quickly classifying blackletters, I'd be all ears.\n\n"

Georg Seifert tried to answer the question how Fraktur typefaces would have looked like today, if they hadn’t fallen out of fashion. In Georg’s hands, the old Teutonic letterforms had to undergo the same stylistic shifts and transformations as Roman typefaces did: less ornamentation, a simplified construction, and a drastically reduced contrast. The result is a “grotesque” monolinear blackletter, Rostrot, and its “seriffed” sister style with some contrast, RosenRot.
