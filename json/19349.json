He has designed and published several types through [International Typeface Corporation](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230756/http:/typophile.com/wiki/International%20Typeface%20Corporation) (ITC), [Bitstream](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230756/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bitstream), [T-26](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230756/http:/typophile.com/wiki/T26) and [Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204230756/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Linotype).
