My favorite part was also the name; my name being Penn, it seemed to be the perfect name for my design company. Sadly, however, after doing a little research on the name, I came up with a few other conflicting organizations / companies.\n\n1. William Penn University’s literary magazine is called Penn & Ink [http://www.wmpenn.edu/Academics/DivisionsAreasofStudy/Humanities/English...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122044036/http:/www.wmpenn.edu/Academics/DivisionsAreasofStudy/Humanities/English/PennInk/tabid/161/Default.aspx \"http://www.wmpenn.edu/Academics/DivisionsAreasofStudy/Humanities/English/PennInk/tabid/161/Default.aspx\")  \n2. There is a publishing company called Penn & Ink publishing [http://pennandinkpublishing.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122044036/http:/pennandinkpublishing.com/ \"http://pennandinkpublishing.com/\")  \n3. Pennandink.com is registered to Penn & Ink communications [http://pennandink.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122044036/http:/pennandink.com/ \"http://pennandink.com/\")  \n4. Similarly, if you search on google penn and inc (note the inc not ink), there is another design site coming soon under that title. (Even if it is crappy design, it’s still got a similar title and similar vocation as an organization) [http://pnidesign.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122044036/http:/pnidesign.com/ \"http://pnidesign.com/\")\n\nIt seems my title is dead in the water. If you guys don’t think that these companies are reason enough to give up the name, I have a question about domain names. I checked the domain: [www.penn&ink.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122044036/http:/www.penn&ink.com \"www.penn&ink.com\") and nothing came up, but I’m wondering if having an ampersand in a web address is possible. Is it?\n\nOnce again, thanks guys for all your help.\n\n"
