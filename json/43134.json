As I’m new perhaps someone could point me in the right direction if it isn’t.\n\nI have to produce a Greek report where the required font is Frutiger LT 45 Light. I understand there was a Frutiger LT Greek a few years ago. Does anyone know where I can purchase this?\n\nIf not, can anyone recommend a Greek font that looks very similar and where I may purchase that? Many thanks.\n\n",

They both have Greeks, though, so you could check them out. Depending on your system and or software, you may already have these fonts installed anyway.\n\n"

Here are links to [Myriad](http://web.archive.org/web/20110317142817/http:/www.linotype.com/1257/myriad-family.html) and [Segoe](http://web.archive.org/web/20110317142817/http:/www.ascendercorp.com/msfonts/segoeUI.html).\n\nThe Myriad fonts on the site that I linked to include Greek in their character sets. If you want to license Segoe, I think you have to e-mail Ascender at via the link on the page I linked to.\n\nNote that some Myriad fonts come with many Adobe and applications, and the OpenType Pro versions have Greek. Also, Segoe is the system font on Windows Vista, so if you are running current Windows, you should have that.\n\n"
