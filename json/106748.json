  "content": "This beeing my first post:  \nHello everybody!\n\nI'm an architecture student and this is the first time I'm really dealing with typography. It's only a very basic draft supposed to show the characteristics of a font I want to create myself, as I can't seem to finde anything comparable that tries this fusion of geometric structure and \"contemporary\" spurless details.  \nIf you know any existing font with these features, please tell me - there has to be one somewhere.  \nAnyway, please feel free to tell me, wether you think this is a project I should push further or if it is completely hopeless - architects tend to think they can do everything on their own and end up in a massive mess.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [draft-01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043430/http:/typophile.com/files/draft-01.jpg) | 729.6 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "These are the letters so far. I'm by far the least satisfied with \"hmnu\" as they seem way too curvy allthough following the design principles of the rest.  \nThe beziers of the \"s\" are a bit messy, I'm afraid, as I constructed them in my CAD software to blend the curves of two circles and then imported them in illustrator where I designed the rest of the letters. I may be lacking the knowledge to do it in entirely in FontForge or the appropriate software ...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043430im_/http:/typophile.com/files/alphabet_4062.jpg)\n\n"

I will definitly try this.  \nBut I happen to like the \"g\" and especially the \"r\" as they bring something sharper to the whole thing and I don't like the way the \"r\" is treated in most spurless fonts. I have to admit the \"f\" and \"j\" are rather problematic though.  \nStill think the worst part are \"hnmu\" and I have not yet figured out how to deal with them.  \nConcerning the optical tricks:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043430im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_5069.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414043430im_/http:/typophile.com/files/n_5515.JPG)\n\nPlease don't pay any attention to kerning etc.! ;)\n\n"
