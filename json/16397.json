The logos need to be very well known, like coca cola, google, etc… because I live in chile and the logo needs to be known over here.\n\nI also have my doubts regarding some logos I have, I don’t know what font they are or in what category of the classification they belong, thats why I added an attachment with the logos in case anyone could ID them.\n\nCould you help me?\n\nso far I have:  \n-venetian: Chivas Regal, berkeley old style  \n-Garalde: ??  \n-Transitional: ??  \n-Didone: Calvin Klein, bodoni  \nSlab Serif: m&m, rockwell\n\nSans Serif  \n- Grotesk: government of chile logo  \n- Neo-grotesk: Toyota  \n- Geometric: ??  \n- Humanist: Saab\n\nBlackletter  \n- Textura: ??  \n- Rotunda: ??  \n- Schwabacher: ??  \n- Fraktur: Corona?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [examples.jpg](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=examples.jpg) | 113.16 KB |\n\n",
