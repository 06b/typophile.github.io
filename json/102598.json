All the talk about scribes and pens lead me to wonder what effect the ball-point pen has had on type. Does anyone \\*like\\* the writing from ball-point pens? Can we blame/credit it for the proliferation of sans-serifs? Etc.\n\n",

      "content": "One big aesthetic and functional advantage of the broad-nib pen is its ability to generate stroke contrast (even though that was essentially dumb luck). Which to me however does not mean it deserves pride of place in type design.\n\nBTW there was actually a historic, long-running discussion between Nicolete Gray and Gerrit Noordzij about the relevance of the ball-point pen versus the broad-nib pen. Gray's position was that the ball-point pen is (or rather, was) the tool of our time. All I have to say is: now that we're back to the index finger I hope our typefaces don't start looking like they were made in pre-school!\n\nhhp\n\n"

And the ball point pens of the time leaked, too.

      "content": "Charles, I think the chronology is wrong for the ball point pen to have been a force, at least early on. Sans were first used for text in Germany, by the Bauhaus and then others as part of the modernist movement there. My own pet theory is that this was partly a nationalist thing: a way for German designers to reject blackletter for text, while not appearing to be traitors to foreigners, who had used roman style text for centuries. They weren't aping Italians or French, but rather becoming 'International'. The internationalism also matched the socialist ideals, which many modernists had allegiance to.\n\nBall point pens didn't become widely used until after WWII: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint\\_pen#History](http://web.archive.org/web/20140730174254/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen#History \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint\\_pen#History\") . So they could have conceivably helped ease the acceptance of the 'international style' that had started in the German speaking world. But they couldn't have been the thing that started it.\n\nThere are now plenty of scripts and lettering influenced by the ball point pen, but they don't seem to be all that popular.\n\n"

Also in Germany I believe that a lot of scientific writing was published in roman script, even while black letter still dominated elsewhere. So probably those technical and scientific captions would have been done in roman style, rather than fraktur, right?\n\nGiven that pencils go back to the 16th century, it is interesting that the thin monoline script never, it seems, became a model for printing.
