  "content": "Does anybody know of a tool that can work to analyze font-family designations in website CSS files? I'm planning a web design study to look at design aspects and trends in a group of websites. I'm trying to find a way to extract CSS font-family: values in some automated (or at least efficient) manner.\n\nThis would probably involve analyzing the Document Object Model (DOM) for web sites, specifically based on CSS files. The Web Developer Toolbar for Firefox has some tools, but none are squarely focued on font faces. For color analysis, the tool [Colorzilla](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203150017/http:/www.colorzilla.com/firefox/) does just the trick. I'm looking for something like Font-familyzilla.\n\nIt's my first time at this site, so excuse me in advance if this is off-topic.\n\n",
