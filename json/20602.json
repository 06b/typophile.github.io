  "content": "OK. This is a rather big challenge, further complicated by the fact that I can't find a representative image online, but here goes...\n\nI'm hoping someone can give me an exact match for the heavy sans serif typeface used in the original title sequence to Jacques Demy's film, \"Les Parapluies de Cherbourg.\"\n\nNOTE: This is /not/ the same face used in posters or packaging (whether vintage in the original French or translated later into English as \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\"). The title sequence may in fact be handlettered, but I suspect it is based upon some grotesk that we may all know. I haven't been able to get stills from the sequence into my system yet, but until then, here's a quick (albeit small) sample:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818093811im_/http:/typophile.com/files/umbrellascherbourg01_3744.gif)\n\nI hope someone will be familiar enough with this classic to help me (or will have the DVD in his/her collection).\n\nSorry if this is a stumper...\n\n--Michael.\n\n",

If someone has the video or DVD, they could run through the credits.\n\nIMHO -- Roger Excoffon was still very much alive and active during the production of the film in 1964, and I can't imagine the producers not \"tipping the hat\" to or not directly consulting someone as well known and respected in France as Mr. Excoffon.\n\nThat leads me to speculate that the film title may have been done from a modified version of Antique Olive (Nord), specifically customized for film, as it visually reads and repros differently from print. It was easy enough in those days to create a filmstrip font for a photo headliner machine, so a custom photo font for optical titling is my best guess.\n\nIt may also account for the variations in print titles and posters, as Mr. Excoffon (if he did it), or the person who actually designed it, had only one specific application using the only font created. If your sample of the film's title was the only occurence of that face, then I would say it could have been produced as a one-off by hand. But if the rest of the credits used the face, then it was produced as a customized filmstrip for a photo-headline device. That's my best guess.\n\n"
