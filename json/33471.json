I am looking for a new challenge -- something with different requirements from _Alice_.\n\nYou are invited to help me choose a the text for the project. This text should be in the public domain and of a reasonable length -- the complete works of Shakespeare or the Bible would, therefore, not be appropriate suggestions. I will consider works for which illustrations in the public domain are available if the illustrations have a different function from the one's in _Alice_, e.g., if they are an integral part of the text.\n\n",

Poetry might be an interesting challenge; if anyone has other suggestions to make, now is the time. Beowulf and Chaucer are _way_ out of my league, though.\n\nAs for the story you've started to write, make it 25,000 words long and I'll consider it.\n\n"
