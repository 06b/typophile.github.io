      "content": "How do you pronounce that word? Is it Spanish? Because in English, in my head, it sounds a lot like regurgitate. That's really not a good association for a religious media company!\n\nAs far as design, the top one looks like jack-o-lantern teeth. Or an earthquake. I don't see the media or religious angle at all.\n\nThe bottom one has more potential, but the white letters are illegible. Brutal truth? Sound waves are incredibly overused. As a rule I never use anything in a logo that's a standard icon already.\n\nHave you though about doing a simple logotype alone instead of a mark? IMO, PR companies are best served by classy, understated typography alone. Due to the dynamic nature of promotional work, far too many media companies use trendy graphics that don't stand the test of time. Just my opinion.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi,  \nThe name is extremely bizarre! Is it a purposefully misspelled name to protect your/client's confidentiality? If not, what's the rationale behind it?  \nIn addition, sound waves are a rather over-used icon. However, I do think that the sound waves in the first version are an slightly unusual take on the sound-waves idea, suitably different to overcome the straightforwardness. It is a specifically Christian media company: do you want this to come across in the logo?  \nWhen designing a logo, I find it useful to consider how it will look in black & white (B&W only, not grayscale) - this will help you create a clear and uncluttered design. In fact, I'm working on something at the moment where this idea would've saved me trouble now, see the thread on Cupcakes!)  \nHope this helps,  \nH\n\n"
