  "content": "Double Drat!   \n   \nAn uncomplete set of letters that I created. The inspiration is turn-of-the-century (mostly from France) posters, specifically those of Charles Loupot. Realizing the recent release of Mostra, I wanted to at least get these noticed and seen. They were created several months ago and owe nothing to Mostra, but everything to Loupot. (That is not to say that I do not appreciate Mostra.) One thing I do like about these letters is their imperfection. Feeling more hand-drawn as opposed to done on the computer using a grid and strict guidelines.   \n   \n ![loupot.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416063510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/981.gif)   \n ![alter01.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416063510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/982.gif)  \n ![alter02.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416063510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/983.gif)  \n ![alter03.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416063510im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/984.gif)\n\n",
