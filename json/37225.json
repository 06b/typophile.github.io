      "content": "My first imulse was to say 'hand-drawn', but on closer inspection it could certainly be an OpenType font with alternate endings. I agree this style is like Jill Bell's work, but Ronna Penner (Typadelic) also has this feel at times in her fonts. In fact, it somewhat resembles her [Black Jack](http://web.archive.org/web/20141230010921/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/black-jack/), which is a free font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you so much. I agree it looks a lot like Black Jack. I also found a font with similar characteristics called Liorah [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/liorah/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141230010921/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/liorah/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/liorah/\") that looks like it might work if I squish it a bit. Thanks to all!\n\n"
