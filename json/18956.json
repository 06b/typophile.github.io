I wouldn’t like to see MyFonts sued for plagiarism of silence, although it would make for great publicity.\n\nA friend of mine had a Chicago college radio show in the early 1990s, and devoted an entire show to playing and commenting on different recordings of 4′33″. Very, very funny. ’Ah, now this version is my favourite....’\n\n"
