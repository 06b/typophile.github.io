Cookbooks are really complicated and you should look at as many as you can to figure out what is and is not successful. They really have to be functional as well as attractive and you'll see pretty quickly which ones manage to be both.\n\nFor one thing, I think the ingredients need to stand clearly apart from any other text elements (headnote, directions, tips). People use them to make their shopping list and if they are buried in the recipe or not designed well they can be confusing. They are usually easier to read flush left/rag right than centered. Also, try to make the recipes fit on a single page or spread. It's a drag to have to turn the page mid recipe when your fingers are wet or sticky.\n\n"

Something that will complement rather than detract.\n\nSo truth be told, I don't think any suggestions at this point would help you, the client, the designer, anyone. A good manuscript with careful thought out page layout along with photos if there are any would be the starting point for selecting a typeface or two.\n\nP.S.
