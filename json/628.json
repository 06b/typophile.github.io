It sounds suspicious to me.   \n   \nThe creation of Bell Centennial was made necessary because of the switch from hot-metal Linotype to Cathode Ray Tube technology. The traps were introduced to compensate for effects of CRT exposure and ink spread on cheap paper. The early CRT technology was basically like bitmaps; there was no such thing as smooth, device-independent outlines. Matthew drew the letterforms for Bell Centennial, laboriously, on quadrille (graph) paper. Any given notch might be comprised of maybe 8 or 10 \"pixels\" -- not really enough resolution to model them after much of anything.   \n   \nI can't say definitively that they weren't modelled after glass crimps, but I find it doubtful.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
