I know of one sample (a logo design that I am not yet at liberty to display; portion of it shown) and many online mentions regarding its similarity to Eras-if-it-had-serifs. It is actually quite different from Basilia. If I can sleuth out the foundry, I'll repost.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019004958im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cinema_basilea_5295.jpg)\n\n"

Please let me know. All I have now is printed in an old Andresen Typographics (L.A.) font showing catalog. I don't have autotrace, but do have an old Fontographer 4.x for mac OS 8.6 but have never used it. If I did, what licensing issues would I encounter? Could I alter the letterforms slightly and rename it and make it available?\n\n"
