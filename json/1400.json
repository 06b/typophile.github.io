The job requires some extremely tight registration for a small die cut detail and some letterpress. Please let me know if you have any low run quality craftsman in the LA, Orange County or Riverside County areas of Southern California. I appreciate any contacts you can give me in the next 24 hrs.   \n   \nMahalo,   \nScott\n\n",
