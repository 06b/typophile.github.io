  "content": "Hi Everybody.\n\nI just uploaded some Pics of my new Project.  \nI'm really interested in your Opinion. Right now it was like one complete Week ok Work an i think i want to finish it in one month.  \nLower and Uppercase follow different Rules. The lowercase is much more »scriptlike« than the uppercase.  \nI really like this difference but wanted titling-featues for some of the uppercase characters. I think there will be an titl and a final version for every lowercase letter plus a bunch of ligatures.\n\nFeel free to coment. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426231642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/promo_blog_02_a_4034.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426231642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/promo_blog_02_b_6233.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426231642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/promo_blog_02_c_6029.png)\n\n",
