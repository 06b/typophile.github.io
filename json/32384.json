If I try to use any less space, the text disappears and I just see a red dot in place of it. Am I doing something wrong, or is this just Indesign forcing me to use what Adobe’s developers thought was a good minimum height for rows?\n\n [‹ AFDK 2.0 Fix Startpoints](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200539/http:/typophile.com/node/32331 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How to create subcategory typeface in font lab ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200539/http:/typophile.com/node/32356 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
