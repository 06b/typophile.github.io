After the copy header (or what do you call it) there is also a space on the right side, automatically added by indesign. Is this decent typography or should i try to align the right row with the top of the body header?\n\nThis is one big text box by the way with paragraph styles.\n\nThank you,  \nAlexander\n\n",
