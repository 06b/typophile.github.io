  "content": "So, I was wearing last year's Typophile Tee at a local coffee shop last night (Farley's for those of you in San Francisco) and a guy came up to me and said, \"Why would are you wearing a California Job Case on your chest?\" I was floored. It's the fist time since I've been wearing this shirt that someone actually knew what it was (my desiger friends of course recognize it in general, my students, sadly, do not).   \n   \nI've had many comments on the shirt, including \"nice shirt, I love Mondrian,\" but that was the first time the design has been \"outed.\" I thought I'd share, on the eve (I think) of the new shirt being announced.   \n   \nHopefully it gives Graham a little tickle...\n\n",

Typo_phile_ not typo_philia_!\" Once that was cleared up we talked about the site briefly and I urged him to check it out. It turns out he used to run a print shop and now has the entire thing (three presses and who knows how many tons of type) in storage. He does AutoCad now.   \n   \nWe discussed about the possibility of him starting up again or deciding to sell the equipment. A good friend of mine bought that press that was posted on typographi.ca earlier this year (I seem to be quite the hook-up artists), so we talked about that for a bit too.   \n   \nOf course, I don't go anywhere without a stack of self promo books, so I gave him one of those and wrote your URL on the inside front cover. (I feel it's only right that I split my commission on hos memebrship with Graham, since his shirt was the catalsyt for the whole interaction. ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123029im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif))   \n   \nSpeaking of, congrats Mr. Hicks, on winning the contest.\n\n"
