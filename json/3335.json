  "content": "Doggy Overnight Bag is to be a small kit that's placed in hotel rooms that are pet friendly. It will contains things such as a dog blanket, food & water dishes, dog treats and other such stuff.   \n   \nThey were presented with three different concepts and this is what they're going with. I have some tweaks in mind, but overall I'm pretty pleased with it. I would like help seeing the things I shouldn't be pleased with. I'm sure they're there.\n\n",

      "content": "I like the mark and the type on the second version but the letter spacing needs work. I think you need to take some space between the o and first g out in doggy and please don't crash the y into the g. In Overnight the t is floating and you can crash the ni combination a bit more. In Bag make the B a combination tighter.   \nQuestion: could you have come up with a harder to space font? I remember this font from the 70s and it never set well. If you have time take a look at ITC Caslon 224 Extra Bold, it has character and the color of the letter spacing is much better and it has some of the feel you have here.   \nDid you do a verion of the mark with a black lab and a outline moon? I haven't seen a black moon lately.\n\n"

Do tell.   \n   \nHrant, for what reason does the size of the dog concern you? The illustration goes quite small with the dog still being discernable. I don't think he could sleep comfortably on that moon if he was very much bigger. I will try him as big as I can though (the client also wanted to see this)   \n   \nOle, waggy-tailed g's?
