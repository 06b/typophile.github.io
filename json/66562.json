  "content": "I'm using FF Legato (the lighter weights) for the identity of a jewelry designer – meaning the wordmark is set in Legato, as well as additional bits on the stationery and business card. Now I need to come up with a font (family) to recommend for her correspondence. Assuming that it would be possible to get a style-linked version of Legato (?), I'd recommend it to her for the text as well; and she loves it, but for the text she'd like to see some alternatives too, «maybe something with serifs».\n\nThis would probably have to feel accessible, but not dumb; beautiful, but not _too_ «polished» (see below); rather feminine, but not too wispy and swirly (think correspondence – no book faces); it could go in a slab direction as well, but it can't get brutish. Most importantly, in terms of proportions and «tone», it needs to click with Legato, and not overpower it. It should «feel» like high value.\n\nFWIW her jewelry is beautifully hand-made and not cheap, while individualized and rather nonstandard (although in a subdued/smart rather than a flamboyant way); for example often using locally found rocks in place of jewels, or special kinds of surface treatment. So the font might be subtly «special»/nonstandard too (like Legato is too).\n\nOn the technical side, the font should be available as a style-linked family of 4 for office type use.\n\nIf any fonts pop into your collective minds, I'm all ears. :-)\n\n",
