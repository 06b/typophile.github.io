If you want all pages to be a certain background colour, you could put the boxes (frames) on the master pages. There must be a way to do this with layers too.\n\n"

It's different from the None swatch because it's opaque, hence white. I don't understand why they don't just call it \"White\". You can't modify the Black swatch, it's just black, but you can modify this Paper swatch. You can also create a similar no color swatch and name it White for simplicity's sake.\n\n"

Then in this little box type the word or words required, and adjust the length of the box as necessary (easiest if you centre the word horizontally in the box). You'll have to shift the box down (it pastes in on the baseline) and adjust the text in it if necessary using baseline shift. The highlighted box will move with the text if you reflow it, though it won't break for a hyphenation. You can copy and paste the box to other places and replace the words.\n\nA bit cumbersome I know. If you know there won't be reflow, just put a coloured box behind the word(s) you want highlighted.\n\nThere's gotta be an easier way!\n\n"

If you apply the highlight to that invisible box (in essence making it visible) then if you change any qualities of that character such as size, leading, tracking or offset, the highlighting will automatically change with it. And Underline and Strikeout prove; it's easy to apply character specific, manually augmentable features.\n\nI'm just speculating of course. Either way, you'd still have to manually tweak the end result to really get it to perfection.\n\n"
