Is there a closer match out there? I'm trying to get it as exact as possible.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ACSCDSDTRK.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141005203930/http:/typophile.com/files/ACSCDSDTRK.jpg) | 30.75 KB |\n\n",

And if you're seeking for some numerous alternate swashes, I strongly recommend [Bookmania](http://web.archive.org/web/20141005203930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania) by Mark Simonson.
