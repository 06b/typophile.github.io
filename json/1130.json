Do some more characters! ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023033430im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

Here's some of the revised characters and a quick toying around with the idea of making a shadow version.

I can see ITC, Lettraset or Image Club (or whatever name they're going by now) carrying this....   \n   \nAnd definitely, include the shadow version. It adds to the flavor and versatility of the family.   \n   \nDavid\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Colin,   \n   \nI like your Ebin font but you came here for critique so I've got some for ya!   \n   \nI can see how you built part of the font based on duplicating the stems to make all the ascenders but I feel it is the wrong direction to take this face.   \n   \nThis type design has a quirky inconsistancy to it that should be enhanced, not normalized or homogenized. I would say put all the letters you've got on one print out and you'll see very easily which ones could use some tweaking to be more expressive and playful.   \n   \nOf the glyphs I would say there are a few that could use a redo g, k, s, and v. Also the x could use a little more weight on one end.   \n   \nOnce the base font is mastered, go nuts with the other versions of the font.   \n   \nAlso, even if it is free, take the time to develop the uppercase, numbers and some symbols for this font. You'll kick yourself later for not learning more from this experiment.   \n   \nCan't wait to see the results!   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for the feedback Stuart, i think you're right about taking it another step to make it more unique. And David, i'm impressed, you picked out the Ren and Stimpy influence with ease. Before i began my education as a graphic designer i was obsessed with animation and of course Spumco's stuff. When i started designing this font it kind naturally took that direction and i went with it (note the ren like g).   \n   \nthanks again, CK\n\n"
