Like many color posters of that era, this one was probably hand-lettered. My eyes aren't as keen as they used to be, but I believe the two lowercase **a**'s are slightly different. The artist was clearly using Gill Sans (1926) as a model. (This poster predates Candara by nearly half a century, and Humanist 521 is Bitstream's brand name for Gill Sans.)\n\n"
