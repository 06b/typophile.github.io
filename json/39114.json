Check out the [list of recent digitized books](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/purl.pt/index/geral/news/PT/indexOD.html), and I’m quite sure you’ll be as hyped as I am now. I mean, look at these beauties [from 1685](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/purl.pt/index/geral/date/PT/1685.html), for example. And this stuff seems to be available for free download in PDF format or [JPG files](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/purl.pt/170/1/P52.html)!!!\n\nHere’s another pearl: [Nova Escola para aprender a ler, escrever, e contar](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/purl.pt/107). This book is where [Dino dos Santos](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Dino%252Bdos%252BSantos) got his inspiration for [Andrade](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/andrade-pro/).\n\nI hope the [Library of Mafra National Palace](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafra_National_Palace#Library) decides to digitize its contents as well...\n\n [‹ Upcoming book/type/print events in Vancouver](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38821 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rethinking historical models ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203185618/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39110 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Add to that, that not all of us are lucky enough to get over there to begin with. That said, when we were at Mafra the library was amazing and it was sad that we couldn’t walk down the great hall. (I’ll have to post a picture to Flickr now.)\n\n"
