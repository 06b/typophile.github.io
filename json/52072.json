  "content": "Hi!  \nI'm doing a little research on the typeface Frutiger.  \nI've read plenty about Adrian himself unfortunately for me I need information about the typeface  \nHe doesnt mention the face Frutiger much, though I have found some information about the typeface he designed for the airport in France called; Roissy which is i think Frutiger but it doesnt say much.\n\nI need a little information on how to distict this typeface (Frutiger) with popular typefaces like Helvetica, Univers(Adrian again), etc. etc.\n\nOr maybe something about its personality.  \nI found a few little companies that use Frutiger on the corporate identity.  \nHowever i'm sure a lot of companies use Frutiger for many things.\n\nAny help will be appreciated, thank you type lovers.\n\n",

      "content": "It’s not simply the blandness of the face, but the way that lack of distinction combines with the generous proportions of the forms and counterforms. Frutiger is a very airy typeface with huge counters and wide letterspacing; its black weight could pass for bold in some families. So it also lends itself to great readability in many circumstances.\n\n"

Unfortunately, they don't have a lot of branded PDFs or anything online; [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023142404/http:/de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bild:Swiss-post.svg&filetimestamp=20080131220237) is their logo, which has actually just recently been tweaked a little, departing from the classic Frutiger lettershapes. I think their web site still has the old one though.\n\nGerman Wikipedia lists a whole slew of companies that use Frutiger [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023142404/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger#Verwendung) – ranging from the [German Army](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023142404/http:/de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bild:Bundeswehr_Logo.svg&filetimestamp=20060916190808) (Bundeswehr) to [a certain failed Swiss Bank](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023142404/http:/www.ubs.com/) (which combines it with Walbaum in their printed matters) as well as [Germany's largest (I think) trade union](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023142404/http:/de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild:Ver_di.svg).  \nEnglish Wikipedia also lists [a few](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023142404/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger#Frutiger_in_Branding).\n\n"
