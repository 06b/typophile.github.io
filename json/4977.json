But I have a huge respect for Sumner's knowledge and would love to learn from him. (I was so bummed when, at the last minute, he couldn't make his presentation to ATypI Boston in 1999.)   \n   \nThe perennial dilemma -- which workshops to choose?   \n   \n-- K.\n\n",

Speaking as somebody who lived there until recently, you absolutely don't want to fly into San Jose, unless you're going to go up to SF with somebody from San Jose.   \n   \nNow it is true that Adobe HQ is about 5 minutes from the SJ airport, so if you know folks from Adobe, there are possibilities there.
