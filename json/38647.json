  "content": "Hi,\n\njust signed-up on typophile and would like some advice from all you good people. I’ve had a go at designing my own creative identity (I’m more of a developer but having spent a lot of time actionscripting in flash I’m feeling the need to become more informed typographically speaking and with graphic design principles too).\n\nHaving moved to Brittany, France, recently I needed a relevant and local ID - et voila! as they say on the rive gauche - “zansal” - pronounced je-on-sal is the Breton word for dansing and (possibly) singing. The dancer is attempting to make a Z sign - this was inspired by a book I read 4 years ago “ABZ more alphabets and other signs” (great book) - the typeface is Bodoni with Helvetica Nueu for the tagline.\n\nHere’s the link: [zansal](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102112246/http:/www.zansal.com/)\n\nNow, I like Bodoni - I really do - but I’m aware of other similar fonts such as Didot or JF Porchez’s Ambroise. Should I stick with Bodoni? With the extra wide setting it looks good on the web even at small point size.\n\nThe tagline might be better in serif? Ideas anyone? I’d appreciate all comments.\n\n [‹ Holiday Inn](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102112246/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38495 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Road Signage Dissertation-Please Help ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102112246/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38445 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
