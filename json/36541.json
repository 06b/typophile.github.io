They are here:\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/sets/72157601705177162/](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012144923/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/sets/72157601705177162/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ebensorkin/sets/72157601705177162/\")\n\nHere’s a sample:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071012144923im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chip_6484.sm.jpg)\n\nThis ’a’ is from the monospace I had critiqued at TypeCon.\n\nI found the experience fascinating. All the materials awareness is amazing. The wrong brass. Your done. Wrong mix of Lead, Tin & Antimony. It’s over. Done. It goes on & on. There are so many ways to go wrong. It really shows you what was involved in getting superior printing. The machines themselves are amazing too. They are hugely precise - to the thickness of cigarette paper, 1/1000th of an inch. And Jim was a very very nice guy.\n\nThanks again Jim!\n\nHere’s hoping you will be at TypeCon in Buffalo.\n\n",
