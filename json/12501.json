This must vary a lot from person to person depending on memories etc. Who knows, you might find some of mine good enough?  \n [http://www.macrhino.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090831142535/http:/www.macrhino.com/ \"http://www.macrhino.com\")\n\n"

I had to recreate the look for a job and used imagery rather than relying on type in the end, the more recent use a flare serif. I think I used Friz Quadrata.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/friz-quadrata-sh/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090831142535/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/friz-quadrata-sh/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/friz-quadrata-sh/\")  \nTim\n\n"
