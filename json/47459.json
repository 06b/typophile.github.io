  "content": "Hi guys,  \ni'm about to work on some visual stuff for a company selling car equipment. I want to design a logotype based on some kind of racing typography but because this is something unusual for me (i'm more into DIN-style typo) i didn't find enough fonts which would match my idea because it should be something motoristic (racing style - see attachment) on one hand but also modern (designed like eg. [http://subtype.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214011320/http:/subtype.org/ \"http://subtype.org/\") and these modern looking fonts) as well...\n\nI would be more than grateful for your suggestions.\n\nThanks a lot,  \ngonee\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [racer.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214011320/http:/typophile.com/files/racer.png) | 3.81 KB |\n\n",
