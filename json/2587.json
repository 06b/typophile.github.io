But that don't make it purdy.   \n   \nCo-branding gone bad.   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018224420im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/23410.gif)   \n   \nI'm not going to bother stepping up to any soap boxes over this one. But it's just more evidence that co-branding, while it may make absolute pefect business sense, rarely looks good. It rarely bolsters either brand's image. (Speaking from purely a visual-branding perspective.)\n\n",
