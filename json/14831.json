Then type “o”, and kern the o underneath the breve.\n\nUnless you are using a glyph-rich OpenType font, which should have that glyph. You can insert it using Character Palette, and Quark should understand it. (I honestly have not used Quark in years for the same reason that I don’t use a horse-and-buggy to get around.)\n\n"
