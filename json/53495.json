      "content": "Oh, and here's the dummy I am currently using (only with select clients, and at smaller point sizes for now)\n\nIt seems that the time has come to create the new dummy text, devoid of any semblance of meaning, whole and utterly unremarkable compilation of dreary nonsense. Cicero's work can only get you so far, as the structure of Latin is rather different, not to mention, that certain letters of the alphabet are omitted all-together. So there you are, plowing through the textura, as stale and boring as most of Milton's poetry, rife with omissions, plagued by horrid grammar, with no horizon in sight.\n\nContrary to popular belief, writing a thoroughly nonsensical copy is a serious challenge, quite comparable to other creative endeavors. A self-referential dummy is even more straining, as the subject gets exhausted quite quickly, leaving you short of synonymous words, or seemly metaphors. There is also a vague fear that some poor demented soul could actually read this dribble, risking their fragile, precious brains exploding into a centillion glittering pieces.\n\nLuckily, in our advanced industrious age of infographics and condensed bullet lists, the likelihood of this tragedy is rather low. Still, I have to warn you, if you are one of the unfortunates tricked into reading this far, you must stop this silliness at once! Go outside, bask in the sun, make a flow-chart, compose an impromptu toast, hold an important staff meeting, pass out the crab-flavored coffee biscuits, but for the love of all that is good and wholesome, don't even think about reading this to the very end, least you suffer the fate far worse then gradual decomposition (a proper, judicially approved and well-recommended manner of passing) and end up a dried-up, prunish sort of being that even Heidegger would not find the time for.\n\nIf you've read thus far, you might be be wondering why none of those horrible things have actually happened. Let me assure you that they have, but the sheer horror and impossibility of them was such, that the reality has split in twine, leaving the original one all crumpled up and laying by a dumpster, while the current copy goes on all primmed and pampered, moving through unbeing with a joyful (though metaphorical) spring in her steps and apples in her (allegorical) cheeks. Incidentally, among other adjustments, the text above has also changed irrevocably so as to prevent anyone from destroying the world. So, once gain, we have a new dummy text, devoid of any semblance of meaning, whole and utterly unremarkable compilation....(Ad infinitum)  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nPersonal Art and Design Portal of Ivan Gulkov  \n [www.ivangdesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130818071328/http:/www.ivangdesign.com/ \"www.ivangdesign.com\")\n\n"
