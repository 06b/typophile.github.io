It was basically showing off their skills in BS—oops I mean public speaking.\n\nThe guy in the video posted by Patty is I don’t know who. The contact person at Stunning Books (they sure stun me!) who supposedly is her publisher is called Martin Rimm. Perhaps the other videos mention who the speaker is, if not him.\n\nI don’t know if it’s the same guy, but there is a Martin Rimm who was an engineering undergrad at Carnegie Mellon who in 1995 wrote an infamous research report about internet pornography, which got into the Georgetown Law Review. But though referred to by Time Magazine and quoted in Congress, it was so bogus that it led to an inquiry and criticism by the Carnegie Mellon faculty. This same Martin Rimm seems to be the author of the book “The Pornographer’s Handbook: How to Exploit Women, Dupe Men, & Make Lots of Money”.\n\nI find all this information strangely reassuring.
