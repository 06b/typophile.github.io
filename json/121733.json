Known as monmouth back then, but the blackletter font now also known as monmouth is completely different so the one I want is difficult to search for... any idea if this font was renamed at some point? Similar fonts accepted...\n\nimage attached\n\nthanks\n\na\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160519im_/http:/typophile.com/files/monmouth_4837.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Stanza \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [riccard0](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317160519/http:/typophile.com/user/46071 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
