The film is beautifully shot and very thoughtful”\n\nFor once I’d like to disagree with you Adam. ;)  \nI purchased the film with great expectations, and yes, maybe Christoph is a professional camera operator and did very poethic shots, but he does not care much about typography or type design. I found that there is an enourmous amount of personal information about Frutiger’s life that I would have easily omitted. I was quite frustrated, as not much from the art of Mr. Frutiger was extracted and too much drama was added.\n\nThis is just my opinion, but I felt like if a great opportunity was lost... a well meritted homage to one of the greatest type designer and a great contribution to type history.\n\nI’ll have to see it again for the third or fourth time, and see if my opinion changes, but I was indeed disapointed...\n\nno one take it personal!  \ncheers,\n\n"

      "content": "Gjubert,\n\nactually, what I liked about the film was that it showed Frutiger as somebody who is much more than “just a type designer”. I think showing typography on film just won’t work and I’m grateful that Christoph did not attempt that. For that, we have Frutiger’s books. But the film beautifully puts together some of Frutiger’s creation in context of the Swiss surroundings, nature and Frutiger’s philosophy. I had hoped that it won’t be a just another “tell me the Frutiger facts that I didn’t know” production because — well, I know quite a few \\*facts\\* so I wasn’t looking for them.\n\nSufficient to say that I was supposed to do a 1.5-hour lecture on Frutiger’s work for a small group of students in Warsaw two weeks ago. On the train, on my way to Warsaw, I watched the film — it has been lying around on my shelf for half a year or so but I only decided to see it in the last moment, so to say. After I watched the film, I immediately decided that I’ll cut my own content of the lecture by half and will show the film to the students. Within one day — when I was already there — I translated and — heh heh — dubbed myself all the commentary into Polish and home-produced a Polish version. It took me about 7 hours, credit to the wonderful Apple GarageBand 3, and it was the first time in my life that I did such a thing :)\n\nThe students loved the film as a complement to my 45 minutes of “Frutiger facts”. I’d like to get the film published in Poland (with my Polish translation) :)\n\nAnother great video that I can recommend is the Golgonooza video ( [http://www.manifoldmedia.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081010131723/http:/www.manifoldmedia.com/ \"http://www.manifoldmedia.com/\") ). It is a documentation of Dan Carr’s punchutting work made by Gahlord Dewald. I liked it as well.\n\nA.\n\n"

I ordered my copy from Linotype  \nand seems to be multiregion, or at least work in the US region code.\n\nOh. Adam,  \nif you wish I could traslate the content to Spanish,  \nso you could add an extra language to the polish new version.  \nI would not mind doing it, but you should have to dubbe it for me. ;)  \nAnyhow I’ll see you in NYC and we can talk more about it.\n\nBUY THIS DVD. IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!\n\nGiovanni Jubert.\n\n"
