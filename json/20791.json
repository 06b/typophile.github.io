  "content": "Can anyone please tell me the name of the font that the \"7\" on a Vegas slot machine is from? I would also like to know where I can download the font if anyone knows where... Here is an example of what the numbers look like that I am looking for at this link [http://www.dafont.com/lucky-ape.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20150302015927/http:/www.dafont.com/lucky-ape.font \"http://www.dafont.com/lucky-ape.font\") I believe the font I am looking for is similar to the font used for the big number \"5\" in the corner of a five dollar bill. Anyway, I would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me out. I've looked for this font all over the internet but, because I don't know the actual name of the font, I can't find it anywhere!!!!\n\nThanks,\n\nMatt\n\n",
