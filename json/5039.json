  "content": "Calling all Typophiles, I need your help.   \n   \nThe company I work for is currently examining its style guide (or lack thereof), which is opening up possibilities for changes.   \n   \nCurrently we use ::shudder:: Condensed Helveticas for titling/ display and Times/ TNR for text. The Helveticas aren't up for debate, but the text face is.   \n   \nWe're a Dutch company, so I'm thinking that along with all of the obvious arguments against Times, I'd use the origin of the type/ designer as secondary leverage and a way to narrow the field a bit.   \n   \nSo, I know some of the foundries, such as DTL and TEFF, and some designers such as Majoor and Smeihjers, but I don't have a voluminous knowledge of Dutch Foundries, designers, and serif faces. What I need is a list to start examining examples from so I can hit them with a list of options that I've culled from a greater one. Any help is very, very much appreciated!   \n   \nThanks for any suggestions.   \n   \nPS: Wim Crouwel might be a bit too avante garde for our needs. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140806205354im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n",

I just picked it up last week in New York and I've been singing its praises to all my designer friends ever since. It's got the rare combination of a substantial amount of text (that is actually interesting to read) and a ton of great images. It's so good, it made me consider going to a grad program in the Netherlands.
