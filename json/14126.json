She designed the icons and [bitmap typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/bitmap%20fonts) and interface icons for use on the original Macintosh computers. In doing so, she invented a language of metaphor and iconography still in use today. She later designed icons and graphics for Windows 3.0 and OS/2. Some of her typefaces, which have become ubiquitous on the Macintosh, include [Geneva](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Geneva), [Chicago](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Chicago), [Monaco](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Monaco), and [New York](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/New%20York). Her contribution to the history of user interface design and personal computing in general cannot be overstated.\n\nSome of her other bitmap type designs are available from [Atomic Media](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Atomic%20Media).  \nLink:  \n [Susan Kare](http://web.archive.org/web/20130920214423/http:/www.kare.com/ \"external link to Susan Kare's website\")\n\n",
