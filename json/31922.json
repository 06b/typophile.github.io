I was thinking of ’more modern’ perhaps not having serifs on the top and bottom, like a heavy weight of Storm’s [Areplos](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907050420/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-56-areplos), but that’s not a Didone style type, if that’s what you wanted.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I don’t really want to change it, but we’ve been discussing making the mark a little more modern looking. I have no problem with keeping the old one, since it is an established and recognizable brand. But at the same time, updating it wouldn’t be so bad either.\n\nHere’s the current mark that has been the identity of the paper for as long as anyone can remember:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907050420im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/gator_4010.jpg)\n\n"
