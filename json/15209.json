I don’t know the name of it, though.\n\nSince they closed their doors a couple of years ago (after selling their SoundJam MP3 player to Apple as a basis for iTunes), I don’t know what’s become of their fonts. Their former web address ( [http://www.casadyg.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080406132911/http:/www.casadyg.com/ \"http://www.casadyg.com/\")) is now one of those horrible generic web portals and has nothing to do with the original organization (not unlike [http://www.typographi.ca](http://web.archive.org/web/20080406132911/http:/www.typographi.ca/ \"http://www.typographi.ca\")).\n\nEdit: Actually, the collection was called “Fluent Laser Fonts” and the font in question was called Calligraphy. More about them [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080406132911/http:/moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/casady_greene/index.htm), including the actual fonts which are apparently in the public domain now.\n\n"

If you want the real thing (which is about a hundred times higher quality) you can get it from [Phil’s Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080406132911/http:/www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=AB80395003P1).\n\n"
