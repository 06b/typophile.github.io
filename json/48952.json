There is an obvious relationship between graphic design and type design, and there are great designers who also design type. There are graphic design type designers such as Johnathan Barnbrook (who may or may not be so great), and House Ind. who are collectively great illustrators and designers, but I have come across many more examples of great type designers with a poorer graphic application. In fact, I have encountered this mostly through links from this website to web pages, or personal work. I think you'll find many of the great graphic designers don't do all that much type design because they are not programmed like that, although, yes, you'll find that each has designed at least one typeface, but they are usually of the graphic kind, not text faces, or faces with huge European sets!\n\n"

I always thought it was _meant_ to be that (it's a somewhat popular logo in geeky circles) but I did wonder why Typophile chose it.\n\nConway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton: a 2-d grid of squares, each one either \"alive\" or \"dead\" (black or white), with rules governing the birth, death and survival of a \"cell\" each timestep, based on the population surrounding it. If you start with a live cells in the configuration of the logo, four timesteps later you have the same configuration one cell north-east of the starting position.\n\n"
