  "content": "I just finished working a preliminary version of Greek for Coruña.\n\nIt looks pretty good to me but I'm sure I've got a lot of mistakes so I figured a pair (or more) of fresh eyes could help me spot any problems with it. The PDF has the modern alphabet and then all the archaic letters and most of the symbols (but not Coptic). I'm a little unsure on some of the archaic letters but from lookin around I think I'm not the only one. Most fonts I've seen have vastly different styles.\n\nUpdate: I'm almost done with a complete range of small caps (yes, even polytonic) which the base alphabet can be seen in the v 0,9b file. I have the full polytonic range done for lowercase and 90% of uppercase so I included that. Italic is done for modern monotonic greek but has no archaic or polytonic (yet). Spacing is greatly improved.\n\nDecember Update: Now switching gears to polishing out the italic and bold. I THINK I might not have made the bold dark enough, but since I've only done the lowercase I figure now is the time to get the comments before I do all of the letters.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Greek Test (v.09a)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417182754/http:/typophile.com/files/corunna_greek_v09a.pdf) | 126.79 KB |\n| [Greek Test (v.09b)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417182754/http:/typophile.com/files/corunna_greek_v09b.pdf) | 138.42 KB |\n| [(Demi)Bold and Italic Test (v.02)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417182754/http:/typophile.com/files/corunna_bold_v03.pdf) | 39.1 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Here's my 2 obols' worth as a nonspecialist. I'm also not a designer, so I'll leave comment on the modern alphabet to those more competent than I am. You may want to check your outline directions, though. I think in general you've done a reasonable job of trying to make up forms that fit the logic of your modern alphabet, considering that there really isn't much to go on for a number of the characters that never existed until very recently, but in some cases the results are a little disconcerting.\n\nSampi is a problem. While I understand the reasons that they decided to separate archaic sampi and modern sampi and then make them both have uppercase and lowercase forms, I think that in practical terms it's completely perverse. The road to hell, etc. Anyway, we're stuck with two characters that never before existed. For your uppercase modern Sampi, I'd suggest making it look a bit less like a flipped euro sign - perhaps tilt it a bit counterclockwise. Your archaic Sampi should have stronger downstrokes on the sides; at the present weight they look more like big serifs than actual strokes. The lowercase modern sampi looks like it has been squashed flat like a bug on a wall; normally there's more curvature to its spine, and the lower of the two strokes in the middle might want to have its connection moved up a bit, so it doesn't look like it's at the same angle as the upper one. For the archaic sampi, you should make up something more easily recognizable as a cursive of your uppercase form. What you have there looks kind of squashed again, and perhaps too upsilon-ish. I'd be inclined to make a single curved stroke over the top, like in some uncial forms, rather than the two curves you've got there.\n\nThe uppercase San should have straight sides, like your Mu, except that the central \"v\" part doesn't go down to baseline. The resemblance is inconvenient, but the ancient alphabets that used San never had a Mu of Trajanic form - the sides of the Mu were diagonal and/or only the left stroke went down to baseline.\n\nThe lowercase digamma is a little odd; the two horizontal strokes might want to look more visually unified. At the least, I would suggest that it needs to be brought more into the same chirographic model as your modern letters - the horizontal strokes on sigma and tau end in a slight upcurve, not a downward hook like you have on the lower horizontal stroke of the digamma. The same applies to your heta.\n\nThe archaic Koppa and Stigma need longer stems, to differentiate them more clearly from Omicron and lunate Sigma.\n\nThe descender on the lowercase archaic koppa looks too slanted. Normally it's either vertical or mostly vertical with a curve or flick to the right at the bottom.\n\nThe lowercase modern koppa also looks a bit squashed; perhaps try curving the left stroke more to the left as it descends, and maybe not take it all the way to the baseline?\n\nThe lowercase Pamphylian digamma probably shouldn't have so much descender; it looks too much like an eta.\n\nYour various lunate Sigmas look a bit anemic compared to the other uppercase letters, probably because of where you cut the ends. How are you handling the terminals on Latin C?\n\nI hope all this is at least a bit useful, and I recognize the irony of my giving design advice, when I doubt that I could do anywhere near as well as you have.\n\n"

I'll double check that to make sure I didn't accidentally lob of some weight by accident.\n\nNatasa, so these days chi doesn't really descend?

      "content": "Hi Guifa, long time no see, great that you are back here again. So, you are using FontForge? I thought that you would be using FontLab instead.\n\nThe ‘nu’ looks much better now and it differs from ‘upsilon’. The kappa is very distinctive and looks quite novel in design\n\nRipping apart your typeface isn’t my style. Nymus wrote something for all those designing Oldstyle Greek typefaces and I will quote it verbatim as it is somewhat relevant.\n\nHe wrote: ‘I have found out that the only Greek typefaces that are universally accepted and admired are all those that are digitized from hot metal types designed by great masters such as Bodoni, Baskerville and others... All those typefaces have certain of their letterform characteristics (hooks, blobs etc) enlarged in ways similar to the enlargement of facial characteristics in caricatures, this keeps the individual style of the typeface quite strong even at small point sizes, this is very important...’\n\nPersonally I would add another point: The morphology of any novel designs of Oldstyle Greek characters should not only follow their respective and traditional Greek calligraphic forms (see Vergikios manuscripts of the Grecs du Roi) but they must also be different in concept and look than all the pre-existing Oldstyle Greek typefaces. For example TimesTen differs in quite a number of characters from TimesNewRoman and Porson, Minion Pro differs almost totally from Monotype’s Greek Upright 90.\n\nNow there are still a few of your Greek letterforms that may be enhanced a little more:\n\nLOWER CASE\n\nlambda:\n\nthe ascender is too high and the letterform looks a bit like a stork, what could be done is to cheat a little and smoothen the left hand joint at the x-height. This is something that happens also with typefaces like Future that have quite small x-height in relation to the ascender height (in delta for instance) and in that case adjustments like the one that I am suggesting are made.\n\nchi:\n\nit is extremely beautiful, quite admirable.\n\nomega:\n\nthe endings of the two horns should be moved 20 em upwards, and the blob in the middle 20 em downwards and it should be thickened a little also.\n\npi:\n\nThe upper horizontal stroke it would be better to be moved 20 – 30 em to the right for more balance.\n\nCAPITALS\n\nI noticed that some of your capitals are asymmetrical (Theta, Omicron, Tau, Phi, Psi and Omega) obviously it must have been done on purpose, and yet it might be better to try designing them symmetrical as well and see how it goes.\n\nAlso in Kappa and Upsilon the joints in the middle are rather too low, maybe raising them higher it would look better.\n\nEpsilon:\n\nThe middle bar is much thicker than the other two, it should have the same stroke thickness and its length increased by 30 – 40 em at least.\n\nSigma:\n\nIts forms don’t balance well, some readjustments should be made.\n\nThe widths of Alpha, Delta, Eta, Lambda and Pi should be readjusted to bypass certain tical illusions, for instance as Alpha, Delta and Lambda are made from the same mold so to say they end up looking dissimilar width-wise. Therefore the following alterations should be made to their width:\n\nWidth\\_of\\_Delta = Width\\_of\\_Alpha minus 10 em  \nWidth\\_of\\_Lambda = Width\\_of\\_Alpha minus 10 – 20 em\n\nSimilarly:\n\nWidth\\_of\\_Pi = Width\\_of\\_Eta minus 10 – 20 em\n\nFor all the above I am uploading for you an image file with all the above suggestions.\n\nBy the way I have also uploaded SemeleArchaicGreekLetters15N.pdf which might be of some interest to you as it contains all the Greek Archaic letterforms.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417182754im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CR18_72_4359.jpg)\n\n"

The lowercase archaic sampi might benefit from having the top arched instead of flat like a tall tau: there's an uncial example at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Grec\\_oncial\\_sampi.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417182754/http:/commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Grec_oncial_sampi.png) - you would want more curvature than that to fit with the style of your lowercase, obviously.\n\nThe lowercase modern koppa and sampi are characters that are actually used, so they matter in a way that many of the Page 2 characters don't. They both look kind of squashed to me. To show you what I mean, I've used Photoshop to put them into their use context, so you can see how they look when juxtaposed with the other letters.
