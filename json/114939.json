  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI am looking for a script/handwriting to be used as a tagline. It must feel friendly, warm and simple. And maybe more important it has to be very legible and work in small sizes.\n\nI've found Tomboy from Letterperfect [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/tomboy/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184054/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/tomboy/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/tomboy/\") that I find pretty suitable. However, I think it's a bit too masculine and harsh. I guess it's because it's a signage/marker typeface rather than a script.\n\nAny ideas on similar but with a friendlier appearance?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
