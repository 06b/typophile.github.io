  "content": "I am curious about peoples opinions and experiences. Just a hypothetical question: if you were to choose a typeface for a novel in the creepy genre, what would you use? There are elements of fantasy in the storytelling, but also quite some chill factor in the creepy sense.\n\nMy feeling was going towards something with edgy serifs, higher contrast, nothing rounded at least. It should be comfortable to read, yet leave an unsettling hint? Walbaum, perhaps?\n\n",

There's a whole [website](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424044049/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/propdocs/propfonts.html) dedicated to that but nothing that tickles me the right way.

In my opinion it works for extended text because it is is not a high contrast font. Leaving aside the sharp details, the light weight and low contrast is very similar to the Victorian Lightface text fonts that were condemned from the 1890s onward as being too wispy -- which might we might freely interpret as lacking the vigor of life in the flesh.  \nAs for the Lovecraft fonts, note that they were created as \"prop fonts\" that work well in a prop document seen on screen, but would be technically inadequate for a book.  \nDon\n\n"

Alegreya seems to be somewhat in the same vain yet it's not as dark as Satyr.
