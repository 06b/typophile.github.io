Also, one has to admire an alphabet that supposedly were deprecated (is that the right word?) around 1300, but still were in daily use in Telemark in the early 19th century.

As languages evolved, they had to reflect the sound changes, while maintaining etymological logic and consistency. French, for instance, had evolved to a stage were too many words had become homonyms, so accents, cedillas and circumflexes were needed. Portuguese and Lithuanian, for instance, lost a lot of final n's and m's, which led to the nasalization of the preseding wovels, expressed by adding a tilde in Portuguese and an ogonek in Lithuanian. The umlaut of the Germanic languages expresses the changed wovel, while keeping the relationship to the root. And so on and on. This is the kind of extension I'm talking about. One alphabet made usable for several related languages. How did the West make money on Romanian putting a circumflex over an a when its pronounciation changed to i, of etymological reasons? Brilliant minds have made the Latin alphabet work better than any other alphabet in the world. When Turkish was written with Arabic script, it was close to incomprehensible, because of the crucial vowel harmony that just could not be properly expressed.\n\n\\> That’s just apologism.\n\nNo, it's not.

Cultural chauvinism, which can permeate anything, including writing systems. It even causes people to not realize for example that the Latin alphabet doesn't even work well for _English_! Nevermind its idiotic hyper-reliance on an x-height. Saddest of all however, such chauvinism causes people to rape an entire people's psyche by inventing monstrosities like the Vietnamese script.\n\n\\> When Turkish was written with Arabic  \n\\> script, it was close to incomprehensible\n\nThat's a massive -and convenient- exaggeration.  \nSome people (like Thomas Milo) would even say it's completely wrong.\n\n\\> No, it’s not.
