Thought it could have been embedded in her [Greeting Cards](http://web.archive.org/web/20131005082446/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/greeting-cards) but unfortunately not. Anyway, even if it's a bit rough, [Alana](http://web.archive.org/web/20131005082446/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/laura-worthington/alana) by the aforementioned Laura Worthington could be considered as a nice substitute.\n\n"
