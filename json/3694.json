It looks like it could just be a very small sample of a font similar to [Zavtone](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124303/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg2.html) (left side 2/3 down the page), or [Neon Stream](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124303/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg4.html) (fifth row down).   \n   \nIf one of these isn't close enough, search with Google for Bitmapped fonts. They are everywhere.\n\n"
