      "content": "Yes, there is, and yes, I have designed several fonts for Palm OS. In my opinion, it's an ideal place to design bitmap fonts.   \n   \nThe leading package is probably Font Editor 1.9 by Symbioforge, which hasn't been updated in a while. It's at [http://www.symbioforge.com/products.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017121008/http:/www.symbioforge.com/products.html). You'll need a \"Hack\" program to implement the fonts, however- Look for \" [FontHack123](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017121008/http:/www.sergem.net/fonthack123/)\" which plugs into Xmaster or Hackmaster for that.   \n   \nI recently contacted the developer of FE who assures me that a Palm OS 5 version is coming in the next few months. I'm trying to see if we can Beta it here for him at Typophile.   \n   \nFrom my testing, FontHack123 won't currently work with OS 5 series Palm devices- Clearly these guys need to catch up. With the new high-res screens, I'm really wanting to design and implement some tighter bitmaps, which is not possible now.\n\n"
