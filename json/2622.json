And since the Apostrophe case ended with a whimper, it might very well be that Emigre has also never _won_ a court case! On the other hand, they have used the _threat_ of lawsuits to some effect. Although that has also turned off some otherwise benevolent font people. On the other hand, I think it's fair to say that Emigre (and others) have now grown out of that \"obsessive\" phase, and hopefully will now start producing more mature _fonts_ as well.   \n   \nBesides Apostrophe and SSI, I remember a big case with Linotype in Europe, but I don't know much about that one.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not aware of any cases of illicit font use that have gone to court. Generally speaking, if caught using an unlicensed font, a company will promptly pay the appropriate license fee, since this is very much cheaper than contesting the charge. Also, companies often cannot account for all the fonts on individual computers or networks, so they may not realise that the font they are using has not been correctly licensed. Companies, especially big ones with a large installation base, are beginning to realise that having unlicensed fonts exposes them legally. Recently, Agfa Monotype introduced a [font licensing management tool](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014212033/http:/www.fontwise.com/) that helps companies keep track of their font licenses. It presupposes that most companies want to do the right thing and just need help doing it.\n\n"
