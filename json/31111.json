This is not the functional site, but a simple machines forum on which to brainstorm, assess goals and then decide how to implement them. It is open to all. I would love to see everybody who is interested in a web-based font newsmagazine. Those that like the idea, come on over, check the manifesto and join in debate. If you think the idea is awful, then stay here and discuss! :)\n\nI’m going to go watch House. I’ll check in for any questions later over there.\n\n",

Or if there can even be one unified rating for them, or if it would even be beneficial to the users.\n\nI imagine some of the community has very strong opinions on this, and look forward to hearing them.\n\n"
