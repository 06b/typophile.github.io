I do however _not_ edit posts\\*, only subject lines in order to make it easier for our IDers to quickly identify individual threads. Gotta keep this magnificent identification machine well lubricated. ;^)\n\n_\\* The only time we edit the actual content of posts is when they contain links to pirated fonts and other stuff that is prohibited on this board._\n\n"
