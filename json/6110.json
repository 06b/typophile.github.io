I tried to create a hip logo with a fresh and funky feel to it.   \nI'm not sure to sure about the type - do the shape (TV+ \"what's hot\") and colours work?   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052644im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42940.gif)   \n   \n   \nGreetings,   \nsaman\n\n",

Fudge dripping over a TV? Piece of fudge wrapped in a fudge TV wrapper?\n\n"

This mostly has only short reach. (I mean being hip in first place).   \n   \nI'd be going much more in the music direction. The TV interpretation does not hit the point for me.   \nMusic Videos are much more about music than about video. So maybe try something referring to music and singing.   \n   \nServus   \n   \nDominik\n\n"
