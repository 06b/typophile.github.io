  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m having a big problem with Illustrator CS3.\n\nIf I deactivate my fonts in Suitcase, they stay  \nopen in Illustrator. How come.\n\nEven if I restart my computer, I deleted all my  \nfonts in Suitcase, and they still appear  \nin Illustrator.\n\nI’m going crazy.... I have about 300 fonts open in Illustrator,  \nand I cant close them at all.\n\nDoes anybody know what I’m doing wrong?\n\n [‹ Degrees & Graduate School / Feelings?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220195022/http:/typophile.com/node/40061 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Meta Serif takes the pole position ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220195022/http:/typophile.com/node/39952 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
