  "content": "I recently saw the documentary titled, \"Visual Acoustics: The Modernism of Julius Shulman\" and what I found really attracting other then Shulman's fantastic photos was the typeface they used. Unfortunately cameras were forbidden in the theater and I was unable to take a picture. So for those who have seen that documentary, please identify the typeface they used.\n\nThank you!\n\n",
