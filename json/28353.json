I'm trying to create something eclectic with blackletter/old english forms without strait blackletter in one style.\n\nThe T bothers me a bit. I like the s's, but they look too narrow. So the p is giving you trouble too.. hmmm...\n\nSuggestions welcome...\n\nthanks\n\n"

Maybe adding a vertical line to the T, like capitals in [some blackletter fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709001842/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/neualtisch/).

I thought it sounded an awful lot like tapestry\n\nI hadn't thought of the long s, but my only concern would be lay-men \\*us audience\\* ; it's hypothetical usage is a knitting/sewing type magazine. It might read Tapifferie. And I'll give your other suggestion a shot.\n\nThanks!\n\n"

The ie needs kerning tighter and I would look at some kind of decorative ending or flourish to the second e. The Ta ligature is rather attractive, but I think you need to do some work to the outside/bottom stroke so the join is smooth, there seems to be a flat point between 5 and 6 oâ€™clock.  \n\\*anti-chirographic  \nTim\n\n"

(that's why I didn't do something more literal)\n\nThis is why i don't like hypothetical work, becuase I can change my audience. ( anyway, this area of mag masthead design is hidiously drab, why not spice it up )\n\nIs it the just the blackletter making it feel liturgical? Any ideas otherwise?
