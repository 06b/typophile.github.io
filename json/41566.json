I've looked through Rob Roy Kelly's book, but didn't find anything there.\n\nAlso, do side-brackets a Tuscan make? Or does there need to be at least some kind of stroke bifurcation or splaying? For instance, where do these land?:\n\n- [Hamilton's 515](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/number-515/)\n- [Cowboy Western](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/)\n- [Sombra](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/cubanica/sombra/)\n\nAm I wasting my time trying to nail down concrete terminology for 19th-century ornamental typographic phenomena?\n\n",

      "content": "I think _thorn_ is is the best term for that feature too.\n\nThe strict definition of \"tuscan\" is a type with split or bifurcated stems, for example:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/de-louisville/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/de-louisville/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/de-louisville/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/frisco-antique-display-sg/\")\n\nMyfonts appear to have revised their definition of \"tuscan\" not too long ago. It used to be assigned as a key word to wood type and Victorian faces with bands of vertical stressing but ordinary stems (not split), for example:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-western/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ouachita-way-wbw/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ouachita-way-wbw/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ouachita-way-wbw/\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rio-grande-wbw/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rio-grande-wbw/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rio-grande-wbw/\")\n\nTypes with the thorn feature and/or bands of vertical stressing are correctly named wood types, or classified as Victorian:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/go-west/\")\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/opera-house/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/opera-house/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/opera-house/\")  \nis a true tuscan due to its split stems and genreally bifurcated outline.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "My guess as to what is happening on MyFonts is that foundries are spotting the <cite>tuscan</cite> keyword on other wood types and adopting it for their own fonts without knowing what it is really, other than a \"Wild Western\" thing. Generally though, the keyword application on MyFonts seems more or less to the point: [http://www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/tuscan/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/keyword/tuscan/)\n\nOne other interesting example which I spotted in Rob Roy Kelly's book was [Gothic Tuscan Round](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/gothic-tuscan-round/). Following this naming, the pointy side-brackets _do_ make for a tuscan (or at least a Gothic Tuscan); but for my own purposes, I'm not sure I'm about to adopt that logic wholeheartedly just yet.\n\nTo further confuse matters, there is a whole other class of tuscans which are less bifurcated than they are just concave:  \n [Gothic Tuscan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/gothic-tuscan/)  \n [Antique Tuscan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/antique-tuscan/)  \n [Tuscan Expanded](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-tuscan-expanded/)  \n [Concave Tuscan](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075802/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/concave-tuscan-x/)\n\nBut I'm getting off topic a bit here. Of course any related discussion is welcome, but I'm mostly interested hearing if people think the presence of these spur… er… _thorns_… are enough to endow a face with the classification of <cite>Tuscan</cite>.\n\n"

Similarly, the <cite>bulge</cite> suggested in that previous thread is limiting because it implies, well, bulginess (wow, my spell check let that word pass).\n\nIt is too bad that <cite>spur</cite> is already in use for another typo-term (not that there aren't a million typo-homographs already) … maybe I'll add a <cite>side-</cite> prefix to it and call it a day: **<cite>side-spur</cite>**\n\nI mean after all, it is vaguely similar, formally, to the other kind of spur, right?
