It used to include the dot from the address as well, but I couldn’t make it work, so I took it out. The word “_untums_” means “whimsy” in Latvian. I’d be very grateful for any critiques. \n",

I’m not sold on the offset colors. It’s a touch disturbing and detracts from the whimsical mood. Just some thoughts.\n\n"
