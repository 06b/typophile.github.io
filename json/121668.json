  "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am wondering if anyone out there has experience using fonts from Parahcute's DIN series. I am unfamiliar with the foundry and would like to set my C.V. for a design professorship using DIN Display, mainly, but my jump over to their DIN Text if it doesn't work out at lower sizes. Before I lay down the Euros, I'd love to know how well these fonts behave. Are they well-spaced and well-kerned?\n\n",
