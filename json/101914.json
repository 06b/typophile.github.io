      "content": "Right. MT Grotesque Extra Condensed (MTGEC) is close but, even if /G could appear to come closer, that's doubtlessly Alternate Gothic No 1 (AGNO1) with a custom /G: /R bowler connection with vertical stem is oblique for AGNO1 and horizontal for MTGEC, MTGEC weight not enough bold, MTGEC /E middle bar too short while AGNO1 one is matching...\n\n"
