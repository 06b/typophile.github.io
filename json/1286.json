If you hadn't guessed the identity of the mystery Adobe application being previewed at this year's ATypI conference, Thomas Phinney today confirms that it is a new Illustrator, complete with Unicode text support, OpenType Layout features, and reportedly the most advanced typography UI in any application.   \n   \nAt 9:35 on Sunday, September 28th, Thomas will present 'the first public technology preview of this future version of Illustrator', exclusively for attendees of the ATypI conference.   \n   \n   \nJohn Hudson, conference programme organiser\n\n",
