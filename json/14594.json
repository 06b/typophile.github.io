  "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am trying to line up a couple of speakers for a public program mid-October at City College where I teach. If you can help with any of these wishes, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n1. I am looking for an epigrapher: someone who works in stone or other permanent, 3D material.\n\n2. I am also looking for non-Roman script calligraphers (Arabic, Asian, etc.). (We have Chinese and Japanese calligraphers on campus, but do you know anyone who does Thai or Burmese or Korean or...?)\n\n3. I would like the contact info for Asa Peavey in the SFPL so I can ask him as well.\n\nAny speakers would have to be local, as the pay is only a token and not enough to pay for travel.\n\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nAmy\n\n",
