  "content": "Hello everyone, I'm looking for the font of a Red vs Blue title season, \"Out of Mind\", to make a personal composition in Photoshop. I thought it would be easy, because the letter \"F\" is highly characteristic, but I can't even manage to find something similar.\n\nIf anybody knows this font, could he tell me what it is? Thanks in advance.\n\nSébastien C.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112454im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rvb_OoM_x360_banner_6272.png)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Arnprior \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112454/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
