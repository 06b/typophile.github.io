  "content": "ditto to Grants comment. userbility goes down.   \nAs far as uniqueness is concerned. Well new \"s\" is ceratinly interesting but in my opinion not complete. the center slant on the \"s\" is thicker than the slant the \"e\", \"g\" and \"a\". I am not sure if it is intentional or not but it looks too thick especially in the bold weight. I am also noticing the top counter in the lc \"g\" is sitting kind of low and not centered. This I suspect may be intentional.   \nI tell you Joseph, I am a sucker for unusual forms but these days   \nI find myself regretting certain recent purchases (Sophia from Fontsmith as well as Friendly from Die-Gestalten) because of userbility issues.   \nI guess Stephan might be right in some ways.   \nA designer/agency may purchase the new version but will it be used a lot-I am guessing properly not. If one of your goals is exposure of Pill in award winning design the i would suggest going back to basics.   \n   \n ![pill](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317100236im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/29014.jpg)\n\n",

I think it is very unique.   \n   \nOle and Grant have the same readability issues that I have. I purchased Fedra a few months ago, and as much as I love using the font at small sizes, anything above 12 point starts to be problematic. The \"uniqueness\" of certain letters becomes a distraction. I would hate to see that happen with this font. (I noticed recently that Peter Bilak is offering an alternate version of Fedra that removes some \"features\" of the old font.)\n\n"

In the context of the sample that Ole posted, the 's' seems a bit off - not much mind you. Making the thickness of the similar diagonals in those characters more consistant would help the congruity - at least from my perspective.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree that there is something not quite right with the s's, though I think I'm on the right track. It's true that the font behaves completely differently with the funky S's. It supports my theory that the character of a font can be changed drastically with a smattering of alternates (see Uncial New in the Critique:Blackletter/Uncial category). I really wish OpenType software (i.e. InDesign) would let type designers name their own features, which would then come up under the font menu. Why have a \"Titling Alternates\" check box when the font really needs a \"Funky S\" feature? I can understand why standard naming conventions would be desirable for standard features (smcp), but why won't the software recognize non-standard features? The question seems so obvious to me that it makes me angry.   \n   \nThe cross-bar on the new s' are too wide. Good call. As for Hrant's last comment: too terse : ) For now, however, I think that the funky s will have to live in an OpenType category like titling alternates, or something like that.\n\n"

I am by the way not implying that you borrowed your \"S\" idea from Brody.

It's actully makes is less buyable for me.   \n   \nBut the fact that some do like it suggests to me that you should include one or the other as an alternate.

Our bottleneck right now is the time it takes to properly create custom, family-specific displays for all of the new (and existing) fonts. Our goal over the next dozen weeks or so is to replace our generic 'Divergently' displays within the Umbrella collection with showings that are unique to each face.   \n   \nEventually, these improvements would continue through the most popular typefaces from the other foundries as well. Right now, we are really limited by our internal creative resources. We are definitely concerned with displaying the typefaces in the most appropriate and complimentary manner as possible.   \n   \nFrankly, the better it looks, the more you sell.   \n   \n\\> _Also, will Veer be adding PDF specimines any time soon?_   \n   \nYes, and hopefully soon. This is not something that we can easily accommodate with the product database solution we are currently tied to. However, we are in the process of finishing up a brand-spanking new system that will allow us to add external data types (like custom PDF specimens and links to designers website, for instance) to individual product pages.   \n   \nNot yet, but soon.   \n   \nAnother thing we are going to address is the ability to view complete dynamically-generated character set, a la MyFonts. Oh, and a preference that maintains a consistent, user-defined text string for all of your Flont samples is also going to be available shortly.\n\n"
