But in order to find my own position I would like to start a little discussion to this topic, here and now :-)\n\nOf course I was already thinking about this topic and I first wanted to narrow the thing a bit down, but then I thought it’s better to just keep everything open. I’m just curious about what you guys think is social responsibility in our job? how do you bear this responsibility (if there is such a thing) in your daily work? Are there (historical) examples, that (kind of) support your arguments?\n\nAnd now, go operate your keyboards untill they melt!!! :-D\n\n [‹ Any other guitarists out there?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154505/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39236 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Make me a business card?

I think, in general, responsibility has more grip on g.d. where the end result is “in sight”.\n\nDifferent kinds of responsibility may be found throughout the spectrum of type design, from those working on complex systems of fonts for the typography of rich but unseen documents, to those working on the perfection of the letters for a single word they know all too well. Are you talking about type design, or graphic design?\n\n”..how do you bear this responsibility (if there is such a thing) in your daily work?”  \nI don’t purchase print products as much as possible. I force myself, activity by activity, to use digital alternatives, improving them and propagating appropriate improvements to others as much as I can along the way.\n\n“Are there (historical) examples, that (kind of) support your arguments?”  \nWhat argument? :)\n\nCheers!\n\n"

To me the latter would be more satisfying, since the “end result” will actually be type. To give it a try – Gerard Ungers Gulliver is an attempt to create a typeface, that is economic. In other words it safes paper and thus trees. Behind it’s design there was that “ecological” concept and out of this idea Gulliver was born.

But today, with trees not used much for paper, (volume publishers of daily publications normally use recycled pulp of some kind), the current frontier of typographic activism is elimination of printing day-after-use garbage altogether. Or at least, that’s what I think.\n\nOn another trail, there is a problem with thinking that “your fonts” will only be used for environmentally friendly purposes if they are at all suited to print use. But Nick says: “Is it really responsible to hype the newest biggest Airbus as being environmentally friendly?” If you don’t then you’re standing at the corner of No-Travel and Don’t Move. I don’t travel much because my carbon footprint can’t come with me, so it is pure burning man to go away without a dire need. However, I know lots and lots of, people will be doing so regardless of my private concerns... so why not root for a more efficient aeroplane?\n\nAnd, I see no difference between relative and absolute morality, they are both 8 letters, and are usually about the same width.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

The use the fonts are put to (or who buys them) is usually way out of the hands of the designer. I mean one can hardly place your fonts off limits to, say, republican presidential candidates. In other words, aside from designing custom fonts for big oil or pharmaceutical companies it’s hard for me to think of a way that a type designer can be socially irresponsible, professionally. And since the wider idea of socially responsibility in graphic design has already been covered in another thread...\n\nI say buy compact fluorescent lightbulbs, use public transportation and vote. Donate some of your earnings to causes you believe in. Carry around a reusable tote bag. Give an old lady or a pregnant woman your seat on the bus. Don’t buy gold or diamonds. Avoid fast food restaurants and chain stores - try to eat locally produced, organic food. Don’t eat chilean sea bass or other threatened fish. Keep after your elected officials, urge them to vote responsibly. Shut off the water while you brush your teeth. Try to avoid products made in countries that don’t have good employment or environmental practices (such as China). Take to the streets to support causes that are important to you. Don’t force your daughter to undergo female circumcision. The list goes on.\n\n"

And you say, that this has nothing to do with our trade. But what I ask myself is, why is it then, that these questions about social and environmental responsibility etc. so often pop up in discussions with people involved in type- or graphic-design?  \nTo me it looks like there are two things relevant here. The first is, that we work with mass-media on a daily base. We know exactly how powerfull these information channels are and we spend a lot of time in making them accessible for people to get a certain information. We have kinda control how this thing is going to look like, but we rarely have control over the content. This can – in some cases – lead to frustration.  \nThe second thing is, that our trade has certain, lets say “artistic” aspects. Artists tend to be critical and idealistic.\n\nIf we look back in time many typographers or graphic-designers have become autors themselves. They know the channels, they have contacts to publishers and printers and they know how to make printed stuff – to me it’s only logical, that sooner or later some of them start to write.\n\nConsidering these things I could imagine, that there IS something to discuss about this topic in relation to our trade.\n\nTo the discussion of the green cars... I agree with David – as long as we can not assume, that everybody acts responsible and instead of the car takes his bike, we must assume, that they use the car. So if this car runs with a very low petrol usage compared to the average, this might be a big success... And in that relation it actually might be a green car.

While one could argue that there are all sorts of non-consumerist areas of graphic design, without consumerism, we just wouldn’t be that large of an industry.\n\nAnd, of course typographers depend a lot of graphic designers, so there’s that ecosystem.\n\nTo get back to the guilt issue, I think the issue is that we talk a lot about it because we are indirectly helping destroy the planet by doing what we do...help sell crap.\n\nI think there are two mindsets that ’commercial artists’ can have, neither being any better/worse in my opinion:\n\n1) We are what we are. We help companies make money by providing better designed products, services, and advertising. The specific product/service is irrelevant, our only job is to help the customer meet their goals.\n\n2) We are a major decision maker on what succeeds and fails in the market place. We as designers should make a conscious analysis of every client and product we work with and establish if it’s socially responsible for us to work with that client and/or/product.\n\nMarketers have the most guilt.

For a start all computers, which have many components made abroad and in developing countries. For example Intel’s huge new plants Chengdu. Read [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154505/http:/www.intel.com/jobs/China/index.htm) about Intel’s factories around China, including in Chengdu. Chengdu is especially favored because it is in the poor interior, and there will be low cost, high quality labor for many years. So if you want to boycott Chinese goods, you can basically shut down your computer and close up shop as a designer.\n\nFor a more informed view of the situation, I would highly recommend going to Beijing and Shanghai and Chengdu, as I have, and see the life there and talk to people there about how life has changed for them. In the past 20 years people who were formerly quite poor are now living middle class and prosperous lives. Shanghai is like New York City and Beijing like DC in the feel of their prosperity. Though most of China is still poor, we are talking about a transformation in the lives of as many people as the entire population of the US. This is a tremendous blessing to a huge number of people. And this has been built on trade to the US and Europe.\n\nDo you really want to impoverish the Chinese by shutting down their trade with the US and Europe? Oh, and the Chinese government holds huge portions of US bonds, underpinning our economy, so our economy will collapse along with theirs, when we all stop buying Chinese goods. So you will wreck the lives of both Chinese and Americans. Will Lou Dobbs then be happy? I don’t think so.\n\nThere are serious abuses of workers, denials of political rights, and environmental problems in China. But to only focus on these is to be ignorant of the reality of the tremendous blessings of globalization. The grinding, desperate poverty of most of China and South Asia are now at long last being progressively remedied. This, and not only the evils that also have gone along with globalization, need to be recognized for an ethically sound reaction to the situation.\n\n"

Without all of the things mankind has added to the environment, Earth is a beautiful place. We are human. We make stuff in an effort to make things better. Whatever we create, whatever we add, it should, at the very least, NOT be hard on the eyes. If it cannot be incredibly beautiful, it should at the very least be neutral (which is sometimes better). Lots of us make every effort to make that happen. This is where I curse computers and technology. While some of us use it well, lots more of us (us being everyone, not limited to professional designers) make incredibly ugly stuff with our personal computers and garbage up the whole picture. It’s everywhere.\n\nSure, there was bad design when everything was printed on a C&P, but not everybody had a printing press in their house.\n\nI think it comes down to education. What we’ve got here is a social responsibility to educate the general public about design and help them gain an understanding of what is good and what is bad, and why it matters. A more widespread, generally accepted respect for good design...a world where everyone valued beauty more than speed and profit...is the ultimate goal. It seems like an almost impossible task.\n\nI feel a social responsibility to be both proactive (positively noting good design to people other than fellow designers, i.e. “the choir”) and openly critical of everything that is ugly.\n\nLike that “green” typeface linked above...UGLY. And if we cannot agree that it’s flat out ugly, we should at least be able to agree that it’s not as beautiful as other previously existing typefaces that serve the same purpose. Therefore, in an ideal world, in a socially responsible world, nobody should use it. Someone destroy it before it destroys us.\n\nWhew! Nothing like a good tirade to get the juices flowing...I better get back to my socially responsible work before my boss catches me jagging off with this post!\n\n"

The book tells you everything you need to know about all of the different things you can do with the type and the layout of a slide. However, nowhere does it say anything about WHY you should (or should NOT) use these tools.\n\nSo, it’s not that I think I know exactly how everything should be, or that there is an absolute right or wrong.

The “client” asks, “Why are we using this typeface?” The answer is, “Because that’s our brand typeface.” The client remains confused and the designer comes across as, as you say, dogmatic.\n\nTo summarize, if it’s necessary, education is not simply saying, “This is the way it is.” It is explaining why we do things the way we do them. And if we don’t know why, if it’s all subjective, then it’s just fluff. I feel a social responsibility to help others (and myself) understand why.

Also, if you’re in a warm climate where air conditioning is used, LCDs give off much less heat which would otherwise get compensated by more AC. Perhaps there are other issues with the materials involved in the screens themselves or the manufacturing thereof, but LCDs seem to be “greener” than CRTs.\n\nNote: Plasma displays also use more power than LCDs (not in use much any more for computers, but a significant consideration for TVs).

Though it is a major consumer of energy, it doesn’t seem to be a particularly bad net producer of carbon dioxide, and it may become completely carbon neutral.\n\nTrees themselves eat carbon dioxide, and are a sustainable resource, when properly managed. They are a crop like any other, except that they take longer to grow to a point where they are used for paper, housing, and furniture.\n\nThe distinctive thing about the paper industry is that for energy it burns a lot of wood chips for fuel. This is relatively carbon saving as this US government report explains (C stands for Carbon dioxide production, E for Energy):\n\n“The paper industry makes extensive use of wood byproducts as an energy source. Carbon dioxide emissions from wood consumption are considered to be zero, because the carbon that is emitted has been sequestered recently, and the regrowing of trees will again sequester an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. Consequently, the paper industry has a relatively low C/E ratio, at 37.4 and 36.5 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent per quadrillion Btu in 1991 and 2002, respectively. In contrast, the primary metals industry, which uses large amounts of coal and other carbon-intensive fuels (e.g., electricity), has a high C/E ratio: 68.2 in 1991 and 68.7 in 2002.”\n\nThis stuff about carbon neutrality of wood burning may just be industry BS, but at first blush it makes sense to me. Further, they are doing research to create plants that produce all their own energy from wood chips, making it net carbon neutral. This will also save the manufacturers money, so I think they are serious about it.\n\nThe really nasty thing in paper manufacturing is not carbon dioxide production, but rather the use of chlorine to bleach the paper, which leads to serious chemical waste products that sometimes end up in rivers. (Sulfur is another serious problem also.) The industry spends a lot of money to contain these problems, but evidently should do more. However, these don’t seem to be technically unsolvable problems, so government regulation and industry innovation could deal with them. So the problems with pollution from paper manufacturing don’t seem insurmountable.\n\nOh, and I read that 36% of new paper is from recycled paper...\n\n"

Given how many managed forests have been created just to serve the needs of paper and furniture industries in Europe and the USA, it could be legit.\n\nBut I don’t get the impression that paper companies in Asia have moved beyond just clearcutting land and spewing out crap paper, and there are still some US paper producers who make a pretty big mess. But now that printers and paper vendors are working with the FSC and going green, it’s getting a lot easier to stick with paper products that aren’t so bad.\n\nDoes anyone know much about the current state of hemp-based papers? I remember that the hemp producers in Eastern Europe were working on some really promising stuff a few years ago that would have made hemp papers suitable for use in high-speed presses, but I haven’t heard anything about it lately.\n\n"

OK, I made that up, but it is clear that easy access to printers means lots of unnecessary printing happens and it may actually be realistic estimate. At home I print very little because I have to pay for my own paper and ink. I’m not so sure though that this is really the sort of issue that designers should focus on to be ’responsible’.\n\nFor me, as a signage designer, I there are some significant environmental repercussions to much of what I do. Choices of type for example... (to try and keep it topical) A typeface that occupies 15% less lateral space than another obviously uses less materials. Choices in substrates, coatings and sheeting materials (though it’s tough to get away from vinyls) and energy sources for illuminated signs can all have an impact. Then of course, there’s the aesthetic impact.\n\nIt is difficult to go out into any part of the built-environment and not see at least a dozen signs. The consumption of materials used in sign making is huge and very wasteful. Vinyl and retro reflective sheeting comes in rolls which are fed into a plotters, which cut the letters. All the material around the letters is weeded out and thrown in the garbage. (roughly 75% to 80%). The backing material is thrown out, although sometimes it gets used to wrap or sandwich signs for shipping. These materials can not be recycled because of the adhesive and the non-stick coating.\n\nSo, Maybe the use of a condensed typeface will mean less waste goes to the landfill, less demand on petrochemical and other natural resources and less energy consumed. less aluminum, plastic and plywood for substrates.\n\nOn the other hand, if my products aren’t readable, then everything about them is a complete waste of time and materials, and in the case of a wayfinding system,. even worse, may put people lives at risk.\n\nOn the whole I find it difficult not to conclude that designers (present company probably not included) have been and are very irresponsible. In the face of giant bill boards, whose faces will be stripped off, thrown in the garbage and replaced with new ones every other month, vinyl wraps on public transit vehicles, acres of illuminated signs that run all night in empty strip malls, obscenely wasteful packaging, junk mail that goes directly into the recycling or garbage without even having the elastic bands removed, and on and on - every piece of it having been designed but someone. I’m glad I work where I do. The work may be mundane, but Every now and then I can tell myself it’s for a good cause, and I design for longevity we are less wasteful also.\n\nThe idea of being a more responsible designer by being careful not to leave your computer running too long and switching to low energy light bulbs, or even the amount of paper you print off for proofs, or read your email, seems a little trivial. Everyone should do that. Designers are often in a position have a much more significant impact. Getting back to choosing an economical typeface, a difference of 15% of lateral space could mean a savings of tons of aluminum and plastic (literally) and thousands of square feet of vinyl and retro reflective sheeting.\n\nR\n\n"

The “Wealth of Nations” comes from productivity and trade in his view, not from the merchantilistic, protectionist policies that nations were following in his day.\n\nFor a factual rebuttal of Dobb’s views on the massive net loss of jobs to ’overseas cheap foreign labor’, here is an answer entitled [Lou Dobbs is wrong](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154505/http:/www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=108&subid=206&contentid=254269) laying out why that isn’t true.\n\nBut my problem with Lou Dobbs isn’t so much with his opinions as with his demagogic approach to journalism. He is not even so much ignorant as willfully putting on blinders. He appeals to fear of foreigners and badgers and heaps insults on everyone whom he disagrees with. The constant string of insults lowers and corrupts the standard of public discourse. This is standard with right wing ’hate radio’, but now Dobbs has brought it to nativist populism. His behavior is just downright loutish.\n\nYou also can read a series of articles about his poor handling of the ’leprosy from immigrants’ claim in the [Columbia Journalism Review](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154505/http:/www.cjr.org/); just do a search on his name at that site.\n\nI do feel that there is a profound ignorance leading to his attitudes. I see in him a lack of sympathetic understanding of foreign countries and people living in them. The increase of wealth in poor countries due to globalization over the past twenty years is one of the great triumphs in the history of humanity. The beginning of a major world-wide conquest of poverty is tremendously exciting and productive, and one of the great stories of our time. How can you cover the issue night after night and miss the most important story? I can only think that a lack of time spent in foreign countries, and the knowledge and understanding that would come with it is a cause. To be completely insensible to this great story, and never mention it is to me a great professional failing.\n\nIt is true that other journalists are not telling it either, and more’s the pity. But for Dobbs to cover the issue constantly and not mention the main story—seemingly because it concerns the lives of foreigners—I really find reprehensible.\n\nAlso, as the linked article above explains, the loss of jobs abroad is not the problem domestically. The key problem domestically is increasing inequality of income in the US. This started under Reagan, and has continued apace under ever Republican president. But it is true that globalization and the international freer market and have created forces that are enriching the wealthy much faster than the mass of Americans, and leaving the poor behind—though in the US they are indeed materially hugely better off than in many poor countries. The market is a tremendous engine of economic growth, but it also has accompanying evils of cruelty to some and now increasing inequality.\n\nIncreasing social inequality in the US is a grave problem that is hurting the US in many ways. It should be dealt with by government action, both re-distribution by taxing the wealthy, and by programs that help all in the areas of in education and health, and especially help the poor.\n\nThere is also a serious problem of the undermining of the rule of law by the lack of reasonable immigration laws, properly enforced. But that is another story.\n\n"

This is roughly the problem Victor Gaultney sought to address in developing Gentium. If you want to design a font to benefit mankind, you might consider supporting some less-common languages. If it’s too much to provide, say, all the Latinate characters in the Unicode standard (plus the combining diacritics, properly supported by each base glyph), you could pick a region of the world and support that (for example, support all the characters used in Pacific Northwest languages). Or, support one or more non-Latin scripts. Whichever languages you choose to support, do your potential linguist customers a favor and support the International Phonetic Alphabet so that we can publish papers and books using your font.\n\n"

And his views (from what I know of the man) are global and not protectionist and he views America’s trade deficit with communist China as unacceptable. Look how long it took for China to adjust even a small percentage of it’s currency. And as for China becoming the world’s largest polluter (passing the USA earlier this year), and China military sales and development, I think are also a great concern to Dobbs but those issues only enforce the impact of the trade practices of China, and also to a certain extent the other “cheap foreign” markets too highlight this trade imbalance/outsourcing issue. So I find you using Dobbs as your “ignorance USA” poster boy, offensive.\n\nI’m a product of the Frank Lloyd Wright school of architecture and I own several small companies. In my greater family, we own a chain of retails stores that has over one hundred locations. The majority of products sold through that chain come from China and from other cheap foreign labour markets. On the other side of the coin is one of my favorite companies, my plastics company. It manufactures mostly acrylic products for Canada’s retail sector (I started this company in first year uni!). Just last spring it lost a national contract to China. So William I am well aquainted with both sides of China in the global market place, and the global market place in general. And I favour balanced freer global trade.\n\nIf you have a problem with Lou Dobbs and his brand of journalism, I suggest you send him an email and have a chat with the man. That’s the intelligent and enlightened way to deal with your Dobbsian ’issues’.\n\n"

These are specifically against his arguments on job loss in the US and the evils of the trade deficit.\n\nAs to his not being a protectionist. He doesn’t like to be called that, but he never met a trade agreement he likes, and never has mentioned lowering any tariffs as a good idea. So he is one, even though he likes to call it ’balanced’ trade.\n\nI am sorry your firm lost a contract to China, but that is competition. It is brutal and heartless, but benefits the customer. Many firms, as is shown in the link I gave, have figured out how to beat the low cost Chinese labor market by improved productivity using technology. As I said competition also leads to social inequality, which must be addressed by government action more than we have done in the US.\n\nOne of the things I think is the social responsibility of all citizens is not to be taken in by sloganeering, and to try to think critically about social issues. That I what I have tried to do on the issue of globalization.\n\nIt is pointless going further you if you won’t respond to arguments, but just repeat your views.\n\nHowever, I would like to point out that no prominent academic economist I know of supports Dobbs’s views. Thomas Friedman, of the New York Times, has talked extensively to people in China and India and the US about this issue, and has written two books on globalization. He is not given to non-stop insults, like Dobbs is, but he did let slip in a talk that he regards Dobbs as as a [“blithering idiot”](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203154505/http:/blog.nam.org/archives/2006/02/tom_friedman_on.php) on these issues. I really think the fact that the people who study these issues most seriously dismiss Dobbs’s views should give you pause.\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, I will post something on a real story of globalization: type design. I think it illustrates how, contrary to Dobbs, the ’global village’ really is overall a wonderfully positive and productive development. Oh and Typophile is an important part of that story.\n\n"

As such, the well financed schools tend to be in high-class/high-priced neighborhoods and the poorly financed schools tend to be in (obviously) low-class/low-priced neighborhoods.\n\nFor areas with school choice, this problem gets nasty. What happens is that parents that have the ability to send their children elsewhere, do, and those that don’t, don’t. So what happens is that the schools become increasingly segregated on a socio-ecnomic level. Which becomes a vicious cycle.\n\nIn the end, a parent that wants the best education for their child will send them to the best school. The catch is that the best school is likely in a neighborhood that the family can’t imagine affording to live in.\n\nOK, BACK TO TYPE!\n\n"
