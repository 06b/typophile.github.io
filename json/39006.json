I don’t plan on selling the font (it’s really just for my own use), but I’m acting as if I will, because I want the experience of creating a polished font that would meet the requirements of a commercially viable font.\n\nWhich codepages does everyone think the average, commercially useful font should support? I’m using Fontlab on Windows, and have so far completed the MS Windows 1252 Western codepage. I’ve also included additional characters, such as L slash, the fi and fl ligatures, and a few additional diacritical marks.\n\nSo far, I’ve been basically shooting for the union of the Windows 1252 and MacOS Roman code pages. Am I leaving anything out this way? I notice that neither codepage includes additional ligatures like ffi and ffl. Is there a more standard list of “usually supported” codepages among the major fonts out there?\n\nBefore I move on to metrics and the final round of details, I want to finalize my codepage support and wrap up all the remaining glyphs.\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Brand Identity : changing color](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112234449/http:/typophile.com/node/39008 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Ten Commandments of Arabic Fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071112234449/http:/typophile.com/node/36706 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
