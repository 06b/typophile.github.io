The closest match I came across was [Ultramagnetic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106093744/http:/www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0020) by YouWorkForThem.  \nHere's the DVD cover from which I took the sample, if it's to any help: [Clicky](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106093744/http:/criterion.com/content/images/full_boxshot/408_box_348x490.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",
