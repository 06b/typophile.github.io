(I actually had very sound proffesional humourous distraction required here reasons at the time)... Around the same time, I was uninstalling a bunch of fonts that I had no use for use.\n\nThen... Time passed. My dentist asked me to re-design the sign I'd done for her before. It was basically an editing job, but changed fonts. I did the work in the same file the previous version was in so I could show her a quick \"before and after\"... Mean-time, unbeknownst to me, one of the fonts I'd deleted was the one I'd used in the old design. For some reason, the god's chose to make FF MT the default fall back-up font for that file... In the event that to one I'd originally specified should be unavailable. She looked at it for a few seconds (\"Dr. Lbvk Dntst...\" and said, \"Um, Russ, I think there might be some spelling mistakes there\"...\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
