If there are no comments or replies on a new topic within 24 hours, it could get buried three pages deep on the \"Recent Posts\" page.\n\nAs for Mr. Nicolai's dingbats, they are imaginative, and dare I say, notanic! The rounded forms are almost Aztec/Inca in imagery.\n\nBut I fear our notice of them now is just \"too little, too late.\"\n\n"
