  "content": "I consider Brandon Grotesque for headlines on a website, but prefer to stay with light weights to make things look more fresh and contemporary. Brandon loses some of its character in light weight, when not paired with the brilliant heavier weights, and most people wouldn't probably distinguish it then form a plain Lato. For light weight, I think Futura for instance, works better, as LV [http://www.louisvuitton.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414024247/http:/www.louisvuitton.com/) do on their website.\n\nAny opinions on this?\n\n",
