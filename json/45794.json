I am well aware of the limitless optical concerns but I want  \nto really start digging into the details so please, number wonders,  \nany advice would be wonderful.\n\n [‹ Downloadable fonts thru Safari](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204093933/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37793 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typecon 2008 registration is up ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204093933/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45815 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Whatever numerical rule you discover, you’ll immediately find numerous exceptions. Whatever “rational” or logic-based theories you collect or devise for type design need to be tested against the real-life application of visual assessment; in other words, type is made to be looked at, so the final arbiter of function, beauty, or whatever, will be the human eye. Since there is so much about type design that requires compromise, deception, trickery and illusion, I think you should focus on those aspects. There are examples of alphabets overlaid with intricate geometric schemes, but many of those turn out to be applied for teaching purposes after the fact; they don’t assist in the production of useful or beautiful letters. The Latin alphabet is derived from shapes written by hand.\n\n"
