Just as Times Roman was the default serif face. Without that, it would be no where as popular (or overused, if that is your view).\n\n"

He said that he, as the dude at Linotype here in America, had to choose between Helvetica and Univers for import into America for general use. He said that Univers was probably better, and had a wider range of characters, but that it was much more expensive to license than Helvetica.\n\nAnd thus, America got Helvetica, while Europe got Univers.\n\n"

For instance, referring to the metal specimen of Fleet Typographers, a shop in Toronto still active in the 1980s (I used them occasionally), one notes:\n\n- Linotype: Helvetica Light, Medium and Bold with italics; Univers Light, Medium, Bold and Extra Bold with italics.\n- Ludlow: neither (Tempo, a Futura clone, is the sans)\n- Foundry: Helvetica Light, Medium and Bold; no Univers\n- Monotype: Univers Medium and Bold with italics, Bold Condensed, Extra Bold; no Helvetica. \n\n"
