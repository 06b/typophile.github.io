He is looking for a typeface reference which has, in his words, \"a sense of humor, some sort of childish style and a little bit of comic taste; may be even like a carnival and Ottoman flavor, such as the curves of a tulip flower, a little bit of brush stroke weight and stress.\"  \nI attach the sample/example he gave to me (would be nice if you can ID this font as well).  \nThanks very much.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015063800im_/http:/typophile.com/files/duraga_3841.gif)\n\n",
