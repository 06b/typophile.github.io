  "content": "Hi, I am trying to create a series on fonts that can be used for childrens handwriting practice.\n\nI need the fonts to appear layered when used in Illustrator.\n\nI am using FontLab and have created 3 separate fonts with the same metrics. One font is handwriting and the other two are guidelines.\n\nAfter generating the fonts and loading on the computer, each font is out of step with the other on the vertical position.\n\nDoes anyone know why this is happening? Is it Fontlab or is it Illustrator?\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [image.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130208081713/http:/typophile.com/files/image_0.png) | 12.1 KB |\n\n",

Illustrator seems to seems to push the character (which is a square) to the top of the text box.\n\nI have decided to try things a different way now, as it not crucial all of the fonts are layered.\n\nBut thanks all for your help, much appreciated and I have learnt something new in FontLab!\n\n"
