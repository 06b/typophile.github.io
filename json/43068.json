      "content": "Cool I like it.\n\nAny way you do it is going to be a bit laborious.  \nThis is what I'd do:\n\n• draw a line with the pen tool  \n• duplicate, rotate and repeat the lines the same way you have done with your text.  \n• Then use 'type on a path' tool to start writing on one line and write more information than can fit into the single text box.  \n• Deselect the type box and select the white arrow tool  \n• Select the text box again and you should see a little box with a red plus indicating there's more info than can fit in the text box.  \n• using the white arrow tool, click on the red arrow and the cursor will change to show what looks like a tiny block of text  \n• select the start of the next line and the overflow will run onto the next line – you can just repeat this all the way round the circle and every line will adjust when you change one detail.\n\nHope that helps.  \nIf you're really stuck send me your email address and I'll send you an ai file showing what I mean... or check out 'typing on a path' and 'linking path type' in help files.\n\nGood luck!  \nEd\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150330001826im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typeonapath_5810.png)\n\n"
