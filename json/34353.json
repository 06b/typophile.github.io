Unfortunately, I did not write the name of the font down and it is driving me crazy.\n\nCan anyone ID this font? Sorry about the pixelation, but the scan I did years ago was not very good and I can't find the original at this time.\n\nThanks,  \nRebecca\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101227155745im_/http:/typophile.com/files/rebecca4_4006.JPG)\n\n",
