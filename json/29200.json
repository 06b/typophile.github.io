I'd suggest a bold sans-serif, preferably one with pretty subtle quirks so that it won't be too distracting (but some are good). It'd be nice if you could use a somewhat uncommon sans; the current administration is constantly being attacked for their terrible, Photoshop-esque banners, so an interesting typeface might be the first step to improving at least that reputation. A quick suggestion would be [Metro](http://web.archive.org/web/20150326031234/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/list_fontfamily.cfm/family/Metro_Sans), a typeface that I'm personally looking at, designed by W.A.
