      "content": "Hi there,\n\nWell this sort of stuff is always going to be tricky, because quite possibly it will have been done as a one off hand lettered job and not be based on any particular font as such. Although, when I first saw the logo it had a familiarity about it, so just for the hell of it I dropped a key line of a \"brush style' font over it and, well, it looks to me that it may well have started out being based on the font \"Bira\" by Måns Grebäck as the e, o, n are almost identical on the overlay. Then it would have been further modified for the swash on the g etc. You get the general idea!\n\nAnyhow, as you seem interested in this type of \"hand lettered/brush\" style of font with extra ligatures and glyphs, check out others by Måns Grebäck:  \n [http://www.aringtypeface.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205654/http:/www.aringtypeface.com/ \"http://www.aringtypeface.com/\")  \nand especially the classy fonts available from  \n [http://sudtipos.com/fonts/90](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205654/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/90 \"http://sudtipos.com/fonts/90\")  \nWay cool stuff -  \nAlso, for the real sign writers:  \n [http://artandsignstudio.com/fontmenu.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205654/http:/artandsignstudio.com/fontmenu.html \"http://artandsignstudio.com/fontmenu.html\")  \nPlus, as ever - the always fantastic:  \n [http://www.letterheadfonts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205654/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/ \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/\")  \nEnjoy!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141018205654im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bira-Personal_5285.gif)\n\n"
