The showing of Kleukens Antiqua in Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" does show the same g as your sample. This makes me guess that your sample was made with a pre-digital version (either film type or metal).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

But you are right, the EF version is virtually identical except for the 'g'. There is a less refined version of the Kleukens at MyFonts [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014104412/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/kleukens-antiqua-nf/), but it does have the right 'g'.\n\n"
