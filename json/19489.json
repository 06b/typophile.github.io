It seems like what I’m doing is by the book, but maybe you can tell me what I’m doing wrong or point me to a thread I haven’t seen before that addresses this topic.\n\nThe code I’ve been trying to use is this:\n\nfeature liga { # Standard Ligatures  \n # Latin  \n sub c h by C\\_H;  \n} liga;\n\nI created a new glyph named C\\_H, but when I go the preview button in the OpenType panel, nothing happens when i type in ch.\n\nAlso, one more question: how do I add more glyphs if there aren’t enough for my purposes? I know in OpenType, you can add more than you would ever need for most purposes, but how do i go about doing this? thanks for your help.\n\n [‹ Quark 7 Beta 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808063028/http:/typophile.com/node/19536 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Dominant Opentype ligatures? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808063028/http:/typophile.com/node/18896 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
