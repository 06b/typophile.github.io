This is undoubtedly good news, but can anyone from the company (Adam? Yuri?) list the changes and fixes between version 4.7.2 and 4.7.3? I have been unable to locate any release notes on the Fontlab site or in the user forums.\n\nInquiring minds want to know.\n\nAnd while you’re digging around, I’d appreciate knowing what the differences between the version 4.7.1 and 4.7.2 releases are as well.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ What languages are supported by Latin Extended A?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070628214410/http:/typophile.com/node/18980 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type Tool Question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070628214410/http:/typophile.com/node/18966 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But mostly, these were bugfixes resulting from the porting of Fontographer 4.1 to Mac OS X — no features added or principal functionality changes.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
