From the beginning, GarageFonts has always been on the cutting edge of new typeface design. It started as a small library of trend setting designs and continues to grow into a varied collection of original, accessible text and display typefaces.\n\nGarageFonts is now owned and maintained by [Phils Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204222902/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Phils%20Fonts).\n\n**External Links**  \n [GarageFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204222902/http:/www.garagefonts.com/)  \n [GarageFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204222902/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/foundry/garagefonts/) at FontShop\n\n",
