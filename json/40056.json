I’ve used them in the past a large number of times, and am trying to find something new to brand a company. Something more ’compact’ vertically.\n\nJust throw out your favorites, so I can check them out. I’m not sure exactly what I’m looking for, but i’ll know it when i see it. Damn, I sound as bad as a client!\n\n [‹ Languages](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215014940/http:/typophile.com/node/40054 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tell us about the Support Typophile link at right--\\> ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215014940/http:/typophile.com/node/39992 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
