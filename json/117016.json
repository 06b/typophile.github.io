The faux Medieval touches Such as the X could come from a font like Mason Serif [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mason-ot/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724103333/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mason-ot/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mason-ot/\") which has it as an alternate letter, or from Avqest [http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724103333/http:/www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest \"http://www.fontspace.com/gemfonts/avqest\") or it might simply be a little creative design work.  \nDon\n\n"
