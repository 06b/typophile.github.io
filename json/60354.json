  "content": "We just released the new Krasny Mir font (formerly and briefly titled Red Star prior to release). It's a strong titling font based on soviet-era Russian poster lettering with some neat features. You can find it on our main site at [the Scriptorium](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211848/http:/www.fontcraft.com/) or on our new lite site at [TypeSmight](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211848/http:/www.typesmith.com/).\n\nBoth places offer samples and a free download of the working demo version.\n\nDave\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016211848im_/http:/typophile.com/files/krasnymirmf_6459.jpg)\n\n",
