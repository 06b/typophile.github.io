I thought I was very close with Museo but the uppercase A has a serif at the top that points to the right and the lowercase \"a\" is shaped differently. I also checked the alternate characters on these fonts and there are not characters that match this font.\n\nAny thoughts on what the name of this font is?\n\nThank you,\n\n",
