A bit like Serif Gothic with more of a twist.  \nIts a record cover from Ai records and has subsequently been treated with a pattern-like effect hence the image quality of the jpeg.\n\nThanks in advance for looking.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font\\_id.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207214626/http:/typophile.com/files/font_id_0.jpg) | 33.36 KB |\n\n [‹ technical drawing font?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207214626/http:/typophile.com/node/32472 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Geert Mak \"De eeuw van mijn vader\" Dutch book cover serif face - Collis {Pieter} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081207214626/http:/typophile.com/node/32461 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
