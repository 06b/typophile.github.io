  "content": "I'm having a delimma where I'm trying to display quotes/testimonials in a slider. The content is dynamic, and varies in length. Most of the comments are approximately 110 characters, the limit is 500 characters, and there are a fair amount over 200 characters. It would be disruptive to accommodate the largest comment (500 characters), because for most of the comments it would be a huge area of wasted space. We'll probably based the amount of space around 250 characters, and then we need an option for the comments larger than 250. I can't think of anything that would work well in a slideshow because it's constantly rotating. If we just change the height then the site will be growing and shrinking a lot which looks weird.\n\nDo any of you know of any websites that handle this gracefully or have suggestions?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [comment-lengths.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417173551/http:/typophile.com/files/comment-lengths.png) | 468.86 KB |\n\n",
