  "content": "Hi all,  \n I'm currently doing a bit of research on the history of the Latin alphabet and I was wondering if anyone knew of helpful resources, academic or otherwise, that could help me along. Specifically I'm looking for info on the early development of the characters of the alphabet, particularly the onset of lowercase letters.\n\nI've already got Bringhurst's ETS, Allan Haley's Alphabet and am skimming through David Sacks' Letter Perfect.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\njr\n\n",
