      "content": "You're welcome.  \nBy 1914 various foundries produced their own flavors of Devinne, wider narrower, a nip here a tuck there. Plus various outline versions.  \nTo find an exact match for the BLAST sample, a possible strategy might be to find out who the printer was & where they bought their type. The reference page mentions \"London: John Lane, the Bodley Head.\" I suspect that the type was probably purchased from a British foundry like Stephenson Blake. So a SB, or other British, specimen book from the era might have the Devinne variation you are seeking.  \nAs for digital interpretations of the Devinne typefaces, most do not exist.  \nDevinne went from the height of fashionable font taste before WWI to unspeakably quaint in the Art Deco era. It has never returned to fashion.  \nBut in the 21st century there is a market for somewhere for everything, even the Devinne fonts. An opportunity for the enterprising digital font designer.  \nDon\n\n"

It was promptly copied, initially in Europe by Ludwig & Mayer, and spread rapidly throughout the US and Europe, becoming the best known member of the series. ATF made popular an ornamental form under the name De Vinne Ornamental.\n"
