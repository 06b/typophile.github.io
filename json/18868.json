But FontLab has increased the speed of production dramatically by including a decent AutoHinter and Python support.\n\nI learned Python in a few hours and in less than a week I wrote enough functions to make a 250 glyph font into a 650 glyph font with extended fractions, superiors, inferiors, and accents to cover up to European Ext-A. Been able to batch process glyph names and other font info to fix or rename whole families and write out a fully localized name table all within the FontLab file.\n\nYou can also hint to a similar level by using the autohinter then changing it’s hints or adding your own.\n\nSo in the long run we are hinting/creating font files that are 3 times as big as we did five years ago, hinting to the same level and doing all that for 1/2 the price in 1/3 of the time.\n\nClearType and the Mac OS-X fuzzies have eliminated the need for heavy hinting but there are still situations that require manually hinted TrueType.\n\n"

Because I’m  \nwondering how that jives with “we are hinting/creating  \nfont files that are 3 times as big”, which confused me.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Y-direction hints, including deltas, are supported in current CT rasterisers and, as far as I know, they always have been. This makes sense, since the sampling gain is only in the x-direction. You need y direction hints to establish consistent alignment and horizontal stroke weight.\n\nWhat is new in the Vista CT rasteriser is gasp table controlled y-direction greyscale antialiasing.\n\n"
