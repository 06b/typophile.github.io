We are going to London, Edinburgh, Manchester and Leicester at the end of the month and I am wondering if any of you might have recommendations for type or design related things I could do or see...? My experience from traveling to other places is that if you just go by what is in the guide books, then you are missing out on a lot of possibly more interesting things.\n\nThank you,\n\nDuncan\n\n",

The V&A is great and has lots of artists' books which you can arrange an appointment to see. Also, Postman's Park is a lovely spot (just google it). The Design Museum is an obvious choice. Check Time Out for current exhibitions.\n\nThis is rather London-centric, I'm afraid...\n\n"

Then when I looked at the site for hours and ticket prices I found that it would not be open when we are there.\n\nI am definitely going to check out John Voller's tours. I really hope we can do that while we are in London.\n\nThere is so much to do and I feel like we have such a limited time. I'll do a little more research on your other recommendations and see what we can fit in.\n\nThank you all very much,\n\nDuncan\n\n"

Rare books and manuscripts housed in an amazing building.\n\n[http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321043834/http:/www.library.manchester.ac.uk/ \"http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/\")\n\n[http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data1/dg/exhibition/unlock/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321043834/http:/rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data1/dg/exhibition/unlock/ \"http://rylibweb.man.ac.uk/data1/dg/exhibition/unlock/\")\n\n2. Urbis. Usually has some design exhibtions on.\n\n[http://www.urbis.org.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321043834/http:/www.urbis.org.uk/ \"http://www.urbis.org.uk/\")\n\n[http://www.urbis.org.uk/page.asp?id=3134](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321043834/http:/www.urbis.org.uk/page.asp?id=3134 \"http://www.urbis.org.uk/page.asp?id=3134\")\n\n3. Manchester Art Gallery\n\n[http://www.manchestergalleries.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321043834/http:/www.manchestergalleries.org/ \"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/\")\n\n4. Imperial War Museum North. Designed by Daniel Libeskind.\n\n[http://north.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.00c](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321043834/http:/north.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.00c \"http://north.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.00c\")\n\nThat's all I can think of for the time being. When is it your thinking of travelling?\n\nHave a great time!\n\nDave\n\n"
