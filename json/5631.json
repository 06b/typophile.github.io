  "content": "I have read that OS X can use Windows TT fonts, but I want to know whether they work seamlessly or whether there are downsides.   \n   \nIf they work fine, I'd of course want to buy Win TT whenever possible so I can use it on my Mac and my PC. But if there are problems I'll just stick with the Mac versions. Does anyone regularly buy Windows fonts for their Mac?   \n   \nThanks,   \nza\n\n",

      "content": "I do. They mostly work fine, but their international behavior is a bit unpredictable - most have many Unicode pages, and the default language for each seems different. But all languges encoded in the TTF/OTF file ARE supported (and English too, of course) - if you use a Windows font in, say, Safari - they will work for any language.\n\n"
