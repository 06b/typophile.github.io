There are books with more extensive information and illustrations of typesetting history - you might see if you can get copies of the two volumes of Daniel Berkeley Updike's 'Printing Types: Their History, Forms and Use'. There are quite a few histories of type with images of book covers and title pages from the days of yore.\n\n"
