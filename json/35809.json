Rather than the cocaine and New Order vibe, or the Flashdance vibe of the others, I instead opted for the 80s midwestern white trash vibe. (The hat says Happy Days, by the way...)\n\nIt was awesome, because it added about 20 years to me, and no one recognized me at first glance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120727032918im_/http:/typophile.com/files/IMGP2635_3739.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120727032918im_/http:/typophile.com/files/20070428_0011_5954.jpg)\n\n",
