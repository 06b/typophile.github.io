I could find a use for it.   \nIt reminds me of the paper clip. Which I also really like. It's a beautiful thing if you think about it. So well designed you hardly stop to think about it. But, when you do, you just have to say _wow_.   \n  \nBut I digress.   \n  \nThe UC \\*Y\\* throws me off a bit but I see how you got there. Same thing with the \\*?\\*. In the latter case I would like to see more space in the bowl. But again, I see what you are after - its in the style of the design.   \n  \nNice face, Very pleasant.   \n  \nsmc\n\n"

      "content": "the turbo-heightened x-height creates some great and unique forms. looks great to me, the only thing which remotely causes me to doubt is the closeness of the dots on the lc i's. i'd not raise them, perhaps shorten the bottom a smidgeon to define the separation more.   \n   \ncurious: on a typography site, is one's credibility compromised in critique comments where smart quotes and apostrophes are not applied?\n\n"
