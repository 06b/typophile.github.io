      "content": "Good suggestions Kevin.  \nGrange is the name used for a circa 1900 [just a guess as to date] Art Nouveau font found at p. 53 of Dan X. Solo's big catalog of his typeface purchases, but I don't know if this was the original name or the original designer or foundry. The unusual word \"Grange\" seems to have originated as a term for a farming estate belonging to a monastery but in the context of circa 1900 it may have referred to \"The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry\" See wiki at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_National\\_Grange\\_of\\_the\\_Order\\_of\\_Patrons...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140901224551/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Grange_of_the_Order_of_Patrons_of_Husbandry \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_National\\_Grange\\_of\\_the\\_Order\\_of\\_Patrons\\_of\\_Husbandry\") which includes a link to a colorful poster from 1873. Unfortunately Wiki says nothing about a font called Grange.  \nDon\n\n"
