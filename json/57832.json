The name could be paraphrased as \"cursive for manuscripts\".\n\nNastaliq is a simplified derivative of historical, pre-typographic naskh. It retains all the connection rules characteristic of pre-typographic Arabic, be it that they are considerably less complex than those of pre-typographic naskh.\n\nFrom a purely Western typographical perspective, nastaliq is considered to be \"very complex\". Ironically and apparently paradoxically, the first accurate metal typeface produced in the Arabic-scripted world - using Western typographic technology - was based on nastaliq.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Handwritten Indian Newspapers](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424141143/http:/typophile.com/node/34937)  \n [Nastaliq Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424141143/http:/typophile.com/node/44140)  \n [Urdu Features](http://web.archive.org/web/20120424141143/http:/typophile.com/node/57013)\n\n",
