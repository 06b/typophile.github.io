      "content": "Don't use Arial just because it is popular (this isn't actually true for the most part - it is a \"default\") and recognizable (Actually I doubt it is recognized by anyone other than typographers), actually that would be a very bad design decision.\n\nThere are many resources available for finding out information about [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131026195924/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica) online, and many more in books. You might consider actually using the face so that you can include an informed opinion about how well it works or doesn't work for you.\n\nStart here:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/13514](http://web.archive.org/web/20131026195924/http:/typophile.com/node/13514 \"http://typophile.com/node/13514\")?  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131026195924/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica\")\n\nThen consult your local library or bookshop.\n\n"
