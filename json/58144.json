      "content": "While it's true that these control the \"fake\" super/subs, many apps and operating systems \\*still\\* don't support super/subs via OpenType. So the best thing to do is at least take a decent whack at setting these values. At minimum, try to test in apps that use them (e.g. MS Word) and verify that the defaults are giving reasonable results.\n\nAs to the specifics:  \nThe X/Y size values represent a scale factor. Since X and Y are separated, this allows you to scale the width differently than the height, which you might want to do to give more weight to the stems, rather than just a straight scale. To figure out the values to use, look at your real, designed sups/subs, and calculate what percentage they are of the original (i.e. \"zero superior is 65% of the size of the normal zero\", use 650 for the size).\n\nPer the spec: the Y pos (\"offset\") values \"specif[y] a font designer's recommended vertical offset from the character baseline to the character baseline for subscript characters\". So, work out where you want the baseline of the superscripts to be, relative to the normal baseline of the font, in em units, and enter that value. For example, if the superscript baseline is at 400 units above the normal baseline, enter 400. The only slightly odd thing as I mentioned above is that + values mean \"down\" for Y subscript pos...so if the subscript baseline is at -300, you'd just use 300 for that value.\n\nThe X pos values are used for italics, to control positioning along the italic angle. You can use some simple trigonometry to calculate that (using the Y pos value + italic angle).\n\n"
