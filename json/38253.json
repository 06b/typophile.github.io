I’m just starting to learn the ropes of this program (lot of ropes!). Seasoned users may have some better techniques. Sounds like what you’re after is a wonky circle.\n\n"

      "content": "imagine a stretched 8-gon, 12-gon, or 16-gon or any n-gon. now try to round that polygon in illustrator to create a perfectly rounded “O”, similar to a condensed font “O”. the resulting “O” won’t look like a stretched circle (ellipse), it will look like a rectangled circle - that vintage TV screen shape. I couldn’t find a way to do this neither in Illustrator nor in FontLab.\n\nI could pull the handles but the resulting rounded shape has to be regular (symetrical). that means we need some kind of automated function to create a rounded shape out of a an angled one, or at least appropriate grid snapping.\n\nAfter rounding, the corner points should remain at their original coordinates, as well.\n\n"

If the latter are too sharp, change to smooth points with the control points very close to the point.\n\nI doubt you will find a filter for this, but you should be able to do a decent job with a lot of guides to align your control points correctly.\n\n"
