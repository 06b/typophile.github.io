  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nAfter the success of last Fall's FontLab class, I am starting up another very soon. Most of you probably don't need it (it's super basic), but anyone who's interested is welcome.\n\nAll that entry requires is enrolling at [City College of San Francisco](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134059/http:/www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Matriculation/step1.htm) and having some demonstrable command of Bézier curves (like in Illustrator).\n\nEverything else we can take care of on the first day of class.\n\nGRPH 152 Digital Font Creation  \nMondays: 1:00–5:00pm, Visual Arts 143  \nCCSF Ocean Campus: 50 Phelan Ave.  \n8-week course: March 20–May 15, 2006  \nCRN 37865\n\nBTW, it's a one-unit class, making it a whopping $26!\n\nFeel free to email me with questions,\n\nAmy Conger  \n [http://www.ccsf.edu/~aconger/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134059/http:/www.ccsf.edu/~aconger/)  \n [http://www.abecedarienne.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317134059/http:/www.abecedarienne.com/ \"http://www.abecedarienne.com\")\n\n",
