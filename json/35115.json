  "content": "Hi all. I’m currently in the process of branding a company (Loa Creative) and wanted to get a few suggestions on a nice, strong blackletter face that has that “feel”. I’ve been looking at a few 19th Century medicine labels (friend is a fanatical collector of them) and noticed that A LOT of them promoted themselves via blackletter faces. I was looking for a face that encompassed something archaic, but still familiar. I’m not particularly looking for legibilty, as it will be used in conjuction with symbols used in the vodoun religion (hense the name Loa). Any suggestions?? Thanks!\n\n [‹ Type Design tutorial anywhere? - How to create fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031225848/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35134 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [French typography 1963? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071031225848/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33309 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
