      "content": "It sounds like a problem with the linebreaks in your file. Make sure you use a a plain text editor (like the free TextWrangler for instance; Apple's TextEdit is not so suitable). Make sure you use Unix linebreaks and finish the last entry in your file with a linebreak too.\n\nHope that helps.\n\n"
