What \\*is\\* absolutely certain is that they were not produced on the IBM Selectric Composer or the IBM Executive, the two machines most often touted as possibly producing the documents. I have done experiments that prove this beyond any reasonable doubt (while simultaneously supporting but not proving forgery).   \n   \nSee this morning's Washington Post:   \nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A18982-2004Sep13.html   \n   \n   \nClarifications I sorted through last night to my bit of the article:   \n   \n1) Adobe did the digital version of Times Roman from which the Microsoft/Monotype Times New Roman borrowed its widths to use with the Monotype design. Adobe got said widths from Linotype. I did mention the various other players, but what can you expect when an entire interview is boiled down to a couple of sentences?   \n   \n2) Although certainly a run-of-the-mill Selectric could not have produced the memo, more importantly I eliminated the IBM \"Selectric Composer\" (often just called an \"IBM Composer\"). This was an actual typesetting device based on typewriter-like technology, which has frequently been touted as the likely source of the memos.   \n   \n3) The IBM machines used fonts of different widths than the font used for the memos. The font used for the memos is a perfect match for Times. The IBM machines were not capable of producing a perfect match to those widths. Times is based on a system of widths of 5-17 units (at 18-to-the-em). The Composer uses a system of 3-9 units, and the Executive a system of 2-5 units.   \n   \n4) The reporter didn't tell me of Glennon's statement, so it's funny to say that I disputed it. Indeed, I won't dispute that the IBM machines could produce results \"similar\" to the disputed memos. But they cannot reproduce the exact relative line lengths, which is what I measured. Can they do something \"similar\"? Sure. Could they produce those actual memos? Impossible.   \n   \n5) Of course Adobe's HQ is in San Jose. I am at our Seattle offices.   \n   \n6) I've done this solely on my own time. Adobe as a company takes no position on the memos (or the election).   \n   \nThat's about it for now. Here's the first visual aid I produced (attached), along with the original memo for comparison.   \n   \nCheers,   \n   \nT\n\n"

What is your view on the issue of the proportions. (see the discussion at typographi.com)\n\n"

      "content": "1) As a courtesy, I'm going to give ABC News and my blogging writer friend Jules Siegel first shot at showing the \"visual aid.\" I'll post it within another day or so after they've had their chance.   \n   \n2) No, all I care is when the lines end, what letter is above/below what. The cumulative effect of the advance widths. This is practically immune to the issues of distortion from repeated copying.   \n   \nIt's possible that the font is something other than Times or Times New Roman. If so, it exactly matches the advance widths of Times/TNR, and it's an interesting coincidence that virtually all the letterforms are close enough that differences could be attributed to degradation from repeated scanning/copying (like being faxed, then being scanned and having the scan dropped to ~120 dpi).   \n   \nHere's the short version of my analysis:   \n   \nSUMMARY   \n   \nThe incredibly bad reproduction of the memos makes it hard to state many things definitively. But one thing that is not degraded by the reproduction is the simple question of relative line lengths. Where does each line end, relative to the lines above and below it?   \n   \nGiven proportionally spaced fonts, and a large enough sample (as these four memos are), these line breakings offer a sort of digital fingerprint of the widths of the font used. The memos precisely match current digital versions of Times (and previous phototype and hot metal typesetting versions), but they do not match the IBM Composer fonts (1), or do they match any version of the IBM Executive (2).   \n   \nDETAIL:   \n   \nThis is not overly surprising, since the number of possible character widths was much more limited for the Composer (all characters were 3-9 units wide) and the Executive (all characters were 2-5 or perhaps 2-6 units wide).   \n   \nIt is worth noting that the digital versions of Times available today are all based on an earlier 18-units-relative-to-height (\"to the em\" in font-geek-speak) system, with common characters being 5-17 units wide. So while they have relatively discrete widths for common characters, these widths are at a \"finer grain\" than early typewriters or low-end typesetters of the 70s such as the Executive and the Composer.   \n   \nToday's digital versions of Times have widths that descend from those used in Linotype's phototypesetting and earlier hot metal versions. Monotype had previously had a (more original) version with different widths, but when Microsoft licensed Monotype's version, they wanted it to be compatible with Adobe's, so the widths were changed to match the Adobe/Lino versions. Thus all the main digital versions of Times used today have the same widths.   \n   \n(1) The IBM Composer proportional fonts all had the same relative character widths, regardless of font design. Thus there is in essence only one \"fingerprint\" for the Composer fonts. Times matches the memo fingerprint, but not the Composer fingerprint.   \n Contrariwise, I made a digital version of a Composer font (since I have the widths info). This allowed me to do \"virtual Composer\" simulations and prove in the reverse direction, that the relative line lengths set with the virtual Composer are quite different. (Note: My Composer simulation font was accurate to the nearest 1/1000 of the point size for each letter.)   \n   \n(2) The IBM Executive did not offer switchable fonts, so you literally had to buy a different typewriter to get a different proportional font. None of them is particularly close to Times.   \n   \nSpecial Thanks to all the people who have helped me in my research:   \n- Gerry Kaplan on the IBM Composer   \n- Norm Aleks on the IBM Executive and the Composer   \n- Frank Romano and Jack Powers on other possible devices   \n- a retired Adobe person who verified the origins of the Times metrics   \n- Jules Siegel for pointing me at many blogs and arguing with me enough that I realized how visual I needed to make things   \n   \nAnd thanks also to Carol Wahler for putting Newsweek in touch with me and Adobe PR for putting the Washington Post onto me.   \n   \nI am of course solely responsible for my opinions and conclusions, which are not necessarily the same as anybody else's, and do not reflect any particular views of my employer.   \n   \nAlthough I don't feel any need to promote my personal political views, those who know me well will be well aware that my politics obviously had no influence on this analysis.\n\n"

Obviously, the letterforms themselves are mangled beyond recognition, but the cumulative effect of the metrics is much more apparent. Even the slightest differences in character widths when multiplied by hundreds of characters will affect copy flow. Ask any middle schooler who has typed a paper: choose the right font, and a nine page paper becomes ten--and for the most part, your teachers will still think any serif font is Times New Roman (along with most of the members of the press). Obviously the the differences here are more subtle, but the principle is the same. It's really tricky to match copy flow exactly without the exact type, because the metrics will vary slightly, even from vendor to vendor for a particular face. Some notable exceptions are \"parasitic\" fonts specifically designed to replicate metrics, such as Arial, allowing for substitution without changing copy flow.   \n   \nI still had some doubts about the forgeries with all of the old Selectric Composer guys coming out saying \"typewriters could do anything computers can as early as 1492\", but my suspicions were confirmed when I started to see accurate descriptions of Composer metrics. I commented on this over at Typographica. (By the way, what's up with typophile going down the weekend typography was being discussed in every news venue?)   \n   \nTangent: Didn't Adobe do some stuff with \"universal fonts\" at one point that would replicate font metrics to replace document fonts without changing copy flow/document layout?\n\n"
