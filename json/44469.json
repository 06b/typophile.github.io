  "content": "Here is the problem:  \nI have multiple instances of identical type families that should be merged into a single suitcase.  \nIt becomes very tedious to scroll through huge blocks of the same typeface that should be nested into the same suitcase.  \nIs there a way to group these families into a single suitcase through the use of a freeware application or other means?  \nI am using 10.5.\n\nI have attached an image for reference.\n\nThank you!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140329070241/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_128.png) | 129.44 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "In the case of Aaux (the font family in your example image), the foundry has chosen to put each font style into its own family of one. This is not an uncommon practice and is done mainly to avoid cross-platform document compatibility problems due to differences in the way font families are handled on Macs and PCs. There isn't any simple way to change the way a font's names are set up. It's one of the more complicated areas of font development. If you know what you are doing, you could do it with TTX, but I wouldn't recommend it. I would agree with Jens--it would be best to contact the foundry.\n\n"
