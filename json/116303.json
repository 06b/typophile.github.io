      "content": "'LES MALLES MOYNAT' has been reborn in December 2011 by LVMH group. It was a well-known high-end trunk (malle in french) manufacturer. A point to consider is almost all companies in the fashion industry business use bespoke typefaces and custom lettering (which sounds obvious).  \nSo, you're right, that's neither Futura or Neutraface but this /S is definitely to close to Futura to be a coincidence (or a customization).\n\nA point for Neutraface, from ' [Popular Logos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/popularlogos.blogspot.fr/2011/12/le-dieu-du-luxe-ressuscite-une-marque.html)' blog\n\n> After some search, type has been customized but still based on Neutraface.\n\nAnother point for Futura. Baseline of their main logo is set in Futura.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812im_/http:/typophile.com/files/moynat_5238.png)\n\n... But 'PARIS' baseline from their website logo looks like Neutraface No.2\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-moynat_6707.jpg)\n\nActually, that could easily be a mash-up of these 2 (or a customization of any of these 2):  \n- /L, /E, /O, /N and /T from Futura  \n- (alternate)/M and /A from Neutraface No.2\n\nAlternatives but all /S are off: [Milano](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mtt/milano), [Noir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/m-b-creative/mb-noir), [Arquitecta](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/arquitecta), [Celias](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typedynamic/celias), [Radikal](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nootype/radikal), [Ano](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317064812/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/alias/ano)\n\n"

The expressions of the owners, and what appears to be an hotel employee, are priceless. Photography would be so inferior. The crisp authority and stylish quality of \\_MOYNAT\\_ is complemented by the hand lettered informational text with the flavor of Futura. No grunge, chicken tracks or kid's scrawl here! Handlettering like this from the 1920s and 30s is a gold standard. I'm trying to decide what digital font would match the mix of clarity, subtle variation and friendly tone in the Moynat hand lettering.. Not an easy choice.  \nDon\n\n"
