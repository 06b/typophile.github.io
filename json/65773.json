It only misses the information about how to set the stem weight values. But a while ago Ken Lunde and David Lemon have provided useful information in the thread **[PostScript hinting -- number and weight of standard stems](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071534/http:/typophile.com/node/59506)**.\n\nBy the way, Adobe works on a new tutorial. I hope that it will be released with the next version of the AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType). Or is it already available? That would be very cool.\n\nThe AFDKO contains an excellent autohinting program. But the alignment zones and the stem weight values have to be chosen manually.\n\nIf you want to hint a TrueType font, I can’t help. I only know one tutorial. There is a link on the myfonts website. But as far as I remember it is not about Delta hinting.\n\nYou also should have a look into the FontLab manual.\n\n"

      "content": "@ adilturbo\n\nDavid Lemon’s tutorial is a step by step tutorial, but for PostScript flavored fonts only.\n\n1. Set the alignment zones with the help of the tutorial.  \n2. Set the standard stem values with the help of the auto function of FontLab. It is in the font info panel. (You have to use the autohinting function of FontLab first [F7].) Later you can manually tune the standard stem values.  \n3. Remove all hints.  \n4. Hint the fonts with the AFDKO autohinting macro. (There is a bug in the macro, which I have corrected. You can download it **[at the FontLab forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015071534/http:/forum.fontlab.com/adobe-fdk-for-opentype-afdko/bug-in-autohintscript-belonging-to-the-afdko-25-21898-t7057.0.html)**.)\n\nThere are a few FontLab options, that you should deactivate:  \n\"Use subroutines to compress outlines in the CFF table\" and \"Autohint unhinted glyphs\".\n\nPostScript hinting is much easier than drawing the outlines. So, if you have designed the typeface, you are for sure able to hint it.\n\nI never have hinted a TrueType font. I don’t know, how difficult basic TrueType hinting is, but Delta hinting seems to be a science. I have heard, that only a few people have the knowledge and the abilities to set Delta hints.\n\n"
