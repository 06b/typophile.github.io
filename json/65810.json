  "content": "This is the wall calendar for the year 2010. It's made of two thousand and ten keyboard keys. This design offers a new visual experience of time, differently than your average wall calendar. It looks beautiful on the wall, and makes finding dates and marking events a creative process.\n\nThe size of the print is B0 (70cm x 100cm / 27.56” x 39.37”).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014155803im_/http:/typophile.com/files/70100_300dpi_6349.jpg)\n\nThe printing is done with a standard 4c offset printing machine on 135g/m2 glossy paper, finished with a UV coating to protect the colors from bleaching. The UV coating also provides protection against water and dust.\n\nShipping:\n\nWorldwide shipping (folded in a protected envelope) is included in the price of $20.10.\n\nFor $9.90 extra the wall calendar will be sent rolled in a reusable plastic tube.\n\nIf you decide to order two or more wall calendars, world wide shipping (rolled in reusable tubes) is FREE!\n\nOrders:\n\nOrders can be made through Etsy [http://www.etsy.com/view\\_listing.php?listing\\_id=37601980](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014155803/http:/www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=37601980) or my [(beta-) Website](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014155803/http:/haraldgeisler.com/).\n\nCritique:  \nIs welcome!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nPS: Yes, worldwide includes Alaska … Albany … Greece … Italy … Japan … New Zealand … Zimbabwe etc.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014155803im_/http:/typophile.com/files/70100Thumbnail_4914.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014155803im_/http:/typophile.com/files/70100-holding_6365.jpg)\n\n",
