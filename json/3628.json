It has all upper case letters but the ones from the shifted keys have a different shape, given a more realistic simulation of real printing. This has a bold version called Le Obelisk, which I didn't see at MyFonts\n\n"

And the references   \nto modern day history and numerous cameos by famous   \npersonalities are gold. The comic books are even used   \nin school to teach French!\n\n"

They were given to me by a collegue of my dad's from Denmark who stayed with us a few times when he was in the U.S. on business. I still have them, though they are very tattered now. A few years ago I started buying more of them (a few in French, mostly in English) to read to my daughter. We both love them. Astérix Légionnaire, the first one I ever saw, is still my favorite.\n\n"

The great thing is you can read them   \non so many levels: for kids it's very funny slapstick   \nand situation humour, but as you grow older and   \nreread them you start noticing the subtle word plays,   \nthe celebrity cameos, the references to history,   \npolitics, social issues, cultural preconceptions...   \nthey're just great.\n\n"

The stuff in the word balloons in Asterix comics is LETTERING not FONTS or TYPOGRAPHY. \\*sigh\\* (One of my pet peeves is the way people refer to any kind of letter style as a “font,” regardless of whether it is actually a font or not.)\n\nI do enjoy the way they use different lettering styles in Asterix to indicate what language is being spoken. Clever.\n\n"
