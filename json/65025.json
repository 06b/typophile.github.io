I am looking for a typeface to be used on screen and for print.\n\nAfter reading this thread - [http://www.typophile.com/node/3413](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123440/http:/www.typophile.com/node/3413 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/3413\") it stated for maximum legibility on screen a typeface with a high x-height should be used.\n\nSo please recommend some san-serif and slab-serif fonts with high x-heights.\n\nI have used [http://www.neutura.org/Neutrino.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150405123440/http:/www.neutura.org/Neutrino.html \"http://www.neutura.org/Neutrino.html\") for my logo if this helps :)\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",

We commission gutsy programmes and blend cool drama with our own lifestyles. We segue effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist.\n\nThe picture is fantastic. What’s missing is the frame. We’ve lost our mojo. We are too passive – lost in the avalanche of brands (movies, adverts, sponsors, TV shows) screaming for attention.\n\nWe need to build a big, bold brand – to forge emotional connections with our audiences – to be open and compelling – rooted in truth and effect. We want to carve out a place in people’s hearts – be a challenger and express a clear point of view. We need to be more than expected – not just any other channel.\n\nThe Brief  \nWe want you to develop the identity/look and creative direction of the channel.\n\nName  \nChannel X is only a working title – we want you to come up with a name that reflects the personality and values of the channel.\n\nLogo  \nCreate a logo that represents the channel. It can be live action, animation-based and it needs to have a strong, bold attitude that feels alive while being essentially typographic. This needs to be applied for on screen use and for a range of channel marketing materials and merchandise.\n\ndo  \n– create a distinct, expressive, cohesive, entertaining, exciting channel look.  \n– have a strategy that is driven by the proposition ‘stimulation for the masses’.  \n– relate the look to channel content.\n\ndon’t  \n– create typical logo idents that feel generic.  \n– create typical TV design.\n\nTarget Audience  \nOur audience  \n– love being entertained.  \n– are not affluent but have sophisticated spending and tastes.  \n– are articulate but not necessarily university educated.  \n– are 16–45 with a slight male bias.  \n– are a cultural mix.  \n– includes young parents.  \n——————————————————————————————————-\n\nI feel the channel is trying to be like a mix of Channel 4 and MTV.\n\n"

It's not technically a sans, but its flares do give it great visual interest at larger sizes. However in print I would not use it for more than a couple of lines of text; for that I would find a font that matches Laudatio but with a smaller x-height (and perhaps not as wide). Maybe Pascal.\n\nIf you want something more contemporary and rigid, try FF Balance, which actually evokes \"TV\" to me quite strongly. It even has gentle traps, which would compensate for dot gain in video. Also, you could use it for print text, but still not long text.\n\nLogo feedback in that other thread.\n\nhhp\n\n"
