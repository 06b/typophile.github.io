  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m trying to find a good solution for setting type (place names etc.) over satellite photographs. The examples I’ve seen either have the type set in yellow or outlined in a contrasting colour. Neither of these methods seem particularly fantastic to me, so I’d appreciate any ideas for methods and/or typefaces.\n\nThanks,  \nRichard\n\n",

Yet, if the images are as you originally posted, Richard then I would go with white as yellow is too closely related color-wise to the blue/green combo you have in your posted photo.\n\n"
