I realize that I can't license it or anything, and that it's not as difficult as creating a face from scratch, but I wanted to know what the 'philes think....\n\nCaps only as of right now, halfway through digits...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819213910im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Avenir_Ultralight_6354.jpg)\n\n",

I think in a few places I wasn't sure exactly where the characters should begin and end. I'm not sure how well I can explain myself.\n\nTo answer Stephen... Maybe I'll should re-title this typeface as \"moot point\" to get away with it. I don't think a 26-character face would do too well...\n\nThanks all!\n\n"
