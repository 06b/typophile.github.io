  "content": "BAD HOMBURG, Germany, Dec. 10, 2009 – Linotype GmbH, a Monotype Imaging (Nasdaq: TYPE) company, has expanded its portfolio of Arabic typefaces to include a new design: the Neue Helvetica® Arabic typeface family.\n\nDesigned by Nadine Chahine, Linotype’s Arabic specialist typeface designer, Neue Helvetica Arabic combines the traditional Helvetica style, with the distinctive scripts of Arabic. The new typeface now allows Helvetica to be used in Arabic headlines, titles, signage, logos and corporate communication.\n\nFrank Wildenberg, managing director of Linotype, said: “The release of Neue Helvetica Arabic is part of Linotype’s response to the growing market for Arabic typefaces. We have released a series of successful Arabic typefaces in the last few years and we pride ourselves in providing original and innovative designs that can be used in many different mediums, internationally.”\n\nThe popularity of Helvetica meant Chahine had an ambitious task when it came to designing the Arabic version of the typeface. According to Chahine, not only are Latin and Arabic languages intrinsically different in design, but it is a challenge to create an Arabic typeface that works in both headlines and text. This is due to Arabic scripts having many different calligraphic styles, for either text or headlines. Neue Helvetica Arabic has been designed to be used at the same point size, weight and optical size as the Latin version and translates the Helvetican concept into Arabic. Despite being translated into another script system, Chahine’s approach was to ensure that the neutrality and formality of the original typeface be maintained.\n\nChahine said: “Helvetica is an iconic design and I was delighted to be involved in this project. The finished typeface is original and innovative and inspired by a rich blend of local aesthetics while ensuring international levels of quality and performance.”\n\nNeue Helvetica Arabic fonts may be viewed, purchased and downloaded from [www.linotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120827151001/http:/www.linotype.com/ \"www.linotype.com\").
