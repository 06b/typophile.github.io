But the ruling was intentionally very tightly defined as \"...with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright.\" The linking of the two (guns and filesharing) may make conceptual sense, but probably makes less legal sense. Also, the argument that will most likely be used to dismantle an attack on gun manufacturers: ownership of guns has its own Amendment\\*. Whereas filesharing (or its conceptual equivalent) does not. Though the ninth Amendment\\*\\* would be the obvious retort, I suppose.\n\nAs for the case specifically, I'd posit that it's not a matter of valuing one over the other, _per se_, but a matter of one being a scary new technology that affects commerce in new and unfamiliar ways (to those involved in the legal battle), whereas the other is a long-entrenched political thicket. From my understanding, Grokster really got nailed because they were foolish with their self-promotion. They made it clear enough that violating copyright law through filesharing with Grokster was part of its purpose. If they'd been more mindful (as Apple is with its iPod), they probably would've been able to at least stage a stronger counter-attack. I understand the danger of the ruling, but I'm not sure I disagree with the specific instance that spawned it.\n\n\\*\"_A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed._\"\n\n\\*\\*\"_The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people._\"\n\n"

It's got little to nothing to do with \"personal responsibility\" (a term that sounds great until you put it into practice, kind of like \"corporate accountability\"). It's about intent.

She received 3rd degree burns over 16% of her body, burns which required \"hospitalization for eight days, whirlpool treatment for debridement of her wounds, skin grafting, scarring, and disability for more than two years\". McDonald's also admitted that \"its coffee is 'not fit for consumption' when sold because it causes severe scalds if spilled or drunk\".\n\nThe case rested on the idea that A) McDonald's knew that it was selling a dangerously hot liquid that was far beyond the temperature required to be considered 'hot' to people who were driving B) made no move to warn them in spite of other consumers getting burned, and C) had no plans to change the sitution for the benefit of the public's safety. She wanted to settle for $20K, but McDonald's refused, and she ended up with a sum that was a far smaller % than the false $3 Million often repeated by tellers of the story.\n\nWhile one may still not agree with the ruling, the facts shed light on why this case was actually treated seriously by the court.\n\n"

In a similar vein, you could consider FontLab. Some people use it in an illegal way, but you couldn't blame the FontLab boys for this. Again, it all goes back to personal responsibility, personal HUMAN responsibility. That is why I think ISPs should be held responsible once informed of the illegal activity.\n\n"

Most ISPs will, indeed, shut down any illegal going-ons. But, at the same time, they do have a right, and expectation, IMHO, to provide a level of privacy for their customers as well. Also, when the RIAA is out their making incredibly outrageous lawsuits, I can see why larger ISPs would be less inclined to take them seriously.\n\n"

Shouldn’t the CD price be just a few bucks just to upgrade the media?_\n\nrecord companies thought vinyl would essentially die out with the advent of the cd, and so re-released artists' entire back catalogues on cd to make some more money and revive flagging sales.\n\nthe opposite seems to be happening now - vinyl is becoming trendy again, with picture disks, limited edition 7\" (or 9\" if you're 9inch nails) and back-catalogue items sitting on most large chain stores. and over here in the uk, it's often cheaper to buy the cd than the vinyl. for instance, at hmv one can purchase the cd of british sea power's \"open season\" fo 8.99, or the vinyl for 12.99.\n\n"
