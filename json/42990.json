  "content": "two questions:\n\n\\* first, what is the typographic term for the junction of the axis between the two u’s (v shapes, normally) of the letter w?\n\n(see uploaded image)\n\n\\* is there an easy to find a font (preferably sans-serif) for everyday use where the junction of the axis occurs lower than the two stems on ether side? I guess the same might be true for a letter M as well. I’ve gone through my font explorer and library and can only find a few examples, like lithos but that’s not really what I want.\n\nthanks in advance.\n\n—\n\nskipper chong warson  \ngraphic design  \n [http://www.skipperchong.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907032341/http:/www.skipperchong.com/ \"http://www.skipperchong.com\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907032341im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/65ABBBAD28554EFAA2B39A79FC1BA7CB_4545.gif)\n\n [‹ Suggestions for Jazz typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907032341/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42897 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Neutraface No. 2 ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907032341/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38416 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
