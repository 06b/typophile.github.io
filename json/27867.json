A little bit of taste here, and c’mon it’s not that bad, I don’t agree...  \nBy the way, I’d LOVE to see your bCards guys...  \nLet’s have a little gallery here in this thread.  \nB.CARDS HALL OF FAME (first edition)\n\nThanxxx.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123030904im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bCards_4009.jpg)\n\n [‹ Font crush of the day part II](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123030904/http:/typophile.com/node/27846 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font crush of the day ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123030904/http:/typophile.com/node/27843 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
