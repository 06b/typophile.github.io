I designed that logo when the font was really new, though, and not overused for Asian themes like it is now. I remember it also from a book I read awhile back about growing up in Afghanistan but I can’t remember the title.\n\nI also used it for the title of this book:\n\nhttp://www.powerhousebooks.com/books!/PleasurePalaces/\n\nand made extensive use of the ornaments inside.\n\n"
