  "content": "G'day guys,\n\nCouple of questions:\n\n1. Does anyone have experience in licensing fonts for embedding in academic journals available in PDFs? Do you think the copyright revenue that publishers get counts the publication towards being a commercial product?\n\nAlso\n\n2. One of the fonts is (the ever glamorous) Palatino. This is the font info:\n\nCopyright © 1991-99, 2006 Apple Computer, Inc. Copyright © 1991-92 Type Solutions, Inc. All rights reserved. Trademark Palatino is a registered trademark of Linotype AG.\n\nWho do I contact for licensing? Apple, TSI (Bitstream) or Monotype/Linotype?\n\nAs with a lot of my fonts, I have no documentation letting me know where or when they came from in the first place, I just have to guess. In the future I'm aiming to only use foundries that have no restrictions on embedding,  \nthanks guys, you've been helpful in the past I hope you can help now.\n\n--N\n\n",
