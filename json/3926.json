Which is more important?   \n   \nHere's an example of an ingenious negative-space trick that doesn't need any help: [http://www.bigten.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417031107/http:/www.bigten.org/)   \n(Note: The Big Ten Conference is actually 11 teams now.)   \n   \n\\> I was sad when they redesigned it.   \n   \nThe whole redesign looks wannabe to me: going in the wrong direction, backwards to what used to be cool 5 years ago or something.

I always thought that was a classic; it could well have been designed in the thirties by some rogue Bauhaus ne'er do well.   \nAnd personally, I like their approach to fast food compared to the burger chains. Their ingredients may be factory-farmed but the experience of walking into a Subway you never visited before is a bit more like a roll of the dice than the totally predictable experience at any given McDonalds etc. The care or lack thereof that the Subway \"sandwich artists\" give to your sub is something to behold. It's an intensive interaction the like of which you don't even get at a sit-down $12 entrée restaurant.   \nI hope the logo debacle isn't some sort of indication that an unwelcome change is in the offing.   \n   \nAnd let's not forget that their interior decor features late 19th/early 20th century newspaper reproductions covering the walls. - full of nice examples of the use of Cheltenham, amongst other types. There must have been some sort of typophile involved in their early retail design team. It would be nice to know the story behind this.\n\n"

While Felix credits Joel Templin (The T in TBD) as creative director, TBD doesn't acknowledge Felix at all, though I know they frequently work together, so I am confused as to who did what and for whom.   \n   \nAs for the original vs. the \"client ruined\" design, I prefer the latter. The first is totally impractical when it comes to application. While neither of them are stunning, the final version is credible, unique and surprisingly memorable.   \n   \nWhat I find more objectionable is that a designer would post a disclaimer on his site lambasting his client. Every project is a collaborative effort, and often the results are less than we feel we could have achieved if left to our own devices. But the fact of the matter is that design is a service industry, not an artistic autocracy. Our clients are an essential part of the equation, and bad-mouthing them discredits design as a profession.\n\n"
