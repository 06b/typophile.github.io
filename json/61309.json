There is also [Chestnut Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024350/http:/www.azfonts.net/load_font/chesc.html).\n\nI did find another version called [Chesterfield](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024350/http:/www.azfonts.net/load_font/chester.html)\n\nIn all of this I discovered an eye opening website...\n\n“The history of typefaces is the history of forgeries”  \n [http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024350/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/ \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/\")\n\nBelow is an overview from the the page on SWFTE\n\n———- snip ————\n\nThe defunct font forging company SWFTE International in Rockland (Delaware), forged roughly 1,600 fonts sold as CDs, at first by SWFTE itself, then by the front company Expert Softare, Inc. (also defunct) and in recent years under the label Fantastic Fonts.\n\nIt should be mentioned as an irony of fate that the SWFTE font forging company forged the fonts of the Bitstream font forging company, which had forged the Linotype font collection. Strangely enough, the Bitstream font forging company (and other font outfits, e.g. Adobe) sued the SWFTE font forging company (see the court file: Bitstream, Inc., et al. v. SWFTE International Ltd. Case No. 93-11067H, District of Mass) i.e. “forger v. forger”, so to speak, but the claims of the font forging plaintiffs were dismissed by the Massachusetts court.\n\nExample: The original Monotype typeface ’Rockwell’ was cloned by Linotype. This Linotype clone was forged by Bitstream and sold as ’Geometric Slab 712’, and this font was forged by SWFTE and sold as ’Rockland’.\n\n———- snip ————\n\n[http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/swfte.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20091003024350/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/swfte.pdf \"http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/swfte.pdf\")\n\n"
