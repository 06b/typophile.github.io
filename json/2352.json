I wonder what the thinking is?   \n   \nYeah, and on CD's that are liscenced from EMI UK by other divisions of EMI, it has both logos on the back. At first when I saw that I thought they were trying to get people used to the new logo before making a complete transition, but after searching for the logo online, I realized the contrary.   \n   \nI personally really like the somple rectangular logo over the circular one, not really sure why.   \n   \n\\>On the aforementioned EMI Chrysalis UK website it's really hard to read the new logo when it's that small, the block letters in full would be easier.   \n   \nThis becomes extremely important on the back of a CD, when the logos are no bigger that a 1/4 inch in both directions.\n\n"
