I've been looking everywhere for the script font used in this image, an ad for Los Santos in GTAV. It's just perfect. I've tried using font identification websites such as whatthefont but to no avail.. I've found similar fonts, such as wisdomscript, pacifico, missionscript, recklame, and lobster, but nothing close enough to the one used in this image.\n\nI'm hoping its not a custom font created by rockstar because I love it already and want to use it :P\n\nIf anyone can help me out that'd be great!  \nThanks!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Sign Painter HouseScript by House Industries \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317161132/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
