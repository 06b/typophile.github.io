      "content": "Props for drawing your own letters!   \n   \nI can see that you are trying to relate the a and e. Typically this is done by giving them (optically) the same amount of counter. In other words, consider making the the bowl of your a very small (like the eye on the e), or the eye of the e very large like the bowl on the a. I'd actually meet somewhere in the middle.   \n   \nTry bar & restaurant in caps. Maybe even extended caps for a little contrast.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"
