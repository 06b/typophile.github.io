  "content": "Myself and an associate are jointly designing a wide sans-serif display typeface and are looking for some information on standard character sets and advice on how we should proceed with the design.\n\nWe started this project with the fashion industry in mind and designed an entire uppercase glyph set with an emphasis on elegance. We discussed the design direction for the lowercase and feel that it would detract from the typeface's overall elegance.\n\nIf we were to proceed without lowercase glyphs, would it create a stumbling block for us if we decided to try to sell the fonts through a foundry or reseller? Do you think the lack of a lowercase would put the foundries and/or potential customers off from accepting or purchasing the fonts? We've also decided against small caps and other text-related character sets (tabular/lining figures, etc.) as we don't intend this typeface to ever be used to set text.\n\nCan anyone point us in the right direction of a standard character set for a display-only typeface (if one even exists)?\n\nIf the answer is that we should definitely proceed with a lowercase, are there any examples of wide, sans-serif lowercase glyphs that could be considered elegant?\n\n",

It just might turn up the character sets that different foundries use. Maybe.\n\n"

Basically, if you want to _sell_ the typeface, it's not really important what _you_ would or wouldn't use it for, but what other people can do with it.\n\nBut it's of course your choice. Caps-only typefaces aren't that uncommon.\n\n"

Leaving out letters (as opposed to mathematical symbols &c.) wouldn't be a good idea because people in non-English speaking countries may need display faces too :)\n\n"
