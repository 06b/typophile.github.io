As a teenager, he earned pocket money lettering mail boxes and trucks. He studied Design at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Carnegie%20Mellon%20University) (called Carnegie Institute of Technology at the time) where he earned a BFA in [Graphic Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Graphic%20Design). While at CMU, he studied with [calligrapher](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/calligraphy) [Arnold Bank](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Arnold%20Bank) who brought out a love of historic letterforms, learned to set [hot metal](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/hot%20metal) type in the Laboratory Press established there by [Jack Stauffacher](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jack%20Stauffacher). Chris also was influenced by guest professors [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf), Rudy DeHarek, Martin Krampen and Gui Bonnsieppe (of the HfG Ulm). His greatest influence was typography proffessor Ken Hiebert, a student of [Emil Ruder](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Emil%20Ruder).  \nAfter several decades of practicing graphic design, Chris renewed his affair with letter forms and began to design typefaces. In the past 2 years, he has designed type families, Leporello, Align, [Now Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/nowsans/), [Weimar Plakat 1923 Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/weimarplakat/), [Dez Squeeze](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/squeeze/), Chrishand, [Froggy](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/froggy/), [Boulder](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/boulder/), Backhand, Forehand, Dez HeadsUp, Dez SuperEgo [Dez Tovarich](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/typefaces/tovarich/), and Petroula and hopes to be releasing them soon for distribution.  \nChris abhors puns.\n\n[http://dezcom.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203/http:/dezcom.com/ \"http://dezcom.com/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809045203im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dezcom_logo200x50_6272.png)\n\n",
