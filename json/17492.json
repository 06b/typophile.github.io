While it was fun to set the word Avant Garde (with the ligatures of course), everything else isn’t that funny with this font ;)\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n [‹ Need period typeface suggestions](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009062124/http:/typophile.com/node/17347 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sans counterpart to Goudy Oldstyle? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009062124/http:/typophile.com/node/17427 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
