Hopefully anyone in the area was able to attend. Jim in his home studio, designs type, casts lead type, and runs a letterpress, plus much more. His talk was really great, and it was interesting to find out about his partnership with [P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20100113165358/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22) to release his types. Some of the technical stuff about the production of the type was a bit over my head, but he did a good job of giving a good overview and descriptions and photos of some of the tools he used. Anyways I thought it was cool, and very nice of him and Richard Keglar, that they gave out real pieces of lead type that were P22 ornaments that Mr. Rimmer cast in his home studio. They had both a mirror image for actual printing and a unreversed image for sourvenir purposes. I included a close up photo [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20100113165358/http:/www.negativespace.ca/misc/p22.jpg)\n\n",
