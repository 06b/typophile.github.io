I am using a three folding format.  \nAfter I added the pattern into the card, I feel my logo is too heavy or traditional.\n\nThank you,\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [card14-2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108172719/http:/typophile.com/files/card14-2.png) | 4.93 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I appreciate your feedback.\n\nT and K are in the logo. The both logo and pattern were derived from bamboo, which I have wanted to use for my logo. I love the pattern inside of the card (right side), but I feel it doesn't go with the logo because the logo has solid colors while the patterns are just lines. I am trying to edit the logo to have more organic shapes, but I still feel it is heavy.\n\n"
