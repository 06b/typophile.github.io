  "content": "Hi,\n\nCan anyone explain to me exactly what a font's point size constitutes? I've read that it is a measure of the fonts em, but in a practical sense, it seems to be more a measure of the font's height. I am using Illustrator for measurements - comparing a 14pt line with various 14pt fonts, and it seems to be match the font height (decender to ascender/stem) with a bit of leading included (Amount varying from font to font). This seems quite counter-intuitive as this surely means that when adding leading, you are adding it to an already-leaded font.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
