One that I haven’t figured out is this:\n\nSome of our postscript fonts like Charlotte Sans and Figural Book (both Letraset) come in with a cursor that is way overextended in length. I’ve even opened Figural up in FontLab, but see nothing wrong there. This issue can become problematic when setting paragraphs of text. Any ideas what can cause this?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103114908im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fig_Book_4511.png)\n\n",
