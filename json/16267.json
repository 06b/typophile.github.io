(actually, regula is probably too beautiful to be sick.)\n\nbut if the context is...i don’t know, say, contemporary germ warfare, then how about one of house industries’ distressed faces, like [housecopy](http://web.archive.org/web/20080504200043/http:/www.houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=201&subpage=lettersetter)?\n\n"
