  "content": "Hey guys,\n\nI was wondering if I could ask you typographical gurus a question. I'm production manager on my university's magazine, and we're interested in redesigning our magazine to be less The New Yorker and more Wired or another equivalently modern magazine. I was wondering if any of you know some really nice modern fonts we should investigate into purchasing for our magazine's new cover typeface. We were thinking either thin or bold lettering, possibly in all lowercase with some nice x-height. That being said, I think something like Myriad Pro won't strike readers as being all too ingenious. We want an awesome, not-really-overused-yet typeface.\n\nThanks for your time, guys!\n\n-- David\n\n",

      "content": "In many ways, the title influences the font...is the title more than found characters? I always think of the magazine Mademoiselle, which is a long title by anyone's standards and it was a condensed Futura in its later years. My own feeling about magazine logos is that they should not have too much character; they have typically been simple because of newsstands. A recent resign I did I went back to News Gothic because it was strong, readable and just seemed right. I would also recommend House Industries Chalet (Tokyo) [http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720120152/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet \"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/chalet\") as a font that has character and is not overused.\n\n"

Find a [designer](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720120152/http:/www.evanmade.com/) (shameless self promotion).\n\nWithout knowing much, I think I'd lean toward a very new, very fresh serif or slab serif face. I really like [Skolar](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720120152/http:/www.type-together.com/Skolar) and [Apex Serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720120152/http:/vllg.com/Thirstype/ApexSerif/mudTyper+Weights/).\n\nBest of luck!\n\n[evan](http://web.archive.org/web/20120720120152/http:/www.evanmade.com/)\n\n"
