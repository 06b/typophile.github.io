However, the use of modern technical equipment such as computers is not allowed.\n\nThe goal of the contest is to receive as many variations of the word “Encore” as possible.\n\nThe best works will be presented at an exhibition at the Designmai Festival in Berlin/Germany.  \nFor more informations and an example image provided by Eikes Grafischer Hort, check out [http://contest.encore-mag.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071010144118/http:/contest.encore-mag.com/ \"http://contest.encore-mag.com\")\n\n\\_\\_\\_  \nContact:  \n [contest@encore-mag.com](mailto:contest@encore-mag.com)  \n [http://www.encore-mag.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071010144118/http:/www.encore-mag.com/ \"http://www.encore-mag.com\")\n\n",
