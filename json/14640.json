The type is somewhere near okay (the lowercase e looks smallish, though), but the twig just doesn’t have the right feel. Too literal, in my opinion.\n\nI think the rather straight shape of the words collides with the loose treatment of the twig. The two should be a unity.\n\nThe twig refers to the organic, but I think some reference to jewelry might be better.\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\n——————————————————————————  \nMy work is a game. A very serious game [M.C. Escher]\n\n"

      "content": "A few points one loose the twig as Bart suggests. The G has the shape of an ear with an ear ring hanging from it already. Maybe slighly modifing that shape will make it clearer what you are making. Over all the letter and word spacing needs major work. Start with one word get the spacing working then use that word as your benchmark for the other two. Good start keep going.\n\n"
