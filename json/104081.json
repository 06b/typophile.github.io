  "content": "I downloaded the VSCOcam iphone app and discovered its beautiful typeface.  \nHonestly, i cant get it over it. Curious as to whether anyone would possibly know what typeface it is?  \nIf you need a better look, you can head over to their website [http://vsco.co](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227162730/http:/vsco.co/).\n\nI dont have a lot of knowledge on typefaces, so any help would be appreciated.  \nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [photo 1.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227162730/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%201.PNG) | 332.92 KB |\n| [photo 2.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227162730/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%202.PNG) | 897.82 KB |\n| [photo 3.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227162730/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%203.PNG) | 971.84 KB |\n| [photo 4.PNG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227162730/http:/typophile.com/files/photo%204.PNG) | 520.46 KB |\n\n",
