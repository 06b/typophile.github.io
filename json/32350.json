  "content": "A while back [Jim Rimmer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123084104/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jim%20Rimmer) asked if I would scan a few pages of his book, “Leaves from the Pie Tree”. It is a beautiful letterpress book is printed on fine paper and hand bound by Jim in limited edition. It is available from [P22](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123084104/http:/typophile.com/wiki/P22) and from Jim’s own foundry. The types are all Jims own hot metal cuts. I have posted a PDF of the pages I scanned so that you can see them at higher than screen resolution. There was a thread here on Typophile a while back which prompted this post.\n\nOne of the featured faces is used to set a story his father told him as a boy. The following is a note from Jim.\n\n“Nephi Mediaeval was my attempt to make a type heavily reflective of the semi roman of Sweynheim and Pannartz, without making an out and out revival of it. I studied the characters of the original pretty thoroughly and then put them away before starting my own drawings. I did refer back to the originals a couple of times and cheated a little, making alterations where I had drifted too far away from the look of the S&P type.\n\nI cut this type in one size only (18 point) since I believed at the time that this was close to the historic type. I named my version after my dad, John, Nephi Rimmer. It has had little use because of the restrictive nature of such an archaic design, but I was able to use it this year in my putting down in words, a story often told to me by my dad from his early memories of boyhood in Bolton, Lancashire.”\n\nJim Rimmer\n\n---\\_\\_\\_\\_---\n\nChrisL\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123084104im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Rimmerdetail_5391.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [RimmerPie72.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123084104/http:/typophile.com/files/RimmerPie72.pdf) | 550.15 KB |\n\n",
