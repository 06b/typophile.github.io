Try Celeste, which has just the right delicacy, character shape, and x-height to match Gill Sans pretty well. Also, Josh Darden's Corundum. This is actually one of the harder match-up questions I've seen here.\n\n"

It's a bit of an obvious pairing, but there are some interesting family members in both faces, such as Perpetua Titling, Gill Extra Bold and the Condensed Gills. And Gill Shadow. I had to make a beefed-up Perpetua for footnotes. In all, the typographic palette was quite large, although the Gill figure \"1\" is really nasty.\n\n"

Being somewhat of a regular here, I can't help but notice that certain themes and questions frequently appear, déjà vu all over again.~ Hardly a day goes by without someone who has a particular typeface in mind inquiring as to what other face might go well with it, make a good companion, be the sans to its serif or vice versa --in short, as it's usually put, what would \"compliment\" the face in question.\n\nMight I suggest that as the word \"compliment\" is rarely used at Typophile in its correct meaning, and that as the said word is invariably proffered instead of the correct \"complement\", that SmartyPants be instructed to substitute \"compliment\" by\" complement\" on these here web pages?\n\nAfter all, ol' Smarty has a mind to replace hash marks (primes) by \"proper\" quotes, even though he frequently cocks it up -- I refer of course to abbreviations where a hash mark is turned into a left quote, when an apostrophe would be correct.\n\nSo if, at the expense of blowing off the occasional abbreviation, \"smart\" quotes are deemed acceptable, surely by the same principle of digitally-enabled bowdlerization it would be desirable to improve the spelling to which one is exposed at Typophile, by the same means.\n\n"

But what if someone prefers their personal pronoun to be timid and friendly? And what if someone prefers their quote marks dumb?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnother choice of face would be Scala, on the principal that Scala Sans is somewhat of a humanist peer to Gill Sans.\n\n"

Take these lines from the Lord's Prayer in a few of these languages.\n\nCroatian: \"... kako na Nebu, tako i na Zemlji\"  \nSwedish: \"Fader Vår som är i Himmelen\"  \nWelsh: \"Dyro i ni heddiw ein bara beunyddiol\"\n\nI point this out because Microsoft Word always automatically capitalizes the 'i' when I try to type Swedish.
