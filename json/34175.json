Taking advantage of OpenType technology, Grant added many special characters and alternative glyphs, thus boosting the potential of the «Beans» font by virtually re-inventing its character set, and offering both the original set and many new options to the discerning user.  \nThe original Zembsch set is accessed with «caps lock» activated, whilst new characters & alternates are mapped to the lower case and to OpenType Stylistic Sets respectively\n\nEDIT: Oops, that is what Mr. Grant probably wanted to say in the post above, which I didn’t realize, while posting. Sorry for the double information.\n\n"
