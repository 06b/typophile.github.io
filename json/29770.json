  "content": "Hi there!!\n\nWhen I generate a Opentype TrueType flavored font on FLAB, it gets a TrueType icon file in Windows. (I'm not sure that also happens on MAC platform).  \nBut I've seen these kind of font files with the .TTF extension presenting an Opentype font icon. I know DaltonMaag uses this.\n\nHow can this be done?\n\nI'm selling fonts with this format (for better screen hinting), but the .TTF extension and font file icon missleads some users...thinking they've bought a simple TrueType font.\n\nmany regards from sunny Brazil ;)\n\nFabio\n\n",

If a font was modified, the digital signature becomes invalid (or is not included at all). Some foundries, e.g. Linotype, use DSIG to check if a font that a customer is complaining about is an unmodified Linotype original or if it was \"touched\" by someone and therefore \"the warranty is void\". You could view DSIGs as some sort of \"warranty seal\".\n\nA.\n\n"

The Authenticode code signing certificates are X.509 IETF certificates issued for a particular purpose and packaged in a particular, Microsoft-specific way. However, there are opensource tools that can convert a code signing X.509 certificate into an Authenticode code signing certificate, and the format of the Microsoft packaging of digital certificate is widely published.\n\nX.509 digital certificates are an IETF international standard, and are used widely on the WWW, for example in SSL (https) encryption. They all cost money, even those that you use on an opensource Apache server. This has to do with the fact that the certification authorities that issue the certificates are companies that have costs of operation and (since they are companies) their purpose is to make money.\n\nThis, per se, has nothing to do with Microsoft, but I guess where you live ranting against \"M$\" is just an easy way to escape the complex reality.\n\nTip for the future: do some background reading before publicly announcing your conclusions.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"
