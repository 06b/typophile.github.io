  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWondering if anyone else is having the same problems searching the Typohile forums? Every search term I enter comes back with a \"Page Not Found\" error. Even the word \"font\" produces this.\n\nI'd love a quick solution to this one, if it exists, because I rely on these forums for info when I encounter technical probs, as I'm sure many others do.\n\nCheers, Wayne  \nAustralian Type Foundry\n\n",
