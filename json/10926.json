      "content": "I'm taking this class now, and there are so many good reasons   \nto sign up, I can't begin. Whether you're interested in theory   \nor practice, Gerald is your man - he manages to both instill a   \nrespect for letterpress (sans the cloying nostalgia) as well as   \ngive all the insight needed in those 14 wonderful weeks, with   \nno preaching whatsoever. A surprising proportion of the class   \nis devoted to \"self-study\" - especially suitable to those who   \nalready have some typographic attitudes in place.   \n  \nAnd if you're not in Southern California, consider moving.   \nAs we say: the weather is here, wish you were beautiful. ;-)   \n  \nhhp\n\n"
