  "content": "Hi all,\n\nHas anybody seen Akzidenz Grotesk in Greek Language? Were they ever existed, even before digital type?  \nAs far as I've searched (very briefly I must say) the new opentype versions of the font do not include Greek letters apart from some symbols. I'd like to know if anything like that is in plan. I think I crossed an extended version once, years ago, but I did't know where they came from. They may exist with a different name...\n\nthanks\n\n",
