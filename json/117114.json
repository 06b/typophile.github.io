Thats that I thought it was too, but if you look at the numerals, it's a dead giveaway that it is neither.\n\nThanks all.\n\n:)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317180159im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Fireworks_5254.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Channel Slanted 1 \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317180159/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Fireworks.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317180159/http:/typophile.com/files/Fireworks.jpg) | 63.87 KB |\n\n",
