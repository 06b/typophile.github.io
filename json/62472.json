Similarly, the advice is that I should select my layout before writing. However, the geometric picture does not become visible until after I have written!\n\nIn which case, to achieve any given page composition, the relative darkness and grid be designed first, then the text written, and then the font(s) selected to achieve the pre-determined darkness.\n\nWouldn't that throw legibility out the window? Could you please tell me, do you follow a methodology or work flow that mitigates my muddled contradictions?\n\n",

He/she will do all the rest of the stuff. If you really want to do something great, add a good editor in between. This idea that one person should be able to do everything is one of the key reasons why the world is rapidly sinking into illiteracy. (Well, I needed \\_some\\_ hyperbole in the posting.)\n\n"
