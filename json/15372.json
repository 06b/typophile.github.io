      "content": " **Keeping track of FF Meta**\n\nOriginally, back in 1991 when the very first batch of FontFonts was released, there was **FF Meta 1** (Normal, Bold, Small Caps). Hanging figures and additional ff-ligatures were already present in the Normal and Bold weights, with lining figures in the Small Caps.\n\nThe first expansion came in 1992 with **FF Meta 2** {Italic, Italic Small Caps, Bold Small Caps}.\n\n**FF MetaPlus** , released in 1993, was the big leap forward. Apart from tripling the total number of fonts to 18, it included a fine-tuning of some characters (most notably the correction of the crossbar on the lc 't'). The family at that point featured Normal, Book, Medium, Bold and Black weights, all in Roman, Italic, Small Caps and Italic Small Caps (except for the Black weight which didn't include Small Caps). Still hanging figures in the 'normal' weights and lining figures in the Small Caps.\n\nEventually, in 1998 it was back to **FF Meta** , which saw a reorganisation of the family into subfamilies: FF MetaNormal, FF MetaBook, FF MetaMedium, FF MetaBold and FF MetaBlack, all in Roman, Italic, Small Caps and Italic Small Caps, which all got coupled with their respective Expert and Lining Figures weights: yep, 60 fonts indeed. Biggest change this time was the addition of the Black Small Caps, and moving the extra ligatures (ff, ffi, ffl which were previously in the regular fonts) to the new Expert fonts. And of course the Lining figures weights which means you don't have to switch weights anymore to get the desired type of numerals.\n\nSince then, the family was expanded to include foreign language sets, additional weights, and Condensed and Headline variations.\n\nSo, to conclude: don't mix the original six weight FF Meta with FF MetaPlus nor the new FF Meta family (different spacing, some redesigned characters), and when substituting FF Meta for FF MetaPlus be careful with disappearing ff-ligatures and different types of numerals.\n\n_This is a reprise of a 2 year old post which appears to have disappeared in digital limbo. Thought it might clear up any misunderstandings about FF Meta and FF MetaPlus._\n\n"
