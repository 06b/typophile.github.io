The pair that I linked to are currently the subjects of an [argument](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/www.brugesgroup.com/mediacentre/releases.live?article=9075) between the two groups , of course it doesn't help that the two are linked to the opposite sides of the UK political spectrum.  \nDoes Coca-Cola make their product from polar bears? Perhaps they farm them in remote locations, do they employ herders and what are their dogs like? They could market an organic version. The wages for milking polar bears would have to be pretty good.  \nTim\n\n"

Using the monogram for TDC makes sense because it speaks to a typographic tradition. The \"Desert Troon\" however makes much less connection and does not seem to be a good fit. I have no idea if the similarity is intentional, I only say that to me it suits TDC far, far better and that \"DTC\" would be far better served using something different.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

You may want to take a look at some of the discussion and evidence at some of these links:\n\nThe Origins of Brands Blog - written in praise of LogoWorks.  \nThe comments offer a great deal of info:  \n [http://tinyurl.com/bs8gb](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/bs8gb \"http://tinyurl.com/bs8gb\")\n\nBadDesignKills  \n [http://www.baddesignkills.com/logoworks/index.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/www.baddesignkills.com/logoworks/index.htm \"http://www.baddesignkills.com/logoworks/index.htm\")\n\nThePreparedMind  \n [http://tinyurl.com/bbv9c](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/bbv9c \"http://tinyurl.com/bbv9c\")\n\nMorea's Photos  \n [http://tinyurl.com/dmhrr](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/dmhrr \"http://tinyurl.com/dmhrr\")\n\nHOW Design Forum Discussion  \n [http://tinyurl.com/bej4q](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/bej4q \"http://tinyurl.com/bej4q\")\n\nA HOW Forum \"discussion\" with a LW designer  \n [http://tinyurl.com/a9rry](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/a9rry \"http://tinyurl.com/a9rry\")\n\nI'm sure this will get more interesting as the week continues. Personally, I feel such \"logo mills\" do a huge disservice to the graphic design industry. The outright stealing of the work of other designers is another issue and its blatancy is incredible to me - and should outrage all designers and the clients being taken for what initially may be an inexpensive ride to get a new logo. How many stolen designs have been repackaged and sold to unexpecting clients by LogoWorks?\n\n- J.\n\nJeff Fisher :: Engineer of Creative Identity  \n [Jeff Fisher LogoMotives](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/5y8bm)\n\nAuthor: [Savvy Designer's Guide to Success](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623033237/http:/tinyurl.com/5o7ud) from HOW Design Books\n\n"
