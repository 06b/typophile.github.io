  "content": "A couple of years back, while cleaning the letterpress workshop at the KABK in The Hague, we had an amazing find. A package that hasn’t been opened for some time. We opened it and found eighteen printing plates in mint condition. The printing plates, we soon found out, were made by Gerrit Noordzij and date back to the late 1960’s. They contain a brief lesson about writing with the broad nib and, once familiar with this basis, writing and drawing some different techniques.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185119im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GewoneLetters_05_4997.jpg)\n\nSince it seemed the plates are never published before, we decided to do so and made a book containing prints from the plates. Next to the plates we asked former students Albert-Jan Pool, Frank E. Blokland, Aad van Dommelen, Huug Schipper and Petr van Blokland if they still had old work and sketches with comments by Gerrit Noordzij. The result is a collection of sketches and material, together with five writings about the plates, Gerrit Noordzij and his contribution to the field of type and typography.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185119im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GewoneLetters_02_4749.jpg)\n\nFor more information noordzij.geenbitter.nl\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414185119im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GewoneLetters_07_5618.jpg)\n\n",
