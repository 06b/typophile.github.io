  "content": "Hey,\n\nI need some help. Im working on a wedding monogram for a couple and I don't really feel the current design. They really like it, but in my infinite difficultness it doesn't work for me, so I wont give it to them yet. I have made about 30 other compositions but they like this the best.\n\nI am requesting two things; Some critique and maybe a suggestion of a nice classy Hebrew serif font that looks similar so I can try to hash this out in Illustrator.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [elanrachel.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120218013814/http:/typophile.com/files/elanrachel.jpg) | 40.58 KB |\n\n",
