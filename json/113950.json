One of them looks like joined-together cursive bubble letters (Justice),and the other one, (Elizabeth) looks like some type of cursive lettering. Any help will be greatly appreciated!! Even if the fonts are custom one-of-a-kind lettering, can you name fonts that are similar to these two in which they look the most like? Thanks in advanced!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [anonymous\\_22400.JPEG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307122855/http:/typophile.com/files/anonymous_22400.JPEG) | 41.21 KB |\n\n",
