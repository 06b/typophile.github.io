  "content": "When I generate this typeface as an OpenType PS there are no problems, and it works properly.\n\nThe thing that seems peculiar to me is when I scroll across the type to select in InDesign or Illustrator (or whatever), it goes from baseline to baseline from one line to the next.\n\nAs it’s a script the characters are all different sizes, so the Ascender, Descender, Cap height and x height values are all pretty arbitrary, but the ascender and descender values do add up to 1000. The fonts’ UPM size is 1000.\n\nDoes anybody have any idea why the type is selected like this?\n\nHave I entered some incorrect values? please see the pics.\n\nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100105212435im_/http:/typophile.com/files/scroll_4717.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100105212435im_/http:/typophile.com/files/met1_4011.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100105212435im_/http:/typophile.com/files/met2_4820.jpg)\n\n",

Paul, I know you’re a Script Meister yourself - love Allyson and Zaner Pro.\n\nI altered the metrics according to Paul’s equation, minus the Typo Line gap and line gap, (is it necessary to have a value here?).\n\nCould the problem have something to do with ’Splats’ extending above and below the bounding box?
