There maybe more than one font in use any help on any of the fonts would be great as I am trying to recreate the interface as a personal project.\n\nI am specifically looking for the number font that says \"13:46:12\". No font I looked at has the elongated 6 or the : in the right place. Closests I found was Alternate Gothic No 2 ... but its not that. I feel like all of the numbers are in this font.\n\nThank you for any help!\n\n",

Its not quite Scout Condensed Regular.\n\nI also feel the rest of the text is written in combination of regular and condensed Scout.\n\nThank you Don for your help!\n\n"
