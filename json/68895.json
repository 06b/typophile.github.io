  "content": "This is a sample from the Solari split-flap \"Train Information\" board at Amtrak's PHL 30th St. Station. I suspect the typeface on the flaps is a custom job (presented as monospaced on single-character flaps, but kerned on longer place-name flaps), but I'm looking for something with a similar feel. So far the best I've got is Whitney Condensed Book or Medium; which will work fine, but I still wanted to see if there were any other opinions.\n\nThanks!  \nMB\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [wtf\\_DSC\\_0018\\_590px.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015100733/http:/typophile.com/files/wtf_DSC_0018_590px_0.jpg) | 10.18 KB |\n\n",

Myriad is even further in that direction. I'd really like to replicate the slightly cold industrial feel. Perhaps I'll have to settle on one of these and modify it slightly.\n\n"
