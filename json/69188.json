  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm a graphic design student researching justified text, and wondered if anybody knew of some examples of brilliant (or terrible!) justified text? Previous forums have discussed whether it's a good idea or not, but I'm really looking for real examples of successful justification (possibly including pre-computers and pre-type, as one forum entry mentioned manuscripts written by monks). If anybody could recommend some books too, that'd be great.\n\nCheers!\n\n",

Even if you read the section headings and nothing else, it will give you the vocabulary to describe what such software is capable of.\n\nThe following figure illustrates what can be accomplished with tracking alone (for good or ill).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014093031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/microtype_package_4254.png)\n\n"

And then there are the books set entirely without word spacing. I tend to think these were do to semi-literate monks who merely copied letter after letter, without understanding the concept of words.\n\n"
