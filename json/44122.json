For instance, the son reads Nietzsche but when he finally expresses his anger at the world (the 2 times actually) his vocabulary is reduced to a bunch of 4 letter words. I’d have assumed he’d be able to be more articulate. The little girl was adorable though and the point made by the entire movie was nice.\n\n"

The music from the film is as naive as the font you’re looking for.\n\nTry one of the many handwritten fonts on DaFont: [http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=603](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415214001/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=603)\n\n"
