  "content": "I'm looking for authentic typefaces for the 19th century stacked poster look. I'm thinking condensed slabserifs etc. I've attached an image of the look the client is going for, but I don't think it's a particularly good example. I'd also be keen to hear of any modern takes on the style. If anyone has any suggestions it'd be much appreciated.  \nthanks,  \nHD\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105105830im_/http:/typophile.com/files/amy_martin_2_6545.jpg)\n\n",
