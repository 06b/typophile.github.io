Not to be confused with the rather new FontExplorer X (FEX)! The former can  \n<cite>[f]ind fonts fitting each historical era</cite> and <cite>[s]elect a mix of emotions and impressions and find the fonts that suit them all</cite>.\n\nYet, I don’t think this app is suited for _managing_ fonts. For that, the latter is the right thing – however the Windows version of that is currently not available due to revision.\n\nThere’s a [FAQ on the Best Font Management](http://web.archive.org/web/20071220030548/http:/typophile.com/node/15290).\n\nThough there are tags like ‘designer’ or ‘description’ in FEX, you have to do the sorting yourself, I’m afraid.\n\n"
