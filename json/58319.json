I had to read a lot of text before I found your menu, and when I tried to find your work I spent another minute figuring out the gallery navigation and the logic behind the sorting. I clicked the full screen button a couple of times as well trying to find my way. Additionally the mute button didn't react at first. By then, 95% of your readers would have left.  \nAnd that's only the navigation.\n\n"
