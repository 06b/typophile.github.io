  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m looking for a good sans to be used with Arnhem for setting a wide variety of print materials, reports, brochures, price lists, etc. Farnham may make an occasional appearance as a display/titling face. Something contemporary with a nice dose of tradition like Arnhem. Univers is in the running, though something with a little more personality would be nice. I’ve looked at Fresco Sans but not sure how that would work with Arnhem and it didn’t feel quite right. It would be great if the uppercase G matched the tail-less Arnhem G and the K matched how the limbs meet the vertical at a point. And if the outer profile of the M was vertical instead of inclined ala Myriad. The materials will be related to international development, sustainability, and the like. Connotation would be humanist over corporate, classic printed Grotesks over computeresque.\n\nThanks very much.\n\n [‹ Alternatives to The Mix / The Serif?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906162228/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34541 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Body Copy : Humanist Slab Serif ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906162228/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34386 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "There certainly are a lot of great faces for the task. Parry Grotesque is nice, I just can’t abide those curly drooping stroke endings for this project. Benton Sans is fantastic and is definitely in the running. Galaxie Polaris is a nice face but just doesn’t grab me for this project. TheSans is great in some aspects, like how the lowercase b is hoisting up its beer belly for the photoshoot. I just don’t like those inclined “M”s for some reason. I’ve always loved FF Bau, and it’s certainly a possibility, though it lacks the spring of something like Benton Sans, but makes up for it in character, like the eccentric Uncle of sanserifs, especially the bolder weights. News Gothic is too condensed in its natural state for my taste.\n\nAnything out there like an FF Bau with a little more contemporary snap in its step, or a Benton Sans that listened to a touch more Tom Waits?\n\nThanks very much for your help.\n\n"
