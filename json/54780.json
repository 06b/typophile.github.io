      "content": "I wouldn't recommand changing the font metrics because it would make your tex code less portable. You can define a simple command like:\n\n\\def\\fz{\\symbol{383}\\kern-0.14emz}\n\nI suggest using \\f instead because command names are restricted to basic ASCII. Using \\symbol{383} also makes the command usable in different encodings or language.\n\nHope this help\n\n"
