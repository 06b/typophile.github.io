The photogrpher wants to create a mixture of elegance and contemporary look at the same time, and this is one of my first ideas (even though the selected typefaces are not that contemporary - I am still working on it).\n\nSo, I was hoping for some comments on the spacing and the typefaces combinations (and perhaps other, more contemporary suggestions)? Which of the two versions would you go for?\n\nThanks in advanced\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115139im_/http:/typophile.com/files/chiaroscuro_3784.png)\n\n [‹ vintage style (number) typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115139/http:/typophile.com/node/41077 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typeface suggestions for stationary line ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119115139/http:/typophile.com/node/41063 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Historically, artistically and aesthetically the term is inextricably wed to the Italian Renaissance.

      "content": "I don’t think it is really Italian Renaissance. Early painters who experimented with chiaroscuro were mostly Mannerists and Caravaggio — who has widely considered as the one who mastered chiaroscuro into perfection — was an early Baroque painter.\n\nWhile historically not quite perfect, the second logo (Bodoni and Nobel) in my opinion is a great example of how I would understand chiaroscuro in typographic terms — better than the first, because of the interesting two-way contrast: the weight increases while stroke modulation and design complexity decreases. That is more sophisticated that the first approach which really just says “little” vs “much” of everything.\n\nA.\n\n"

Just a suggestion. Personally I love that sort of thematic integration.  \nAlso, there is a danger with having too great of a contrast in weight here in that it begins to look like two separate words.\n\n"
