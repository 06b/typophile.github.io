      "content": "The problem occurs when points from two different paths are directly on top of each other and one of the paths is a counter (like the inside of an \"o\").   \n   \nThe method shown in the old Atomic Media tutorial (no longer available) was to use Fontographer's Change Weight command to make the characters slightly bolder, then use the Remove Overlap command. This causes the outside of the glyph to get larger and the inside smaller, neatly moving the offending points away from each other.   \n   \nThere are other ways to do it, but the main thing is to avoid overlapping points.   \n   \nFWIW, the method in the tutorial you linked to works too, but the \"cut\" would be visible in some uses (if you used it large, for example).\n\n"

This means that all the various techniques that have been developed to get Flash to behave with pseudo-bitmap fonts are no longer needed (except if you use earlier versions of Flash). This will greatly simplify the creation of such fonts.\n\n"
