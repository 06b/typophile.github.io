Perhaps [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173232/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1153.html)? (If it is small.) Or perhaps [Cronos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173232/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1734.html)? I really wish [Penumbra](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173232/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1115.html) had a lowercase because I'd suggest that as well. I'd imagine what ever you are doing, since you used the world \"elegant,\" it needs to be fairly thin as to at least match closely the thinnest part of the weight of Waters that you are using. I'd enjoy seeing what it is you are doing.\n\n"

Unfortunately I came on after the title design meeting. I was told that the title and the subtitle should be nearly the same in importance. This is tricky because the title doesn't tell you what the book is about, thus the sub needs to be more visible. This is like the 12th version of this. AND my immediate boss just told me that the one on the right (which I like only a little less than the one on the left,) is too extreme of a switch.\n\nThe image is cropped photo of a spotlight on curtains, playing on the 'stage-left' aspect of not being famous, similar as to showing a red carpet with no one on it.\n\nalso: they won't let me use any kind of cliché writing instruments. Pencils, pens, typewriters &c.\n\nThen there is this...  \n [http://static.flickr.com/122/303283067\\_469933c73c\\_o.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173232/http:/static.flickr.com/122/303283067_469933c73c_o.png \"http://static.flickr.com/122/303283067\\_469933c73c\\_o.png\")  \nOut of frustration.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414173232im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fms_5146.png)\n\n"

The tight, stacked caps give me spiritual conotations (alt E adds to it).\n\nAlso, waters titling makes me feel like I do have to be famous since it's so expressive. Isn't the point that even anonymous people have a story to tell? Maybe you could hint at this with the type. A nameless, faceless, condensed, grotesque to which you add unexpected flair perhaps? (sounds like I got that from the Typophile Small Chat Generator :-)\n\nI'm wondering if the text setting can also reflect your stage left concept. Maybe it is coming out of the shadows. Or maybe it is left justified and wraps around the spine (off page left).\n\nTo sum it up either:  \nFancy type hidden in the shadows  \nor  \nPlain type in the spotlight with unexpected flair.  \nor  \nFamous in the spotlight and the rest in shadow (would need to get away from stage left concept.\n\nObviously 6 ideas on one cover will not work ;-)  \nI could be thinking too hard.  \nR\n\n"
