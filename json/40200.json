  "content": "I am helping my boyfriend translate his CV into UK format, and was hoping for some advice as to font choice.\n\nHe’s a computer engineer/programmer/game developer from Sweden. The jobs to which he’ll be applying are at top companies in the UK for senior programming or development positions in the games industry. In other words, everything needs to look shiny.\n\nI’m not a designer myself (but happen to be an old acquaintance of the esteemed Mr Coles; hello Stephen!) but work as a project manager for an Internet marketing consultancy.. so I’m comfortable with the layout aspects. I just want to choose a font that’s “right” for this sort of position and don’t have enough expertise myself to figure that out.\n\nAny recommendations?\n\nI should add that he’ll submit it as a PDF, with an OpenOffice accompaniment, so an alternate for the .odt part would be nice as well. Thanks!\n\n/e^10\n\n [‹ T-TOOLS...WHAT ARE THOSE? :-?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40201 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Display font for nonprofit newsletter ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40223 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Here are a few of my favorites:\n\n[Cachet](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/cachet/) - designed by a Brit and fairly popular among bright people over there  \n [Neo Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/neo_sans/) - ditto, but more techno  \n [FF Daxline](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_daxline_ot/) - an ultra clean update to an old FontFont favorite  \n [Klavika](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/process/klavika_ot/) - Facebook’s identity typeface, can’t go wrong\n\nDon’t know what’s available in OpenOffice, but if someone can link me to a list, I’ll give you an alt.\n\n"

How’s SF treating you?\n\nThanks much for the recommendations; I quite like both Neo Sans and Klavika (I think it’s the ’g’s!). What size/weight would you recommend for best clarity?\n\nAs to font compatibility for OpenOffice, I think the best thing would be to link you to a list of [Linux-Windows agreeable fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092140/http:/mondaybynoon.com/2007/04/02/linux-font-equivalents-to-popular-web-typefaces/).\n\n"
