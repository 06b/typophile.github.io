  "content": "Hello Allâ€“  \nHaving a complete mental block today about a typeface I have previously used it on an invite and own it. It's a Tri Line face which isn't rounded so unlike Gala or Pump. Quite plain in a way with a bit of a 30s feel to it, condensed. I have seen it used before where a designer had knocked some of the lines out to create different versions of the face. Any help appreciated, driving me up the wall.\n\n",
