      "content": "The sample does seem to match Bordeaux from Letraset, but I believe that Letraset was making type products before digital fonts that we know today were used. The other consideration is that film types, which Letraset may have created or digitized were the dominant type technology from the 50's (I think) to the late 80's when digital PostScript & TrueType fonts began to be widely available. Looking through a 1960 Photo-Lettering book I can see many super condensed Bodoni's that are virtually identical to \"Bordeaux\". For example, a designer by the name of Tommy Thompson had a range of Bordeaux-like styles like \"Colonial Triple Condensed\", which seems very similar.   \n   \nI think the exact identity probably ought not to be as important as the fact that Bordeaux is a font you know that looks virtually identical to the sample, so isn't that enough?\n\n"
