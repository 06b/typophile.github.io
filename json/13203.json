      "content": "6. I’m stingy, and I like to hold onto a version that works. It seems to me that there comes a point when a company decides that their industry isn’t selling enough how-to books and training classes, so they rearrange the interface of each new upgrade to be as complex, nonsensical, and counterintuitive as possible.\n\nFor raster work, I use and love Paint Shop Pro 5. I tried out 7 once, and found that I would be paying to give up the ability to draw a straight line on a flat layer. The line tool now makes a new layer containing a vector line each time you use it. In fact, everything you do becomes a separate layer until memory runs out. So convenient! I wiped it and treasure my 5 disc like gold.\n\nI once imported a book I laid out in CorelDraw 6 into CorelDraw 8 on someone else’s computer to prepare it for print. Turns out that they defined an RGB equivalent for 100% black that’s like #050108 or something, to reflect that the fact that 100% of all four CMYK is darker. WYSIWYG, you know. Except “what you get” is a PDF where all the black has turned into a 95% screen. Took me a while to figure out what was wrong and what I had to do. I shudder to think what even later versions were like.\n\nIf software companies want any more of my money, they’ve got to stop breaking their product.\n\n"

      "content": "v6 for the Mac or PC? v6 for the PC was an utter disaster — it had a tendency to crash JUST as you were trying to save a file, which is pretty inconvenient unless you like doing the same work over and over again. However, I do agree that, as a rule, Corel has managed to break more things than it has fixed along the way. WordPerfect 8 is the last reliable version of that software that they produced, and CorelDraw 9 is much better in MANY ways than the subsequent three versions.\n\n"
