Am i doing something wrong in my stylesheets? if anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCheers\n\n [‹ \"There Will Be Blood\"-- title typeface treatment](http://web.archive.org/web/20080414234140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42664 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [NIN Ghosts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080414234140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42762 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
