A term used to describe type that has been horizontally or vertically stretched or condensed using graphic design software. Glyph scaling in this manner is almost always inadvisable and is often a sure sign of amateur typography. Space is best saved by reducing the type size or using a condensed (or extended) version of the font professionally drawn by a type designer.\n\n“Squooshed™” is a trademark of [Miss Tiff Industries, Inc.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/6471)\n\nSee also [Faux Formatting](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053616/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Faux%20Formatting).\n\n**External Links**  \n [A Limit to Font Scaling](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101053616/http:/www.artlebedev.com/mandership/134/)  \n\"As a way to train the eye, we suggest that designers (and customers) take their own photo and distort it along with the font. When the distortions become visible on the face, it’s time you stop disfiguring the font.\"\n\n",
