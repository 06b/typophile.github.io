The Oblique versions I made a skew ( -12º) and I tryed to give the better apperence of the Italic fellings on this oblique version. Like for the exemple the oblique l/c (a), don't have the typical apperence of the oblique normaly used but I desided to use something more expressive to give a new felling for the family and for the visual combination. Thank's for the comments to l/c (g) in real fact the letter must be thinking again.   \nSteve if you don't mind I would like understand better the points that you refered on last message about the plain version that you sayed that are very different of the oblique set. One more time thank's Steve and Stephen.   \nregads for all / Ricardo\n\n"

In fact personaly I didn't wanted to designed the letters with the apperence of the normaly oblique l/c letter (a)=( Plain with skew inclination to simulate italic) fell's me a rigid visual felling. I think that this set is oblique because are not a typical italic (more scrip). I tryed to change the apperence with the other alternative l/c (a) which is more similiar of the italic, like the other letter l/c (e) that I try ed to incorporated a (scrip) apperence in that caracther and the others of course.   \n   \nBut I would like to have more feedbacks about this question to have a clear ideia of the frontier that I'm trying to tread.   \n   \nPS: Thanks David for your critics-( Venceremos!\\>;)   \nRegards for all / Ricardo\n\n"
