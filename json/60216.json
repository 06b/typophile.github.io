Participants are gentle flute-playing, drum-circling, banjo-strumming, dope-toking hippie artists and performers of all generations.\n\nThe perfect place for a True Believer warning of eternal damnation! Look how dynamic the typographic design and color on these. One is professionally printed, the other hand-stenciled.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090728174509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/repent-signs-10i_3790.JPG)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090728174509im_/http:/typophile.com/files/warning-sign-8i_6295.JPG)\n\nThe sign he’s carrying isn’t enough, he also wears a sandwich board. This guy was dogged by the guitar-playing folkie behind him.\n\nI love how “rebellious wives and kids” are destined for hellfire along with murderers, thieves and sodomites. Enjoy this example of true folk art!\n\n",
