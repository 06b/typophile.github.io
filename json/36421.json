This is something that happens a lot when people write things out by hand, sometimes drastic, sometimes subtle.\n\nNow, a lot of typefaces are coming out that \"mimic\" handwriting/lettering. Wouldn't it be cool if they included contextual alternates that compressed the last few words of a sentence if found near the end of a line?\n\nI know that might totally screw with people's H&J settings, but is something like that possible?\n\n",

      "content": "Although you can't detect the end of a line (yet) in OpenType, you can set something to happen based on there being no further context. Make a class of all glyphs. Do something based on there being no further glyphs, and use a backtracking context. Not too hard, and pretty similar to other contextual font stuff I've demonstrated and shared FDK/FontLab code for. I'm rather busy right now, but if anyone wants to implement it I'd be happy to write the code for it whenever they are at the point where they need it.\n\nThe limitation would be that depending on the application, other things besides the line ending may break the context. For example, a font change will certainly break the context. Being in a different cell of a table would probably break the context. For \\*some\\* implementations, even word boundaries may break context, to improve performance.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Thomas, this assumes that all applications behave like InDesign, i.e. that any line break would 'end' a sequence. If I remember correctly, this is not the case with Mellel where the sequence would continue despite of a line break (the automatic one, not the 'return'). What would be WPF's behavior here?  \nIt looks like there's no binding standards for layout applications' here, so it is not warranted that contextual features behave as intended.\n\nSquashing glyphs toward the end of a line somehow indicates bad planning by the writer, so it would make script typefaces even more 'human'.  \nAnother approach would use abbreviations as found in blackletter, combining 'bo' 'be' etc, these could be distributed evenly throughout a line; I remember that in a hz-Program brochure there was a sketch by Hermann Zapf for applying this to URW Antiqua.  \nYet another approach would include slightly narrower and wider forms of glyphs that allow it (also found in the hz-Program brochure) and one Stylistic Set feature would replace by narrower, another by wider glyphs, the designer would apply the one which would be needed. Or better, there could be two special features, one maps glyphs to condensed and one to wide alternates; then the layout application could decide a line is too long or too short, and needs condensation or stretching, and apply as many substitutions as are required to get the desired lenght. Would be a nice addition to the multi-line composer. And here, the feature merely provides the material, but the decision whether/what to substitute is on the application.  \nBut this is not the issue of the thread which was handwriting. :)\n\nKarsten\n\n"

      "content": "I'd imagine getting the effect that Dan was originally thinking of would be extremely difficult. The problem being that when you substitute narrower characters, you use less space (I know, \"duh!\") So even if you could get around the complication Thomas mentions, so that this \"squeeze\" effect only happens at the end of a prescribed line length - once the effect is applied, the length of that line would get shorter, leaving extra space before the end of the prescribed line length. This would look like someone started trying to squeeze letters in when they still had additional space left.\n\nWhat you'd really need to do is detect widows. Once you find a case where a line wraps, with only a few characters on the following line, you'd then want to replace the last X number of characters with narrower versions, so that the paragraph would end on the previous line, and not leave a widow.\n\nHmm, it gets worse the more I think about it!\n\nJason C\n\n"

If somebody's typesetting a lengthy textbook, they bloody well better not get too \"expressive\" about the selection and usage of the text typeface. Or even a novel. IMO, typography is still usually about serving the text. Sometimes that can be done while being \"expressive,\" but sometimes it can't.\n\nThis isn't intended as a personal attack or anything - indeed, from the way you worded your post, I'm not clear on whether this is a view you espouse yourself, or just what you think is being taught in schools today.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Good typography is about being expressive now._\n\nDesign schools teach the use of type in the context of graphic design. I'm not even sure that typography is the correct term for this, unless one uses the term in the broadest possible since of making stuff with type. The use of type in graphic design is a specialised use, somewhat alienated -- in intent, if not always in practice -- from what I consider typography, i.e. text manufacture with prefabricated letters. Typography proceeds from text. Graphic design proceeds from different impeti, e.g. branding.\n\n"
