  "content": "I am happy to finally announce the release of \" **Lestatic**\", my largest typeface project to date, and one with a slightly more serious take than usual from !Exclamachine. It is available exclusively through [myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415055336/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Lestatic/fonts/). The collection of 9 families and 27 styles includes a free mashup font to give a taste of the grungier sides of Lestatic. Also, for a limited time, Lestatic Lashed, a more stroked variant, is 75% off!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415055336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lestatic-preview-A_5234.png)\n \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415055336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lestatic-preview-C_5981.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415055336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cover-lestatic-brace_4250.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415055336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cCSS_3601.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415055336im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lashed-sale_4504.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks, Nick. I'm very happy with how the entire group came out! I am most interested to see how Sliced gets used. It reminds me of a super-grainy woodcut style, and I hope offers an effect like no other face out there.\n\nI actually used hand edits, then some filters, then hand editing all over again on Slashed and Sliced and even on Carved. Went a little over the time I had planned, but hey, that's nothing new in my projects. :)\n\n"
