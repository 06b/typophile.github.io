  "content": "I found this font in a german cookbook from the 50ies (DR.OETKER BACKEN MACHT FREUDE); Mike Yanega thinks it might be a hybrid typeface (Gill sans Infant with l, t, u and M out of Futura/Twentieth Century) and suggested to post it here.\n\nHas anyone another idea? Is it common to mix typefaces? Sorry, I am not a professional so please bare with my naive questioning.\n\nI would like to use the font for a publication, I find it very elegant...\n\nThanks a lot for helping me!!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208142142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/oetker_0020_3428.JPG)\n\n [‹ Serif with swashed capitals](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208142142/http:/typophile.com/node/39881 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [koenig books - custom ? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071208142142/http:/typophile.com/node/39858 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Is this a modified version of Gill Sans Schoolbook (Infant), or is it truly a hybrid typeface, mixing Gill with a Futura-like type?\n\nI suggested that Ralf post this here, becuase I was hoping someone else might know whether type mixing was a common practice to create a ’new’ type look. I know I am one of the older folks on this forum, but my background in type is based in my books, and not on firsthand experience in the field of typography. I was an engineer, not a typographer.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "i seem to remember reading that Monotype tried several different attempts to Futur-ize Gill and this may be one of those permutations. If this is the case, I doubt that there has been any digital version made of this particular model.  \nYou could get pretty close with P22 Underground Pro Light + several of the stylistic sets activated, but even that would not give you an exact match (there’s no splayed M, no single-story a with tail, no stem-less u—i had to stop with customizing options somewhere).\n\n"
