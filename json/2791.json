      "content": "There are two very good essays, one about Arabic and one about Hebrew, in [_Language Culture Type_](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015164253/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1932026010/qid=1074703376/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/103-4402685-6125406?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).   \n   \nOne of the best books I have on Arabic calligraphy is [_The art of the pen_](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015164253/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0197276040/qid=1074703432/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i11_xgl14/103-4402685-6125406?v=glance&s=books&n=507846), which not only shows a lot of wonderful stuff but also explains what you are looking at. The section at the back showing examples of the major calligraphic styles may be particularly useful for you.\n\n"

I have a copy of Abdelkebir Khatibi and Mohammed Sijelmassi's _The Splendor of Islamic Calligraphy_, published by Thames and Hudson, which provides a decent catalog of styles. It was republished recently and is now far more affordable than the copy I got soaked by in Istanbul some years back.\n\n"

      "content": "Another very good book is TF Mitchell's _Writing Arabic_. This book focuses almost exclusively on the _ruq'ah_ script, the most common daily handwriting style found in the Middle East, but it is the only text I've come across, apart from Thomas Milo's essay in _Language Culture Type_, that treats connectivity of the Arabic script as something other than collections of 'ligatures'.   \n   \nJohn B's recommendation of _The splendor of Islamic calligraphy_ is a good one, which I'll second. Its catalogue of styles is not as complete nor as nuanced as that in _The art of the pen_, i.e. it misses a number of significant sub-styles, but it has many good examples of fine work. Perhaps a academic library near you has a copy of _The art of the pen?_\n\n"

I already ordered a copy of \"Arabic script\" by Gabriel Mandel Khan last week on amazon and expecting it any moment, I also orded his book on Hebrew script, though this book exists only in Italian and my Italian is not that good. Has anybody any suggestions on books on Hebrew script (in English) ??\n\n"

It was published by Tav (1993), in Jerusalem, but I've not seen it available from any North American sources.

The images in the book are often not the original photos of bookpages, but are drawings, and they are quite small, so you can't see the letters well.   \nAnd I also hoped that there would have been some info about STAM, the special hebrew script, that is used in the Thora, and that has to be written in consideration of special rules (to be kosher); but the book doesn't even mention STAM.   \nCan you tell me if the books above have information on STAM ??\n\n"
