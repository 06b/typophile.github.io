Haven't got anything on my machine, had a look through Indentifont and WTF with no joy, so found this site recommended on a blog here [http://www.webhostingreviewboards.com/design/5-famous-font-recognition-t...](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701150358/http:/www.webhostingreviewboards.com/design/5-famous-font-recognition-tools-and-my-personal-experience/ \"http://www.webhostingreviewboards.com/design/5-famous-font-recognition-tools-and-my-personal-experience/\") and thought I'd ask, very nicely, if anyone could help. Design is for a penurious amateur drama company, so free would be nice, but not essential...  \nThanks in advance  \nMike \n",
