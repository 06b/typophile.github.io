I’m looking for an article by David Rutt covering [Eric Gill’s postage stamp designs](http://web.archive.org/web/20090907060458/http:/www.katranpress.com/stamps_gill_1_1.html). I actually have an _old_ photocopy of this article, but am hoping to get some scans of the illustrations. I can’t find a copy locally (Boston) or even many mentions to this journal online. As always, any help or hints would be greatly appreciated.\n\nMichael\n\n",
