  "content": "I'm working on a typeface I've been working on for a year and I'm nearly done. Today I added a few more kerning classes and kerned hundreds of kerning pairs. I spent hours on it today and I was excited to be done and generate the font and I get an error stating I can't generate the font because some glyphs used in the feature file were not found in the font.\n\nNow, this seems an easy problem to fix. I just don't know how. Can someone tell me what I need to be looking at? Today I replaced a few characters and added some kerning classes in both Bold and Light and I get the same error in both versions so I'm quite sure the problem is in one of the kerning classes.\n\nAs far as I can remember these are the classes I added:  \n\\_a.ss01: a' a.ss01 aacute.ss01 acircumflex.ss01 adieresis.ss01 agrave.ss01 aring.ss01 atilde.ss01  \n\\_i: i' iacute icircumflex idieresis igrave imacron iogonek iring dotlessi  \n\\_y: y' yacute ycircumflex ydieresis ygrave  \n\\_period: period' comma colon semicolon ellipsis  \n\\_question: question' question.ss03  \n\\_copy: copyright' registered\n\nIs there a typo somewhere or am I doing something wrong? How can I check which glyphs are supposedly missing from the font?\n\n",
