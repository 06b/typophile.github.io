More information on how to survive this Board can be found in the two threads at the top of the list: [!!! PLEASE READ THIS FIRST !!! Frequently Answered Questions](http://web.archive.org/) and [!!! PLEASE READ THIS FIRST !!! How to post a sample or image](http://web.archive.org/web/20131026195446/http:/typophile.com/node/18067). Pretty self-explanatory, huh? ;^)\n\nWeeliam, one thing you'll find in the FAQ is that you'd better name your threads a little more specifically. To quote myself: _“Please help me identify this font” is pretty pointless as that’s the only thing we do on the Type Identification Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline would say “Stuff happened!”_ ;^)\n\n"
