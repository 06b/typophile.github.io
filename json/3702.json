The two big problems I see are both in your last name (and they're supporting each other), which is tempting to read \"BRIGHTAL\" or at best \"BRICHTAL\". Just making the tops of the \"A\" round would probably make it snap into place.   \n   \nAlso, I would put a dot (vertically centered) before the \"ORG\" - for one thing some people would think \"Oregon\"... and maybe as a result think you live in town where everybody is always very hungry. :-)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
