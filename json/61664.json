It's not a didone, like Bodoni, but it has a rather high contrast and the display cut is very expressive.\n\nI'm a sucker for [Bodoni Egyptian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227021643/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=SHT0000006) (predominantly for text), by Nick Shinn, which would pair nicely with most other Didones.\n\n"
