To me, the \"flip the m in me around to change it into a w\" gimmick is not funny. What it seems he wants is for us to about all of us instead of ourselves as individuals. This is very noble and would might make a change. But when I look at the logo, I see that word in the center looking like a \"me\" instead of \"we\" and I suddenly think that the whole purpose of this movement might be more about _Al-Gore-the-person-and-what-he's-doing-to-save-the-environment-and-how-it-is-all-great_ rather than a call for all of us to work together to save the environment, which is what should really happen. Right?\n\n",

Sounds good to me. And the logo achieves simplicity and balance, which is the main and most difficult thing. Kudos to Chester.\n\n"
