  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm new to font-making, and I've been pulling my hair out trying to get some OpenType features working for a Cyrillic font I'm putting together. Superscript variants and ligatures \\*are\\* supposed to work in Word 2003, right? (I did try InDesign too, also with no luck.)\n\nMy font needs superscript glyphs that look somewhat different than just a raised standard glyph. If it makes a difference, the superscript glyphs have dimensions such that they should show up above the previous character.\n\nIn addition, the superscript glyphs take on a different appearance if combined with Uni0483 (combining titlo); they should still appear above the previous character.\n\nI've read everything I can on OpenType superscripts and looked at all the fonts I have for clues, but I wasn't able to find much in terms of examples. All I know is that typing any of the relevant characters in superscript doesn't yield the superscript variants, and none of the ligatures appear when the correct combinations are typed.\n\nHere's what I did for the OpenType code:\n\nfeature sups { # Superscript  \n script cyri;  \n sub [uni0434 uni043C uni0440 uni0441] by [uni0434.sups uni043C.sups uni0440.sups uni0441.sups];  \n} sups;\n\nand also\n\nfeature liga { # Standard Ligatures  \n script cyri;  \n sub uni0434 uni0483 by uni0434\\_uni0483.sups;  \n sub uni043C uni0483 by uni043c\\_uni0483.sups;  \n sub uni0440 uni0483 by uni0440\\_uni0483.sups;  \n sub uni0441 uni0483 by uni0441\\_uni0483.sups;  \n} liga;\n\nAny help at all would be wonderful.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\n~Quinn\n\n",

(And whether Word for Vista will?) I'm assuming browsers don't display it. I'd ideally like to use them in xml-based e-books, but it would be up to the e-book reader software to support it, right?\n\nAlso, if someone writes something with the correct combinations for the superscript or ligature in Word, then copies and pastes it into a program that does support OpenType, will the variant glyphs show up?\n\nThanks,  \nQuinn\n\n"
