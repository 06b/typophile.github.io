  "content": "Dear forum-Members,\n\n**------------------- edit July 2010 ------------------**\n\nDear members of this forum – Tierra Nueva is finally out, released in July 2010. You can find [more information here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203054/http:/fonts.info/info/en_tierra-nueva.htm), and the [final specimen here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203054/http:/www.fonts.info/dlcounter/DrWeb_DownloadZaehler.php?d=10).\n\nPurchase is available via [www.fonts.info](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203054/http:/www.fonts.info/ \"www.fonts.info\") and myfonts.com.\n\nAs this project was started here on typophile.com, I will leave the text below, from 2005 till now in a as-is state for documentation.\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------**\n\nin my leisure-time I am working on a font inspired by an spanish map of america made in the year 1561. The Map has hundreds of letters and a lot of illustration (sea-monsters, native americans, etc.) on it, I think it's made by copperplace engraving (or at least by another form of engraving).\n\nThere is enough material to make a roman, italic and capital display font with a lot of ligatures, flourishes etc. of it. At the moment, i am experimenting on the roman and have started selecting glyphs for the italic version.\n\nI guess i have worked too long without feedback (as you can see, i have created many ligatures and diacritics already), so it's over time already to show it somebody...\n\nMy method is to select some glyphs from the map (they vary, there is no \"typical A\"), do a 1:1-redraw, adjust and modify it trying to keep the original impression (with some exceptions). I also added some of the letters that are not availiable on the map, as it is in spanish and latin (missing U, missing Z,z, etc.). The original figures are all lowercase, the uppercase ones are derived from them.\n\nThere are certainly some problems with some glyphs at the moment (for example C, S, Z, K, W k, s, w, 2, 8, too wide f-ligatures and/or too narrow longs-ligatures, i am sure you'll find more of them).\n\nI would be thankful if you could take a look at it, comparing it with the original letters, and telling me what you would do different, I just need some feedback before I can go further with it...\n\nLast thing: I am planning to call it \"Terra Nova\". Objection? Suggestions?\n\nThanks a lot for your help  \nsebilar\n\nps.: if I am already posting: are there any guides, tutorials, FAQs, frequently made errors, etc. how to start working on a font concerning the technical matters (opentype, ligatures, encoding, etc.)? I am trying to lern a lot about it at the moment, but it's just collecting and combining pieces of information and do trial and error...\n\n",

Going on v. 0.44 --\n\nI generally don't like this sort of face -- too angular, sharp, and compressed for my very subjective tastes -- but you've done quite a good job with this.

I'd say give the head more stress contrast and squash it a little top-to-bottom; then bring the bottom finial underneath the handle.  \ns: change the serifs?  \nZero needs more stroke contrast.  \n7 too wide.  \nWhy do the periods and such have a slice taken out of them?  \n? needs more thick.  \nWhat distinction will there be between diereses and double-acutes?  \nG's top serif should be more like C's.\n\nItalics (even though it's a rough sketch, I'll start critiquing):  \nTerrific motion. Make sure that as you go, you give each character a definite thick and definite thin area. Like, the z is all thin, no thick. (This applies to some of the Roman characters too.)  \nX, x don't seem like they should have serifs.  \no and s don't fit.  \nc needs an upper finial.  \ng too wide.\n\nI like this a lot. Very well done.\n\nNow, keep in mind, I'm still only 16 and this is my... fourth? post on the site. But what I just mentioned is what I see.\n\n"

I guess this is the only easy way to create a \"dot\" with the tools available for this technique (doing a \"twist\" with a beginning and an ending – creating the slice in between). I think at the moment it's too much detail that can't be seen in reading-textsizes. I will try to make it more visible, or, if this does not work, eliminate the slices completely.\n\nI think telling what you see is very important, whether you are 16 or 96. It's just that more people means more thoughts, and thoughts are good :)  \nOf course, as the designer of this font, i have to keep the decicion which ideas and thoughts i translate into the design, and which i do not, because otherwise it's just implementing \\*all\\* the ideas, and in the end the type turns out to be a freak ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Nick Shinn,\n\nI am working on some opentype-features, but as I have found out, this is more complicated than assumed :)\n\nThis is my first font that is that far that I can think about opentype-coding, so everything I do is experimenting how it could work.  \nLigatures are no problem, figures are (at the moment), as there are more then just two types on them, but there are uppercase, lowercase, table, superior, inferior, etc., and I haven't found out yet how to exchange from every figure-class to any other without problems.  \nI've tried to look at Adobes Garamond Pro for that, but it's too complicated for me at the moment... Learning by doing will be the key I guess.\n\nOn ligatures, there is another little problem: I am German-speaking, and we have a very \"nice\" ruleset for ligatures: they are only allowed, when they do not spread across so-called \"Wortfugen\". A \"Wortfuge\" would for example be here: Mouse|trap. So, let's say if we have the word \"Schilfinsel\" (Schilf|insel), we are not allews to use a ligature, as it could disturb the legability of this word combined of two seperate words. This is because german language consists of a large amount of these combination of words, and they would not be recognisable anymore as parts of the whole new word if they were connected by ligatures.  \nOf course, this is a problem for german language only. The only question is: is it useful to full-feature the font with ligature-replacements even of exotic combinations, and annoying german typographers, or should it be reduced, and the additional ligs can be accessed by the glyph-table? Or even do two versions of it :)\n\nDoing contextual alternates is an option, but i first have to re-work them, as they are far less-developed at the moment than the rest of the glyphs.\n\nThanks for your Feedback  \nSebilar\n\n"

(Although I had come across the capital \"double S\" before in a Typophile thread (can someone point that out?), where that phenomenon can occur.\n\nIt is possible to include alternate sets of rules within an OpenType feature, distinguished by a \"language tag\". You can see this at work in the \"locl\" feature of A Garamond Pro.\n\nI wonder if any foundries, such as Linotype, have implemented language-specific OT ligature substitutions?\n\nHere I am, sounding like an authority on OpenType (and I have even given a workshop on contextual alternates), however, I have only been making OT fonts for a year, and there are huge gaps in my knowledge, as I have only \"mastered\" some capabilities of some features. What's more, there are new capabilities to be invented/designed all the time, such as dealing with Wortfugen.\n\nSo don't be discouraged, make this an OpenType font from the outset.  \nI expect that quite soon, as OpenType becomes the norm (no longer \"terra nova\"), typographers will have zero tolerance for fiddling around with glyph substitutions and font changes, but will expect to handle things like compound fractions and complex ligatures by going straight to the OT palette. You might think \"I can retrofit this font with OT later\", but if you're anything like me, you will have new fish to fry by then, and it won't get done.\n\nI'm not saying OT features are a necessity of every font, but I do believe that it is more important to make special ligatures accessible by OT, rather than to just make them.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick Shinn:\n\nThanks for the reveal of this Fontlab-behavior, I already was wondering about Adobe-programmer's super-high IQ so that they can remember classes by numbers :)\n\nCapital double s is quite a controversial thing: german double s is a ligature of longs and s (other say longs and z... another topic), and it's a letter by its own today, used when the s is spoken sharply, but the vocal in front of it is long, not shortened (otherwise, ss is used).  \nWhen writing in capital letters (for titling or advertising, etc.), the problem was that there is no equivalent for ß in capitals. This leads to typographical uglyness like \"MAßNAHME\". Correctly, ß is replaced by SS in capitals, so it becomes \"MASSNAHME\".  \nBut there are cases where this leads to misunderstanding. In lowercase writing, the words \"Maße\" (measures) and \"Masse\" (mass) can be indentified as two different things, but in uppercase, both become \"MASSE\".  \nThere are examples of a uppercase equivalent of ß, like in inscriptions of family names on tombstones, and there were also tries in DDR (eastern germany) to create a uppercase ß, but until now this was not successful. There is no place for it in unicase, and it is not used in dictionaries either. So there is no big hope that it will ever be \"standard\".\n\nThere is no doubt that I will try to do a lot of opentype-Scripting with Terra Nova, as this is also a project to learn new things. But I know already that it will be difficult :)  \nI think the problem with Wortfugen can't be solved until Opentype supports dictionaries. Until now I haven't found fonts that have solved this problem (not even linotype, that have done things like Zapfino...). It's the same problem as scripting the usage of s/longs: too many (or no) rules, too many exceptions.\n\n"

There are also some sans serif typefaces in which the fi and fl ligatures actually pull back the top of the f rather than make a connection.

There were ligatured-character and other glyphs for de, del, and several other common \"glue words\". Unfortunately, there are no ISO designations for these characters yet. The closest one for \"de\" is Ð (an old Norse glyph; in most typefaces the horizontal also extends leftward from the vertical, which wasn't the case for the Spanish ligature). There isn't anything even close for the other combo characters commonly used by the Spanish back then.\n\nCheers, Warren\n\n"

It's very simple to make, you just take the midddle bar of the E and stick it off onto the D:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203054im_/http:/typophile.com/files/de_lig_example_6593.png)\n\nThat's pretty much the only ligature you see in Spanish other than the ampersand as \"et\" used to be used instead of Modern Spanish \"y\" for \"and\". I've read in several places that there used to be a ligature for LL or ll, but in my research I've yet to find a single document that actually used such a ligature, although there are some interesting posibilities. The \"ch\" is occasionally kerned closer but seeing them ligatured is not common practice.\n\nA good font for Spanish needs a,o,e,z,d,n,r,s,c,ñ in superscript off the top of my head (see [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417203054/http:/typophile.com/node/42577) on ordinal numbers which you may or may not want their combinations ligatured. Best bet for them is do several bar/underline characters that can underline one, two, three, four of them at a time. Likewise,the tilde was not just reserved for the ñ, but could be used over any vowel as well where it meant \"this letter plus an m or n\" (eg, cõtar = contar, ãpliaciõ = ampliación). It could be used over multiple letters to signify that several letters (usually vowels) had been omitted.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't hurt to have some nice capital Qs designed for the words Que and Qué, which do appear quite frequently.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos».

The lettering on the map seems more tight and regular than Sebastian's interpretation- I could see how hard it was to create a font that encompassed both this regularity and the many idiosyncratic elements that give it its special flavor. I compared the new version of the font with a copy of the pdf I saved last week. I was sorry to see the small g lose its \"cartoony\" shape as Hrant has remarked with some justification. Sebastian, how about using the g found on the map in the word \"Magallanes\" just to the left of the Southern tip of S. America? It has dignity and a nice flourish to it. Also the new version of the font seems a bit too staid, perhaps because the text sample lacked the exciting ch and ft and other ligatures that added so much to the character of the font.\n\n"
