We want the vibrance to inspire people, to get people really backing the Olympic bid. We passionately believe in the Olympic bid and we want other people to actually follow suit and really get behind the bid.\"_\n\nBarbara Cassani, Chairman, London Olympic Bid 2012  \n_\"The London symbol is the River Thames which flows through us and gives us the heart of the city, the backbone of the city. And the shape is also a ribbon, a ribbon of colours. The colours represent the diversity of the city, the people who come from everywhere, and the ribbon itself is something that's used in sport. It's a winners' tape. It's the ribbon from which those gold medals will hang for all those people from London and the UK who win the medals in 2012.\"_\n\nScripted explaination of logo at the unveiling:\n\nThe new design for London Olympic bid for 2012 has been unveiled at the Tate Modern gallery in London. The ribbon-based design, which represents the shape of the River Thames, beat off stiff competition. Those behind the bid say it's symbolic of the diversity of London and the Olympic spirit.\n\nThe five-colour ribbon design represents London's main waterway, which runs through the heart of the city, and the Olympics games itself. Those behind the bid say this is crucial to the bid.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nI have always had a keen interest in the development and marketing of Olympic Games logos, emblems and identity systems. There are not many projects in design or marketing that present themselves every two years (alternating Summer and Winter Olympics) and have such a major impact globally.\n\nHere is an excellent blog on designs of 2012 candidate logos:  \n [http://38one.com/cleverblog/place-your-bid](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106040119/http:/38one.com/cleverblog/place-your-bid)\n\n"

Kids today don't get enough exercise: driven to school, nowhere to play (habitat removal), privatization of facilities, etc.\n\n"

Here in New York there was a completely different vibe for the games. I couldn't walk anywhere in London without seeing tons of ads. Here in New York, you're lucky if you happen to run across a couple.\n\nI love hand done type as its one of my specialities, and I would be inclined to lean toward the Paris logo. It just to me feels a little incomplete. My vote (though it has always been unpopular in the past) is the New York logo. It has a playful vibe, which I like. Though personally speaking I'd like it more if the \"1\" in 2012 had a pseudo-serif on it. :)\n\n"

In my opinion, when you visually join the split images of Statue of Liberty on left and victorious olympic athelete on right, you get an overall message of \"America wins!\"\n\nLondon's bid logo ribbon motif (in official olympic colors) seems very problematic as an emblem that has to stand up for repro on embroidered patches, tiny pins, etc. So I imagine that Andy Stanfield will continue to refine the logo before official adoption.\n\nThe Paris bid logo as it stands looks colorful if anything, but weak in treatment. The brush forms are not gestured enough to portray energy or movement, and not refined enough to evoke visual harmony. As for it's message, deja vu \"I (heart) NY\" \"I (heart) Virginia\" and \"I (heart) my dog!\"\n\nI know it's easy to sit back and dis designs, but come on, it's the Olympics of logo design.\n\n--------------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!\n\n"
