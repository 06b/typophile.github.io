  "content": "This is a work in progress (maybe, depending on the feedback) for a hipster vegetarian restaurant. I have designed a logo that will be simple and sleek, as the restaurant will have strong graphic treatments and I didn't want the composition as a whole to be too busy. The logo will probably be reversed out of the images. I have included a variation on the logo, the one with the solid black box bordering, and then the second logo with lines above and below. The third logo includes the by-line of the restaurant, I assume to be put on the restaurant sign. Let me know what you think, changes, critques etc. I really would appreciate feedback so as to learn as much as possible!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Animalia.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032/http:/typophile.com/files/Animalia.jpg) | 11.96 KB |\n| [AnimaliaBox.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032/http:/typophile.com/files/AnimaliaBox.jpg) | 13.85 KB |\n| [AnimaliaMeat.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032/http:/typophile.com/files/AnimaliaMeat.jpg) | 15.95 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "This is not a critique, more just a comment in general.\n\nMy favorite logos are the ones that have an idea to them. A concept that reinforces the message of the brand. There are plenty of lovely logos that are just a word set in type—and some do a fantastic job of setting a mood or personality. For example, I happen to like the Veer logo over there on the right of the page. But I believe that a logo with a strong, ingenious idea is always the most memorable. I don't mean an idea which overcomplicates the logo—simplicity is key. I mean an idea which provides the viewer with both a visual discovery and a mnemonic device. There is something wonderfully satisfying about seeing a logo which makes you go, \"wow, that is really clever/smart/unexpected.\"\n\nTo me, as simple and strong as your logos are, they are merely a typeset word, and heck, a lot of people can do that. I know, there's a lot of logos that are mere words out there. I think that's because creating a logo with a real idea is so bloody hard.\n\nJust a thought. ;-)\n\n"

The first thing I'd think of when hearing 'animalia' is some sort of exotic steak house or rib joint.\n\nIt'd be like calling a steak house 'broccoli and such'.\n\nBut, as far as a logo, this certainly feels 'upscale restaurant' to me. I agree that a clever mark to go with it would be fun...and might be critical if the name sticks to reinforce the NON-meat aspect of the place.\n\nNot to derail the discussion, but this is one of my favorite restaurant marks as of late:\n\n[http://www.twincitiesfun.net/images/est/002765/002765\\_icon.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032/http:/www.twincitiesfun.net/images/est/002765/002765_icon.png \"http://www.twincitiesfun.net/images/est/002765/002765\\_icon.png\")\n\n"

If it's a vegetarian restaurant maybe a ghostbusters-style circle with cross thru it and a cow inside the circle, or something like that.\n\nConsider using a softer-edged font. Vegetarianism is tantamount to humanism (human respect for animals), so how about using a Venetian (Benbo, High Tower, Jenson etc) and lower case letters, or even a script type.\n\nColor would help make it more attractive too.\n\nThe by-line needs a hyphen: \"A meat **-** free dining experience\"\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

As for the name I would be annoyed by the name and the patronising strapline but then maybe I’m not a hipster and ultimately we have to work with what we’re given.\n\nTim\n\n"

Malbright I agree that yes, it's just a typeface etc but as I said, I did want it to be simple, but I will try to add a graphic element as I think this could really develop it, and I definately agree that it's awesome seeing something that is clever. And thanks James re the grammer, (the use of 'meat-free') I didn't realise... I'll also try the box width and spacing etc. The whole idea of ANIMALIA is to be ironic, and I like the idea of ANIMALIA with the box around alluding to an animal being branded, or meat.

Isn't it repulsion to acts like branding of animals that make people become vegetarians in the first place?\n\nThere is nothing wrong with irony in and of itself; just don't be cruel to your audience.

Push the irony a bit further. I think the trick is to make it ironic enough that people get it while still retaining a sense of elegance.\n\n\"Isn’t it repulsion to acts like branding of animals that make people become vegetarians in the first place?\"\n\nI'm not a vegetarian, but I think that's a rather small demographic in the larger market of vegetarians.

      "content": "Sorry folks, I was in a hurry when posting and failed to explain my point properly. What I'm driving at is this: I honestly think a plain sans serif is too sterile and a far from ideal type for a restaurant, as it lacks organic qualities. If the brief feels instinctively off-target and the specs appear set to produce an ineffective design I have no qualms about bucking the specs.\n\nYou shouldn't either. If it doesn't make sense, try something that does.\n\nUsing a Venetian type for this logo is an exaggerated alternative. Here are some mock-ups using types closer to the original brief:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032im_/http:/typophile.com/files/animalcomp1_6218.gif)\n\nSerifa black, plus Serifa regular for the by-line. Graphic effect without the sterility of a sans serif.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032im_/http:/typophile.com/files/animalcomp4_4313.gif)\n\nSerifa bold caps. Effect as above but the capitals make it less endearing. Some patrons might think they're being shouted at.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032im_/http:/typophile.com/files/animalcomp3_5267.gif)\n\nClarendon black plus Clarendon regular for the by-line. The bracketed serifs and tails on the a's make it much more organic. But it's still graphic in effect. Dectractor---Clarendon is widely used and may not stand out enough for some patrons.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032im_/http:/typophile.com/files/animalcomp6_4300.gif)\n\nChianti black plus Chianti bold for the by-line. Closer to a sans serif without being one. Not as graphic in effect but friendly and organic at a glance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205032im_/http:/typophile.com/files/animalcomp5_6232.gif)\n\nChianti weights as above but all capitals. A more graphic effect from the same type. If it must be done with all caps this one avoids the sterile quality of a straight-laced sans.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "Love that idea Lex!\n\nAnimalia set in type that simulates stark meat packaging or cattle branding doesn't strike me as particularly ironic. I suppose if the word were VEGETABLE and it looked like meat branding, that would have some inherent irony. But since the name is ANIMALIA and the type looks like something on a package of MEAT, there's no inherent conflict that would present itself ironically. Actually, they kind of look like they belong together.\n\nBranding vegetables, creating an animal out of vegetables or broccoli ... those are ideas that are interesting because of the juxtaposition. They also truly underscore the concept of the restaurant. And by the way, they're pretty ingenious too. It's that kind of intrinsic counterpoint that could make this a logo people will remember and enjoy. I believe such a mark would do a better job of selling the restaurant and bringing people in. I believe that on a subconscious level an intelligent, ingenious design causes people to raise their expectations about the whole experience, and it gives them a helpful mnemonic by which they can hang on to the memory in their busy brains.\n\nThere's something very pleasing about discovering a visual irony ... or a vegetable irony, as the case may be. I could just hear one of my vegan friends saying, \"Lets go to that restaurant with the broccolli animal thing. That was cool.\" I cannot imagine someone saying, \"Let's go to that restaurant with the really stark type that says Animalia. Just looking at that logo makes me smile and feel happy. It's very wecoming\"\n\nI also agree with James that there might be a better approach than something so sterile. In just a few minutes he put together some rather nice treatments that have personality and warmth. Very thoughtful and kind of you, good man. If you're not going to have a pleasing ironic interplay, at least make the customers feel warm, welcomed and enticed when they see the mark.\n\nIf you want to stick with the stark, cold MEAT-like labeling motif, in my view you're going to have to add something to it to make it ironic. Otherwise I think it just looks cold, flat and not particularly relevant.\n\nAnyway, It's really fun to read everybody's opinions and see their examples. That's why I love this place. You learn. You meet really smart people who provoke thinking. And you get to bathe in gorgeous fontrocities. A delightful way to spend an evening indeed.\n\n"

Are you saying hipsters are now vegetarians, or it's hip to be a veg, or it's only a place for vegetarians who are hipsters, or you want to create a cool veg eatery that has some style to it?\n\nAs a vegetarian, if someone told me it was a 'hipster vegetarian restaurant' I'd probably be immediately turned off. In my impression hip no longer is what's new and cool, but a bunch of annoying young people wearing bad neon clothing, and ridiculous fashion that would otherwise usually be left on the runways of fashion shows.\n\nSo, that being said, I don't believe that mark is the right fit. Personally, I find it plain and if I was looking for my restaurant to stand out from the crowd I'd probably a more daring feel as opposed to conservative.\n\n--\n\nIn response to aluminum's statement about why people don't eat meat – I personally don't for health reasons, and my wife doesn't for environmental reasons.
