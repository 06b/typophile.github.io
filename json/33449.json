Seems that everyone is doing their own characters based on the topic.\n\nI.e. check out the swedish super skilled girls behind Hjärta Smärta at [http://www.woo.se/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124718/http:/www.woo.se/ \"http://www.woo.se/\").

You are right I went too far.\n\nThe thing I have against this kind of assignment is that if your teacher had been able to show you what postmodern means then you would not have to take it from a book or a person that a typeface ( or song or book ) is postmodern - it would be something you could detect for yourself. And if you saw a false claim you could detect that too. But you haven't been given the idea of what Post Modern is. It's sort of unfair in a way. Or tough.\n\nThink about it this way: Can you look at a typeface an decide for yourself if it looks Venetian, Aldine or Egypitine to you? If you study type history a little it can become pretty easy.\n\nLook here & you will be able to:\n\n[http://typophile.com/courses/type101](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124718/http:/typophile.com/courses/type101 \"http://typophile.com/courses/type101\")\n\nHowever I am arguing that postmodern is not detectable in the same way. Not at all. It's not like apples & oranges it's like apples and civilizations. It is a whole different thing.\n\nWhat you can already say without understanding postmodern ideas very well is 'this font seems to be the result of a sort of postmodern sentiment'. Or you could say 'here is a font using pastiche - so is that pomo?'\n\nThats the sort of thing which will get you further. But It isn't what you were asked to do. And won't ansswer you question very well even if it's a start.\n\n<cite>weird looks </cite>\n\nThe reason you may have goten that look could be:\n\na) they don't think it exists  \nb) the don't think it should exist  \nc) they are looking for a most specific kind of question like the kind I gave eamples of above.  \nd) It doesn't exist  \ne) They might wish your other teacher would give reasonable assignments\n\nI am not they guy to explain Pomo to you. Still, since I insulted you I will do my best to give you my take on it. I will warn you that you should take it with some salt & look around for a better explanation. And maybe read some Derida.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques\\_Derrida](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124718/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques\\_Derrida\")\n\nTo do it I will comment on some previous posts:\n\n<cite> Type revival as recontextualization. </cite>\n\nThis isn't really pomo. Not Caslon is a a pomo-ish title. The designer may have been influenced by pomo sentiments. But I don't know that the font is pomo.\n\n[http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=111](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124718/http:/www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=111 \"http://www.emigre.com/EFfeature.php?di=111\").\n\nI say that because I think pastiche is not enough in itself to label a typeface as 'Pomo'. There would have to be intent.\n\n<cite> curation-as-art methodology </cite>\n\nCuration is not type.\n\n<cite>But then I’m not sure where to draw the line between where things are postmodern by design, or postmodern because of the environment in which they were created.</cite>\n\nHere the distiction should be made between the aesthetics or qualities that resulted from post modern ideas and impulses and the ideas and impulses themselves. Design cannot be Pomo but the content/narrative in a design ( magazine, greeting card, whatever) can be aesthetically reinforced by Design. This can be done by employing pastiche, rejection of genre distictions, etc.\n\nSo far I have just ben negating things. There should be a postive example as well.\n\nI think Pomo is a little bit like Murder vs. Manslaughter. If there is intent it's Murder/Pomo. If there isn't it's maybe Pastiche or Parody or Ambiguous - but it's not Pomo. Sorry my 'postive' example is murder.\n\nPut in less bloody terms; Pomo implies and requires either an audience that receives the intent of an author/maker, a viewer that constructs a narative on his/her own, or just an author with intent. Immediately the wole thing is complex and gets ever more complex. It's that complexity that creates a sense that ambiguity ( as opposed to modern objectivity ) is inherently inevitable.\n\nAlso, identification of something as Pomo automatically sets up narative and a triagulation of the labeler, the object in question, and the maker or author - even if the maker is labeler.\n\nSo; no narrative - no Pomo.\n\nStories have narratives. Films may have them. Art can (or not).\n\nBut Type does not.\n\nA promotion of type could be postmodern. But they type cannot be. It's too simple a thing.\n\nHere is one last example: Iron or even Iron compounds are not an organism. But Iron or Iron compounds can be in an organism. Pomo is complex like an organism. Type is simple like Iron compounds. You wouldn't ask if a compund of Iron had Ape-like qualities would you? But You need Iron to make Apes.\n\nAgain, sorry if I irked you. Hopefully this is of some help.\n\nBTW: the post modern thing to do now would be to ask your teacher why he/she gave you this assignment and what the intent of it was. And then to deconstruct that intent, to spectulate on the way in which the assignment related to the history of the teacher's life, and to indicate the subjective value the assignment had for you while acknowleging that your opinion is not well informed enough, while also admitting that the narritive you are constructing cannot help but be constructed - however unobjective it may be.\n\n"

I agree that I hate this sort of assignment, too, but I’m stuck doing them. I think she feels the need to pile on more work.\n\nDuring my course, we had studied the usual type classifications like Old Style, Transitional, etc., but never once did my professor mention Post Modern as a classification in any of our lectures. This was part of a very, very long essay for the end of the semester, supposedly hitting on all of the important things we had gone over. But it was never covered in any form so it was a bit…odd.\n\nThe analogies helped a lot. I was looking through one of the books recommended to me on here and I saw that it had all sorts of typefaces in it—from all different classifications, making it impossible to pin down one specific typeface, year, characteristic, etc. Your explanation made it clearer.\n\nHahah…you have me half-tempted to ask my professor why she gave us the assignment, deconstruct it, and write her a note.

I asked a friendf of mine whose views of these things I respect and this is what he wrote to me:\n\n\" Well...here's the short version of \"postmodern\" literary theory, as I understand it. Others might suggest otherwise:\n\n1. Postmodernism, before the 1950s, was primarily a mode of description for certain kinds of appropriative forms.  \n2. At some point, in the 1960s and 1970s, it works its way into both literarure and literary criticism as a self-aware attitude. From my point of view, it is more substantial in literature as an \"artistic\" development--Borges, Calvino, Barth. Novelists like Barth theorize it into things like \"The literature of exhaustion\". In philosophy, there are related-but-quite different developments, like \"The Social Construction of Reality\", etc.  \n3. In the 1960s and 1970s, poststructuralist literary theory (Derrida, etc) makes its way through the intelligentsia. This is a separate development from postmodernism,. as it is a specific reaction to french structuralist theory. It is \"relativizing\", but doesn't particularly relate to developments in the arts, or their modes--there is a certain kind of intellectual sympathy/interaction. From the point of view of postmodern theorists, I suppose, it might itself be considered a kind of development of postmodernism, if you are a postmodern theorist..  \n4. In the late 1970s, postmodern philosophy becomes a broader, more articulated idea. Lyotard writes \"The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge\". Rorty writes \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\". Postmodernism is articulated into a more general description of contemporary thought and knowledge--suspicion of metanarrative, etc.  \n5. In the 1980s, \"postmodern\" and \"poststructuralism\" become catchwords for undergrads everywhere, like ourselves, and often become conflated or generalized into relativized relationships to knowledge.  \n6. Eventually, it becomes a kind of cultural catchword--Republicans mistake it for \"relativism\". Everything self-conscious in the arts becomes \"postmodern\". People get fed up and stop using the term.\n\nYou are probably right that a font is not \"Postmodern\" in the same way that a Calvino novel is postmodern, and also right that that might have been one of the most interesting moments in postmodernism, or the most useful phase. As far as architecture goes, you may also be right, since a piece of architecture is fundamentally a kind of aesthetic object as well as a functional one that has things fonts do not--like a physical context. If you build a modern building in an old neighborhood with certain kinds of self-conscious allusion to the older forms of architecture surrounding it, that may be postmodernism. But a font might be more like a construction material--or not exactly, but it in itself is mostly a form/object which can be put into different contexts.\n\nI think the bigger question has to do with, as you say, technique, which of course is not \"postmodern\"--dada is a good example--for that matter, 18th c novels, etc. That's the problem with step 5, in the 1980s. I wish people would use the phrase \"self-conscious\" or \"self-allusive\" when they just mean self-conscious, instead of invoking a confusing intellectual lineage every time. This is especially a problem since its original uses are real developments in intellectual history. Also, often people really mean \"modernist\", which as you say used all of those techniques and more--no one is more self-conscious/pastiche-using than Dadaists, Surrealists, Theater of the Absurd-ists, Woolf, Joyce, Godard, etc. etc. One might say that postmodernism was a kind of shift in ideology that stripped modernism of its idealist/elitist project, but is still basically modernist in technique. In a way, what people mean by postmodernism is a kind of popularization of modernist technique.\n\nOh well...\"\n\nEnjoy! Or Not.\n\n"

But in terms of contextual quality, when a font is used for everything from soup to sex to septic tanks it becomes too diluted to use for anything effectively. Contrary to what some people claim, it's not that it becomes neutral, it's that it becomes confused, hence unreliable. Think of Trajan, poor Trajan.\n\n\\> spacing preferences are relative\n\nNot when it comes to reading.  \nWhen it comes to delivering good notan a font's various attributes have to be in balance.

Made.\n\n\\> tracking can be applied\n\nTracking ruins the spacing of \"boundary condition\" glyphs,  \nmost famously the right side of the \"r\". Tracking is for brutes.\n\n--\n\nBut there is a good reason to pass on my advice: chances are your teacher, being a graphic designer and not a type designer, really has no idea how (or even that) Helvetica sucks, and might react badly.\n\nhhp\n\n"

And in fact when I posted my friend's long analysis I was interested in showing that pomo has in fact meant many things over time. You can pick from a series of definitions of you want. How is that for shades of grey?\n\nJoseph, the other thing your post suggests is that type has existed in neat catagories up until recently. This is also a mistake. To be sure you can talk about how 'aldine' a type is or not but it isn't a border. It's hazy too. Less than pomo for sure but hazy none the less.\n\nBut the real point I wanted to make was that Pomo isn't really that descriptive a term for type. It isn't that useful. It's closer to spin - or hype. A description that gets closer to what is going on like 'parody' or 'pastitche' or whatever is actually helpful. Saying 'Pomo' about type is as much or more an assertion about the state of the maker mind as it is about the type. Pomo is scattershot & weak as a descriptor.\n\nI am willing to climb down a bit and admit that saying pomo about type is might be okay if you are a graphic designer or a memeber of the public. I am sure there are contexts in which that is going to be a useful way of describing work. I would prefer it is they said type that supports a Pomo direction or something but it isn't worth the arguement. Talking about type isn't easy and they should be given some slack.\n\nOn the other hand, if I have a class I want my teacher to teach something that can use intellectually or practically. That is why I say that for somebody involved in type as a type designer or a teacher; using Pomo as a serious description amounts in intellectual sloth or laziness.\n\n"

Here are a few pithy extracts from pp135-36 of v2.5 of his book:\n\nELEGIAC POSTMODERNISM:\n\n\"Postmodern letterforms ... frequently recycle and revise Neoclassical, Romantic and other premodern forms. At their best, they do so with an engaging lightness of touch and a fine sense of humor. Postmodern art is for the most part highly self-conscious, but devoutly unserious....\"\n\nGEOMETRIC POSTMODERNISM:\n\n\"Some postmodern faces are highly geometric. Like their predecessors the Geometric Modernist faces, they are usually slab-serifed or unserifed, but often they exist in both varieties at once or are hybrids of the two. They are rarely, it seems, based on the pure and simple line and circle, but almost always on more mannered, often asymmetric forms. And like other Postmodern types, they are rich with nostalgia for something pre-modern. Many of these faces are indebted to older industrial letterforms, including typewriter faces and the ubiquitous factory folk-art of North American highway signs. They recycle not Romantic and Neoclassical but Realist ideas....\"\n\n\"Postmodern art, like Neoclassical art, is above all an art of the surface: an art of reflections rather than visions. It has thrived in the depthless world of high-speed offset printing and digital design, where modernism starves. But the world of the scribes, in which the craft of type design is rooted, was a depthless world too. It was the world of the Gothic painters, in which everything is present in one plane....\"\n\nAnd this from Bruce Mau's fabulous catalogue of \"Postmodern\" culture (although I doubt that he uses the \"P\" word):\n\n\"There is no longer any distinction between text and non-text, image and non-image. The entire surface is now described in one language. Everything is now image. With [PostScript] Adobe ushered in an entirely new aesthetic and a new model of 'thinking the page' that will change the way typography itself is conceived.\" (Life Style, p. 65)\n\nSo, perhaps looking at the technologies of so-called 'postmodernity' (Macintosh, PostScript, Fontographer, Internet, etc.) would allow the cultivation of a valid meaning for the term 'postmodern type'.\n\nInevitably, letterforms are always going to refer to something other than themselves (i.e., alphabets). Experiment: try and decipher John Cage's '62 Mesostics for Merce Cunningham,' scattered throughout his book \\_M\\_. (Find specimens here: [http://www.ubu.com/historical/cage/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124718/http:/www.ubu.com/historical/cage/index.html \"http://www.ubu.com/historical/cage/index.html\")). Is Cage's use of Letraset in these musical compositions still 'typography'? This would be another way of approaching the question of 'postmodern type'.\n\n"

It was also imperitive that what was happening be addresed in some way. I think if you read what he wrote there he was trying to make a bridge for his readers and what he was building to had to have been hazy in his own esitmation. No wonder hand waving was employed! What other choice did he have? Also, the making of type & the use of type were coming back together which was a case PoMo style classification breaking. So I am not willing to condemn him for having put it that way - especially in that historical context. But I do think with 20/20 hindsight there are now better, more complex, more accurate & more useful constructions that can & should be employed. Also, if you read his \"The Solid Form Of Language\" you will see that this hand waving is atypical. In general his work is far more specific and grounded. And finally, there is no point in worshiping at the shrine of Bringhurst no matter how much you respect him - which I do in a big big way. So don't think you can cow me into backing down by invoking Bringhurst.\n\n<cite> There is no longer any distinction between text and non-text, image and non-image. </cite>\n\nOn the surface of it ( & in the era of Google) this is silly. Text is king because it is searchable. And even the power of the Image is enhanced with the use of tags. Maybe because the quote you have there is short I am not getting what he is after. And this sentence in particular seems to me crafted to sell books via excitement rather than as an excercise in creating greater clarity. I think Bruce is as much an entertainer as he is a theoretician. I am not slaging off him for that, but I am saying look at the source & be critical of it. And again while Bruce Mau is a lot of fun, and thoughful & provocative - much as I respect him, I don't think he has a corner on truth.\n\n<cite> So, perhaps looking at the technologies of so-called ‘postmodernity’ (Macintosh, PostScript, Fontographer, Internet, etc.) would allow the cultivation of a valid meaning for the term ‘postmodern type’. </cite>\n\nMaybe you would like to explain what you mean & stop simply waving your hands. Conflation is not a helpful way of thinking - especially about this.\n\nFor example, re: John Cage etc: Typography and Type design are differnet things.\n\n- Certainly he is using type so we can agree it's typography.  \n- Is he designing a type face? No. He is using many of them. So there is no PoMo type there. There may be a use of type that supports a PoMo intent. They are not the same thing.  \n- There may also be a PoMo peice using type in ways that support a pomo intent. Again, not quite the same thing.  \n- A typeface based on this work would also not be Pomo for the reasons I have given before.\n\nIf you are going to use the term Pomo with success get out you have to start making distinctions. With distictions comes relationships and with the investigation of relationships you could build to PoMo. And for the sake of being repetitive : A typeface on it's own does not contain a rich enough body of relationships to be PoMo in and of itself.\n\nAs soon as somebody can make an arguement that is considered and convincing I will back down. I would even like that. But so far nobody has. Also, saying that sombody called something PoMo at one point or another doesn't make it so and isn't the basis for a debate.\n\nHrant I llike your logo-ized way of typing PoMo so I stole it.\n\n"

I invoked Bringhurst not for the purposes of worship or for bullying, but simply because his is one of the very few books on type that I happen to have at my disposal. Ditto Mau -- who as an 'entertainer' playing with 'surfaces', goes beyond a theory of postmodernism and into its actual practice. Within my own field of expertise (literature) postmodernism was hardly very exciting or trendy from 1992-2002, when Bringhurst wrote and revised his book (v.2.5 which I quoted from). Indeed, Ihab Hassan, a prominent literary theorist, proclaimed the 'death' of postmodernism in 1990 -- around the same time something we could (but won't)agree to call 'postmodern type' was being born.\n\nAs for making distinctions: this is precisely Bringhurst's method, differentiating postmodernism from modernism, 'elegiac' from 'geometric' postmodernism, etc. They're unstable and problematic categories, to be sure, but no more so than in other fields (literary theory for example).\n\nGranted, postmodern typeface and postmodern typography need to be distinguished (I was evidently thinking somewhat like a rhizome in my previous post). For the record, though, Cage is in fact a de facto typographer, ever since his handwriting was digitized and fontified. In homage, P22Cage even includes a 'Silence' font - the definitive postmodernist typographical gesture? I wonder, has 'Silence' ever been used by a designer?\n\nA couple of salient points mentioned by Bringhurst -- playfulness, hybridity, nostalgia, pastiche and recycling -- allude to theories of postmodernism developed in other fields. I think they reliably inform a working definition of postmodern type. They are starting points -- at least, that's my rationale for posting them -- from which theoretical statements might eventually be formulated. Or not, as the case may be.\n\n"

Since you make that criticism in relation to my comments on technology, let me cite Mau once more:\n\n\"If we look closely at the history of typography, it's principally a history of evolving typographic production techniques. The forms are in fact inseparable from the ways in which they were produced. The same will apply to PostScript. The consequences remain to be seen.\"\n\nThat's the context for Mau's remarks I quoted previously: the \"principal innovation [of PostScript] was the invention of a 'page description language' used to describe any point on the surface, whether it was text or image.\" If text and image are not yet one and the same thing, they are well on the way to becoming so. That, at least, is Mau's conjecture. Technologies such as OCR and image-tagging do tend to blur the boundary somewhat.\n\n"

      "content": "Eben: I appreciate that. You've certainly provided ample food for thought. For example, it strikes me that what Cage achieves in his graphic mesostics at the level of the page is analogous to that which a postmodern typeface would achieve at the level of the font: i.e., hybridity, pastiche, playfulness, etc. -- even (if only rarely) at the expense of legibility itself (or in the case of Cage's mesostics, grammar and syntax). Cage's mesostics exemplify a kind of 'visual poetics' which have often been associated with the initial, more creative and experimental phase of postmodern writing. The arrangement of text as visual image dominates even theoretical writings on postmodernism, such as Hassan's The Postmodern Turn. But unlike concrete poetry, etc., Cage's mesostics and other writings (Mureau, Empty Words) deliberately defy the imperative to communicate a syntactic message. I doubt whether typography could ever be so experimental as to completely disavow its conventional raison d'etre (the result would be the \"Silence\" font -- a blank specimen page -- or sheer noise; in any case, something other than typography as traditionally conceived).\n\nCage's is of course not the only literary aesthetic to qualify as 'postmodern.' Consider Thomas Pynchon's novels as a contrast. Mason & Dixon, a weighty historical novel written in parody of eighteenth-century style (although with plenty of historical anomalies) is set in a period typeface (Pynchon scholars have seized on the ebullient ampersand that adorns the book's jacket). This \"putting on the costume\" (and indeed, \"parading\") of past styles is also a feature of postmodernist literary aesthetics. Arguably, it comprises a more complex relationship than that which might be discerned in such typefaces as NotCaslon or DeadHistory. But the same principle -- reviving historical styles in order to comment on them, and our lingering attachments to them; usually critically -- seems to inform both projects.\n\nJust a couple of random thoughts to throw into the mix.\n\n"

Admittedly I need less proof re: Mau's practice but I would like some sort of specificity or I will be forced to say 'waving hands' again.

Don't you think so too?\n\n<cite> Within my own field of expertise (literature) postmodernism was hardly very exciting or trendy from 1992-2002, when Bringhurst wrote and revised his book </cite>\n\nMaybe so, but within graphic design PoMo was hitting big by the time 1992 rolled around and stopped being trendy maybe 5-7 years later. And who was Bringhurst writing for? Not a Lit or Theory audience. No, clearly a graphic design oriented audience. So I contend Bringhurst had motive. You can't really use Lit Crit as guide here. I mean, how much sense would that make?\n\n<cite> They’re unstable and problematic categories, to be sure, but no more so than in other fields </cite>\n\nI think it would be good if you expanded on this. Even if you think PoMo is a problematic or iffy adventure; it doesn't preclude describing what you you think is essential or descriptive or better still distictive from other ( especially related ) ways of looking at the world.\n\nThat's my core thesis here. I don't see anything in suposedly PoMo type that would not be at home in Dada or some other period that shared 'techniques'. Is there a technique that is unique to Pomo? That would be start at least.\n\nBut even if you can name one or even 100; PoMo isn't just made from one or more approved processi. It isn't just a new & improved Dada 2.0 with 2 new techniques! I am saying PoMo is different & worth talking about because it goes beyond technique, and aesthetics. Actually, Dada did too. But back to the point: Type as a vessel isn't able to carry that distictiveness- mostly because Type on it's own has no narrative. It can play a part in a narrative. But it does not contain one in the way that a Pynchon's 'Mason & Dixon' ( that bit about the ketchap was really fun wasn't it!) or Calvino's 'If on a Winter Night a Traveler' does. Or a Cage poem or Mau essay \\*might\\*.\n\nIn the case of Pynchon & Calvino you can point to the Narrative acknowledging itself as a narrative. That wasn't new exactly. 18th century lit such as Montesquieu, \"Lettres persanes\", or Henry Fielding's \"Tom Jones\", or Laurence Sterne's \"Tristram Shandy\"... did that too which is why Pynchon was keen on revisting the past. And he isn't the only one. Jeanette Winterson & Rushdie have been there too. Still there is something in Pynchon's book which is Postmodern not 18th century. Can you put your finger on it?\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415124718/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction\")\n\nIf you can; can you locate it in a typeface \\*itself\\*?\n\n<cite> If text and image are not yet one and the same thing, they are well on the way to becoming so. </cite>\n\nI have already shown one way in which this is not so. Mau is blurring what is actually complex & rich and - possibly postmodern. He is not getting at what happening but waving hands. It's entertaining but not enlightening. It's not that it's all becomeing one mushy image gruel. It's not a case of becoming Textimage or Imagetext. It's text in images. And images of text. And XML. And RSS. And they are all specific. Distinct and in a web of complex relationships. So it's not all becomeing the <cite> same thing </cite> at all. In fact the opposite. It's a case of more different but also related & interrelated than ever.\n\nI think your best hope for defining some kind of type as PoMo in a really convincing way would be to draw a definition of Pomo outside it's most complex periods : Lit & Theory; and find something distictive there. I am not sayng it can't be done. Just that nobody has done it so far.\n\nThe other model you could use is to say, this period if different. This type was made during this period. It has features which are typical of type from the period. Maybe it was notorious/famous or influential. All of which amounts to: It's periodicity and noteworthiness makes it 'Pomo'. I say that's a poor definition but if you want it you can have it. I only ask that you cop to buying that definition if that's they one you are using.\n\nThe 1st model is harder. The 2nd model is easy. But in either case: confess what standards you are using.\n\n<cite> I doubt whether typography could ever be so experimental as to completely disavow its conventional raison d’etre. </cite>\n\nYes, it is absolutely neccesary that the type carry significant amounts of 'past style' or it will not be recognized as type and will not work and is there fore not type. I mean you could say that all type has been postmodern from the beginning of time because it carries past styles. But that's not a useful or accurate thing to say. You agree - correct?\n\n<cite> a feature of postmodernist literary aesthetics </cite>\n\nNow we are getting somewhere 'a feature' is right. A feature does not rate as equivalent to an aesthetic. And moreover I have been busy saying that PoMo is essentially beyond Aeshetics too. So showing a feature is not enough. Not by a a long shot. That is to say, I am saying PoMo cannot be defined by aesthetics alone. You can disagree. But say so.\n\nAnd finally\n\n<cite> reviving historical styles in order to comment on them, and our lingering attachments to them; usually critically — seems to inform both projects. </cite>\n\nThis was your best point I think. You are saying; if I get you; \"it's not the same, but it has the same spirit\". That really works as long as you don't take things apart and examine the bits. I cannot find the part of NotCaslon & DeadHistory that comments. They do repurpose historical forms. And in a newish way. But repurposing has no point of view in and of itself. It is a technique without a perspective so it isn't 'critical'. Ceratinly commenting; depending on what is said; might be PoMo. The intent lies with the Authors in the case of Type because Type cannot reveal intent in the way that Art, Film, Narrative or I would even argue Architecture can.\n\n"

Or, \"modernity can only define itself in terms of a temporal break with an organic past, but it is a break that has always already occurred no matter which moment one chooses as its starting point.\" (Kantaris).\n\nSo Italian Fat Face is not part of the Post-modern era, but may still be a post-modern type design.\n\n"

      "content": "For what it's worth, these would appear to be quite distinct labelling terms (if not downright misnomers):\n\n1. postmodernism -- a self-conscious aesthetic/anti-aesthetic movement in literature and the arts\n\n2. postmodernity -- a periodizing term the inaugural date of which varies by discipline: ca. 1945 in Hassan's account of American literature; ca. 1972 in Jencks's account of architecture. As for typography, Mau would probably settle somewhere mid-1980s, while others might prefer a date of ca. 1990 (Emigre, et al.). Note however that 'postmodernism' was occasionally used in the 1930s, and even as early as the late-19th century (see Nicholas Zurbrugg's book \\_The Parameters of Postmodernism\\_ for details).\n\nEben: 'postmodern ... intent' would appear to be a contradiction in terms, insofar as the example of Cage is concerned. Part and parcel of the postmodern condition would seem to be the relinquishment of an author's control over the 'meaning' of his/her text, and analogously, of a typographer's control over the use and interpretation of his/her typeface; although arguably, that disavowal of intention discloses -- yes, paradoxically -- merely another kind of intention, one that responds to the conditions of postmodernity (immanence + indeterminacy, or indetermanence, as Hassan quipped).\n\nSpeaking of Cage's preference for non-intentionality, an \\_I Ching\\_ approach to typeface design is remotely conceivable. Just as Cage decided which parameters of a composition would be determined by chance operations, so too might a type designer subject the various parameters of each letterform in the alphabet to a series of chance operations. Parameters such as 'ascender height,' 'bowl width' or 'stroke direction' could easily be modulated at random, ostensibly free of the designer's intention or aesthetic preference. That, for me, would constitute one of many examples of a 'postmodern typography.'\n\nNick: I appreciate the fact that an actual type designer has contributed to this topic! Jeff Keedy is practically the only other typeface designer that I know of who uses the term 'postmodern' to describe what they do. For want of a better term, perhaps?\n\n"
