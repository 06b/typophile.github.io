It unfortunately doesn't have any convenient identifying marks; I looked through a couple of specimen books and the closest thing I found was \"Old English No. 13\" in an ATF book from 1912. It's similar but not the same.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202013536im_/http:/typophile.com/files/oldenglish_3683.jpg)\n\nI did find some crazy judgmental manicule people in another book, though. Completely off topic, but I think they're pretty great!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202013536im_/http:/typophile.com/files/maniculeheads_6490.jpg)\n\n"

Posting on [Briar Press](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202013536/http:/www.briarpress.org/19179) he says:\n\n\"Typographer John Ryder in his book ‘A Suite of Fleurons’ dubbed it a Lyonnaise Arabesque. Originating from the Lyon printing office of Guillaume Rouille in about the year 1570, it may have been cut by Rouille or Pierre Roussin, assisted by Salomon or Robert Granjon. It was recut and cast in multiple sizes as Monotype 219. Francis Meynell and Stanley Morison in their essay “Printers’ Flowers and Arabesques’ published in The Fleuron, give the lineage: Michael Jouve and Pierre Roussin, 1551-1580; Jean Pillehote, 1580-1600; Lamesle, 1742; Delacolonge, 1773; Ploos van Amstel, 1796 and Imprenta Real, 1799.\"\n\nSo there!\n\nAs for Digitization [here's](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202013536/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/glc/1550-arabesques/arabesques/characters.html) a sort of rough interpretation.\n\n"
