Also thought of Matthew Carter (this reminds me a slab version of his heavyweight Wrigley font for Sports Illustrated), or something Jim Parkinson might have done, but I couldn't find it in the works of either of them.\n\nIf I had to guess a foundry, I would have thought Font Bureau, but I didn't see this. Not Hoefler either.\n\nI'm curious where this will turn out to be from.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
