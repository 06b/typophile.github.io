He was a very kind soul and always in great spirits.\n\nOne of my favorite memories of him: [http://www.houseind.com/movie/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120718074643/http:/www.houseind.com/movie/ \"http://www.houseind.com/movie/\")\n\nAlso, if you get a chance pick up a copy of his book Life with Letters as the Turned Photogenic, a wonderful tome that recounts the history of his company and life . . .\n\nHe left and indelible mark on the type industry and will be sorely missed . . .\n\nStuart\n\n",
