I am currently researching the use of typography associated with aircraft during WW2 and specifically the Lancaster Bomber, for use as part of the International Bomber Command Centre.\n\nIf there is anyone that can help advise me on how typography was used across different planes, how it was applied between factories etc. would be very much appreciated.\n\nI am looking at the end of this process to produce or find an appropriate stencil font that can be used to cut out of metal panels the over 20,000 names of those that lost their lives flying from Lincolnshire during the war. It will be displayed at approximately 80pt.\n\nSam Bartle  \n [www.distraction.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417140954/http:/www.distraction.co.uk/ \"www.distraction.co.uk\")  \n [sam.bartle@distraction.co.uk](mailto:sam.bartle@distraction.co.uk)\n\n",
