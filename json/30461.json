I’m desperate.\n\nThis will be my first time. After years of mediocre design for undeserving clients and design agencies, I am now crippled with stunted typographic skills.\n\nPS—I live in Ireland, so I can’t visit the local _Safeway_ to look at labels on the shelves if you are directing me to American brands.\n\nJC\n\n",

And what's the income bracket your client wants to attract?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nHiro\n\n"
