[Some exhibiton images here,](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121408/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/tags/tobiasfrerejonesgerritnoordzijprizeexhibition/) more soon.\n\nThe Tobias Frere-Jones exhibition also made it on to the [news](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121408/http:/www.rtl.nl/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/miMedia/2009/week10/vr_1930_letters.avi_plain.xml)\n\nOn Saturday was a short seminar on the occasion of the Gerrit Noordzij prize and Paul Barnes, Rich Roat, Chris Vermaas, Tobias Frere-Jones and Piet Schreuders (followed by a performance by the Beau Hunks). I'm sure Erik will post a link to the video clips of the Robothon and Gerrit Noordzij prize lectures here as soon as they are up.\n\n--\n\nLate that night there was small gathering of Type and Media students, Type and Media alumni and some friends from Reading. Some fun was had with the coasters that were on the table: [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121408/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/katanan/3341378046/) and [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121408/http:/abiabiabi.com/index.php?/other/jupiler-coaster--typecooking/)\n\n",
