  "content": "Offenbacher Haggadah from 1927\n\na limited private print for [Rudolf Koch](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rudolf%20Koch)s friend notary Dr. Guggenheim. [Max Dorn](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Max%20Dorn), Offenbach was the artdirector/layouter/executive printer for this project. The book was printed in two colors on [Zerkall](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Zerkall) Bütten paper including 12 handcolored illustration pages by [Fritz Kredel](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fritz%20Kredel). The uniqueness is the combination of the [Jessen](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jessen) Schrift (a gothic blackletter design) and hebrew typefaces.\n\nIt contains also pages with musical notes cuted in type by [Rudolf Koch](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Rudolf%20Koch)s son Paul who worked by this time as apprenticie in the print office of [Klingpor](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingpor).\n\nThe work was set in the 14pt pre-final version of the later called Peter- [Jessen](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jessen)-Schrift.\n\nThe price was in 1928 60RM, no easy money by this time. Today you have to pay between 600 - 1000 Euro, if you have the chance to get some of these rare items.\n\nA public copy is available at [Deutsche Bücherei](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Deutsche%20B%C3%BCcherei), Leipzig at the Lesesaal des Deutschen Buch- und Schriftmuseums (Typespecimen library) (ask for item **1927 B 3622** ) and in the library of the [Klingspor-Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20120826035031/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor-Museum).\n\n",
