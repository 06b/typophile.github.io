Here’s a quick summary of how I did it:\n\nI converted the image to CYMK, then copied each CMYK channel into a separate new grayscale document.\n\nFor each of the four new documents, I added two 50%-gray layers and set them both to Overlay mode. Then I used Add Noise on each of the 50%-gray layers followed by Gaussian Blur. I used a different amount of Gaussian Blur on each of the two layers: a 1.5-pixel radius for the first one and 0.75 pixel for the second. The idea was to get two levels of grain: one coarse, and one finer.\n\nThen I flattened all four of the CYMK gray documents and copied each one back into the appropriate channel in the original document.\n\nI converted back the image to RGB, then added a Hue/Saturation layer to bring down the saturation. Finally, I added a Curves layer to boost the center of the red channel and depress the center of the blue channel.\n\n"
