Ellington is one of my favorite fonts, as is the sans companion font - [Strayhorn](http://web.archive.org/web/20130530021525/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/strayhorn-mt/). The designer, Michael Harvey is a jazz fan -- Billy Strayhorn was Duke Ellington's friend, and arranger on many of his famous pieces.There is also the display face [Braff](http://web.archive.org/web/20130530021525/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/braff/), named for Ruby Braff, a top cornet & trumpet player who had recorded with Ellington, among many others.\n\nEnd of typographical jazz lecture. :)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
