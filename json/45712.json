  "content": "Hey again,\n\nOK I will start with attaching my initial ideas for this little record company located in sweden. The first promo releases will be on 7” vinyl. It is electronic music with a soulfull twist .. want it to fell a bit vintage etc i think. A bit rockabill/ol blues stuff but with a modern finish cause it is still electronic music. So these will in the end be attached on vinyl-labels etc. Ok let me know what u guys think.\n\nCiao!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ss\\_RGB.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045521/http:/typophile.com/files/ss_RGB.jpg) | 197.7 KB |\n\n [‹ Comments on my logo?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045521/http:/typophile.com/node/46449 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help me refine this logo (for high end caterer). ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045521/http:/typophile.com/node/46931 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
