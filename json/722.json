  "content": "Hi everyone! I'm new in this forum, and I hope the discussions can seriously contribute for my projects.   \nAnyway, I'm attaching a sample of a new displays typeface (that don't have a name yet).   \nWhat I'm looking for, in the shape of these characters, is something innovative. Shapes unconventional, but still functional.   \nI'm a little worried about the letter \"A\" legibility. Maybe it's too much innovative.   \nWhat do you think?   \n   \nthanks a lot!   \nHaag ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140914183300im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/13301.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I would encourage you (if you question it) to develop alternates - why not retain the current glyphs (spectacular, by the way) and develop additional characters with more information and uniformity?   \n   \nAllow me to elaborate: your strokes are meticulously consistent, save for the upswing in the H, downstroke on the R and the convention on the S. However, I find all of these characteristics to be appealing.   \n   \nIf you question it, design a more lexically complete group without \"missing\" pieces where the viewer would expect them to be.   \n   \nI wish you the very best with this project -   \n   \nNathan Williams   \nBaseline Fonts\n\n"

      "content": "Very nice Fabio. I am new to Typophile as well, and am amazed by the quality of the work (and people) that I have seen thus far. I just stumbled here by accident this morning but hope to contribute some thoughts and ideas.   \n   \nThe only letters that I seem to stumble across are the M, N and B. The M and N seem ordinary compared to the other letters. They don't have the same \"airy\" quality. Could they be broken somehow or do you think that would be awkward? The letter B seems sad to me. Could the center stroke mimic the letter E?   \n   \nAnyhow, keep up the good work!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Tom for your comments.   \nActually, they match with the suggestions from another typedesigner, my friend.   \nCharacters like N, M, S,... don't have the same expression as all the others. They need to be more opened and lighter.   \nAs you said, designing the center stroke more thin (like \"E\") is a solution. I'm working on it.   \nI agree with you that B is looking weird.   \n   \nI'm also amazed how this forum is a nice and helpfull resource for developing serious typefaces. Thanks for all of you.   \nFabio\n\n"
