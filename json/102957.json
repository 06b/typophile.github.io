I wanted to say thanks to Mark Simonson for his help with some technical questions with regarding to encoding, naming, etc. And a big thank you to Maximiliano Sproviero for letting me bounce glyph looks off of him, and for his fantastic suggestions for making the font.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRL\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Style\\_Typophile.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414235624/http:/typophile.com/files/Style_Typophile.png) | 68.66 KB |\n\n",
