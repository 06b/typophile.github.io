  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI recently purchased a Macbook Pro and went for the antiglare screen – unfortunately it only comes in high resolution (not Retina) and there was no way to scale up the UI elements without compromise of quality... I exchanged it for normal glossy screen.\n\nI'm looking for solutions to decrease glare and have read some reviews of various options; however I'm concerned about the loss of quality (blurriness, prismatic effect) with respect to doing type design.\n\nWhat are your experiences? Does a anti-glare film decrease the quality enough introduce problems – i.e. for proofing text and so on.\n\nThanks\n\n",

      "content": "I have a 15\" MacBook Pro with the optional antiglare screen and love it. The resolution makes UI elements smaller but for me it hasn't been a problem, but I suppose that can vary depending on the application you're using. But most folks these days seem to want a glossy screen as it has deeper blacks and other advantages.\n\nAs Mark says, controlling lighting and position can help. Also I've seen some folks buy (or make) a black screen hood to block overhead lights and side lights.\n\n"

      "content": "A laptop often gets used in environments with lighting outside your control, so to me a glossy screen is bad news. I have no personal long-term experience with anti-glare add-ons - that could be a good solution. The 17.3\" Dell Precision I've been looking at getting has a 1920×1080 matte display, and it's great.\n\nMost people want a glossy screen for the same reason they want a 16:9 aspect-ratio: they watch movies. Type design is sort of diametrically opposed to watching movies. :-)\n\nhhp\n\n"
