Sabine, the kids and I are off to the Côte d’Azur. I’ll be gone all week, starting from tomorrow Saturday, August 18 till Sunday, August 26th.\n\nAs usual, don’t mind the mess during my absence, and in the event of an emergency (spam, abuse, unidentified typeface) please contact the [Stewfmeister](http://web.archive.org/web/20080609231521/http:/www.typophile.com/user/103) or one of the other moderators.\n\nNow that I mention it — does everybody know who all the moderators are? Is there a need for a list or sumptin’? Maybe something to pick up when I’m back.\n\n [‹ Blackletter similar to ITC's Blackmoor](http://web.archive.org/web/20080609231521/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36490 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Top Chef logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080609231521/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36489 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
