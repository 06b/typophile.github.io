  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI'm creating some collateral material for a series of resorts. The parent company has a style guide that indicates using Avenir and New Aster. Since the pieces will be printed in the field and by people with no design experience I have to use MicroSoft Word and I am limited to the fonts bundled with that program. A buyout is occurring so perhaps in the future the parent company will purchase the needed fonts, however at the moment I am stuck and on a tight deadline. Would someone please point me in the direction of a good site that will help me compare and contrast typefaces so I can select a suitable replacement or even better can some of the Typophile experts make some suggestions? I would greatly appreciate your help.\n\nThank you,  \nK\n\n",
