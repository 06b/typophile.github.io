When i turn Ligatures on, the numerals will change to the standard ones (which i don’t want to happen, of course)  \nThis does not occur in InDesign CS2.

      "content": "I suspect that ...\n\nIt is a font problem.  \nThe (FLS) font's feature definition lacks (some of) the initial languagesystem statements. But in 'liga' (and possibly in 'smcp') however, certain lookups are registered for specific languages (e.g. 'DEU' and 'TRK'). This has the effect that after feature compilation only 'liga' (and possibly 'smcp') are registered e.g. for the German language ('DEU').  \nDefault numerals in the font are lining numerals.  \nWhile InDesign CS2 and earlier ignored script and language tags, InDesign CS3 does read them. If a user applies the German dictionary, InDesign CS3 will look for features registered for German and only find the 'liga' feature: as an effect, 'Ligatures' will work, but 'Proportional Oldstyle' numerals won't have any effect, hence the (default) lining numerals.\n\nSolution:\n\nAdam Twardoch described what to do:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/17787](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616053156/http:/typophile.com/node/17787)  \n(See the three \"discussion\" links, especially the [AFDKO thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616053156/http:/typophile.com/node/28277#comment-160533)!)\n\nA must-read is this:  \nChristopher Slye's presentation for the ATypI Lisbon Conference.

You can ignore this, but you need to run the generated .otf fonts through Adam Twardoch's Fix DFLT Script Tag script which can be downloaded here:  \n [http://www.silesian.com/software/FixDFLTScriptTagSL.zip](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616053156/http:/www.silesian.com/software/FixDFLTScriptTagSL.zip \"http://www.silesian.com/software/FixDFLTScriptTagSL.zip\")  \n(Requires TTX, see the README.TXT.)\n\n[My impression is that there are many fonts out there which share the defect described above.]\n\nKarsten\n\n"

This is not any limitation of FontLab Studio, simply a prerequisite of the format. FontLab Studio does not do it magically for you, but it does not automatically generate any OpenType code either (except the example code for Type 1 Standard-encoded fonts, but that is Latin only, anyway).\n\nAlso, I'd like to point out that there is no \\*obligation\\* whatsoever to include the DFLT script tag in OpenType fonts. Adobe does this in their newest fonts but did not in the older fonts, and Microsoft does not use the DFLT script tag at all (and as far as I can tell, they have no intention to).\n\nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "Nick,\n\ni am also quite ignorant of the Python thing, but after reading the ’CommandLineHowTo.pdf’i managed to get a step further. Important is the following procedure as described in the PDF:\n\nTo change the prompt, you need to edit an obscure file that sets parameters for the Terminal program when it starts up. Unfortunately, the way the Terminal program works depends on which Unix command line program it is setup to use. There are several, and each one uses a different name for its startup file, and requires a different line of text added to change the prompt. To see which one you have, under the Terminal menu option, choose “Preferences…”, and note the line of text in the top text field.  \nProgram name Startup file name Line to add  \ncsh .cshrc set prompt=\"%c$ \"  \ntcsh .cshrc set prompt=\"%c$ \"  \nsh .profile PS1='\\W $ '  \nzsh .profile PS1='\\W $ '  \nbash .bash\\_profile PS1='\\W $ '\n\nNotes: the quotes need to be included, and must be either both single or both double quotes. For sh, zsh, and bash, there must be no spaces on either side of the equals sign. You can use any character string you want for the final prompt characters instead of \"$ \". I like to have a space at the end of the prompt.  \nLook in your home directory. Unfortunately, files that begin with a period are hidden in the Finder.  \nTo make them visible, open a Terminal window and type the following command:  \ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE  \nClose all Finder windows, switch to another program, and then switch back to the Finder, and you will be able to see the hidden files. To hide the files once you are done, enter the command line:  \ndefaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE  \nIf there is no file with the name you need, use a text editor to create it. Add the appropriate line (right column), and save it in your home directory. Close the Terminal window and open a new one.  \nNow the prompt should just show your current directory and a dollar sign, rather than the full path to the current directory.\n\nAfter creating a file .bash\\_profile/PS1='\\W $ ' i was able to install AFDKO and it appears in FontLab’s Menue Tools/External Tools.  \nHope that helps a bit.\n\n"

The `languagesystem` declarations apply to all features EXCEPT those that have explicitly defined `script` and `language` declarations inside of feature definitions. In other words, the `languagesystem` list sets up the rules for all features while `script` and `language` set up exceptions for single features.\n\nIf your font only contains text letters from the Latin alphabet plus analphabetics, and it does not use any language exceptions, then you can omit the `languagesystem` declaration. If you use any exceptions (e.g. for Turkish f-ligatures) or if your font has Cyrillic or Greek text letters (or letters from other scripts), then you have to specify all necessary `languagesystem` entries. Otherwise, your font won't work properly in InDesign CS3 (although it may have worked OK in InDesign CS and CS2).\n\nAdam\n\n"

Therefore, I'm not going to set those characters!\" or some such?\n\nWe don't use language tags, period. But we do occasionally set text with some Greek and Cyrillic.

I was puzzled because Python scripts and Robofab were already working fine for me, but the hitch turned out to be some duplicated references and resorting the sequence of the PATH statement. (Seems a Perl interpreter installation scrambled a few registry entries too that I hadn't noticed. _Grrrr._ I have given myself an appropriate dopeslap for overlooking that potential earlier.)\n\nSo, in sum: Thanks again for I am once again \"a happy camper,\" so to speak.

      "content": "Charles & others,\n\nthe OpenType specification prescribes that the text is dissected into \"runs\", i.e. portions that contain characters in a certain script (writing system, alphabet). OpenType Layout features are always registered in specific scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew etc., there is also a more recent \"default script\" registered by Adobe).\n\nThe mechanism has been described by John Hudson in his seminal article \"Windows Glyph Processing: an OpenType Primer\" as early as seven years ago. It is the first article mentioned in the \"Developing fonts\" section on the Microsoft Typography website, so it's hard to think of a more prominent placement -- see [1].\n\nIn a complete implementation of OpenType Layout, the features registered under the Latin script are applied to Latin letters, the features registered under the Cyrillic script are applied to Cyrillic letters etc. For non-alphabetic characters, the features that are applied to them need to be registered under all scripts that the font supports. In addition, they may be registered under the DFLT script so e.g. oldstyle numbers of a certain font can be used with Arabic text even though the font does not support Arabic.\n\nMicrosoft Uniscribe is a quite complete implementation of OpenType Layout, and has been for many years. In Windows Notepad, if complex script processing is enabled on the system, certain OpenType Layout features are applied by default to scripts such as Latin, Cyrillic or Greek (ccmp, liga, clig, mark, mkmk, kern -- see [2] -- also also calt). Cyrillic ligatures will be applied only if they are registered under the cyrl script.\n\nAdobe InDesign CS3 is also a quite complete implementation of OpenType Layout, and follows the same principles. Unlike Uniscribe, it does not offer support for complex scripts, but on the other hand it offers support for non-default languages for the standard scripts (e.g. you can use the Turkish language exclusions for the Latin script), something that Uniscribe only offers in theory (as there are no Microsoft applications that use that for the standard scripts).\n\nAdobe InDesign CS2 and earlier versions had a SIMPLISTIC implementation of OpenType Layout, which did not dissect the text into runs but instead, it blindly applied OpenType Layout features registered to the Latin script on all text, regardless of the actual script of the text. It was unfortunate that Adobe chose this path at the beginning, but this problem has been discussed frequently on Typophile as well as on the OpenType list. Another side-effect of Adobe's simplification policy was that if you don't specify any languagesystems (i.e. scripts and optionally languages) for the OpenType font in the AFDKO feature syntax (used by AFDKO, FontLab Studio and DTL FontMaster), all features will be by default registered under Latin script, default language. This is explicitly specified -- see [3] -- but I guess some people have implied from this that they don't need to worry about languagesystems at all. Well, actually, they DO, if their fonts have any alphabetic characters from scripts other than Latin (I say \"alphabetic characters\" because there are many fonts that don't have real Greek alphabetic characters but have a handful of Greek symbols -- these do not fall under the considerations described here as they are treated as \"common script\" analphabetics).\n\nSo, if an OpenType font has Cyrillic or Greek letters but its OpenType Layout code registered the features only in the Latin script, then the basic functionality of the font will still work (e.g. you will be able to type letters) but no OpenType Layout features will work (not even kerning).\n\nThere are OpenType font technology consultants out there (wink wink ;) ) who are able to help you out in details, you know.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n[1] [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/DevArticles.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616053156/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/DevArticles.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/DevArticles.mspx\")  \n[2] [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/intro.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616053156/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/intro.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/intro.mspx\")  \n[3] [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic\\_feature\\_file\\_syntax.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616053156/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic\\_feature\\_file\\_syntax.html\")\n\n"
