I don't think it was made clear in the book whether the device had merely one staff or was capable of producing both a treble and bass cleff or any other configuration of 2 staves. With a single staff only....it is quite possible that it would still be wavy like the exerpt you posted.....but alas....where to purchase such a device........\n\n"

However - the main reason for this idea is more of a compositional process that Robert Craft's book inspired when he went on to describe the methods Stravinsky had come to employ in the later serial phase of his life(serial meaning he had left his neo-classical period and embraced(albeit in his own inimitable way)the philosophy of the second viennese school(namely Schoenberg and his 2 disciples Alban Berg and my favourite - Anton von Webern)....at this point in time Stravinsky began to employ a method of composition involving blank paper that he could write ideas on and merely put staves whereever he neede to accompany ideas....a rather organic process...which appeals to me.....Chris....yeah i have loads of staff paper...i have even created several documents of custom staff paper in illy.....however it is more a question of trying to create a more organic process...plus lots of staff paper is printed on low quality paper that evaporates under the eraser of my obssesive/compulsive editing.....thanks for the ideas and tips....\n\n"
