And yes, you can remove liguistic implications (by this do you actually mean phonetic associations?) from letterforms, but it takes training both eye and mind.\n\nBTW — your “fixing up BRB” on your web site is refreshing.\n\n————————————————————————-  \nYes, I’m old, but I’ll be right back!\n\n"

      "content": "apologies if i glaze over some thoughts, ive been going over this for a while.\n\nok so when you look at a letter A, you will only see it as a letter A, whether it’s being used in text or as a design elements. you’ll still understand that what you’re looking at is a letterform. the only kink in that is adding dimension, texture, etc. to the shape. like for example, looking at a 3-dimensional A from the top.\n\nalso, i guess i should add the relevance ie. why i’m even asking.\n\nour capacity to read letterforms has flourished through the inundation of messages we receive and the proliferation of typefaces that challenge traditional letterform shapes. im not saying they all look good or anything, but our understanding of these shapes has been enriched. even with things like “wheel of fortune” we seek out letterforms. seeing a bunch of sticks on the ground and thinking “that looks like a K.” we’re just raised to search for messages.\n\nthis all leads to a broader range within which we can deliver meaning and distress type and still create clear messages.\n\nat what point do these letterforms cease to retain their linguistic value? i believe this only occurs when elements are added to the basic shape of what defines letterforms.\n\n"

Let me re-phrase what you have written & see if I get you here. You are saying that - there is a degree to which all ’a’s are ’a’s and that may be more or less (& maybe more or less depending on the reader?) You are also saying that in general we are expanding our willingness to see an ’a’ over time due to exposure to increasingly less ’a’-like ’a’ shapes. You are also saying that there is a point at which the ’a’ stops being recognized as such. It ceases to be a recognized as a letter.\n\n\\> i believe this only occurs when elements are added to the basic shape of what defines letterforms.\n\nYou are saying this happens when too many features of ’a’ ness are lost. This might be degenration, fading, etc - or it might be an extreme design which has failed.\n\nThis is your example of ’looking at a letter “A” and thinking “i dont get it.” ’. As in ’I don’t see a letter there’.\n\nIf this is what you are talking about it is a sort opposite end of what has been a topic around here recently - readability. You are talking about the moment when type becomes unreadable.\n\n"

      "content": "eben -\n\nyes, the degree of A-ness changes, but stays within the “threshold of semiosis” which i’m citing from an article in zed issue 4. on one end there is no doubt at what is presented and the other shows extreme doubt. our abilities to read letterforms that may lean toward the extreme end are improving with the way we presented messages, or even in some cases our need to seek out messages where they appear to be leacking.\n\ni’m working on being more articulate with my thoughts (thankfully i have an editor and topic consultant to help with much of that) but youve got it. any references or other thoughts would great. i’ve been reading alot on semiotics and other theory-related texts, and also looking for designers whose typefaces fit within the realm of this thesis. ji lee and his “univers revolved” and faces by fere-jones are getting alot of talk in my paper. even some of the work over at typeworkshops.com is worth mentioning, anton beeke, dainippon, some of the stuff fuse did, are all references on current examples running along that threshold.\n\noh and also, i’m basing the notion of what makes a letterform on frutiger’s “skeleton” of a letter, but expanding it to reference the white space around a letter as also defining it’s shape. so i’m calling it a “soul.”\n\nadditionally, a letter is defined semiotically not just by its shape or the spoken letter it represents, but the other letters it is NOT. so an A is an A because it is not a B or a Z etc. even further, the A may not exist if there is no B or Z etc. the latter notion is really taken into consideration when looking at typefaces that are pretty hard to discern, but when you see them in context, the forms make more sense.\n\n"

Are you also looking at perceptions of the symbols/ characters of unfamiliar languages? There are some type designers who will not design type for a language they do not read/write. Perhaps this is because of that relationship which you are exploring, connecting even further the relationship between the form/content of type and written language...\n\nI think you’ll enjoy David Sacks’ “Language Visible: Unraveling the Mystery of the Alphabet from A to Z”. it’s not very academic, but it gives an interesting historical perspective on the alphabet.\n\nI’d also be interesting in reading/seeing your thesis if you want some more feedback...i have some [recent] experience in that...\n\ngood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "eben and amy p,\n\ni’m still pretty early in the thesis process, but this topic came about from a discussion with a faculty member here at SCAD. i dont recall the whole conversation, but at one point we argued over seeing a letterform as a shape and not as a letter. i’m not arguing against type being used as design elements, but even then, a reader will see it as a letterform being used as a design element. i just dont see it as possible to look at a letterform and not recognize it as such. yes, i plan to only deal with the latin alphabet, as much of this defined culturally. i wouldnt recognize japanese characters if i saw them. i may recognize it as some form of language, but i could be fooled pretty easily on that.\n\ni realize this has been discussed in varying degrees, but discussing type semiotically is so interesting to me. but its also the hard part since so much has been said already. please let me know if you have suggestions in thinking i should take the thesis in another direction, based on that conversation i had.\n\ni would love to keep you all up to date on the progress including visuals once their developed, and also would apreciate any feedback along the way.\n\nthanks for all the reference suggestions, i’ve made notes on them all and am checking them out.\n\n"
