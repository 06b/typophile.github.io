Again, a quick and dirty encode. You’ll almost be able to smell the roses in that vase next to him on the actual DVD...\n\nCheers!\n\n-Gary\n\n [‹ Khatt, kufi & kaffiya \\> Who is attending?](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024014734/http:/typophile.com/node/36253 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Looking for hedera/aldus leaf... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024014734/http:/typophile.com/node/36236 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

However, the typeface could have come out more legible while still adhering to the 90° and 45° concept had he stuck to the basic forms. It seems like he was taking a chance at creating something revolutionary and experimental rather than really solving the problem.\n\nThanks Gary. Can’t wait for the DVD! Already pre-ordered.\n\n"

The introduction of such an alphabet requires an adaptation of men. It would be more logical to adapt the machine.\n\nMachines exist. They have been contructed by technicians, whose primary aim was to achieve a very fast composing machine. This was their concern.\n\nLetters are my concern. Letters, as elements of words and sentences, are used to communicate. Such communication must be as clear as possible, whatever the shape of the letters. This is the main criterion.\n\nAn adaptation of old letterforms, to the new techniques and the old reading habits, is in my opinion the most reasonable solution. I wish to remain as close as possible to the old letterforms, owing to the fact that these have the most readability.\n\nI reject reproduction of old letterforms by new machines. The retangular pattern creates too great a disfiguration. When a Garamond face is used, the printed result is no longer recognizable as a Garamond. By doing so, the control of quality is lost, because the end result differs too greatly from the original. Too many of the finer points are lost.\n\nIt will be necessary to invent new refinements for the old forms which can be faithfully reproduced by the new machines.”\n\n"

Something more resembling an ’a’ is obviously possible even with only 90 and 45 degree angles. Unger’s solution seems more logical in my opinion. But maybe if Crouwel had designed something that ’normal’, it might not have been in the spotlights as much or be as interesting as it was now.\n\n"
