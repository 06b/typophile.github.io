  "content": "Hello everyone, i'm in need of some help.\n\nI am designing a logo for a friend of mine that started an educational consulting firm. The original name was Arise! Talitha Koum (which I thought was too long but...) the 2nd half is Hebrew and refers to a girl of 12 which held special meaning to her. She gave in and has finally changed her original name to Arise Educational Consulting, Inc.\n\nThe variations I attached were based on what she wanted originally, which was uplifting hands that signified strength in the colors green and/or brown.\n\nI'm looking for a font that would signify excellence and strength without being too overpowering (if that is possible) because she writes curriculums and training plans for schools and businesses.\n\nCritique on the ideas/direction are welcome, no matter how brutal. I appreciate honesty and i'm a bit new to the logo design thing. Thanks in advance for any insight.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [arise.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018050455/http:/typophile.com/files/arise.jpg) | 49.79 KB |\n\n",
