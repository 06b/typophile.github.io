  "content": "Houschka Rounded is released this week.\n\nIt is very comprehensive with multi-lingual coverage, featuring a standard character set, contextual and stylistic alternates, lining and old-style numbers, both proportional and tabular, small caps, and 3 extra stylistic sets (as shown on the pdf).\n\nHouschka Rounded has six weights ranging from a very thin Thin to Extra Bold.\n\nThe Thin style may be the thinnest rounded (terminals) font ever! Magnify the 5-spread pdf and have a look.\n\n[Houschka Rounded](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015212931/http:/www.type.co.uk/pdfpreview/F007329.pdf)\n\n",
