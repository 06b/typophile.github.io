I did ask the company if they knew what font was used and unfortunately they do not know.\n\nIdentifying factors (just to name a few) is the roundness of the “o”, the length of the “p’s” descender (which of course could of be manipulated), the squareness of the “p’s” slab on the bottom, and the round points and serifs of the “c” and “e”. I do not think the font is actually an outline font just made to look like one.\n\nThanks a bunch for any suggestions in advance,\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [COPE.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023163148/http:/typophile.com/files/COPE.gif) | 4.96 KB |\n\n [‹ maybe morris sans, any other suggestions?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023163148/http:/typophile.com/node/50769 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [yoigo type? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023163148/http:/typophile.com/node/50736 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
