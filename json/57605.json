My notes show a QBF font called [Nachtwache](http://web.archive.org/web/20090505173751/http:/www.qbf.de/dceng.htm) is a version of this. I think there are others with spelling variations on Rubens, like Rueben, or such. Mike F. probably has a list of them. We may have explored this topic before.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
