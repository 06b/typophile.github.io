  "content": "Hi, Type ID-Detectives,\n\nI really like the way the three typefaces work together (i.e. the sans, the serif & the slab), but I am frustrated by inability to identify ‘em due to a misplaced Rockledge and, perhaps, a lack of zeal due to a current bout of brochonitis. Would y’all be so kind and help out this uffering b-tard? Thanx, Geo.\n\nThe serif looks look a Bodoni, but I don’t believe it is.  \nThe slab looks loike a variation on Egyptianne but it isn’t.  \nAnd, the cap ” R ” in the sans is really throwing my weezing and conjested brain for a loop.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/type_3906.samples.jpg)\n\n",
