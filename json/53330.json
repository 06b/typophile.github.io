  "content": "Hello fellow Typophiles!\n\nMy name is Scott, and I'm a Senior design student at Ohio University. I have been working on a bunch of geometric typefaces for my thesis project and have decided to put them out in the public.\n\nThese typefaces are based on my studies of modernism and constructivism respectively (largely based on the writing of Jan Tschichold and the Stenberg brothers). I'm starting with strict geometric designs, and developing the glyphs into a more legible forms.\n\ncheck 'em out!\n\n[http://www.1919type.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416205952/http:/www.1919type.com/ \"http://www.1919type.com\")\n\nthanks!\n\n",
