  "content": "Looking for alternatives to DIN that can be purchased in Open Type format and include an italics version for all weights. I have found DIN versions that meet both requirements but I was hoping to find another font with its own unique touch yet similar in form and style. While I love DIN I find it being used everywhere and it has grown somewhat old on both our design and editorial staff thus the search for a fresh alternative. Thanks.\n\n",
