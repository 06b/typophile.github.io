  "content": "I posted a little while ago about my salon logo. I finally decided on a logo and had it refined.  \nHowever, a friend mentioned a few things about the logo that were 'off' that I hadn't even noticed.  \nMy area is undergoing a revitalization of midcentury modern buildings. The area is starting to have a downtown lofty feeling.  \nThe salon is modern..clean lines. Fairly simple. No fluff. I wanted it to appear unisex..not girly or flowery like some salons. I have a full clientelle- not looking for clients but I plan on hiring two stylists and hoped the salon would appeal to variety of people.  \nThis is getting wordy. I don't want a \"bunch of blue haired shampoo set\" people working there..  \nphotos of the salon if you're interested - [http://share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=9AZMWrZw3asWu](http://web.archive.org/web/20101009171524/http:/share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=9AZMWrZw3asWu \"http://share.shutterfly.com/action/welcome?sid=9AZMWrZw3asWu\")\n\nThe logo-\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101009171524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/png_4759.png)\n  \nThe logo is on a black background \\*\\*\\*only because I have dark windows and they kept giving me black lettering\\*\\*\\*\\* My sign guy said he could extract the logo from the black background since it really isn't part of the logo. The windows aren't black anyway, just dark.\n\nShe suggested stacking the words..since there is no heirarchy- ? I want people to know the name of the salon but I also want them to be driving by and go \"oh a salon\".  \nI wish I would have had her do the logo but she's so busy..\n\nI used an online company for the logo. It was a horrible experience - not sure I can mention the name here but it wasn't ebay. Local companies were out of my price range..maybe because it's Scottsdale. And by that I mean over 1500.00. NOT that they aren't worth it and good for them because they are obviously getting it. I just couldn't swing that.\n\nSo- having said all that- you won't hurt my feelings if you tear it apart...much. :)\n\n",

Often, the actual cost of designing the logo is the lesser cost.\n\nThe logo is OK, I guess. Two letters smashed together in a not entirely bad way. The type underneath doesn't seem terribly 'salonesque' though and appears to be more of a random typeface just slapped on there. The type, itself is also very small in proportion to the mark, so you might want to rethink the scale there for use in print.\n\n"

I understand your desire for minimalism, and in this case, some tasteful interior elements would not detract from, but augment that ideal.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you have any questions about how to capitalize on the brand you have started to establish.\n\nIf you have access to editing software or know another designer that has access to the comments on this forum, it might be a good idea to contact them once you have received final files from \"the-online-company-who-cannot-be-named-but-has\" for any additional work.

      "content": "As far as the overall feel - I think you are hitting it. Simple and clean on black is very upscale salon looking. As far as the naming goes Have you thought about something a little more concise. Many salons that are hip trendy have simple one word names (we have one here called hotlocks for instance) But you could go even ironic - something like flirt or stomp that has an attitude quality. I wouldn't even have all that descriptor going on everywhere. I would assume that if you are like most high end salons 75% at least of your business is word of mouth referrals. Therefore being too over the top with signage isn't going to do you good (stay away from the FAUX NAGLE CLIP ART!!!! ARGH!). Instead use the sign to set the tone of what you are trying to accomplish from a brand standpoint. Tying your salon name to a location (ie downtown) makes it difficult if you ever wantto move/expand.The mark itself is what it is - two squished letters which can work in a pinch. My thoughts with salon and beauty marks is can you see a guy named Sven wearing the logo on a crisp black t-shirt as he gives you a color rinse (think Vidal Sassoon). I actually did a brand with a similar feel for a plastic surgeon (called IMAAGE - [www.myimaage.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20101009171524/http:/www.myimaage.com/ \"www.myimaage.com\")). On the typeography I would pick one word to play up more than the others. I would at least remove the SCOTTSDALE from the name. If you want to really get the hip upscale urban feel what about metro?\n\n"

      "content": "Hughfire-  \nMy licenses and advertisements (yellow page)ad are all under \"downtown...\" I've been in the downtown scottsdale area since 1990. I don't plan on moving anytime soon but I did consider that when I chose the name. We're on Miller Rd and I thought perhaps I would just name the salon with Miller in the name. Too specific though even if I decided to stay in the downtown area.\n\nWe were \"Nails,Etc\" (purchased a salon that we worked in) and kept that name forever. We did nails and some tanning but no hair. My business partner moved out of town in January and I kept the space, totally remodeled and added hair stations. I knew that hair people wouldn't want to work at a \"nails,etc\". Frankly, no one likes to be \"etc\". So I chose Scottsdale Salon - which was taken. Scottsdale Hair & Nails...and figured I would still answer the phone \"scottsdale salon\". It was approved by the city and state and then the State Board of Cosmetology said it was too close to Salon de Scottsdale and I needed to add something to it. I was there, doing the final paperwork so I made some quick phone calls and came up with the \"downtown\". My yellow page contracts were due and I had to renew my licenses with the new name so I was pretty much stuck.\n\nIt's an established salon and you're right about word of mouth..that's where most of our clients come from.  \nHonestly I thought that if I could get a cool enough logo, the long drawn out name wouldn't really matter. It would be just a formality...because of what we need on licenses and such.\n\nBtw, your imaage design is very cool. Also- love the name \"metro\"..but like I said..\n\nOur old name was horrible- or so I thought...as far as a coolness factor but for advertising- great. When people called information looking for a nail salon in scottsdale, ours was first to pop up. When a stylist is building a clientelle it's great for obtaining new clientelle.\n\nI have to admit, there are times when I think \"gah! I hate it all!\" and think about starting over. It's just been a long road with the remodel and then getting a decent logo has been an effin' nightmare. I've approved the final logo and now I have to go back and at the very least, make the changes that were mentioned on this forum.\n\nI had company for over a week and I was glad to live in complete denial of the whole mess...but now I have to get busy. This has been dragging on for 8 months.  \nI've put off hiring anyone or even placing an add to hire because I want the signage and branding done.  \nI wouldn't want to work in a salon that was half done so I don't expect anyone else would want to either.  \nSee? Here it comes...\"gah!....\"\n\nPerhaps it's more of a therapy issue than a logo issue...:)\n\nI appreciate all the comments and feedback. Thanks so much.\n\n"

Or are there different windows not pictured?\n\nUnless the bulk of the traffic passing by is pedestrian, I think the logo is too difficult to read from a car, even at slow parking lot speeds.

If it's a clean, modern, mid-twentieth century feel you're after, how about Futura or Neutraface--though surrounding business might go the same route.\n\nI do suggest talking to a legitimate designer.

I agree with Tiffany's earlier post that you should steer clear of a playful approach.\n\nIt seems to be heading in a more upmarket direction with your latest iteration - not quite sure about the skyline, but maybe if you picked a rich, solid colour and relied on the typography alone, it would give you the upmarket feel you were looking for - certainly the logotogogo or whatever that did the first logo missed the mark.\n\nIt was really great that you posted the photos because it gives a feel of your salon and it looks contemporary and upmarket from the interior alone - i think it looks almost European somehow, it seems nice and refined. Your logo is important because it has to sync with the environment it's got to work in.\n\nMaybe look at a sans-serif typeface that isn't so Art Deco - I'm not quite sure that the Art Deco fits with the image your salon portrays. It could be something as simple as Helvetica or DIN, or a condensed Akzidenz Grotesque. If you wanted something with more to it, slab serif such as Serifa might be a good way to go. I really think a more minimal approach would suit your salon. I wouldn't be afraid of a thin typeface - if you use it on its own as a wordmark, you could make the type larger. If you use really heavy weights of type, it could cheapen the look.\n\nSi\n\n"
