  "content": "Please help me identify this pretty serif logo font, used on the cover of a new graphic novel. It seems similar to both Garamond-like and Charlemagne-like fonts. Letter E resembles CharleMagne, Barry Gothic etc, but R is specific and unusual. I understand this logo may be created in a vector graphic editor, but there must be a font it's based on. I guess this ornamented O is more probably a product of graphic design, but may it be some decorative font too?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110319im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dragons%20Logo_3577.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Nicolas Cochin \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317110319/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
