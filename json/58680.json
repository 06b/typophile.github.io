  "content": "Hi there.\n\nIve basically convinced myself this logo is finished, but then again Ive only shown it to a few people so would appreciate any feedback you have.\n\nIts for a group-travel website/app.  \nThe \"Stormer\" in the title is reffering to \"brainstorming\" however I avoided using imagery that relates to brainstorming as its usually pretty cliche.\n\nSo have gone literal on it and used the tornado type of storm which Im pretty happy with.\n\nThe typeface is National.\n\nthanks for your time and feedback obviously welcome.  \nGeorge\n\n",

Try experimenting with the shape you have, take some tranparent paper and lay over your logo and sketch for a while. What I noticed in your logo was this interresting countershape. If you don't mind I removed the bottom swirl. It now looks a bit like the Ripcurl logo, but what I try to show is that you can take your shape somewhere else. It's not where you start but where you end up.
