While a daily or weekly font rotation is wonderful in theory, it would add a lot more work for our friends in the administration arena. The idea of having a sponsored typeface is to help generate revenue to keep this community going. I'm glad they've come up with ideas like this so we aren't subjected to zillions of Google ads and annoying ads from media farms.\n\nJust saying :)\n\n"

I don't exactly know what goes on under the hood, but I know a ton of work goes into programming and administering every aspect of this site and it's all a labor of love that we benefit from.\n\nI've personally grown fond of Super Duty and its strength in this application, as I did Beorcana before it - I would echo Eric's sentiments. I'm not sure that I would enjoy a constantly rotating font in all the headers. I mean, I love to see different fonts, but there is a certain comfort factor in coming to Typophile and seeing a consistent look over a period of time. I like the warm fuzziness and stability of it all.\n\nOf course I look forward to being pleasantly surprised when a new typeface is introduced here, but it will be a bit of a shock to the system.\n\nI don't know what the fees for featured faces are, but the folks at Typophile have mentioned this sponsorship program in multiple threads and said interested parties should email them. So that's what I would do.\n\n"
