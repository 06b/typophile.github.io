      "content": "Note the generally triangular serifs. This resembles a 19th century style then called Latin. Not certain if there is an exact digital match, but if there is one, our typophiles will probably find it for you. This is pretty close, a font from the Connor's Sons catalog of 1888 digitized as [Ysleta](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012085143/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/ysleta-nf/) by Nick Curtis. In this font the Latinate serifs are clipped in an angled style called Detroit or Mansard -- a refinement that may or may not be present in your samples. This version of the Latinate style was also known as [Aetna](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012085143/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/aetna/%3Cbr%20/%3E) or Painter's Gothic.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Don. These guys use it willy nilly so often and the funny little detailed roughness of the E is identical in both cases so much so that it makes me feel strongly this is a digital typeface somewhere. I've asked them but they are a small market and they don't know. They can't even point me to the people who did the work for them originally.\n\n"
