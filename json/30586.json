That said, I do feel lucky that I get to use metal in some of my work.)\n\nI have a copy of Zapf’s _Manuale Typographicum_ (the later, 1968 edition published with MIT Press) which is set in many dozens of different types. The Optima pages in this book have a kind of noble and magical radiance that I have never experienced in offset reproductions of the type, whether from VIP or 202 or later digital typesetting. Maybe the impression accentuates or highlights the subtle swellings of the strokes in some way. Whatever it is, the sure gives that type _presence_.\n\nOptima seems to garner more fierce pro and con statements than most designs. I can remember one of my favorite art directors in the 1980s talking about characteristics of the quintessential client from h\\*ll, and saying in tones of disgust: “Yeah, you know, the kind of person whose sister-in-law went to art school and she loves Optima!!”\n\n"

      "content": "I misspell my own name too :-)\n\nThe difference is that I don’t like the Roman Palatino either and feel the sans does not look a bit like it—maybe that is why it looks better to me. With the sans, there was a commitment to making it work as a sans. Optima just doesn’t fall enough either way to work for me. Beorcana does a much better job of it. It is more gutsy than Optima and looks like it should hold up well under text use.\n\nI don’t blame Zapf as much for the problems with Optima as I do the technology change. As noted by Muzz, it can work when set well in hot metal. When first translated to phototype, they must have just used the drawings uncorrected for photo and offset. I am sure Herman(n) worked from hot metal proofs to finalize his drawings and figured in inkspread in his design. When you take phototype (moreso with dirty lenses) you weaken the marginalness of Optima to begin with. Then you put it in front of a Robertson to shoot film and it degrades more. Next step, platemaking where someone gets heavyhanded with the rouge—add light ink on an offset press and bingo, the poor thing is dead. Pressman were trying to hold it from plugging and yet keep the color even. Ask an oldschool pressman running 6pt Optima on an old offset press how much fun it was (then ask him how printing a reverse was). Early digital type (and Optima was one of the first) didn’t remedy much if any. I am glad the Nova version has moved it towards the better.\n\nChrisL\n\nPS: I don’t know why LinoType named the sans version Palatino at all unless they were looking at it purel;y as a marketing thing to cash in on the name recognition of the roman original. They should have just named it Zapf Sans or some such thing.\n\n"

I look forward to seeing it used a lot.\n\nBut there is till a place for Optima, in my view. Beorcana is more gutsy, and will be better for many uses, but it’s hard to beat the elegance of line and proportion in Optima.\n\n"
