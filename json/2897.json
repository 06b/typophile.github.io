      "content": "Yes, Nick, that's it. So called because it is typically an en width. 1) There are two practical drawbacks to nut fractions: the numerator and denominator are typically smaller than in regular fractions, often too small for use at the littler sizes. For example, here is a comparison from Palatino Linotype:   \n ![Fraction comparison](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107053907im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/25200.gif)   \n2. There is easy way to make arbitrary fractions, because the bar has to stretch over the denominators. To do this sort of thing you need a mathematical layout tool, whereas regular fractions of any size can be fairly easily made, with the right components, in any page layout or word processing application. Nut fractions are only good for a limited number of 'standard' fractions.\n\n"
