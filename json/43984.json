  "content": "There are many variations of how the c in last names starting with \"Mc\" (like my own, McArthur) have been used in handwriting and in type. I have seen a raised c such that the top of the c lines up with the capital letters on either side of it, a raised c with a horizontal line under it, a raised c with two dots under it, a raised c with two horizontal lines under it (the way I was taught when I was little), and a raised c with a horizontal line under it and two dots under the line. The lines and dots seem to be most common in handwriting, but I have seen the c raised frequently in type, and have also seen it in type with underlines sometimes. Nowadays it is obviously common to use a normal lowercase c, with or without an apostrophe between the M and the c.\n\nDoes anybody know of any Unicode characters that would match any of the raised variants? Does anybody have some insight into which variant(s) may be most correct?\n\n",

      "content": "The Mc prefix comes from 'Mac' in Gaelic from Ireland (and later Scotland), Mac literally meaning 'son'. It is normally taken to mean 'son of' – Mac Arthur, for example, meaning Son of Arthur.\n\nBeing Irish, I have never seen Mc with an apostrophe between the two letters. I would say that the most correct way of writing it, taking its history into account, is simply 'Mc', without any dots, lines or otherwise.\n\nRoss\n\n"

It was done that way on the family business signage, and occasionally I have seen it with a little triangle instead. Never double underlines though.\n\nSince adopting the typewriter in 1970 as a cure for horrid handwriting and printing, and later the computer, I have given up on the raised c and let it slide back to the baseline. It does not bother me down there.\n\n"

If using an appropriate application that supports such things, you could use an OpenType font that has superiors or ordinals (and adjust their vertical position if needed).\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
