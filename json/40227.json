  "content": "I bought Fontographer in the 90s, did some type design, then moved on to other things, and haven’t touched FOG since. I want to get back into type design, so I’m wondering which makes more sense: upgrading to FOG 4.7 or getting TypeTool. Either option would cost me $99, and since it’s been so long since I’ve used FOG, I’m not concerned about having to re-learn anything by moving to TypeTool. I know FOG should have some more features than TT, but after looking at the product comparison chart, they look really equal (with TT ahead in some features).\n\nSince I’m more or less a beginner at this point, I don’t need super advanced features, and TT seems like a more modern program, and maybe a bit easier to use, and if I ever decided to upgrade to Fontlab, I’d already know how to use the program.\n\nAnyone have any recommendations?\n\nthanks!\n\nJonathan\n\n [‹ Try this, (if you're tough and daring)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907050204/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40618 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Kerning: Restore Exceptions? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907050204/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40552 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If I get TypeTool, I can always use my FOG serial number to upgrade to FontLab (since it’scheaper to upgrade to FL from FOG than TT).\n\nJames, what limitations of TT caused you to upgrade to FL? After reading the comparison charts, and trying out the demos, I still can’t quite tell what the limitations of TT and FOG are compared to each other.\n\nthanks!\n\nJonathan\n\n"

In that regard FOG has much more capability and is a far simpler program to use than either FontLab or TT. FOG can’t create fonts in the OT format but if that is necessary FOG databases can be ported over to TypeTool Pro or FontLab with FogLamp.\n\nGerald\n\n"

Lack of autotracing was a big problem, because what Livetrace generates is next to worthless for lettering, but Fontlab can be a huge timesaver when I want to build up a complex letter without using the pen tools. That might not matter to serious type designers who don’t trace, but I’m a student and have to cut corners when time is really tight. There were other things, but it’s been a few months and I can’t really remember them now.\n\nOn the upside, Fontlab will issue you a refund for Typetool to upgrade to Fontlab within three months of purchase. So you can always start with Typetool and upgrade later.\n\n"

If ones 90’s experience with FOG was pre-4.0, there is no current upgrade to what you were drawing with.

I just happened to be interested in doing a font, so I upgraded.\n\nAfter upgrading there were a few things that bugged me about the program, like not being able to cut and paste from Illustrator very well. Maybe I needed a newer version of Illustrator, but I couldn’t do a straight cut and paste into Fontographer. I also wanted the capability of making OpenType fonts. Lastly, I’m one of those very very rare people that spent years on Macs and got converted to the PC. I preferred to work in Windows, but the Fontographer upgrade was for Macs.\n\nSo, I upgraded to FontLab Studio and I’m really pleased with it.\n\n"
