These are now available and can be downloaded, with link code, from   \n   \n [http://www.atypi.org/40\\_conferences/28\\_Vancouver/48\\_promotion](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017231016/http:/www.atypi.org/40_conferences/28_Vancouver/48_promotion)   \n   \nThere are four graphics: a banner ad, and three narrower ads of different sizes. If you want to help promote the conference in this way, please download the image or images that you want to use and serve them from your own web account, rather than linking directly to the images on the ATypI server.   \n   \nIf you would like to help promote the conference in other ways and are able to offer print media space or distribution, please contact Cynthia at the ATypI secretariat \\< [secretariat@atypi.org](mailto:secretariat@atypi.org)\\>.   \n   \nMany thanks to everyone who helps to make this conference a great success.   \n   \nJohn Hudson   \nATypI 2003 programme planning committee   \n [www.atypi.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017231016/http:/www.atypi.org/)\n\n",
