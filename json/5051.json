  "content": "Hey,   \n   \nI was also curious if anyone knew the names of the two fonts that are used on the West Coast Choppers iron cross logo. I believe that the one used for 'Choppers' is a variation of IRONWORK, but I'm not for certain. Here's a link to the logo:   \n   \n [http://www.marzdistribution.com/images/WCC\\_LOGO.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055151/http:/www.marzdistribution.com/images/WCC_LOGO.jpg)   \n   \nIf you happen to know the names &/or where I can obtain the fonts, I'd be very happy. Thanks & have a beautiful day.   \n   \nKevo\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Classic cadillac logo - custom &#40;similar to English 157&#41; {Mark S, Patricia}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055151/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5050 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; The Last Waltz - customized Caslon {Chesh} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055151/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5047 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
