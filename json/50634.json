  "content": "Hi all, first time here. Very impress with all the critiques here. You guys provided great constructive criticisms. It prompted me to post a current project that I'm in a bit of a stand still. I'm currently updating a company logo, the old one seem very out dated. The company provides medical & dental insurance so we can't really go wild on this one. It needs to be a bit conservative. Anyway, here are the various logos I came up with, I would be very appreciated if I can get any feedback to further improve the logo. Thanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021121038im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logos_4134.gif)\n\n",

Maybe a 0,20,100,0 (CMYK) would be even more \"golden\"... Otherwise they are becoming too complicated in comparison to the original one.\n\nFirst step I'd do is I'd try to find a sans serif font to replace in the original logo that would go best with the star in hexagon.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

The tagline as is is SOOO unnecessary... reminds me of 'best little whorehouse in Texas.' Comparisons are odious.\n\nI'm thinking I'd like to see a nice typographic treatment of the word 'Best' inside the the hexagon (the one you've done for 'BL' is quite handsome) and then finish off with 'Life' in grey outside the hexagon (either to the right or below).\n\nThe tagline SHOULD say something... other than what you've already said:\n\n'BEST life and health insurance for the 21st century'\n\n(not sure it needs 'life and health')\n\n"

Maybe I should try putting \"Life\" in all caps also...just like the old logo to balance it out a bit.\n\nChazglen, funny you mention putting the word \"BEST\" inside the hexagon cause that is how the original BEST life logo was created in the 70s. I did tried to update that also.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021121038im_/http:/typophile.com/files/oldBest_4353.jpg)\n\nThanks again everyone...I will take all your feedback & rework the design a bit.\n\n"

I's still consult the client whether it's possible to change it to Life and Health Insurance, because logo already reads \"Best life\" and company really is one thing too many.\n\nAnyway. I'd try larger tag type that will probably span more than 1 line. I think your logo will look much better this way and you will also eliminate small size problems.\n\nSince logos should normally evolve I'd suggest you stay with #1 and refine it.\n\nYou'll also have to do something about the star cut because you created a very thin line that may look as an error and it will probably create more bad than good.\n\nCarry on.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
