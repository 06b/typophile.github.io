(If there are others, they haven't   \nlet us know.)   \n   \nI like this, however it performs much better   \nin limited quantities (e.g. for navigation or   \nheaders) versus the way you show it on your   \nsite as body text.   \n   \nYou may have success including a   \nsample on your site at 2x or even 3x scale. I   \nknow Matthew Bardram has had success with   \nhis bitmap fonts selling as display faces for   \nprint.   \n   \nGood luck with it.\n\n"
