After all his url's in the listserv link you posted.\n\nOther people who might be able to help;\n\n[http://www.stbride.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013052417/http:/www.stbride.org/ \"http://www.stbride.org/\")\n\nI take it you're aware of Catherine Dixon's 2002 St Brides conference address? It was about type classification.\n\nThe other thing that comes to mind in this context is the Wynkyn de Worde Society.\n\nYou could probably look up Vox on both the wikipedia and the French library system.\n\nBTW, Gerard and Francis are spelt M e ynell.\n\n"
