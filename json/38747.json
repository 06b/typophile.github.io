  "content": "Greetings! I am new to this site, and am glad it popped up in a search for “rules of typography.”\n\nA newspaper from my hometown has now designed their online obituaries with the person’s name set in a large, bold, sans-serif font in RED. I am aggrevated every time I read that page, and have decided that the reason goes way back to the “rule” that one never uses red type when designing for doctors, dentists, medical things, etc. The page may be viewed at:\n\n[http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=167&TM=53335.12](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145301/http:/www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=167&TM=53335.12 \"http://www.dcourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=167&TM=53335.12\")\n\nI’d like feedback on this issue, please. I appreciate it.\n\n [‹ Suitable fonts For Ladies Nite](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145301/http:/typophile.com/node/38883 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Complimentary body font for Eurostile ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080126145301/http:/typophile.com/node/38676 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Especially in this brutish, bold Verdana style.  \nBut what to do – changing the font color for ALL links is the possibility or remain “red”. Otherwise it’s not a good usability, if you just change font color for the medical field on this site.\n\nEdit: panpainter posted nearly the same at the time i wrote this.\n\n"

I remember being told by other children that writing a name in red meant that person would die.\n\nI’ve heard the actual reason for this taboo is that the First Emperor of China reserved the right to have one’s name written in red for himself and had anyone else who dared to write one’s name in red ink put to death.\n\n"
