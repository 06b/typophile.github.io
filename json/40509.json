I really despise the FHWA Standard Typeface, but used here it looks awesome, and the C is very circular without giving the modernist or Futura-esque feel.\n\nI believe it is FHWA Standard Series E.\n\n(Sorry for the iStockphoto, haha)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140328103406im_/http:/typophile.com/files/1_6094.jpg)\n\n"
