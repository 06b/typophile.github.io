      "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm a student too and I'll try to give you my honest and humble opinion.\n\nThe first thing that came into my mind (and I know it's really odd) was the Mettallica lettering, specially K, N, R, Z, Y, Z... Don't ask me why but it reminds me, with a bold modern look.  \n I think it's still inconsistent. You should work it better specially on details, and structure, like, why does the B doesn't have counterform? Why the Q's and O's counterform is smaller than C's and G's? And there's more, but I'm afraid to sound annoying and too boring.\n\nI'm working on a font too, that it's kinda \"similar\" to this of yours.  \n If you want to share opinions more properly give-me your e-mail and I'll send you mine, as I don't want to show it off \"typophile forum scale\" if you know what I mean :).\n\nPlus you should make some test prints with various sizes and with real phrases or words, to get a notion of how it works on real, specific applications, that you should decide to. I assume it's meant to be a poster application?..\n\nRegards, and good work!  \n João\n\n"

      "content": "Hi, Peter\n\n/R/ I think it could take a hint from /B/.  \n/F/ has an overbite problem.  \n/J/ Does it need a flat bottom? The /U/ isn't flat.  \n/M/ and /W/ both seem naked without those extra notches.  \nThe counter could be more uniform. No?  \n/4/ seems a tad wide, same for /5/ and /2/.  \nCould the /1/ have a notch or something. Hmm. Maybe?  \nWhy no counters on /4/, /6/, /8/, /9/, and /0/?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks,\n\nThis is gonna be for a poster, business card, letterhead, website and for my own logo.\n\nAlready did some print tests, works fine as a logo on a business card, the counter on the /O/ was almost gone so it makes sense making it bigger.\n\nGonna keep the counters out of the numbers for now, I kinda like it like that and it helps to seperate the zero and /O/. The counters look fine on /4/, /6/, /9/ and /0/ but not on the /8/, to me it makes more sense to leave them all out.\n\nI noticed the overbite issue on /F/ but I think it's a cool /F/, tried some variations but nothing decent came out of it.\n\nMade some changes trying to make it more consistent.\n\nMade changes to /C/, /B/, /E/, /G/, /J/, /M/, /O/, /Q/, /W/, /3/ and /8/.\n\nRight now when I'm looking at the letter the /B/ looks odd to me.\n\nLet me know what you think,  \nPeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416041555im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile2_3415.jpg)\n\n"

It should be equal in my opinion.\n\nRegarding the name is such a difficult task since there's a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot of fonts over the internet. Since you're Finnish (?) I suggest that you name it with a Finnish name.\n\nCheers  \nJoão\n\n"

      "content": "Some more updates.\n\nThe R was thinner then all the other characters for some reason so I fixed that. I like my F so I'm not gonna change it yet. Also added a cut on the U. The B looks wierd when the upper counter is the same thickness.\n\nDecided to go with the name Fatman. Added a extra character ( a bomb). Fatman was the name of one of the nuclear bombs that America dropped on Japan in WWII. Also made a poster for the final assesment in my type design class.\n\nStill gonna work some more on it and make it into a proper font with more special characters.\n\nSo if you have any more feedback to give, please do.  \nPeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416041555im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile4_3720.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416041555im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile6_3534.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Hej Peter,\n\nYour font is coming nicely along. Nice to see the notch in the letter U. For what it's worth, the J strikes me as much too skinny; L is a bit small, too. I'd also encourage you to consider balancing the R a little more (smaller bowl, bigger leg) and adding notches or something to the F. The word \"FATMAN\" in your graphics above is more or less illegible at that size. Other than that, nice work.\n\nIn case it hasn't already come to your attention, there are already several fonts named Fatman out there:\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/atype/fatman/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416041555/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/atype/fatman/)  \n [http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/SearchPage.htm?kid=Los%20Alamos%20Pro%20Fat%20Man](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416041555/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/SearchPage.htm?kid=Los%20Alamos%20Pro%20Fat%20Man)  \n [http://www.searchfreefonts.com/free/fatman.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416041555/http:/www.searchfreefonts.com/free/fatman.htm)\n\nYou could add yours to the list, but on the other hand you might consider a name that hasn't already been used... \"Ginormity\"? \"Humongous\"? \"Larger Than Life\"?\n\nIn any case, best of luck.\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah I started looking at J and L. Gonna try some other versions with them. I could try and take the bowl from P and apply it to the R then the leg would become bigger as well.\n\nThese two poster are A3 and A2 as originals. Just posted this size for the forum. The size works fine as printed posters. Also on the business cards it's ok, meant to be used in big sizes though.\n\nProbably gonna stick with the name. Got a concept going with the nuclear bomb of the same name that America droppen on Japan and I put an extra character in there that's supposed to be the bomb. If I change the name it dosen't work anymore. I don't mind that there are fonts called Fatman already.\n\nThanks\n\nWill post updates soon.  \nPeter\n\n"
