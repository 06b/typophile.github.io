You can tell from the identical letters that don't look exactly the same.   \n   \nHowever, there are many fonts that might be similar enough, depending on what you want. See [Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054916/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html) for some ideas. There's nothing downloadable there, but some of the fonts are freeware, and the sources are all identified in the Reference List that goes with the Guide.\n\n"
