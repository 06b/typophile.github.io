  "content": "DeSoto is a family of 4 faces based on a few letters from a 1958 DeSoto magazine ad. It's an extended width titling face with a luxurious yet warm feel. Each face is fully loaded with features including old style numbers, case-sensitive punctuation, alternates and ligatures, fractions, swashes and ornaments, and Central European language support. Joe Newton at Veer created the butterflies with ornaments and swashes.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124095846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DeSoto-butterflies_5206.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124095846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CTT0000238_P_5708.gif)\n\n",
