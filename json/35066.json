As noted by Eben above, if you’re not careful, the font’s kerning will be ugly, but it is free after all.\n\nEben:  \nI really like Pixen. I just wish that you could use type. There’s no support for glyphs, or even rudimentary type. A shame. It’s open source, so maybe we nudge someone like Raph to help them out with that :)\n\n"

I kind of think of it as a designer’s color, both from CMYK printing and back-in-tha-day playing with Commodores, where it was this funny (ugly?) compromise color I dithered into others. For the site, I decided to feature it in a “pure” fashion. That badge is an attempt to imitate it, though I had to darken the background and add that shadow so it would read.\n\nEben, to look at the differences, I zoomed the images to 200%. The kerning is actually looser from the O onwards, and it looks like the word stretches out as it reads. At 100% it is harder to see. Is that intentional, or a side effect? I will go back now and loosen up around the I but leave the rest at 1px space...\n\n(correction: were all at 2px originally, appears that you also modified the ’t’?)\n\n"
