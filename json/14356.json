  "content": "Hi,\n\nMy company's typeface is Futura. We encourage everyone in the office to use it for everything that will leave the building, but not every machine has the typeface installed. We are being completely legal and licensed it for the critical machines, but we can't realistically put it on every machine. Is there a typeface found in Windows PCs that would be an acceptable substitute?\n\nThe electronic default for web and emails is Verdana, but the sizes aren't equivalent (ie. 8pt does not = 8pt)\n\nThanks for the advice,  \nScott\n\n",
