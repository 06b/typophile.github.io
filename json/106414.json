So if it comes from Industrie Magazine, that should be it.  \nQuoted from this previous discussion.\n\n> This is the house font of Saturday Group, created for Industrie magazine. It's a custom version based on a Big Caslon with a modern twist in it. So far, it has 4 cuts: Medium, Light, Light Italic and Sans (not used yet). Thanks for your interest.\n"
