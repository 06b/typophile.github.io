But don’t we love the results.\n\nHere is a refined Century Italic to enjoy:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905085635im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Unknown_5109.png)\n\nI also like the slabs they have added to the romans. Hmm... moderns and slabs mixed together—has this even been done before?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905085635im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Picture1_6689.png)\n\nDon’t get me started on the IKEA Futura too. Love that too.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n",

I sent then a nastygram not that long ago regarding a sloppy negligence going on with their fluorescent bulb and battery recycling bins. The bins were so full they could not close. I also did not like the fact mercury laden broken bulbs were sitting a porous wood bin—they should be lined and better maintained.\n\nBut at least IKEA recycles so that’s a plus.\n\nBesides that, I LOVE there kitchen products and their new summer collection. This is the only place that I can get a good price on large (glazed) pots for the patio. Also, I love the dinnerware. I bought 25 of the 365+ dinner bowls there were on sale for .99 cents!\n\nNow Dennis why is it that you can take cool photos with a hulking camera and I, little ’o me, can’t sniff the Persian kilims without a Chinese lady looking at me like I’m a perv? I just happen to love the way jute and wool smell okay- sheesh :-)\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"
