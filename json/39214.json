You need to buy a font!</strong></cite>  \n<cite>We know this solution goes against a long-standing tradition of graphic designers not buying their fonts. In an online survey last year, half the designers responding admitted they had purchased almost none of their fonts. With only 6% saying they had purchased all their fonts.</cite>\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah, but the basic statement is kinda wrong.  \nWhy should everyone (that is, every OS X user) _have_ to buy a new Helvetica Neue?  \nThe version of Helvetica Neue that ships with OS X is a TrueType version from Linotype. Apple only repackaged it as a .dfont.\n\nAnd why this arbitrary differentiation of ‘creative fonts’ and ‘system fonts’? As if the latter was in some dubious extra file format that cannot/may not be used for screen or print design…\n\nWhy should I have to licence it from Linotype (or Adobe, being a reseller – no?) again? That was paid with the OS X license.\n\nThose who need to work with several versions of Helvetica (Neue) and are afraid of a jumble, they need a proper font management. But then, who doesn’t, anyway?\n\n"

Is there something I'm not getting? Is there a quality difference? The only case I see the .dfont might cause problems if you purchase additional weights not included on your systems and it cause problems... but again I still don't see the point.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"

Firms that do a lot of big corporate work may be expected to work with all the various weights of Helvetica and Helvetica Neue to keep clients happy.\n\n"
