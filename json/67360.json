  "content": "Howlett, which is now released on [Myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012020935/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/howlett/), combines great character with extreme legibility.\n\nIt’s a simple display face that offers a sense of coziness and order, that speaks of all being well with the world. It is a modern design which pays due Acknowledgment to the past.\n\nAn extensive range of Opentype features, including old-style numerals, terminal forms, ligatures and stylistic alternatives are included.\n\nUse it for headings and titles as well as eye catching poster work.\n\nYou can try out Howlett on [Myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012020935/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/howlett/) or see some examples of it in action in [our blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012020935/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\n",
