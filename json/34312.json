In some languages digraphs are considered individual letters for alphabetizing, casing, &c. In other languages, such as English, this is not the case. Some digraphs have their own code points in [Unicode](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017024820/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Unicode), and as thus it is important to understand which digraphs can be decomposed and which cannot.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Not Ligatures : Digraphs - Lets talk about 'em.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017024820/http:/typophile.com/node/29782)  \n [IJ-ligature Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017024820/http:/typophile.com/node/34111)\n\n**Additional Articles:**  \n [Wikipedia: Digraph (Orthography)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017024820/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraph_%28orthography%29)\n\n",
