It will only be in italic once, and not when it appears again in the second sentence.  \nMy question is: Do I set the quote marks and the period after the word in regular or italic? Or is just the word itself set in italic?\n\nSorry if this is a bit basic, but just wanted to make sure I got it right.\n\nthanks!\n\n [‹ Art Deco poster design... please help!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122060046/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48597 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Ordinal letters in an all-caps display face? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122060046/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48646 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
