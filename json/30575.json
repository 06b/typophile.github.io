After that the whole family pitched in on the project. The alphabet was even accompanied with a full complement of numerals and punctuation. (no old style figs, though!)\n\nI have a copy slide of that page because I used to include in my lectures for a bit of levity. If I can hunt it up I'll post it.\n\n"
