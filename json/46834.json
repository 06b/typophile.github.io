  "content": "Is a two-part question OK ?\n\nThis is from a ’66 literary quarterly. Looks like some kind of Century (Expanded), but none of the digital versions I’ve seen capture it very well at all. Any certainty, corrections, or suggestions for something similar? (Also open to very elegant modern versions of a typeface of this character.)\n\nThanks !\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [compleat.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084459/http:/typophile.com/files/compleat.jpg) | 167.01 KB |\n\n [‹ Hampton Hydraulics logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084459/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46863 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [nypd font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084459/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46851 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Caledonia would have been an option in ’66; Miller (from Font Bureau) is a modern interpretation.\n\nThe small roman type (along with the numbers and small caps) looks like a version of Baskerville. Not sure about the italics, though.\n\n"

[Garamond FB](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905084459/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/GaramondFB) was based on it.\n\nThe rest appears to be Baskerville.\n\n"
