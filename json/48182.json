The dots on the i’s\\* might be custom edited too.\n\nAs for font, I dunno. It’s too slanted to be Book Antiqua, although that makes a close approximation otherwise. Close, almost certainly not exact. I’ll leave this for the experts.\n\n\\* Note: the only case in English where you’re allowed to pluralize with an apostrophe\n\nPeace,  \nJT\n\n"
