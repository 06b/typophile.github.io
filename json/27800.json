The graphics that i’m making should have a gdr/postwar communist era, washed out look.\n\nFor these tasks, I’m looking for some really dull fonts. I mean dull like helvetica, not like arial. Fonts that try to be fancy, but fail. I’d also appreciate som input on how to make display type look boring without being ugly. THanks!\n\nbest regards,\n\nalex\n\n",

Just take a look at the lighter weights of Helvetica Neue - positively glamorous. Personally I find Optima very dull but many people love it. Same thing with a lot of the “novelty” typefaces from the 70s and 80s.\n\nI think almost any type can look dull - it’s just a matter of how you use it. Maybe something like Block Gothic is what you’re looking for? Or a stencilled typeface? Or a typewriter one, like Courier - that really says “dull” to me. 1950s office dull and bureucratic.\n\n"

Its an impossible question to answer, everyone has different opinions.\n\nI suggest that you turn your brief around, instead of looking for dull fonts, (which we just discussed, may not actually exist), maybe you could use any old font and just treat it in a very dull way. A dull font is often dull due to the unispiring way it is being used, a way in which adds nothing to the context it is put in.\n\nI personally find a lot of the hand scribbled destructive fonts quite dull but that is only me opinion.\n\nGood luck\n\n"

But what’s important is the reader perception - and if you stick those fonts in front of people in the street or in the airport they’re going to yawn.

I assume you know the plot and will spare you the details, but there is plenty of GDR-era product in it - however, from memory, none of it appears as dull as maybe you would like.\n\n_Any tricks on how to achieve immediate dullness in the use of type?_\n\nApart from the great recommendations already here, I suggest you print it 70% or 80% black - so you get a washed out grey rather than full strength black; for a distressed or faded look on the props you can lift toner off the surface of a laserprint by using wadded masking tape and gently patting the print with the sticky side of the tape. I did this when I had to make a 1950s Superman comic as a stage prop for West Side Story - worked a treat.\n\n"

Dull” fonts” like helvetica??\n\nTypefaces like Helvetica and Univers are purposely void of personality.. that is why they were made.\n\nPerhaps if you re-wrote your question one could give help. By dull do you mean that it is a sign from the 50’s that is fading away. Then look at old signs from that era and mimic that.\n\nI’ve worked on signs/props for big name motion pictures, and trust me just from your question you may not be cut out for this. Theres a lot more than just finding a typeface.\n\nI’m sorry if I come off as a jerk, but you clearly have a lot to learn. Try doing some research on what signs would have been around during that time, maybe they weren’t even typefaces.....maybe they were hand painted just to a roman style. Who knows?\n\nBembo\n\n"
