  "content": "Adobe Type Marketing will commission 80 RGB GIF images of 100x100 pixels, each representing a specific typeface family (e.g. Myriad Pro) or themed collection of fonts (e.g. Weddings). The design must be interesting to graphic designers, and communicate something of the family’s/collection’s unique qualities. Adobe will provide the fonts, and review the work (and may request changes).\n\nThe delivery date is negotiable, but by default will be 60 days after the contract is signed. If interested, please submit a bid and a few digital samples of relevant designs to Nicole Bok nbok[at]adobe.com.\n\n [‹ An introduction](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104428/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46324 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Nachofoto? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013104428/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39943 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

We’re not saying that we will offer this to the lowest bidder, btw, just that we want to know what you’d charge.\n\nBTW, if the candidates wanted to, I think we’d consider splitting up the project among a couple of designers, to reduce “design fatigue” and increase the variety of designs.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"
