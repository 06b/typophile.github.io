I’m sure that the publisher will find lots of other venues to sell the book, too. But as you can see, Linotype.com is taking orders now. So why wait for March?\n\nI haven’t seen the book yet, since I’ve been out of Linotype’s offices for a few months already. But I have a feeling that this is quite different to _Homage to a typeface_. I can’t wait to see it!\n\n"

In the movie, we showed a little bit of footage of material from Hoffmann’s archive. And with Müller publishing it, I’m sure it’ll be well-designed.\n\nI’m totally sick of Helvetica, but I’m looking forward to this book!\n\nCheers,\n\n-Gary\n\n"
