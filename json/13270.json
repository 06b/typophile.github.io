      "content": "_I dont want to sound too harsh, but.:_ So what you basically did yet is set two words, using pretty 'standard', common typefaces _( Like Helvetica, News or Trade Gothic )_.? I am not too sure about that being very unique, or memorable, what about you.? This could be for everything.. You could have tried to slightly customize / modify these typefaces.. But, I think you may want to return to sketching and scribbling various ideas on paper ( again ), instead of starting out with setting type on screen..\n\nWhat may help you as well is seeing what other airlines did, and what their logos look like.:  \n_\\> [www.aerosite.net/logos.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108213318/http:/www.aerosite.net/logos.htm) ( Airline Logos )_  \n_\\> [www.af.mil/library/symbol/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108213318/http:/www.af.mil/library/symbol/) :)_\n\n_( Is this for a school / university project, Or do you actually have the opportunity to find a new name and create a new brand for an airline.? )_\n\n"

Try something like Kievit\\* instead.  \n2) For the \"airways\" I think all-caps is good, but something smaller, wider, looser and darker.  \n3) For a logo, what about a pennant shape? Since \"standard\" also means flag, and the pennant is associated with wind.  \n4) Yeah, totally nail down the name first! :-/ Not to mention the target clientele, etc.\n\n\\* [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108213318/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/\")\n\nOh, and don't forget the free peanuts if you use any of our ideas.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Branding an airline is one of the most difficult tasks for a designer. Mostly it's a team of designers who work on the first ideas for weeks. Designing every single unit, from badges to counters, from wingtips to guidebooks, that's a very intense job which takes months, even years.  \nThere are examples of very basic low-budget airliners (Easy Jet, Ryanair...), but still they are very clever designs, using very common type like Cooper or Helvetica Extended, and it works. You don't want a low-budget liner looking too fancy.\n\nAnyway, good luck with it...\n\n"

      "content": "First thing I agree with Kyle this looks like a school project. If you intend to use the logo as signage think of a stop sign. It is knocked out type from a bright solid color. There is a reason for this, its because its visible from a far distance. The same think but opposite for a yeild sign (black type against a bright yellow background). In both cases the type has to be bold to be seen at a distance. Airline, distance get it, the thin type doesn't work.\n\n"
