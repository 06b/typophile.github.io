Their early   \nsuccess at selling fonts had more to do with the lack of   \nchoice than quality. They were pretty bad. Although they   \ncontinued to sell them to the end, they stopped developing   \nthem long ago and went on to develop and market some   \nvery useful software--including what eventually became   \niTunes.\n\n"

I'll try to post a few that might be   \nunique digitizations.   \n   \nGranted, viewed in its entirety, their type library is poor.   \nAnd Conflict Catcher and several other apps   \nnever made the jump to OSX...\n\n"

Sort of an Arthur Bakerishly calligraphic script.   \n   \nI bought it just in the nick of time, as it turned out. Some   \nof the letter spacing could be better, but the character   \nset is fairly complete.   \n   \nIt seems like when I surveyed the font offerings on the   \nwebsite, a few of the scripts were the only faces that   \nstood out as unique.   \n   \n(What was with that Fluent Laser Fonts moniker?)\n\n"
