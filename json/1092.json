      "content": "Hi Jared,   \n   \nNice font specimen. I think that the tails of f, g and y are too decorative. I like the optical internal greys, looks great. BTW, I want to buy a Bitfonter that can produce pixel fonts optimised for flash, and maybe a new version who can generate super pixel fonts, vector with greys. I am a windows user, but if bitfonter can offer a new version for those who design pixelfonts...it would be great! I never knew if Bitfonter was a sucess of sales for Pyrus anyway..   \n   \nMH.\n\n"

      "content": "Miguel said: _I think that the tails of f, g and y are too decorative._   \n   \nI like those tails Jared, but they do look a bit out of context with the rest of the face. Perhaps you could derive two versions of the characters: one that is a straighter gothic sans; and one that is more decorative - sort of a sans w/swash lowercase.   \n   \nOr, whatever.   \n   \nRegardless, it looks swell.\n\n"

This is a strange one (in a good way), and the main question about it seems to be: what's it for?   \n   \nIf it's for good performance in video, then the trapping is going to look strange versus \"display\" usage, but OK functionally. So if you're shooting for the former, you'll have to put in more traps (like in the \"I\" - yes, I can see the trickiness there), but if it's for the latter you'd probably need to balance them aesthetically (generally by reducing the trapping in some glyphs).   \n   \nAs to the somewhat unorthodox glyphs (like the \"g\" and \"y\"), I honestly can't figure out if they should stay or go... One thing about the \"g\" though: it's too wide, and leaning rightward - try to make the join to the tail thinner and within the left bound of the head.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "The starstruck g and y are fine to my eye, maybe because they look great from 5 feet away. A fitter quote might go, \"Pixeltrap attains its shape at a distance of 5', or 120 dpi, whichever comes first.\"   \n   \nI am not teasing. Photonic analog interference is wild and real between the viewer and the display. Only those with digital eyes will see strange lighttraps.   \n\\<self-serving\\> maybe some of them want to be gray. \\</sans\\>\n\n"
