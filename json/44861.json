  "content": "Hi Everyone!  \nI'm trying to find a typeface to replace Requiem. I'll be using it at approximately 8-14pt with abundantly open kerning. I'm using it in a way that requires the characters to be bold or black. Trajan is nice but I'm wondering if there is anything else out there. I really love the elegance and Renaissance aspect of Requiem and the numbers make my heart flutter. I'll be using this for page numbers as well so the numbers are important.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

Palatino, Arrighi et. al.\n\nWhen I took this damn craft up the bible was Edmund Arnold, Ink on Paper... Modern, Old Style, and Transitional.
