  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m brand new to the forum but in need of some help!  \nI designed my own business card while I was still at university, and was pleased with it at the time, but it is beginning to show it’s age!\n\nThe card consisted of a rendered 3d letter “e” with a black background (see below). On the right side of the card, I wrote my name and details in white with Magneto for my font. It’s just not doing it for me. I am a video editor/3d animator living in London. I want to convey a modern, smooth image, without being too “out-there” for the average person that I might give my card to. I am still generally happy with this background image, but I welcome any and all advice in regards to colours, layout, font (ESPECIALLY font), etc.\n\nThank you in advance for taking the time to help me!\n\n~Erven\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129091734im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/E_Logo_3499.jpg)\n\n [‹ Mmmmmm...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129091734/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36412 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Futuristic, Techy font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080129091734/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36439 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
