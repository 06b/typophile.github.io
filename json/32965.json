In section the discs have a sandwiched construction of white/brown/white we think that they’re made of formica. Anyway that’s how we plan on reproducing the missing ones.\n\nOne thought has occurred to me. On the myfonts site it says that Clarendon was produced in 1953. That’s 2 years after the Royal Festival Hall was opened! The architecture firm responsible for the interior of the RFH was German, as were the creators of Clarendon. Could this be an early proto version of the font? does anyone know the circumstances of the font’s creation?\n\n"

The original matrices and punches remained at Stephenson Blake and latterly at the Type Museum, London. They were marketed by Stephenson Blake as Consort, though some additional weights (a bold and italics) were cut in 1950s\n\nIt was named after the Clarendon Press in Oxford. The typeface was reworked by the Monotype foundry in 1935. It was revised by Hermann Eidenbenz in 1953.\n\ncould still be a proto version of the bold cut\n\n"

We think it’s formica - multiple layers of white and kraft paper plasticized by laminating together in resin under huge heat and pressure. the top layers (maybe 20 sheets) would have the letter printed on them. this might become distorted under the huge pressures involved. we experimented with routed and laser etched plastics but couldn’t find one durable enough to withstand being repeatedly trodden on. we could easily be wrong though.\n\n"
