My typeface family is ITC Novarese.\n\nWhile I seem to have the font anatomy, origins and characteristics down pat, I am lacking any examples of where it has been used (advertising, magazine work etc). Does anyone know of any examples, brands, advertisements, buildings, etc that make good use of this font family?\n\nThanks!\n\n",
