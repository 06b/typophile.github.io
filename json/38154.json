I theorized that penmanship was stressed more heavily outside of the US.\n\nI'm going to do my best to replicate the number 1 and maybe someone can provide a practice sheet of a matching style?

I heard of a German exchange student who had to argue with her American math teacher: He read a 7 where the student had written a 1 – ‘European style’.  \nThen, we use a crossbar to separate a handwritten 7 from a 1. This habit seems to be so strange to Americans that they name this figure a ‘French Seven’, I was told. Have you heard this expressin, too?\n\n"
