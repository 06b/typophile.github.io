  "content": "I have noticed that lots of folks on the board have talked about the necessity of creating glyphs/characters which look a bit odd, eccentric, ugly or couterintuitivly shaped in order to get good flow in a text face in the course of discussing some other related topic. Has there been a thread that deals with this idea directly or in a more comprehensive manner?   \n   \nexamples:   \n   \nI was looking at Costa's (Porchez Typofonderie) bold/black 'a' & thinking how right this idea must be. It's an ugly duckling for sure on it's own ( I think ) & yet it works very well. No doubt about that.   \n   \nCostaPTF ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110704211544im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/69103.jpg)   \n   \n [http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110704211544/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/)   \n   \nHrant has also talked about the need for a compressed looking 'g' & the need to take special care with the 'r'. ( the arm needs to be shorter than you might think no? )   \n   \nHrant said \" Your \"g\"s need help though. For the Roman, I'd suggest giving it a bigger head and cramping the bottom (natural in a text face)\"   \n   \nAnybody have a favorite 'ugly' character?   \n   \nAnybody have a list of characters that need of distortion in a text face? And maybe a description of the ditortion recomended?\n\n",

      "content": "I don't mean litterally 'ugly'. That was hyperbole - it's true.   \n   \nI should clarify that I mean the top bold 'a' specifically - not the italic form & by ugly I don't mean disgusting or horrible but rather something odd or different from the other characters. Something suprising & unprogramatic - maybe a little stinky even. An exception.   \n   \nThere are alot of examples of this kind of thing in other arts.   \n   \n- In perfume you often need a stinky/musky smell to go with your pretty aromas in order to take attention ( musk ) & then reward that attention ( flower, fruits, spice etc. ).   \n   \n- In western musical theory you need some 'disonant' or 'sad' notes to go with your 'whole' or 'happy' notes to create a feeling of resolution - otherwise it just sounds a bit boring.   \n   \n- Vienamese food needs a bit of stinky fermented fish sauce (which taken straight would be terrible) - or it comes off as bland & uncomplicated. The fish sauce provides interest.   \n   \nI am sure there are plenty of other examples & probably better ones & even the Coasta 'a' may not be the best example of this exception in type - but the point is that type in general benefits from careful use of exceptions & this is perhaps most true in a text face.   \n   \nI want to try to focus in on characters that benefit from being exceptional in some way & maybe even a bit distorted or stinky for a text face.   \n   \nI was hoping to do this without getting into the whole legibility/readabilty/baouma (sp?) debate - or a sellability debate ( Spiekermann's often related comment ((now paraphrased poorly by me)) that type designs with unusual shaped letters often sell better).   \n   \nAnyway - no offence meant. Just the opposite in fact.\n\n"

I think Gill Sans' e and a are among the ugliest letters ever drawn.   \n   \nI suppose what's more important is how the shapes of the letters fit together to form readable word gestalts. That might require ugly letterforms from time to time.\n\n"

I also agree that it is for the good of the \"group\" that this occurs. But, how often does it happen? I personally do see some typefaces where a character is ugly--my opinion...all subjective--but if the designer knows--perhaps I need to read the whole thread first--what they are doing there doesn't have to be a lot of this occurring.\n\n"
