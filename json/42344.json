      "content": "I use FontAgentPro to manage my fonts, and in Quark 7 and Photoshop nearly all of them are properly grouped into families, especially Adobe OpenType families. It's only the boutique fonts, like FF Scala or Meta, that don't list properly, but there are also keystroke-link problems with those too. You really shouldn't have these problems on Mac OSX with proper software like FontAgentPro.\n\n"
