Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

All it does is look at what you type immediately before and after the straight-apostrophe key, and if you have white space or nothing-at-all before, it assumes you're starting a quote and turns it into an ‘. If there's text before, it assumes you're either ending a quote or putting an apostrophe in the middle of a word, and turns it into a ’. It just can't cope with the concept of an apostrophe at the start of something, which is why it can't cope with fish ’n' chips either. But ’09 is what you want, not ‘09.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working.\n\n"

Personally, I've trained myself to type ALT+0146 as fast as any other typing, and to pre-empt when I'm going to need to. :-D\n\nI'm looking at Word's built-in keyboard shortcuts: see what you get if you type CTRL+apostrophe, then release the CTRL and press apostrophe again. According to what I can see, that should also give you a hard ’ without invoking Word's \"is-this-really-a-quote?\" routine.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working.\n\n"
