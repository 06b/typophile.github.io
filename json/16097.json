The main difference is the latter has...\n\n\"relatively small ascenders and descenders and the uppercase letters have the same height as the lowercase ascenders. This makes the typeface optically larger -- useful for headlines and posters where words must shout.\" - Hans Reichel\n\n"

      "content": "Typically the terms compact and compressed refer to a width narrower than condensed. This width is almost always used only for large display sizes. Condensed can be used (in small doses) for text.  \nFrom what Stephen says, I infer that FF is using the compact description to indicate that it is a headline font.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
