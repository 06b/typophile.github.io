  "content": "I need some help identifying the typeface which the book's title—'Woods beyond a cornfield-is set in. The book was printed by hand letterpress in London, in 1979 and I know the printer-publisher used mainly Monotype or special Foundry typefaces. Any help (and info on the typeface if possible) would be GREATLY appreciated! Thanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [WBAC\\_TP.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027181541/http:/typophile.com/files/WBAC_TP.jpg) | 401.34 KB |\n\n",

There's no 'Bold Face Outline' but this did ring a bell with an article I read on the publisher a while ago. Cromy's clue provided the final link - I managed to unearth a copy of the Monotype Printing Types Specimen Book. The type in question is Monotype Old Style Bold Outline 176. See image attached with great many thanks for all the help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141027181541im_/http:/typophile.com/files/oldstyle001_5467.jpg)\n\n"
