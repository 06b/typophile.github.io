  "content": "Hi all.  \nI have a question as to whether or not it would be worth it to release a face I've had sitting on my hard drive for 8+ years.\n\nThe font is basically a reproduction of the Van Doesburg Cafe Aubette lettering which The Foundry seems to have also duped (and I can't say I agree with some of their design decisions). My version is actually quite different than theirs and has my own little twists on the theme. I would also be making several weights and possibly widths to make mine more versatile.\n\nWhat do you think? Do we need another Van Doesburg replica? Should I bother cleaning it up and fleshing out the weights?\n\n",

Meanwhile, P22 is a more responsible about such things.
