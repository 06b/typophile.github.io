  "content": "At ATypI last week at the request of the IE team I asked for font community input on the various Web font formats. I’m posting the details here and encourage feedback from the font community.\n\nWOFF: Microsoft continues to evaluate the format, and are encouraged that it was developed by people within the typeface and browser communities, and that it differentiates web fonts from desktop fonts. It is also encouraging to note that some type designers and vendors have voiced “support” for the format. EOT started with a long list of supporters too, so we would like to see WOFF supporters and other foundries start licensing fonts in the format before we jump on board.\n\nEOT/CWT: Given browser upgrade cycles it will be vital for font foundries, as well as fonts-as-a-service providers to offer fonts in the EOT format alongside raw and WOFF. We are aware that some in the font community have proposed removing URL-binding (tying a font to a specific domain) and compression in a EOT-derived Web font format dubbed CWT. We support attempts to differentiate web fonts from document fonts, but note that in removing URL-binding this format no longer conforms to the OpenType spec’s definition of document font embedding.\n\nRaw fonts: Raw-fonts have a part to play in the Web font ecosystem, in particular around free and open source fonts. However to help prevent accidental posting and linking of unlicensed fonts we’re investigating two possible restrictions. Firstly requiring same-domain linking, meaning fonts must be located on the domain as the referring Web pages. Secondly only allowing “installable embedding” fonts to be used. As we do not propose changing the OpenType font specification’s definition of “installable embedding” it would still be the responsibility of web site creators to confirm that the font license allows raw-font linking. We are particularly interested in font community feedback on this approach.\n\nThanks, Si\n\nsimonda@...\n\n",

So in effect you recognise two different kinds of font linking, one of which constitutes ‘document font embedding’ because the fonts are bound to a particular URL. Is that correct? Can you point me to the part of the OT spec that explains this? I've looked, and I don't see anything that would lead obviously to this interpretation of the word ‘embedding’.\n\nSince the non-IE browser makers have explicitly rejected URL binding -- hence why it is not included in the CWT format --, by your definition there are no embedded fonts in use with those browsers -- yes? -- even though the mechanism of linking may be identical to IE EOT linking excepting URL binding?\n\nThis looks to me like a recipe for confusion; indeed, it is a recipe that we're already tasting.\n\n_Secondly only allowing “installable embedding” fonts to be used. As we do not propose changing the OpenType font specification’s definition of “installable embedding” it would still be the responsibility of web site creators to confirm that the font license allows raw-font linking._\n\nAny free or open source font will have a license that permits format conversion, hence I don't see any reason at all for supporting raw font linking. You get the same mileage from supporting WOFF, with the added benefit of format-side compression.\n\n"

      "content": "Si, I think no one would disagree that a font ‘encapsulated within a document’ is embedded. What seems to me problematic is the assertion that ‘tied to a document’ also constitutes embedding. The former is common usage and understandable from non-specialist usage of the word embedded; the latter is a stretch, and to say that it is ‘the OpenType spec's definition of document font embedding’ is a really big stretch, because this is what the OT spec says re. the OS/2 fsType bits (the only part of the spec font embedding is discussed:\n\n_Embeddable fonts may be stored in a document._\n\nStored **_in_** a document. The spec doesn't say anything about ‘tied to a document’, nor any other wording that would lead obviously to such an interpretation. It simply isn't normal English usage to equate embedding with some kind of strong linking. Embedded reporters in Iraq operate within army units; they're not strapped to the outside of the humvee.\n\n_In my opinion the additional hoop of format conversion would have been a good one, but we’ve moved beyond that now. I don’t think the other browsers are considering dropping support for raw fonts._\n\nFor free and open source fonts, format conversion is barely a hoop. The same sites that make the TTF files available can make the WOFF files available. In neither commercial web font licensing nor in distribution of free and open source fonts is anyone anticipating end-user format conversion. That really is something we've moved beyond.\n\nBut while we've moved beyond end-user format conversion, we've spent months -- successfully -- moving Mozilla and other browser makers toward a web-specific font format. Sure, those browsers that already support raw font linking are not going to remove such support, but that support is meaningless if an interoperable format acceptable to the majority of font vendors is implemented. And such a format works just as well and in exactly the same way for free and open source fonts.\n\nMeanwhile, I am concerned that if IE starts supporting raw font linking, even with the restriction that it only applies to fonts with the installable embedding bit set, then you will encourage an ‘ecosystem’ in which TTFs and OTFs are uploaded to web servers, an ecosystem in which all the other browsers will be ignoring the embedding bits. As I wrote to the W3C list in August, I think the argument that raw font linking for free and open source fonts is somehow magically separate from the issue of unlicensed use of commercial fonts is a naïve fantasy:  \n [http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/1316.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141013175731/http:/lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/1316.html \"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-font/2009JulSep/1316.html\")\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nYou wrote above re. WOFF support: _EOT started with a long list of supporters too._\n\nMonotype and Adobe, if I recall. Who else?\n\nAnd why, for ten years, did EOT go nowhere? Primarily because it only worked on one browser. So that should tell you that the success of a web font format is dependent on browser interoperability, not on advanced sign-up from font vendors. You need the format to be agreeable to font vendors, but it is the implementation in the browsers that will make it successful.\n\nEOT was a format that the makers of IE wanted font vendors to support. WOFF is a format that makers of fonts want IE to support. That seems to me an important distinction.\n\n"

      "content": "The font makers to whom I have spoken who are making use of Typekit-like services are doing so because such services offer various kinds of server-side obfuscation as protections of the font. If these services were simply serving raw TTFs or OTFs direct from their servers to users' browser caches, then foundries would be no more interested in these services than they are in raw font linking. I've discussed this with a lot of colleagues, and very few people are open at all to raw font linking per se -- this is why _font makers_ developed WOFF --; raw font linking with server side obfuscation seems acceptable to some people, but not to everyone. Further, the Typekit people are themselves in favour of a single interoperable format, so that they can move away from serving multiple formats, and seem to understand that they will attract more foundries if they are able to completely bypass raw fonts as a format (which they will be able to for Firefox 3.6).\n\n_...other browsers don’t seem to be backing away from raw-font support._\n\nIn the Spring of this year, raw font linking was being pushed by the non-IE browsers as the preferred interoperable web font format. Since then, they've pretty much stopped talking about it, in the case of Mozilla have worked with font makers to develop and implement WOFF, and have even tested CWT implementations. No one is expecting them to remove the raw font linking that they already have, but they have certainly backed away from it as a viable interoperable format, mainly because both font makers and Microsoft have said that they find it an unacceptable risk to font IP. The point I am making above is that even with the proposed limit to fonts with installable embedding bits, the active encouragement of raw font linking increases the risk to font IP. If you want to protect font IP on the web, the easiest way to do so is to avoid a mechanism that takes TTFs and OTFs and gives them away to every visitor to a webpage. Trying to limit that mechanism on one browser to fonts with a specific fsType bit setting doesn't seem to me worthwhile, because a) it encourages use of a format that other browsers will not limit and b) just makes your browser seem less capable than those other browsers to the average user.\n\n"

Which I have been saying since June, despite my misgivings about the format and my preference for WOFF. CWT needs to be taken seriously, by font vendors, web authors and browsers, because it does provide a broadly compatible interim web font format.\n\nRaw font linking won't be taken seriously by most commercial font vendors, excepting insofar as some measures of server-side obfuscation are acceptable to some. Since an IE implementation of raw font linking limited to free and open source fonts with installable embedding is not practically compatible with the non-restricted implementations of the other browsers, i.e. web authors won't be able to use the same fonts reliably across browsers unless they are free or open source fonts, it does nothing to solve web font interoperability in a way that is meaningful to professionals. As MST demonstrated last year, with Ascender's help, most free fonts are not worth what one pays for them.\n\n"

So unless the other browsers start supporting an EOT compatible format you'll need to continue to serve multiple formats for the foreseeable future. That doesn’t seem to be on the cards. In addition although we might see convergence around WOFF within the next decade, I doubt we'll see any convergence around font rendering across all the devices, displays, OSs and browsers.

      "content": "Si: _In a way, yes. But as noted “if you build it they will come” didn’t work out so well for EOT, even with IE having 90%+ market share._\n\nI think a lot of font makers lost interest in web fonts around the time that IE went with EOT and Netscape went with TrueDoc. It seemed clear at that point that there wasn't going to be a unified font format, and the fact that IE subsequently ended up with such a huge share of the browser market didn't seem to affect the perception, repeated by just about every Net analyst and journalist, that web typography was something that would have to wait. Also, EOT, contra TrueDoc, was seen as a salvo in the browser war, and once the war was effectively won Microsoft's own enthusiasm for EOT seemed to largely disappear until early this year. Partly this is doubtless Microsoft's perennial problem of poor evangelisation (of which WPF is the latest victim), but it also looked like a lack of interest in the weapons once the battle was won.\n\nEOT was also badly positioned in terms of providing or even suggesting to font vendors a viable business model. Microsoft rolled out a tool that enabled end users to make EOT fonts from existing TTFs, and I think a lot of font vendors were left scratching their heads wondering how to monetise this arrangement. It is telling that this time around a lot of the discussion among font vendors has been focused very much on how to monetise web fonts, and also telling that end user format conversion is very much not part of the emerging picture.\n\nFurther, EOT was not a publicly specified format until earlier this year, leaving a lot of questions among font makers about how or whether it might be implemented in other non-IE browsers, as well as how to build EOT into foundries' creation, QA and delivery workflows. These are both key factors in the shaping of the WOFF format.\n\nFinally, as it turned out, Microsoft's own EOT implementation is buggy. It doesn't work with CFF OpenType fonts, and the IE @font-face implementation fails to support font family style linking correctly.\n\nI think there are a lot of reasons why font makers didn't rush to embrace EOT. Once again, I'll point out that the crucial difference that EOT was a technology that Microsoft wanted to give to font makers, while WOFF is a technology that font makers want to give to Microsoft.\n\n"

A new name was recommended by participants on the W3C font list in order to remove confusion about what browsers supporting the new format should do when encountering ‘classic’ EOT fonts.\n\nThe purpose of CWT is to provide a format that is compatible with existing EOT font support in Internet Explorer versions 6–8 (hence ‘compatibility’), while avoiding those aspects of EOT that were rejected by the non-IE browser makers. The CWT format does not use URL binding, which was the major objection to EOT from the browser makers, since this mechanism was viewed as a form of DRM.\n\nI believe a formal spec for CWT is in development, based on discussions on the W3C list.\n\nThe obvious benefit of CWT is that it makes it possible to license and ship web fonts that work on the majority of browsers now in use, including the significant install base of IE6. However, due to bugs in the IE 6–8 EOT support on which CWT would rely in those browsers, there will likely be a distinction between the CWT format spec as it would be implemented by future browsers, and specific recommendations for making fonts that will work with IE 6–8 (e.g. TTF only). In other words, a CWT font built to be compatible with IE 6–8 would also work with new CWT implementations in future browsers, but a CWT font built to spec might not work in those older browsers.

The fact that the actual implementation in IE has been buggy for all that time seems to say something about how seriously EOT was taken both inside about outside MS.\n\n_I would imagine IE is not alone in thinking about WOFF support..._\n\nMozilla are past the thinking about it stage and have already committed to supporting WOFF in Firefox 3.6.\n\nLet me state very clearly that I hope non-IE browsers will take the step of supporting CWT, and hence provide an at least partially backwards compatible interim solution to web fonts, as this will make things easier for web authors in the immediate future. But enthusiasm for this format among commercial font foundries is pretty limited: some of the bigger companies are interested, but most of the independents are not. So I think there is a genuine chicken and egg situation for CWT in that only increased browser support and a considerable user base will overcome the reluctance of many font makers to engage with that format.\n\nEnthusiasm for WOFF is already pretty high among font makers, but as the experience of EOT shows, no web font format is going to take off without multi-browser support. Looking to font vendors to start actively licensing and shipping for a format before it is supported in more than one browser is putting the cart before the horse. Some of these people got burned by GX, remember, and they're wary about touching anything that isn't supported by at least two major entities. A commitment from MS to support WOFF in IE 9 would go a long way toward turning today's enthusiasm into shipping fonts. Otherwise we're still in the late ’90s and IE is supporting one format and Netscape's children are supporting another and the font makers are going to sit it out again. The ball really is in the browser makers court: the uncertainty isn't being generated by the font makers. We'll support the format(s) that a) do not involve giving away our font IP to every visitor to a website, and b) are supported on two or more major browsers (and, frankly, there are only three major browsers: IE, Firefox and Safari, with the latter having an artificially high significance relative to market share).\n\nIdeally, I'd like to see MS and Mozilla mutually commit to support both CWT and WOFF, so that font makers and users know where we are going both now and in the years ahead.\n\n"

David Berlow has a laser precise reason for rejecting EOT, and I suspect he is right that whatever the historical perceptions the equation of embedding with linking is an untenable one.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThis made my day:\n\n[http://type101.fontbureau.com/archives/474](http://web.archive.org/web/20141013175731/http:/type101.fontbureau.com/archives/474 \"http://type101.fontbureau.com/archives/474\")\n\nAnd I don't think there is really anything else to say.\n\n"
