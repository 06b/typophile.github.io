      "content": "Hallo Hans,\n\nyou can use GREP to solve this issue.  \nIn the search/replace window (in InDesign CS ≥3), there’s a tab called ‘GREP’. Search for `\\s\\w+?\\W+?$`\n\n`\\s` is a placeholder for ‘any space character’. (That’s the last word space in your paragraph.)  \n`\\w+?` stands for ‘one or more word characters’. (Matches the last word.)  \n`\\W+?` is for ‘one or more non-word characters’: it matches the dot, but also the question mark, exclamation mark etc. Why ‘one or more’? Because your paragraph could end with a closing quotation mark **and** a punctuation mark. Maybe there’s even an additional superscript character, indicating a footnote.  \nThe final `$` stands for: ‘look at paragraph endings only’.\\*\n\nNow you can easily add the ‘no break’ property (directly or via character style) to the hits.  \nF\n\n\\*) Maybe there’s a more elegant way; I’m still getting used to GREP. Love to hear ideas.\n\n"

Don’t you think that looks odd?</cite>\n\nYes, you're right. And it does happen. The frequency depends on the text of course, but also on the layout program. For instance, I find that InDesign does this -- and other infelicities -- if (1) you use the paragraph composer, and (2) you don't get good values for min-ideal-\"not honored\" (aka max) spacing. The \"best\" values can change a bit with the size of the type and the measure.\n\nNot to pick on InDesign, TeX had a its oddities too. The penalty for increasing the word space was the same as for decreasing the word space, on a percentage basis. Well, using real numbers, if you set the minimum spaceband to 180 and the maximum (which TeX somewhat honors) to 400, using any value other than 290 as \"ideal\" (halfway in between) would skew the results, based on change penalties computed as a percentage. But 290 is too big; 240 is more like it. Since using TeX with these parameters \"encouraged\" adding space to justify, we wrote another routine adding a demerit for setting more lines that absolutely needed in a paragraph. The value you used for this demerit would control the spacing behavior.\n\nToo much information, I know. The point is, for setting extended text, you have to understand how your layout program works, & adapt it to your needs/desires.\n\n"

In some cases, it is too much.\n\nThe problem with Nick's solution to this (letterspacing the stub) is that design on the newspaper seldom happens within the production schedule.
