  "content": "Hi,\n\nThis is for a school project. We're supposed to come up with a name for a fake TV channel, design a logo and guidelines. Quote from the brief \"We segue effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist\". They show drama, reality TV, films, soaps and nice programmes.\n\nTarget audience -\\> Love being entertained, 16-45 with slight male bias, cultural mix, articulate, not affluent but have sophisticated spending and tastes.\n\nI've chosen Capra as a name. Taken from the Alpine mountain goat (Capra Ibex) and italian director Frank Capra. Here I have some logo suggestions where I've modified Clarendon to try and make it more contemporary. Clarendon has a nice property that reminds of the big round horns of the Capra Ibex.\n\nAny feedback much appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100306010536im_/http:/typophile.com/files/capra_v1_4308.jpg)\n\n",

I do like the name, though the addition of \"vision\" comes off as a bit forced and sort of cliched (not to mention competing with the main title in that serif face).\n\nHave you thought about maybe drawing typographic inspiration from some more cinematic sources, maybe classic movie posters and the like?\n\n"

This might actually go really well for another project for a female quire, I think I'll use this modification of Clarendon for that instead.\n\nMade another version that has more of a old movie poster feel to it.  \nSlightly modified Industria with some retro color versions.\n\nThis is perhaps more in the right direction, more masculine version but not too much.\n\npeter\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100306010536im_/http:/typophile.com/files/capra_v2_5005.jpg)\n\n"
