Don't really want/can spend more time on this, but let me know what do you think on the typography & design in general. It has the Metalic Silver pantone + Pantone 7427. Which card do you like more?

      "content": "Very nice logo. The word spacing in \"da costa\" feels a little wide.   \n   \nI definitely prefer the card on the right. The red on the bottom right really draws the viewers eye. I can't quite tell what information is there at this size, but I would suggest making it the most important (phone, services description, or whatever is the priority info). If your friend can't afford to pay you, then he might appreciate going with the one color backside.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

Also the Costa was in fact with lowsy kerning, I've changed that also. About the back print of the card, just the email or plain white on the red print? Is there a need to repeat the logo on the back of the card? I usually do this.. hum.   \n   \nI've replaced the info I had on the red block with the tel& fax.

      "content": "The word spacing (not letter spacing) in \"da costa\" is still a little much compared to the spacing in \"carlos felicio\". Even if the spacing was the same mathmatically/technically, optically the height of the red \"f\" and the lightness of the silver make it feel more open in comparison.   \n   \nI don't necessarily think the logo/title needs to be on the backside of the card. In fact, the value of the red as an identifier is stronger without the name. In other words, with the presence of the logo/title you focus on the company name, but without it you focus on the flooded red color, which might be a distinguishing factor in their visual communications (if they do much of it).   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

If its on uncoated paper you might want to loose the full bleed red back especially if there is a texture to the stock. You can have the best typography in the world and it can be ruined on press.   \n   \nOne other thought is Red reminds me of Stop Signs, especially with Knock Out type. Red also signals danger.\n\n"

Other than that, ligatures and everything.. nice and solid for a lawyer.   \nI like the red, btw. It fits the PMS877 and isaggressive, which I'd personally say is a GOOD quality in a lawyer (as long as he is on your side). Blue is such a standard colour for advocats, as is dark green. Red is it, if you ask me. The first feeling is often the right one. If you know the guy -- is he more agressive or more a laid back person? if the former, go ahead with red. Maybe you can use a bit of a darker tone to mellow it a bit, if need be.   \n   \nUncoated paper with such a full bleed CAN work, if the prrinter knows what he does and the type isn't too small. Imo, the subtle inclusions and structures in the paper, the small imperfections ARE what makes it work in that case.   \n   \nThe right hand card in the first example has such a nice red background and the type is neat, if it technically is workable, you should use that, with a motto or something.   \n   \nBtw, the only thinhg I don't like is the arrangement of the type on the card-front. It looks much nicer on the back in the left-hand example, more symmetric and in-the-middle, a better use of proportion and white-space.\n\n"
