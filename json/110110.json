  "content": "Hi there i'm writing a paper on the effect computers have had on type and would love to get some insight from people on this site regarding a few things;  \nI'd love to know your opinions on digital typeface adaptation, do you think we lose/ maybe even gain anything in tweaking fonts and has this adaptation become easier with computer software?\n\nAlso if you are still in the answering questions kinda mood, what are your opinions on Google Fonts? Do you think that free fonts like the ones from google have an effect on the type industry?\n\nMany thanks for any responses!\n\n",
