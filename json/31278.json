  "content": "Hi all\n\nI’m after some much needed inspiration. I’ve just started a new role as creative director, and as well as managing the studio, introducing and streamlining systems - I have 4 ongoing redesigns, 2 of which I am personally handling. I’ve spent the grand total of 4 hours intermittantly working up these roughs and need a critique.\n\nThe brief is to revamp an existing Australian state-specific tourist guide (6 regions in all). The only constraint is that they currently sell into editorial 1/4 page ads, and so therefore I believe we need to retain a 2 col grid to place these. There are also a lot of 1/8 and 1/16 page ads which I have said need to go into a directory rather than be placed in copy. They want to position it as a high-brow title however are still selling ads to small b&bs and, restaurants that ABC1’s simply won’t go near.\n\nI’m using meta, but want to introduce a serif for headlines - any suggestions?\n\nAlso need to bring in a second colour which will run over all editions - something like a stone or fawn colour?\n\nIt is really early stages just wanted to bounce it off you guys.\n\nThanks for any suggestions + or - all helps!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [discover NT.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225316/http:/typophile.com/files/discover%20NT.pdf) | 819.97 KB |\n\n [‹ Interstate system as transit diagram](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225316/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31279 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Art Nouveau ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080511225316/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31206 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Darren,  \nI did a search for ABC1 but didn’t come up with anything - is it tourist publication?  \nAside from that I think that the use of one colour (brick red in this instance and tints thereof) and the consistent placement of the masthead could link all editions together. There is plenty of colour in the stock photos.  \nI wonder if a serif typeface might be more appropriate for the body copy? If the cover is advertised in the newspaper, the sanserif face should hold together better at a smaller size. The choice may also depend on the target market for this publication. For instance, a senior citizen’s version might need text to be set at a larger size and in a face with a low x-height. High-brow covers a fairly large group, IMHO.  \nI don’t like the reversed out pullquotes, they stand out a little bit too much compared to the other elements on the page. More emphasis could be given to the events in each state too. Sometimes, a tourist might base their trip around one event.  \nHTH\n\nDavid\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t think that you need a separate face for the headlines; the heavier weights of Meta provide a tremendous amount of contrast with the text weight, resulting in a design that’s highly functional and harmonious. Meat also fits into the “highbrow” category because it has warm, humanist characteristics that most neo-grotesques lack.\n\nThe pullouts are creating tension that could be resolved by bringing the lines together into a single shape and providing a little more breathing room for ascenders and descenders at the top and bottom.\n\nFor your second color, try something with a hint of aqua that provides a relaxing alternative to the orange/red scheme, and will also allow you to mix the colors as complements now and then. It will also work with the outdoor shots you’ll be using.\n\nRegarding your grid and advertisements, you’re already breaking pages down into more than two columns, so why not just bump up the number of columns for flexibility?\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks guys!\n\nFirst off ABC1 is a British socio-economic grouping referring to the high-end of the market i.e. top earners, lots of disposable income, buy prestige brands etc.\n\nThanks sincerely for the feedback. I have introduced Minion as a extra face - I agree that Meta is pretty good however the publisher still sees serifs as more high-end than a sans.\n\nColour wise some of the states are blue so bringing in an aqua although great for the red and orange state colours won’t work with the blue ones. So I’m using a fairly ubquitous tan colour.\n\nHeres a reworked version - I couldn’t post another pdf hence the jpg\n\nLook forward to your comments\n\n"
