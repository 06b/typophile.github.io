  "content": "Got a question and wondered if someone could clear it up for me.\n\nAfter spacing and kerning a font to something resembling decency, I test it in a number of packages. They work fine in word processors (eg Word), fine in vector packages (eg Illustrator), and fine in other packages such as Photoshop.\n\nBUT for some reason they dont work fine in Paint Shop Pro. The spacing goes to pot, and the very basic kern feature of PSP just makes the problem even worse.\n\nOne package out of ten is not overly worrying, but it is probably the most used package amoung those who would buy and use my stuff.\n\nAnyone else have similar problems, and is there something during creation that could alleviate this problem ?\n\n",

I dont have any versions except 7, so cant test it on any other versions.\n\nAgain, this is what the majority of average people are using, unfortunately because it was the most and easily pirated version.\n\n"
