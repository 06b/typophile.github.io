I've seen it used (The Donnas logo most recently), so it must exist as a font, but haven't found it.

The Donnas' logo looks like an obliqued and bolded version of Octopuss: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=the+Donnas&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20071229050455/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=the%2BDonnas&p=72). However, unfortunately, Octopuss is not the font of your sample (see: [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=Madeleine&p=72](http://web.archive.org/web/20071229050455/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=Madeleine&p=72)). I was excited, because, at first, I thought Madeleine would be found with the Donnas and Octopuss ... but she seems to be somewhere else.\n\n"

It did fool me in the Donnas logo at least ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071229050455im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) But still, how I wish she could be found... Madeleine, with her more evenly weighted contours is a bit more to my own liking than the slightly rubbery \"quirkyness\" of an Octopuss.   \n   \nSeems strange to me that WhattaFont didn't even list Octopuss among the many suggestions it gave me. Well, you know what they say:\"The best font ID technologies can't match the eye of a typophile\"!   \n   \nThanks for the help!\n\n"
