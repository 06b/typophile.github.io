  "content": "Hey all,\n\nI've been trying to identify two (to three) fonts from the old TV series 'The Dukes of Hazzard' (1979; [imbd-link](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/www.imdb.com/title/tt0078607/)).\n\nOne (or two) would be the lettering on the car, General Lee, especially the **'01'** on the side of the car, as depicted in the attachment. And I was wondering if the font of the letters differs from the font of the ciphers 01 (unfortunately, I could not find any decent images for the letters, just [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/i28.photobucket.com/albums/c214/orange01/dukes_of_hazzard.jpg) or [this one](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/www.prnewswire.com/mnr/cmt/21313/images/21313a.jpg)).\n\nThe other font would be the logo of the series, as depicted [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/www2.warnerbros.com/dukesofhazzard/img/splash/DH_Splash_left_p2_off.jpg) or [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/images.amazon.com/images/P/B0001WTWXI.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg).\n\nBut I'm guessing that would be a custom made one..\n\nThanks a lot,  \nalex.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [dodge\\_general2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/typophile.com/files/dodge_general2.jpg) | 32.02 KB |\n| [general-lee-01-lg.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013529/http:/typophile.com/files/general-lee-01-lg_0.gif) | 5.29 KB |\n\n",
