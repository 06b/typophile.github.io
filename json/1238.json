So perhaps this is how we should remember '9/11': by calling to mind the people who have lived through so many atrocities that they don't keep track of the dates any more.\n\n"

And I still agree with you!   \n   \nJames's tragic recollections reminded me so much of home: the phosphor smell from the hi-tech Israeli bombs that hit my dad's laboratory/office, the smell of my dog's urine stain that I was trying to clean from one of our Persian carpets as one of my uncles suddenly showed up to tell me that his brother had been assassinated, the furious wail of a Druze mobile Katyousha battery using our building as cover to random-bomb the Phalangist Christian neighborhoods, the uneasy silence during my 2-4 AM shift guarding my high school with a Chinese imitation of a \"Klashin\", the symbolic but awesome shelling of a deserted Syrian outpost in the Bekaa Valley by the meter-wide cannons of the New Jersey warship five miles off the coast, and the hopeless but almost festive firing of anti-aircraft guns at it, with the vermillion flare rounds bouncing off the surface of the Mediterranean repeatedly, like some ethereal ballet - and so many other utterly unforgettable things.

I remember Tom Milo at the ATypI conference in Copenhagen, relating the epic story of his roundabout journey from California back to Europe in the aftermath of the attack: he described the consideration shown to everyone stranded at the various airports, the volunteerism, and the lack of selfishness, and remarked that he'd felt privileged to have been there and witnessed it.

In that moment he lost his youth, though he is still in his 20's.   \n   \nHe followed a path like many of his computer-studies classmates of working in the dot-com boom, and then going to work for financial companies after the bust. Three of his graduating class were murdered in the 9-11 attack.   \n   \nArt was used to express grief and anger. My son told me that a poster immediately appeared many places in lower Manhattan - where my son and daughter (she watched the collapse from her rooftop at a safe distance) live.   \n   \nIt was never photographed or reported in the press, to my knowledge. It was a variation on the famous 'I want you' recuitment poster with 'Uncle Sam' pointing at the viewer. (I know it is based in turn on a British poster.) The variation was that instead of pointing at the viewer, Uncle Sam had an upturned middle finger, and the caption was 'We're coming to get you motherf\\*\\*\\*er.'   \n   \n\\>This good guys v bad guys stuff is ridiculous.   \n   \nI agree that being simplistic is a very serious problem in political thinking, especially about foreigners. But there are bad guys. The Taliban qualify. They deserved what they got.   \n   \nAmerica is often the good guy and sometimes the bad guy. It is complicated. But the knee-jerk anti-Americanism I read on these boards I think is seriously misguided, and the product of simplistic and dangerous 'black and white' thinking. It is a cheap way to feel superior, not a result of real understanding.   \n   \nThe main problem with it is not that America doesn't do stupid and bad things. It is that most governments in the world are so much worse that they can't even be mentioned in the same breath as far as badness. My wife has worked all over the world in a UN organization, and is of the very well informed opinion that the reason most of the poverty and misery in the world is due to bad governments, many of which have been just gangsters, mafias. The US government is not, and never has been this bad, and that is why it has peace and prosperity - uneven though these are - within its borders.   \n   \nRight now the US is at its peak of power in the world. If the Taliban had the same power, you would know what bad is.   \n   \nAlso this stuff about the US being so narrow minded and intolerant is crap. I am in an inter-racial marriage, and know people here from all over the world, including many multi-national and multi-racial couples. And they vote with their feet to come here because it is so tolerant. Again, this is by comparison. There are plenty of American bigots. It is just that most other societies are much more intolerant than the US.   \n   \nI don't particularly want to argue about all this on these boards. I want to learn about type from all of the wonderful typofiles here. But on this day, as the question was raised, I thought it might be appropriate to introduce a little balance and get people to think twice about their knee jerk anti-Americanism.\n\n"

This thread exists not because two or three thousand people were killed 2 years ago today, but because those people were mainly Americans.   \nWhen two or three thousand people of other nationalities die the anniversary goes largely un-noticed.   \n   \nNote, for example, that between your first post (1:00 pm) and your second (4:33 pm) over 4000 people starved to death.   \nIs George Dubya going to start a war on hunger, or poverty, or disease?   \nWhat do you think?   \n(Here's a clue: There's no oil involved, nor any other immediate economic benefit for the USA)\n\n"

The indulgence and support of rotten regimes by both America and Europe have, though, exaserbated the problems.   \n   \nI am very distressed about our policies that hurt poor countries. And I am in despair that the left and the right are pretty clueless about what is actually going on.   \n   \nFor example, GW recently paid off rich American farmers with huge subsidies - against his supposed free market principles and in a craven attempt to buy votes in farm states.   \n   \nThis move will wreck the ability of legions of farmers in poor countries to earn a livelihood from farming, and drive them in desparation to the city slums - and incidentally many poor central americans across our borders. The only thing that can be said not to condemn this policy as distinctively devilish is that the agricultural policies of the European Union are even worse - More protectionist, more subsidies undercuting the ability of those in poor countries to making a living by competing fairly.   \n   \nSince trade arguably has a much bigger impact than aid on the poor countries are you denouncing Tony Blair and Jacque Chirac and other European leaders for causing the starvation of millions? Or is your ire just reserved for GW?   \n   \nEuropean anti-americanism is a cheap substitute for real understanding and sound policy.   \n   \n-Just blame the US and get indignant, when in fact the problems and the solutions are very complex, and involve the US and Europe and Japan changing their policies. And most of all the leadership in the poor countries needs to change or actually starting to care about their people. Whenever they do, the countries actually experience economic growth, and fewer people go hungry.   \n   \nAre you denouncing those in poor countries who are actually most responsible for the plight of their people? Or only the US?   \n   \nI see simplistic, conspiratorial thinking going on all the time. People scream about symbols while the substance of policy is neglected.\n\n"

The US created Saddaam, but now that they need the borders of Iraq to serve as their self-validating terrorist threat (now that Afghanistan is no longer useful in that capacity) as well as a source of oil alternative to Saudi Arabia, they got rid of him (quite possibly by simply telling him it was time to go). There are so many realities you conveniently ignore, it's impossible to think you're doing anything but rehashing what you were fed as a child.   \n   \nAnd if Americans really wanted to, a fraction of the people who currently starve to death would suffer that fate. But they don't, because their system has taught them to care first and foremost about their selves. Your society is decrepit. A simple rummage through the trashcan of the average American establishes this instantly.   \n   \nWith power comes responsability - this is the one thing that the US has to take to heart, otherwise it will continue to be the overgrown teenager with the biggest club. The entire foundation of your political thought is based on the contrivance that your government is sound. It is not. Your leaders are murderous thieves, and worst of all the population supports them - not because they're as bad, they don't realize what's going on - but because they've been brainwashed since birth to think the US is good overall. It is not. It has become the single greatest cause of misery to the greatest number of people on Earth. Why? To feed its own obese shell of a society.   \n   \n--   \n   \nYou're severely outnumbered here for one reason only: this is an international forum, with people who have not suffered your brainwashing. The saddest thing is that it will take decades and many more large-scale attacks on the US for you to finally snap out of it. You are being sent to slaughter to make rich people richer.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

If your reasoning were correct, the proper way to respond to the anniversary of your Uncle's death is to berate your Aunt for grieving and not thinking about the starving masses in poor countries.

Spent Uranium are bullets, not bombs, and I believe napalm was not used at all. The idea that the US or Europe can wipe out poverty and ignorance around the world with a one shot spending is nonsense.   \n   \nFor example over half of the budget of Bengla Desh, for years is paid by foreign aid, and they are still mired in horrible poverty - and not coincidentally have one of the most corrupt governments. The fact that you don't know what you are talking about doesn't matter though. So long as it is anti-American most will nod and be happy.\n\n"

Yes, Bangladesh is subsidised and yes, the government has corruption problems, but at Cancun, while Koreans stab themselves to death, America and Europe are trying to destroy the alliance of G21. G21 are seeking to stop richer nations dumping their subsidised surplus goods on markets where local farmers cannot compete.   \nThe world's poorer countries lose a total of $24bn a year because of the subsidies paid to farmers by rich nations, according to new research by economists in Washington.   \nIn addition to the $24bn lost by poor countries, a further $40bn in agricultural exports could be generated by developing countries if protectionist policies were abandoned by developed nations.   \nCurrent subsidies per cow:   \nEU: $803   \nUSA: $1,057   \nJAPAN: $2,555   \n2. International trade rules are agreed between countries at meetings of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Every country that is a member of the WTO is entitled to be represented and is governed by international trade rules. The US has 250 permanent representatives at the WTO while Bangladesh has only one. Many countries cannot afford to have any representatives.   \n3. Iraq is not poverty-stricken, it has huge oil resources and a well educated population, if it is allowed to trade fairly it will lift itself out of poverty - the $75bn is more in the line of replacing infrastructure destroyed by warfare (much of that amount going to American corporations).   \n4.
