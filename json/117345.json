The closest I can find is [Novecento Sans Cond SemiBold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725045019/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/synthview/novecento/cond-demibold/) but it's not quite right. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725045019im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-18%20at%2012_4552.31.54.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen Shot 2014-06-18 at 12.31.54.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725045019/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-18%20at%2012.31.54.png) | 128.24 KB |\n\n",
