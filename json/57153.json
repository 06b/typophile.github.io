      "content": "The set-up costs are the big up-front expense in printing. There is usually some break point where the savings is negligible if any at all for quantities below a certain amount. For offset printed business cards this is often 1000 units, though it can vary from shop to shop. Less than that and you won't save much, but above that you're just paying for more ink and paper and cutting, and the unit cost drops significantly.\n\nYou might never actually use 1000 business cards before you need to change them, especially coming straight out of school, but it's better to have too many than not enough.\n\n"

If you are a graduating student or a Five Stars General it doesn't matter. Go on and print the cards as you wish.\n\n"

I just had 500 printed, don't plan on moving, and wonder if I'll ever get through them.\n\nHad good luck with vistaprint - it's cheap, fast, the quality is good and if I DO move or change info it's cheap enough to reprint. I got 500 for about $45 including delivery and I went for deluxe stock, printing both sides, etc.\n\n"

      "content": "If you're printing offset (not digital) the printer is making 1000 anyway,  \nmaybe 2000, and throwing out whatever you don't buy.\n\nYour card will be set with many other designs- just one copy of yours per page and 1000  \ncopies printed. It's not worth turning on a press for less, and in fact, the press is so fast, it would be hard to print less- unless you crank it by hand.\n\n"

      "content": "I get lots of business cards from all over the spectrum: from new design grads to seasoned design veterans. Many have been printed on good ink jet printers in these people's workrooms. They print them several-up on letter-size paper, with trim marks. Then they cut them out by hand with a sharp knife while watching TV or something.\n\nYes: they look different than cards printed offset. But if they are designed well and printed on a good printer, and cleanly trimmed out they can be quite good looking.\n\nI have no objection to getting these cards. They can be just as effective. You save lots of money, and you can change info as often as you want. & you waste a lot less paper.\n\npowers\n\n"
