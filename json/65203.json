      "content": "I concur that the handwritten Ε is a little weak. There's no need to make it as bold as the black text, because the red already add to its visual \"weight\". But a little bolder/larger should be better (I would made a little less thin the 40 too).  \nAlso, I think you should align all the red text to the vertical center of the black one and not to the baseline as it is now.\n\n"

Get out the India ink and a brush, and make eight strokes.\n\nIf you feel the need to use a font, don't go with one as readily available as Bradley Hand.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
