  "content": "Greetings Bay Area type friends.\n\nIt's been a while since this group gathered in earnest. Let's fix it. No time better than Saturday, May 20. Why? Because type designer [Alejandro Paul](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181000/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Alejandro%20Paul) will grace our city this weekend - all the way from Argentina. Let's get together and show him a good time north of the border(s).\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Alejandro's work, have a look at [Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181000/http:/sudtipos.com.ar/fonts2.htm) and [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181000/http:/www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=search/results.aspx?keyword=alejandro+paul). Ale is a new master of the script font, with hundreds of releases over the last few years, and a lovely jovial fellow to boot.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\n**Los Details**\n\nWhen: Saturday, May 20, 7:30 p.m. (note, changed from the original plan of 7:00)\n\nWhere: [Maya](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181000/http:/www.yelp.com/biz/Sd061OOPTxMSEdQK4enD8g). Wonderful modern Mexican cuisine in SOMA.\n\nAttending:  \nTamye Riggs  \nZara Evens  \nJoachim Müller-Lancé  \nDelve Withringon  \nStephen Coles  \nLourdes Livingston  \nAmy Conger (?)  \nChristian Robertson  \nCarl Crossgrove  \nAle & wife Laura\n\nPlease reply if you're not listed and I will gladly add you to the reservation.\n\n",

They were very friendly and they choose a really nice (neo-mexican?) restaurant. The guacamole was terrific.\n\nAbout the ligatures I showed them some projects and it was nice to see what they liked more so I ll work with more energy on that. The guys there received a few nice newspapers published during the Letras Latinas exhibition featuring the 70 works selected. So, if you were outisde SF that day, then you missed that :P\n\nAnd they were trying to convince me to go to Typecon, hmmm...who knows\n\n"
