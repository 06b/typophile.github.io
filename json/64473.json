  "content": "Hello -\n\nI'm a design hobbyist without professional training trying my hand at some web/blog concepts. I have two web locations that need critique from qualified folks. Friends and fam are great, but they love and yes to death. After witnessing the hearty reviews typical of the Type Battles, I submit the following for appetites with sharp teeth.\n\n1) My Website -- [http://www.benmyers.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201093315/http:/www.benmyers.org/)  \n(I know the portfolio link is dead)\n\n2) My Blog -- [http://www.honeyedmouth.blogspot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201093315/http:/www.honeyedmouth.blogspot.com/)  \n(I'm getting ready to consolidate and move this to my domain)\n\n3) A website I'm working on for a friend -- [http://www.commonconstruction.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201093315/http:/www.commonconstruction.com/)\n\n(This is my first time soliciting feedback. Anything you have to offer is appreciated)\n\nBen\n\n",
