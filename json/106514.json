  "content": "I am building an interactive grammar tool for middle school students - Quill.org. I am looking for a playful font, and the best font I have found at the moment is Oldenburg. The designer I am working with doesn't like Oldenburg, and he suggests we go with a cleaner font, such as Roboto Slab.\n\nI was hoping that you could take a look at these two wire frames, and let me know whether the Oldenburg works, and if not whether you knew a font that might work?\n\nThank you for taking a look!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Oldenberg.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164506/http:/typophile.com/files/Oldenberg.png) | 270.11 KB |\n| [Roboto Slab Copy.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417164506/http:/typophile.com/files/Roboto%20Slab%20Copy.png) | 253.39 KB |\n\n",
