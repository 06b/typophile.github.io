A font that looks good in one browser on one platform may be almost unreadable elsewhere. This is something that would-be web typographers are going to need to anticipate and test.\n\nThe so-called 'web safe' fonts like Verdana are safe not only in being installed on almost all computers, but also safe in the sense of being readable under a wide variety of different rendering systems and browsers, i.e. they are safe in a way analogous to web safe colours.\n\n"

However, your question about whether web designers will design primarily for Safari users (or Mac users) and let other folks \"see what they see\" ... that is an excellent question. More people need to be concerned about this.\n\nThe CSS disparities between Safari and other browsers are so monumental, and it is so tempting to think only of Safari, that unless other browsers start catching up fast ... well ... Joe Clark is going to have to write another book about the value of accessible design. And why not to design solely for one's most ideal visitors.\n\n"

If so, that's probably why web designers notice that a font that looks great at 13px looks oddly fuzzy and uncoordinated at 15px. Its hints might not be lining it up as well at 15px because the combination of hinting instructions and available pixels might not be as suitable (as the same hints at 13px).\n\n"

And that began with TrueType, with ATM being developed and released in a rush by Adobe, which saved Apple. So you could say that alignment zones and stem hints are fundamental to the digital graphic culture we now have.\n\nNonetheless, a lot of the new typography of the digital era, that got the indie font scene started with grunge and deconstructed type designs, studiously avoided this kind of thing, despite the fact that Fontographer had the necessary hinting tools.\n\n"

Also, bear in mind that the kind of semi-automatic approach I described above -- which is very short of what one can achieve with manual TT hinting in FontLab, and very, very short of what one can do in VTT -- depends on the latest anti-aliasing models. With b/w and greyscale rasterisation, the results are not nearly so good.\n\nFontLab's auto hinting for TT is pretty smart, and the nice thing is that it makes use of whatever level of information you put into a font, as I explained above. You can go further, and convert the PS stem hints to TT instructions and manually edit them, and you can do this for individual glyphs, letting the autohinting look after the others.\n\nHowever, there are things you need to look out for. If your font contains zero-width glyphs with outlines, such as combining marks, FontLab will round these off the origin point at some sizes, causing the width to explode. In that case, you need to convert the PS hints to instructions and manually remove the links to the origin point.\n\n"

John Warnock had to think up a way to get letters to look good at low resolution, because Adobe would have crashed and burned without it. So he came up with the appropriately-named font \"hints\". They just provide general information about font and glyph features which can be interpreted by any rasterizer. It's a very practical approach -- even today, when we're coming back around to \"medium resolution\" environments (high-res LCD screens and such) which became largely irrelevant in printers years ago, but were the primary concern in 1984.\n\nOne can look at all this and say, \"So much technological complexity for something as simple as type!\" or one can acknowledge that building digital fonts has always been a task for knowledgeable and skilled professionals -- for whom good ol' Type 1 hints are fairly straightforward, and an easy way to ensure a digital font is something better than a plain rasterized PostScript path.\n\nI did some extensive TrueType hinting back in the day, and it was brain-numbing but very cool in its way. I don't mean to disparage that approach -- but I think everyone knows it's a lot of work, and difficult to apply to every font that comes down the pike.\n\nBy the way, I am on OS X/Safari, and Proxima Nova looks very nice!\n\n"

No idea!\n\nSearch previous threads on ’vertical metrics’ or “chopped off”.\n\n\\> you could say that alignment zones and stem hints are fundamental to the digital graphic culture we now have...  \nNick... I and other designers want to add the intra and inter glyph white-space to that fundamental list to make possible an end to typographic “x abuse” (we see a lot in this site). But the two main owners of TT/OT think the list is long enough at 2 things, alignment zones and ’page color’. And though ISO, the web’s users, and I ’want it’ otherwise, “type scaling” is set up that way by MS and Apple. Though all of the technology to handle readable web type exists, basically “it’s resolution’s fault” that you can barely ever have optimal quality for your needs.\n\nThen, One could say that this web site’s apparent use of @font-face suffers from low resolution typographic x abuse the site developer has absolutely no control over with these or most outline fonts, now or ever.\\* And the site suffers @font-face abuse from the user’s perspective. I.E. the definition of the top 3/4 of the page as 2 assets, for the foreseeable future, does the user absolutely no good in transmission speed, and may in fact end up with that lovely script text appearing as Verdana, likely doing the publisher of the website nearly no good.

But the sub heads, they are very nice and I like the color scheme.\n\n@Hudson\\> This is, as Si Daniels put it, the ’elephant in the room’ that no one is talking about.\n\nThanks John for repeating a not entirely completely untrue statement. Since 2004 when the final hinting/fontformat/OS environment was being described for its eventual 2007 release from Longhorn into Vista, I and quite a few others have never called this issue an elephant in the room. ;)\n\nOtherwise, “web text readability” has been a rather huge topic here and elsewhere. Search on that instead of ’elephant’ if anyone is interested. The fact that learned type people are supposing an emergency availability situation, and are supporting a new font format to utterly exacerbate the beast raw into a naked and raging elephant, is what surprises me.\n\n\\>The so-called ’web safe’ fonts like Verdana,\n\n...are, as John correctly points out, safe by availability and by contour design, and at 13ppx Verdana is particularly safe because it was drawn to fit that size, (delete the hints and it works about the same at 13, when anti-aliased). But mostly, web safe fonts are safe simply from their original selection as part of a class of published digital outlines to accompany everything; as Courier, Times and Helvetica (et al), are familiar enough for users to “fill in the blur” of the bad sizes, they just barely work. While Verdana et al are by contour design, made to minimize the blur by maximizing critical font-wide type design features, also in familiar forms people are used to.\n\n\\>...I’m cooking something up to help web typographers with that....\n\nI call help, ’recommendations’. When taken from groups of fonts, a data-base of recommendations will provide a web typographer with a ’ball park’ to start testing, or just go with the recommndation, for any particular use. I’d love to see what you cook up but people think adding this meta data to the OT font specification is the quickest and only way to begin addressing web text readability education on the scale required.\n\n\\>...Microsoft needs to rethink how it helps type designers with designing fonts\n\nSee what happened on this forum when I quested for a clear cleartype specification in ’05? Search on “giant pile of excrement”, as far as I recall.\n\n\\>I realize that there are some strong arguments in favor of manually-hinted TrueType fonts with deltas for different sizes...\n\nYou must mean Variations for different sizes. :) Deltas, they may be, that term has been demonized to an evil size-specific blot. Search on “Superpolator”\n\nCheers!\n\n\\*Unless e.g. you set your OT/@FF-friendly browser’s text size to medium, then go to:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/test/franky/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307043426/http:/www.fontbureau.com/test/franky/ \"http://www.fontbureau.com/test/franky/\")  \n...there you can futz with the site’s typographic size and weight controls outside of the evil grip of everyone but me and some of my crazy ideas for “elephant training.”\n\nRemember, set your OT/@FF-friendly browser’s text size to medium, set your OT/@FF-friendly browser’s text size to medium. Don’t forget, set your OT/@FF-friendly browser’s text size to medium.\n\nAlso: You can steal these fonts now if it suits you. Or you can wait, and steal better ones later. Or you can wait until the new font wrapper everyone is so hot for, is thoroughly undressed by time as it surely must be to be accepted, and then you can steal these fonts from that format. See!?

I'll tell everybody when and where one can start licensing the serif font in the raw naked undressed OT format soon. ;) Our plan is to give away all sans fonts, because they are so simple, but (I'm) to charge a vast fortune for licenses to (just) serif faces (kidding;)\n\nThis demo is 'even better than bitmaps' down to the bottom sizes, perhaps? and this is what elephant-aware type designers assumed (1994-98), then hoped (1999-2007), but now can only wish user's type looked like down to small sizes. Momma Apple and Daddy MS didn't get along on the TT/scaler/rasterizing-thingy, with each other, or with type's more industrious developers, and uncle Adobe didn't care then — so now, they get most of you design types, ISO, W3C and the biggest text-composing user-community, quality-puzzled. I get the rich who need solutions ahead of most other users, which might sound vile to you, but it makes this time possible. Speaking of which...\n\nFranky and the type it produces, was a 2007, 31-day, 45-style, font lab beating on a demo agate for screens to counter the contention that there is no alternative to the 'well-studied' OS-default scaling techniques when deployed via default web font-sizing and then applied to small font sizes on computer screens. If type developers (e.g. me), can't control completely enough, the size-specific x dimension variation via hinting because of MS' scaler, e.g., and can't give users size-specific x dimension variation via any other means besides changing the contour, font name and forcing its use at only one ppm size, then that's what I had/have to do. It allows me, as I explained to Greg Hitchcock at Sota Seattle, to avoid all the format, scaler, rendering and web composition barriers to type quality — all I need is a baseline, a pixel-per-em, (a tiny user interface, @font-face and repeated warnings to set your browser to the medium fonts size, which I didn't have then, but I have now), and I can undress CT and Quartz quality for this purpose.\n\nOne sub-thing I also had to deal with, as your exploration of Franky benefits from, was people saying 'it's too light' or 'it's too heavy'. This has nothing to do with the detailed problem at hand, while having everything to do with the general problem at hand. Thus one can play with the text weight in this demo, but with a severe limit on the expansion of the text as the goal. Smaller sizes could get heavier, but as each pixel becomes proportionally larger at small sizes they would get really wide, so the smaller sizes don't get really wide in this demo, and some sizes get too tight.\n\nIf a lot of people agree on this realm of quality for small sizes (8-12 ppm), then we can move on to the middle sizes (13-26), where less of the same thing is required but variation for size is still required. And if everybody agrees then that text and agate is better this way, then much less of this kind of work and much more kerning, is required for display types. So, don't get me wrong, it's not all the scaling OS' fault, that browsers are just not OT-table-aware enough yet is clearly an up-n-coming issue.\n\nI'm reminded always to remind you, with the PERM table, (unless it's called EPAR), part of this elephantine issue can be addressed. Without EPAR, there is little chance, in my humble opinion, of anything but a typographic idiocracy followed by more generalized idiocracy, far more idiotic than we now have. I don't think a few billion computers not knowing what year it was, was a problem compared to this. Back then, we all knew what year it was, and if not we could pick up a newspaper and (delighting subliminally in the quality of the text), read all about it. :-)\n\nCheers!\n\n"

I just heard yesterday that the NW is baking, and I hope it passes soon, in the meantime, it's funky, raw, and naked time.\n\n\\>Does the emUnits/pixel ratio change across the different sizes of Franky, or is it constant?\n\nIt changes, because the units per em was kept constant. This is not important unless something does want to react to pixels per units, as the Perm table, and my proposed Size table are designed to slightly enable.\n\n\\>David, following your PERM proposal, how would you set the “Scaling” recommendations for a design built on a 13ppem grid, but delivered as a CFF font with 1000 upm, to be used at 8px size and its multiples? :-/\n\nThe first half if easy, but why exactly would one want to deliver for the wrong size? I.E. if it's for 13 ppm, it should not be used at 8, 16 or 24?\n\nTomorrow, I'll try to republish the expanding list of requirements to make Franky Quality happen, hopefully without Franky Quantity ;)\n\nCheers!\n\n"
