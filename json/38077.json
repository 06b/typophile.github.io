Mostly to devise and establish annual event, and sponsorship plans, as well as public relations and conference organisers. Most of their clients are corporate sector.\n\nThe client wanted a logo with cingularesque look, like abstract views of a meeting or people communicating. They also wanted an appealing and charismatic shape.\n\nThe logo: The clients wanted a personality / human feel, not just another marketing firm or a brand management not as they exist on data sheets but in peoples minds. The two shapes an ascending joined piece, meeting or people communicating...facing each other on positive right direction, only to show ascension, growth, positivity, forward etc.\n\nI’d appreciate suggestions on how can I tighten it up the logo so it holds together as a unified form? I feel something is missing or how can I infuse it with a bit more energy?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [opts.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011054126/http:/typophile.com/files/opts.gif) | 49.16 KB |\n\n [‹ Ocean Child - Clothing/Fashion brand](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011054126/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38241 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [MAQ new concepts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011054126/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36648 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’m on the other side of the Atlantic pond so I’ll bear that in mind. Interesting logo though....water droplets, hot/cold...that is the way I see it.\n\nI’ve talked to my client about changing the approach of the logo...they’re sticking to their cingularesque look, like abstract views of a meeting or people communicating. I’ll try and play around and I’ll see what I’ll come up with.\n\nThank you DOGG for pointing out Moen.\n\n"

Rather than point out similarities (I don’t think Moen really counts) the type will benefit from better kerning, ‘ener’ and ‘communicates’ are very tight and in the case of ‘communicates’ too small. It is crucial to test logos at the sizes that they will be used at – start with a business card up to the side of a van or exhibition panel. The g and y are currently a bit wide and light compared to the density of ‘ener’, whether they should be adapted or the ‘ener’ altered is up to you. I enjoy the two storey g versions although both the characters are facing in the same direction, perhaps the bottom storey could be reflected.\n\nTim\n\n"

I’m aware the ‘ener’ and ‘communicates’ are very tight and in the case of ‘communicates’ is too small.\n\nFor now I just want to focus the logo itself and get it right of abstract views of a meeting or people communicating.  \n- the the two storey g versions  \n- reflected the two storey g versions.  \n- four shapes all in the same direction except the green one to give the impression of public relations and conference.\n\nI’d appreciate your thoughts on modified concepts and which one work the best?\n\nThe logo wil never be on a van or on a TV!!! Most definity on printed stationery, website, company literate, promotions, ads, pull up stands & t-shirts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011054126im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/opts_3704...gif)\n\n"

If you want energy, look at size relationships and interactions between the elements in the logo and/or the type. The lowercase ’g’ could be revised so the point in the counter points up to the right, then maybe you could have some of your other elements extend from that, almost like it was sparking or something. It’ll require a bit of work to get there, though. And while color can be part of the equation here, it shouldn’t be the only one. The form itself should give off enough energy and dynamism that a lack of color won’t undo it.\n\nAlso, “communicates” is still way too small to be readable on a business card. Your original lockup is better, albeit still too-tightly letterspaced.\n\n"
