  "content": "After my talk in for ATypI this past October on the Jim Rimmer film project, several people came up to me and asked what they could do to help me finish the film.\n\nI have decided to set up this somewhat unusual fund raising method to help with the finishing of the film. It is asking for donations but those donations are basically pre-ording things that could be bought in the future anyway.\n\n[http://kck.st/aTulSg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418101949/http:/kck.st/aTulSg \"http://kck.st/aTulSg\")\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\n",
