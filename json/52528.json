In that video, Thomas Milo of Decotype who is the key person behind the software was demonstrating how to convert a plain text title into a calligraphic piece!\n\n-Saad\n\n"

      "content": "Yes Saad it was very impressive. I posted it in our community site and they were amazed. I hope a simplified version of its text engine become the standard rendering in computers. A simplified version that then could port the text to professional tools such as Tasmeem for graphic enhancements.  \nIf designers could design only different patterns of a string of characters (their body only) then position their individual dots and vowels etc., all by remaining in Unicode encoding logic, the Arabic script can benefit in computer usage as a whole and not just in specialized graphic tools.  \nThis is the area I'm not very clear about Decotype project. I don't know how much of it depends on specially designed font tools to facilitate this concept and how much of it depends on the behaviour of the text engine itself.\n\n"

I don’t know how much of it depends on specially designed font tools to facilitate this concept and how much of it depends on the behaviour of the text engine itself.\n\nDecotype or DT format fonts only need to supply main letter forms and diacretic dots and vowels separately, based on a variety of Tasmeem FL template. The engine in Tasmeem would then set text by default with diacritic placement and inter-word spacing as desired by font designer. A font for Tasmeem can be as simple as a typical OT Arabic font, but it can take advantage of many of layout engine features on the fly.\n\n-Saad\n\n"

Here's one I prepared, but withdrew after a few days, because of the low quality of the conversion (I find u-toob a bad medium for typographic demo's - you lose too much detail. ):\n\n[www.decotype.com/MARA/MaraLayout02.mov.zip](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414214102/http:/www.decotype.com/MARA/MaraLayout02.mov.zip \"www.decotype.com/MARA/MaraLayout02.mov.zip\")\n\nIt shows Tasmeem work on what appears highly calligraphic typesetting, but that must be attributed to the Naskh typeface. It doesn't take a lot of imagination that such tools are also very practical for typesetting regular text.\n\nThomas Milo  \nDecoType  \n [www.decotype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414214102/http:/www.decotype.com/ \"www.decotype.com\")\n\n"
