  "content": "Can anyone recommend me a book on how to creat a type? I’ve been looking for it for such a long time. It is NOT a book to teach me how to use Fontographer, not a book to teach me how to lettering; BUT a book containing wisdom and experience of the precursors in the type history, a book containing detailed materials of how curves and edges have been made in that way.\n\nBooks can be found on Amazon or United States would be preffered. Thanks a lot.\n\n [‹ What should I pair with Gill?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203009/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14333 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Searching for graphic designers in Chisinau / Moldavia ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203009/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14401 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
