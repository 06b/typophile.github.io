  "content": "Hello folks,\n\nIs anyone watching The Ashes cricket coverage on Channel 4? They are using an interesting font in their graphics. I am betting it is a custom-made job - looks a bit like something Identikal would put out…(?). Anyone know the font and the story behind it? The sample below is all I can find.\n\nRegards  \nPAUL  \n [SkyRocket Design Co](http://web.archive.org/web/20051126214335/http:/www.skyrocket.com.au/)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cricket.gif](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=cricket.gif) | 959 bytes |\n\n",
