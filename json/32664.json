A few responses I received were:\n\n1] They are made by different type foundries but essentially the same. (As I recall they were designed by Erik Spiekermann?)\n\n2] Some are better used as body text and others for signage?\n\n3] Some are used as Light and Bold sets?\n\nCan someone out there help distinquish between them? Thank you.\n\n",

Don't know what LL means; Light Lining (figures)??\n\n"

[Lining Figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20100504081729/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lining%2520Figures) actually means the numbers line up horizontally. You could call them \"all caps\" or \"titling\" figures. Lining figs can be proportionally spaced. TF stands for [Tabular Figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20100504081729/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Tabular%2520Figures) which means they all have same width for tabluar setting.\n\nI have never heard of Meta LL.\n\n"
