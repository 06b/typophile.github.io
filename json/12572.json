He has a lovely family and a lovely foundry. He is quick to help and slow to anger. He laughs at my jokes and listens to my music. I love this man.\n\nHere’s the best to you, Petah! Looking forward to hearing you and Stefan speak at TypeCon. (You’ve become quite the lecturer in your old age.)\n\nAnd now, [a song](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111221045/http:/stewf.com/stewftone/Happy%20Svensk%20Birthday.mp3).\n\n"
