I would love to design the next Helvetica or Times so I am compelled to experiment to figure out what works and why with text designs.   \n   \nIt's like sitting down to design a display font and saying my goal is to create something that looks like a 1940s Chinese menu. I can easily judge the success of the face or not when I've gotten a few glyphs into it. I think the same goes for a text face if I define a goal for it before I start.   \n   \nI enjoy making fonts, all kinds of fonts and I highly suggest that a type design NEEDS to actually make both kinds at least once.

AW, 2 KEWT!   \n   \n\\>reading theory is bunk   \n   \nA. Scott's question was 'do you find the designing of text faces to be too \"academic\"?'   \nNo, but discussing it can get that way.   \n   \nAs far as I'm concerned, reading theory has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the CRAFT of making a typeface. The old guys who designed all the most readable faces managed perfectly well without if FOR CENTURIES.   \n   \nSure, science and LOGIC can help explain how people and things work, but whenever they are used as the basis of creativity the results tend to be BANAL and inhuman.   \n   \nAs Rilke said (sorry, this is from memory, of a translation) \"ONLY THROUGH LOVE can one understand a work of art\". There's enough art in typography to make his statement applicable.   \n   \n\\>I honestly consider text to BE display just with more rules and different goals.   \n   \nRight on, Stuart. And I'm sure that's the way Nic Jenson worked on the definitive roman type, which was what we would consider a large text size, around 14 pt in size. Like all subsequent type designers who have produced a smooth text face, he was obviously very UP CLOSE AND INTIMATE WITH HIS GLYPHS, and THE WAY THEY COMBINE with one another.   \n   \nFor text, as opposed to display, the principles are simple:   \n1. Sturdier details (eg thicker hairlines and serifs)   \n2. Avoid small counters   \n3. Wider sidebearings and serifs   \nIt's that simple -- if you follow these principles, you can turn any display type into a text type. However, if your typeface has uneven color as a display face, it will have uneven color as a text face too, and such faults tend to be more obvious at text size.\n\n"

And then one day I took a really good look at it (since I had come into possession of a large number of matrices for casting it) and discovered that to my new eyes, it was lovely.   \n   \nI get a little tired of type police. For the past 20 years or more my attitude has been that there is no bad type, some are just better than others. If you apply yourself, you can make any type work, with the possible exception of Murray Hill. I do reserve the right to dislike something.   \n   \nI think that if any type has gone through the jury system of a respected, established manufacturer it can't really be inept.   \n   \nTo answer your other question I like the following sans for both text and display.   \n   \nFutura   \nHess Sans Serif   \nPhiladelphia Lining Gothic   \nPlate Gothics (Copperplate)   \nGill Sans   \nGoudy Sans   \n49J Gothic (Lanston Monotype   \nTwentieth Century   \nUnivers   \nHelvetica   \nOptima   \nFranklin Gothic (Looks great in 8 point, Yummy!)   \nNew sGothic 206   \nGrotesque (English Monotype)   \nKabel   \n   \nAnd all seriousness, I would add Cheltenham to my Roman list.   \n   \nHrant:   \n   \nIf the type I listed did not come out to be the same typeface as when they were metal types that is hardly the fault of the metal types. In any event the ones that I am aware of that are available on the computer still look pretty good to me. Probably because the maker has done extensive scaling and altering. Some of the current Garamonds look a little stiff-assed, and kind of missed the whole point that Garamond should be \"uneven\".   \n   \nA parting comment re sans. Scour the internet and look for the new Ancient Greek (sans) that Dann Carr has cut for a book titled Fragments of Parmenides, printed and published by Peter Koch. The text was translated by Robert Bringhurst. It's a really lovely type, and another version has been done digitally, but at the moment I can't recall who did that one.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

I have seen others do the same kind of thing and the effect is striking. So perhaps this is a little off the discussion, but it IS the use of a display type for text. If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and set the same text the effect might be less successful.   \n   \nThere have been many comparison studies made by scaling different type-size fonts to a common size to compare weight and stroke. I don't think anyone ever came to common understanding over it. So a text face is often huskier and has differing perameters, and if you blow it up, it becomes a medium weight, and not always graceful.   \n   \nSumner Stone designed a lovely face that he has named Arepo, and considers it a display face. I wonder if it wouldn't serve well as a text type. It has all the attributes of a type that would serve in text. It's very attractive, but doesn't holler and shout or draw attention to any one letter.   \n   \nJim Rimmer\n\n"

      "content": "\\> text reading have to be transparece to the reader, but   \n\\> pleasent forms are refreshing if they work technically good.   \n   \nNo face can -or should- be totally transparent. But there is a qualitative difference between the transparency needed in text versus display design, and this is due to the nature of the intended reading experience: deliberative, where we have time to read a handful of words and we can consciously appreciate the formal details; versus immersive, where the subconsious reading mechanism takes over, because it becomes a performance issue. Readability really only matters when a reader is pushing the limits of perception/cognition - otherwise virtually everything is pretty legible.   \n   \n\\> it IS the use of a display type for text.   \n   \nOnly if you use a peculiar -maybe pointless- definition of \"text\".   \nReally _any_ text is \"text\", even if it's one word. But a _useful_ definition of \"text\" versus \"display\" entails a consideration of how humans read. It's been shown for example that when a font is too large reading slows down a lot. So to me \"text\" means a setting that crosses into the subconscious, immersive mechanism. This is where boumas start to matter, and where an x-height can be too large for example, or spacing too loose. This to me is a useful boundary to think about in the text/display discussion.   \n   \n\\> If you scaled that same display fce down into 12 point and   \n\\> set the same text the effect might be less successful.   \n   \nExactly, and not just aesthetically, but functionally.   \nAnd what does that tell you?   \n   \n\\> not always graceful.   \n   \nExactly. And that's why I say \"ugliness\" has merit in text face design, because it's really only ugly at the deliberative level. At the immersive level it's _required_ to make a text font \"click\" for real.   \n   \n(I wish Walter Tracy were alive, and a Typophiler...)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "It seems to me that generally a text type should be artistically strong enough to work for display, if it is optically scaled (big sizes 'go on a diet' for display). In other words, the letter forms will still be identifiable as the same face at both sizes. It may not be great at display, but it should look pretty darn good. The only exceptions would be designs for very small sizes like Bell Centenial or Biblion, where there are extreme distortions for the sake of legibility at a very small size.   \n   \nBut the other way around doesn't work. There are excellent display types that won't work at all as text. There is an assymetry here.   \n   \nI think Hrant is right that the two different kinds of reading are different, and for extended text the typeface must be able to become transparent. If it is so mannered that it cannot become transparent it will fail as text type.   \n   \nBut he is wrong in ignoring that we also look at that same text type in what he calls the 'deliberative' way. We aren't always immersed. We look at the page, the subheads, the first few words more slowly. We go in and out of immersion. That's why the aesthetics and flavor of the text type are important. Ugly is a liability in a text type also, in my opinion, unless it is absolutely tiny, so the legibility trumps every other consideration.\n\n"
