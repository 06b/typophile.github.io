I would say the [Font Bureau version](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414024225/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel/) but the N is different. Nobel was released in 1929, just two years after Futura.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414024225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/council_4631.jpg)\n\n"

Considering it could be based on Nobel, then it seems they also modified the \"N\", which looks close to Futura.\n\nWhat is your opinion on modifying a font this way, with elements that are clearly typical from another font? Personally, I do like the overall result. But for a true typophile, wouldn't this approach lack consistency?\n\n"

As long as it holds together visually, I don't mind the Dr. Frankenstein approach--provided the stitches and bolts aren't visible.\n\nToo many times I've tried to help someone ID a logo typeface on this forum, and they've expressed disappointment that it wasn't a readily available typeface without alterations. Landor always does very subtle work (some may call it boring), but making the complex look simple and effortless is a real talent.\n\nBetter than the alternative: [http://cuttingedgelogos.tumblr.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414024225/http:/cuttingedgelogos.tumblr.com/ \"http://cuttingedgelogos.tumblr.com/\")\n\n"
