  "content": "I’m back, but I am desperate. :-)  \nI have Perla alternate (lower case) as my logotype - first question, would it look too confusing and “messy” to pick another font for the word “Collections” and for the names of the collections, or should I go with Perla all the way? The problem is that it’s very hard to read it when it’s a smaller size and it has to be smaller than the first page on the web site. And secondly, would it be even more confusing to choose two different fonts for the two collections and keep the rest of the text in something neutral like “Century gothic” or something more “clean”? I’ve been thinking about this -after someone suggested it to me - and it is a good alternative to the fact that I didn’t managed to get symbols for the two collections.\n\nIf I should just go for Perla all the way except for the rest of the text, can anyone suggest a font that would match? Thank you!! :-)\n\n [‹ Japanese display fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905094020/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34334 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Contemporary Caslon-like font ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905094020/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34099 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There are many that would work with Perla.\n\nStorm’s Walbaum is a great choice, or Emigre’s Filosofia (I hear the spacing is improved). Both look nice on screen. Or a geometric sans like Proxima Nova, Gotham, Avenir, Futura for a different effect. That’s your call.\n\n"

I’m racing against the clock to get this web site  \nlaunched because selling jewelry is my sole income now and I  \nhad no one else to ask for help. But when you and others asked  \nme to post an image of the logo, a person who works with me  \non this (with marketing) advised me against it. He thought I  \nrisked having someone else “steal” the name. I have - as you  \nknow - previously posted the names of the collections  \nand several pictures of my jewelry (probably not that smart  \neither) and was actually cautioned by someone at Typophile  \nto get the rights before another company stole my ideas. So I  \ntold the truth and that was the main reason not to do it.  \nBut having said that, I’m sure you’re right too. Part of me  \ndoesn’t want to reveal anything more about me because of  \nwhat happened, which is really sad, because that’s not who  \nI am and that’s not how I felt when I first became a  \nmember.
