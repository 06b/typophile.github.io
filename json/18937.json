There are Suomi Script, Serif and Slab Serif.  \nThis one is a fairly narrow font with a hint of calligraphic forms attached for a bit of character. I have finished the Roman and Italics ranges, and currently working with the Small Caps, OSF, and some OT features…\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012054247im_/http:/typophile.com/files/SuomiSans.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Nice work.  \nTwo pence from me though:\n\nIn my opinion (and going by what i can make out of the image supplied), for the sake of consistency, it would be worth a try to have that calligraphic, \"broken\" stroke also on lc u, n, m, etc, in the same vein as it is featured in s and o.\n\nthe second thing is that your weights appear smaller with increasing weight (which is a known phenomenon), for my liking you should increase your x-height a bit with each weight compared to the respective lighter one, to compensate for that effect (I assume that all your weights share an identical x-height?).\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you very much for the insights.\n\nAnd sorry about the limited sample; I seem to have some problems uploading attachemts…\n\nIn fact I have a logic (of sorts) to the \"broken\" strokes: they are on the upper left, and lower right, to follow the nib of a pen. th lc u, n etc. are cut before the intake.\n\nOn the second thing you are right; I haven't incerased the x-height. I should do that to compensate the mass of the glyphs. Thanks.\n\n"
