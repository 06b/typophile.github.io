Have you heard the latest buzz over the James Cameron film Avatar, but the latest rumor and talk about the science fiction epic is that it is racist. Obviously, there are contingents of people out there with too much free time and not enough intelligence, but the story goes that James Cameron and Avatar are racist because the hero is white and male and saves a non-Caucasian alien race, which is less militaristic, industrial with a more egalitarian culture. By that logic, so is Dances with Wolves, and Lawrence of Arabia, yet those films aren't pilloried as such. Honestly, serious people would give payday loans at least to make such ill-conceived arguments go away.\n\n"

Man 'o' man, what a trip! Couldn't socialize, couldn't move away from the creative process, I could barely eat - sleep when exhausted. At the end of it all I managed to open doors into many different worlds.  \nIncluding getting a shot to have my type based sculpture (which I created and built over the last two years!) shown in our National Gallery up here in Canada! Presentation coming up in early May.\n\nIntense crazy run. I'm still a little wobbly. But feel well and chatty. I was formally known as Hiroshige / Hiro. Great to see some familiar faces still kickin' 'round these hallowed halls.\n\n"

While you are at it why not get rid of that gray background and make the font a bit larger for us old fogies to read more comfortably?\n\n"
