  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs many of you may know, I've been playing drums in British/Belgian pop/rock band Troubleman for over 10 years. If you want to know what we do, where we've been, and sample our music please visit our [MySpace](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234855/http:/www.myspace.com/troublemantheband) or [Facebook](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234855/http:/www.facebook.com/pages/Troubleman/8599842637) page. In the increasingly difficult music business the quality of your music isn't sufficient enough for a breakthrough and a band needs all the help it can get.\n\nNow that our second album is out we might have a shot at something more serious. Bel-RTL has a new concept for Sunday nights between 9PM and midnight. Three bands are featured on the Bel RTL website and during the broadcast. Every Sunday the band that garnered the most votes will get airplay and an interview on the premier radio of the French community in Belgium. Troubleman was selected for the first broadcast with \"Radio\", so vote for us! It's simple -- just click the link below and select \"Troubleman\" in the list.  \n [http://www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016234855/http:/www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge \"http://www.belrtl.be/allaccessbelge\")\n\nVoting ends on Tuesday midnight, so there's a little over 24 hours left. Thank all of you who decide to help us. ;^)\n\n",
