  "content": "hi there,\n\ni'm looking for a \"good\" sans family free font that license allows embedding. as far as i remembered bitstream's vera was a good choice, but when i try to embedd it (in adobe designer) it gives me the message that vera's font license does not allow embedding?!\n\ni'm looking for at least 2 faces because i'm doing business forms design which need dynamic contents (pre-filled by the system and/or the user), so i need a least a regular and bold face :)\n\nany further suggestion for an alternative to vera?\n\nthanks: lars\n\n",

The DejaVu package currently contains 21 fonts, and is updated every month.\n\n"

Having said that, if you find a free font you like, I can't see why the creator wouldn't be willing to set the font to editable if you were to ask - probably something they just overlooked.\n\n"
