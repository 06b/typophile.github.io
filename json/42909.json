The 24 style family marks the magazine’s  \nfirst significant typographic update in a decade. Scout created  \na new typographic identity for the magazine with a design that  \nderives structural elements from both new and old: DIN, Venus,  \nand Cairoli (a quirky and forgotten Aldo Novarese typeface).\n\n24 Styles: thin, extra light, light, regular, bold, and black  \nwith italics in normal and condensed widths.\n\nExplore Scout on our website at:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/Scout](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.fontbureau.com/Scout \"http://www.fontbureau.com/Scout\")\n\nAvailable from Font Bureau and its distributors.\n\nTo find out more about the type designer, Cyrus Highsmith, go to:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/people/CyrusHighsmith](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.fontbureau.com/people/CyrusHighsmith \"http://www.fontbureau.com/people/CyrusHighsmith\")\n\nFB MODERNO\n\nIntended for display use in print publications, David Berlow  \nconceived FB Moderno as a relative of Giza, our famous slab serif.  \nHe used Apple’s (later abandoned) GX technology to interpolate  \nbetween two 19th century serif styles, a “slab” and a “modern” -  \na type design first!\n\nAfter being adopted by Eduardo Danilo for the design of Reforma  \nin Mexico City (1993), and then Roger Black’s redesign of the  \nBaltimore Sun (1994-95), and by Esquire magazine, the Montreal  \nGazette expanded the family under Louise Vincent. Cases i Associats  \nadded even more weights for La Stampa in Turin.\n\nDavid has now aligned the weights and widths to make a super 32  \nstyle family, in much the same manner he tamed Bureau Grot to  \nmake a wide mix of styles. This is a classic (actually neo-classical)  \nFont Bureau tale of custom font development. The result, we offer  \na complete 21st Century Modern Family to you: FB Moderno (Modern is  \nthe traditional name for Bodoni-like typefaces that have a lot of  \ncontrast between thicks and thins).\n\n32 Styles: light, regular, semibold, and bold in normal, condensed,  \nextra condensed, and compressed widths. All with italics.\n\nCome see FB Moderno on our website at:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/ModernoFB](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.fontbureau.com/ModernoFB \"http://www.fontbureau.com/ModernoFB\")\n\nAvailable from Font Bureau and its distributors.\n\nTo find out more about the type designer, David Berlow, go to:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/people/DavidBerlow](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.fontbureau.com/people/DavidBerlow \"http://www.fontbureau.com/people/DavidBerlow\")\n\nNEWS\n\nBenton Modern Expansion  \nNew styles have been added to this great news text type from our  \nReadability Series, including Bold, Italic, and Small Caps for Roman,  \nItalic and Bold, all in four grades.  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModern](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModern \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModern\")\n\nType 101  \nCheck out Font Bureau’s blog, where we share occasional notes  \nabout type and typography.

Hist.” and Matthew Carter’s “It’s The Little Things”  \ndiscussed recent innovations in presenting stock tables, sports  \nagate, and other small information. Both were invited to lead the  \nTypography Roundtable, a discussion on trends from readability  \nto revivals.\n\nTYPO Berlin  \nDavid Berlow has been invited to speak at the 13th international  \ndesign conference of TYPO Berlin, to be held this May.

Boomer, Highsmith’s  \noriginal typeface drawn for AARP The Magazine in 2006, was also  \nused for that issue.\n\nHelvetica: A Documentary Film by Gary Hustwit  \nReleased in 2007 Helvetica is an independent film “about typography,  \ngraphic design and global visual culture…the proliferation of  \none typeface as part of a larger conversation about the way type  \naffects of lives.” Matthew Carter and Mike Parker, distinguished  \nmembers of Font Bureau’s type board, were interviewed for the film,  \nas well as a Font Bureau contributing type designer, Tobias  \nFrere-Jones. After showing in over 150 film festivals worldwide,  \nits global screening tour continues and is now available on DVD.  \nIt was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award and recognized  \nby the Design Museum in London.  \n [http://www.helveticafilm.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.helveticafilm.com/ \"http://www.helveticafilm.com/\")\n\nNOTEWORTHY\n\nFont Bureau contributing type designer Christian Schwartz was  \nawarded the eighth Prix Charles Peignot by Association Typographique  \nInternationale (AtypI) this past September.  \n [http://www.atypi.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.atypi.org/ \"http://www.atypi.org/\")\n\nMatthew Carter acted as Jury Chair of TDC2 2008, the Type Director’s  \nClub annual international competition of new typeface designs.  \n [http://www.tdc.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080412130244/http:/www.tdc.org/ \"http://www.tdc.org/\")\n\nSTAY TUNED\n\nOur next upcoming releases will include two new serif displays,  \nBenton Modern Display, prepared by Dyana Weissman and Richard Lipton,  \nand Rocky, crafted by Matthew Carter.\n\n",
