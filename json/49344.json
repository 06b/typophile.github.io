  "content": "Searching for a font that conveys movement or mobility for a technology company. My first thought was to use an oblique or italic typeface, but it's an obvious and expected solution. And it tends to look too sporty or automotive (nascar). There there might be something a little more subtle, yet distinctive. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",
