In the late 60s into the late 70s they made type with no leading and kerned dog into god (super tight) then came the ulta loose revolution double line spacing and loose spacing. I'm seeing a swing towards tight spacing again, but, I hope, not tight leading. Its about content and not design, I hate to say it but its true.\n\n"
