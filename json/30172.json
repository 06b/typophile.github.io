Really looking for something that would fit with a sort of new age vitality mentality without being trendy. Feel free to plug your own work, I’m looking for some suggestions to table to the client.\n\nJ.\n\n [‹ Need input on font choice to go along with a logo.](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104142640/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30122 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [A delicate Didone ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071104142640/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30094 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
