  "content": "Hello, everybody. This is to let you know of my latest font release: Riff. It's my third typeface design and the first more \"serious\" one. Since I have no formal type design education, it's always a great deal of work to figure things out. Hope you enjoy it. Hope you buy it. Hope. :)\n\n[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudiocrop/riff/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020182721/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudiocrop/riff/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/estudiocrop/riff/\")\n\nThanks for your time. Feedback's apreciated.  \nCheers!\n\nDado  \n [www.dadoqueiroz.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020182721/http:/www.dadoqueiroz.com/ \"www.dadoqueiroz.com\")  \nwww.flickr.com/dadoqueiroz\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020182721im_/http:/typophile.com/files/riff-flickr_4190.png)\n\n",
