Here are a few other ideas (sorry but don’t have time to link these):  \n- Rosewood (Adobe) although it’s overused it’s still great  \n- Brothers or Council (Emigre)  \n- Egyptienne Condensed  \n- good ’ol Clarendon\n\nAlso keep in mind that when you say “country” it could mean a lot of things. There’s a big difference between Hank Williams (classic country) and Shania Twain (contemporary). I’m blowing hot air a bit here since I don’t listen to, or care for country music. I do however live in Nashville. Good luck.\n\n"

I recently did a piece for Tracy Byrd and it was filled with the Rosewoods of this world. So it really depends on the artist and what they want to represent themselves as…  \npeace\n\n"
