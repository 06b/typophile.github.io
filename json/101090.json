  "content": "To help with a project I'm currently working on I created a uranges.dat file which is somewhat more up-to-date than the one included with FontLab. To save others from some some rather mindless and laborious typing I thought I'd upload it here. I make no guarantees that it is complete -- just that it is more complete than the one which is included with FontLab. I also make no guarantees that it is 100% error free.\n\nTo use, just change the extension from .txt to .dat (the .txt sufffix was necessary to to overcome forum rules on attachments) and place it in ~Library/Application Support/FontLab/Data.\n\nI assume this will also work for PCs, but have no idea where it needs to be stored on a PC.\n\nAndré\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [uranges.txt](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809162634/http:/typophile.com/files/uranges.txt) | 59.64 KB |\n\n",
