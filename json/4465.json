In Unicode or Windows based encodings, put each in its proper place.   \n   \nIf you need to worry about non Adobe Classic Mac apps, there are some extra wrinkles, which I've long since lost track of. I'm sure somebody else will chime in....   \n   \nT\n\n"

Each gets its own slot, and the euro will show up in the right place for MacRoman, including on Classic and OS 8/9.   \n   \nBut you need to have both for Windows and full Unicode environments. WinANSI has separate slots for the two, and Windows users and folks in full Unicode environments will think there's something wrong if a euro shows up in place of the generic currency symbol.   \n   \nT\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Eric, don't worry, OT fonts (as other fonts based on TrueType table structure) have room for 65536 glyphs. It's enough for all currencies, which Unicode knows. I'm not sure, whether anybody needs the original currency sign for some purpose. Most Non-Unicode-savvy OS'ies and applications can't handle both currency (00A4) and Euro (20AC) sign in the same time, because they excist in (practically) no single 8-bit character set. A good rule of thumb: when dealing with OT fonts forget old apps and OS'ies. In practice you may put Euro sign in both slots, nobody will hardly complain.\n\n"

      "content": "What Juhani says about non-Unicode-savvy OSes and applications is not true. **All** the Windows codepages for European languages have both euro and currency characters in separate slots (Western/WinANSI, Eastern European, Cyrillic, Baltic, Turkish, Greek). Microsoft extended their codepages to add the euro many years ago. These codepages are what single-byte fonts and applications work with.   \n   \nAlthough the currency symbol has few practical uses as a currency symbol, a lot of folks have ended up using it as a bullet or other kind of dingbat. Switching fonts and having it turn into a euro symbol would be a Bad Thing, and I have heard Windows users complain about it in fonts made by people who didn't know better.   \n   \nThere is no reason whatsoever to put a euro (U+20AC) symbol in the currency (U+00A4) slot in an OpenType CFF font. For Classic and OS 8/9, the ATM driver maps the euro to the right slot in MacRoman for both viewing and printing.   \n   \nBut there are good reasons NOT to double-map the euro symbol, as described above. So, for anybody asking for advice, I strongly discourage it, just as I would strongly discourage putting a euro in the slot intended for the letter E.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"
