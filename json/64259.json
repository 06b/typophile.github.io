  "content": "I have been working on a freelance project for a close friend of mine. She’s starting up her own small local record label. Only problem is that out of the sketches that I showed her, this was the one that she happened to like. Three weeks later I notice that it looks phallic. Anyone have any ideas? The name of the record label is Black Catalyst Records. Long text to work with. Yet another design challenge.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091120050748im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/img008_3824.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091120050748im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/blackcatalyst_4763.jpg)\n\n",

Mirroring the c is causing the b to look bad, the additional little rotation is not helping — just falling over. Start by rotating 180 only, and redrawing as needed, but keeping the same angle of modulation (thick/thin flow).\n\nThe \\*ahem\\* head serif on the b could be given more emphasis to the left and jac’s suggestion of hard edges would completely remove any anatomical reference.\n\ndb thanks for the laugh.\n\n"
