Hmmm.   \n   \nWhen I remember the 80s I remember Memphis style with lots of wavy lines and Univers Condensed Oblique set on an angle to match the slant. Remember that?   \n   \nAnd Charles S. Anderson and the retro, rubber stamp feeling. Maybe some Torino or Corvinus Skyline or Fenice. Or maybe even just some Cheltenham Condensed.   \n   \nI also think of early Neville Brody stuff -- Industria, Arcadia. Or maybe early Emigre -- Modula, Senator, Base 9.   \n   \nThat's some of what says the 80s to me.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>Cooper black How does a 20s typeface have an 80s flair? :-) Still used as VIVA TVs principal font, though... Eerie, to see that font on young music television... Fonts with massive 80s flair, imo are the various works of Neville Brody, mostly available through Fontshop and Linotype. The standard, non Fontshop-modded DIN-Schrift also was very big, at least in Germany, in the 80s, used in a mag named TEMPO. Not a font from the 80s, but it fit the cold and sterile tone of the times. Many Emigre Fonts stem from the 80s, especially their bitmap work like Oakland. Also, Modular and Triplex suggest themselves, but I'm not sure they're from the 80s originally. Also, if we go late-80s, there were already some Instant Fonts in Use. VERY late 80s, we got the Beowolf by Letteror. Despite being called the Helvetica of the 90s, Erik Spiekermanns Meta was originally created in the mid-80s and somehow has an 80s Flair, imo, till today. Also, if you look at Vaughan Olivers stellar work, a nice step back in history is okay, so even Garamond and Sabon or specimen from old books can be used.\n\n"

(I hate Enviro but I'm following the brief).   \nSerif Gothic and Eras are also very OK for a more formal look.   \nIf you want to look a bit \"too fancy for my cat\", Tiffany is fine, instead.   \nSteve (ITC/Letraset) it's from 1973 but it recalls a lot the \"future past\" attitude of the 1980s first videogames generation. A lot more than Data70 or Countdown and Amelia, more connected to their own 1970s.   \n   \nI hope I have spotted something suitable for your poster.\n\n"
