  "content": "Hello!\n\nMy first post.\n\nI’m looking for a suitable font for a rock band logo. The bands name is Rock Fuel. There music is similar to that of The Hellacopters, Backyard Babies and Buck Cherry.\n\nRight now I’m looking at Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch but I’m starting to think that it might be a little too much. Does anyone have any other suggestions?\n\nI’m limited to Adobes open type library.\n\nThanks  \nPeter\n\n [‹ Garamond Premier Pro - no titling set?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092604/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32478 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need help, logo design for book series ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080924092604/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32348 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Possibly incorporate a sans for ’Fuel’ to make it a bit more contemporary.\n\nJust please don’t set it in all caps.\n\n"

To put Fuel in a sans sounds interesting, I have to try that.\n\nOther then that I was considering making some sort of emblem between rock and fuel, Right now I’m thinking a guitar pick with some details that goes together with the decorative details on the font. Then maybe putting some small detail in color on the pick.\n\nI’ve drawn a pick in illustrator with round edges and I think it fits quite well together with Wilhelm Klingspor Gotisch.\n\n"

I have too corporate projects that start in april with logo design and webpages, then we can discuss fonts outside Adobes opentype library :)\n\n"

I’m gonna wait a while before I start putting money on typefaces.\n\nThanks for that site Ben, looks fantastic. Tokka quick lok at ITC Kabel. I tried Avant garde eralier but couldn’t come up with anything good. I’m just getting started with this logo so anything is possible.\n\nI’m gonna post something when I feel comfotable posting.\n\n"
