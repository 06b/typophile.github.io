  "content": "Hi all (again)!\n\nIn my \"readings\" I found an type designed by a Portuguese typography offer to the King (at the time). See picture.  \nMy investigations lead me to similar types. But again, I need the \"pros\" feedback.  \nIs this already in use? I mean some typeface equal?  \nI would love to digitize it, but dont want to find something equal out there.\n\nThanks again  \nAntónio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023225415im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tuga_4470.jpg)\n\n",
