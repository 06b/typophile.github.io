Do any of you have any  \nrecommendations of manuscript, typography, and/or  \nprinting museums that I should check out? I’m  \nparticularly interested in incunabula and illuminated  \nmanuscripts, but I’d love to visit some contemporary  \nprint shops as well.\n\nThanks so much!  \nGrendl.\n\np.s. Restaurant recommendations also welcome... and  \napologies for the cross-posting.\n\n [‹ My Favorite Frame of Helvetica (the film)](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218234037/http:/typophile.com/node/40067 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font problem on Leopard - please help me............! somebody, anybody? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071218234037/http:/typophile.com/node/40005 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s just a coffee bar, really, but it’s good.\n\nI went in 1999, and that was before I learned much about typography or took any design classes at all. There’s a lot of great art to be found, especially in Florence: The Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti, L’Accademia...\n\n"
