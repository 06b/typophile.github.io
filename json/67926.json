A friend of mine has a music blog and asked me to juice up his logo a bit without changing the typeface and without '.com' in it. My eyes are really rusty, please give your appreciated advice.\n\nThanks,  \nAdam\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [claptrapped.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023011921/http:/typophile.com/files/claptrapped.gif) | 3.89 KB |\n\n",

I know you're not supposed to change the font, but Harabara is nothing but a bad ripoff of Helvetica with some corners broken off, so the flavor isn't really going to change. You could still remove some parts and round some corners if needed, but it's very likely to end up cleaner.\n\n"
