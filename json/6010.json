      "content": "Pretty nice! A useful design for titling - could work great in a newspaper.   \n   \n- The \"f\" could be less shy.   \n- The \"g\" is too calligraphic; and I'd make its ear Goudy-style.   \n- Both the lc and -especially- the UC \"k\"/\"K\" are unhappy.   \n- The \"r\" is too sharp.   \n- The \"L\" seems too narrow.   \n- Nice \"Q\". I might disconnect the far left of the cross-stroke from the left body curve.   \n- The ascending \"4\" isn't working. The numerals are great overall though.   \n- The acute, grave and tilde seem a hair too strong.   \n- I'd flatten the UC accents.   \n- I might make the exclamation and question marks stronger.   \n- The curly braces could be more interesting.   \n   \nSpacing: I think your overall letterspacing is good, but the word space too small.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, nice work!   \n   \n-E and F seems too narrow (or maybe it's the G that is too wide?);   \n-x could be slightly narrower;   \n-the 2 looks weak, thicken its horizontal stroke;   \n-the figures seem too thin.   \n   \nSomehow this reminds of ITC Garamond and Lucida Bright, but I also see a certain influence from Sumner Stone.\n\n"

      "content": "Nice quick improvements!   \n- I'd make the tail connector (the thick diagonal stroke) on the \"g\" slightly heavier on the bottom-right than the top-left. Look at Binney & Ronaldson #2 (AKA Oxford, AKA Monticello) for a really good model for that structure of \"g\". Or Patria's for a more pronounced difference between the two ends.   \n- I think the gaps in \"B\", \"P\" and \"R\" need to be bigger.   \n- The counters of the \"N\" are imbalanced.   \n- I prefer the top numerals, although that lower \"5\" is killer.   \n- The blank space is a perfect size now.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hi,   \nI had a quick glance:   \n   \n- 'a': the left vertical extremepoint on the bowl should be lower.   \n- 'c' and 'e': although I like their form, I get the impression that they tend to fall to the left. Maybe a little more wheight in the lower left part.   \n- 'o': the rightside is perfect, the leftside isnt as good. I would have a look at this.   \n-'s' and 'S': The middlepart should be a little higher. Although I like the imbalance which occurs between both white innerforms, I think this doesnt fit with the rest of the characters.   \n-'A': right stem should be lighter.   \n-'B': bowls should be fatter.   \n-'D': Bowl should be lighter.   \n-'5' (top): horizontal streak should be longer.   \n- Eurosign: why did you make a sign which is conform the 'official' rules ? Be creative. For example you made a slanted serif, which is the only one in the whole font.   \n- I like your lower five as well. Why didnt you use a similar form for your questionmark ?   \n   \nThis a very nice typeface !   \n   \nregards,   \n--Jacques\n\n"
