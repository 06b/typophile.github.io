The very fine white lines are about .5 point.\n\nThe type is Carol Twombly's Nueva from Adobe Systems.\n\nWe'd be happy to send a couple of cards (limited availability, however) and maybe some other goodies to anyone who would care to drop us a note through the website (do include your mailing address, and note that you read about it on typophile.com!)\n\n[http://slowprint.com/contact-us](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020142944/http:/slowprint.com/contact-us \"http://slowprint.com/contact-us\")\n\n",
