  "content": "Hello Everyone, this is my first foray into making my own typeface. It's based on a mark I created for myself. I started with D, and then I needed letters to spell out EVERYDAY. And then I just kept drawing letters…\n\nFor how to approach a letter, I've used Benton Sans Wide and Idlewild as references, leaning more heavily on Benton Sans. Though of course I'm trying to bring my own ideas and touch to it rather than just copying.\n\nI'm almost finished with the letters and then I'm going to move to numbers and glyphs. It's going to be an uppercase only font.\n\nAny comment, feedback, criticism, etc. is welcome. This is new territory for me.\n\nOne thing I've learned already: the capital S is hard!\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195646im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Everyday_5727.TestBoard.png)  \n [Large image here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317195646/http:/typophile.com/files/Everyday_5727.TestBoard.png)\n\n",

      "content": "At the risk of oversimplification, I can offer a very short comment:  \nMost low contrast sans-serif fonts make an optical correction to reduce the thickness of the horizontal strokes compared to the vertical strokes -- which produces the illusion that the strokes are the same thickness -- unless the objective is to produce what is called a reverse or inverted contrast font. An example of the latter is Antique Olive.  \nIf you are trying to produce a reverse contrast font then your design is generally O.K. Otherwise the horizontal and diagonal strokes look too thick.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "For similar optical correction reasons the mid portion of a curved stroke, such as on the bowl of \\_D\\_ is thicker than the straight vertical stroke that extends from top to bottom of the the letter.  \nAgain this is something that you can ignore if there is a special purpose for your font. For example, if you are trying to produce a font that mimics old time sign lettering by store owners who are not professional sign painters, or lettered propaganda phrases painted on walls in the 1930s.  \nDon\n\n"

Thanks for the advice on the D as well.\n\nFor the curves I have made the glyphs taller, but I forgot to lower them below the baseline in Glyphs. I had manually adjusted a few of them before posting the image, but forgot to do all of them. I'll make this change across the board. Thanks for those links too.\n\nI'll post a new sample once I've made these optical adjustments and hopefully created more letters.\n\nThanks again!\n\n"
