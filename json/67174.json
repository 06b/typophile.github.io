I joined because I heard this is the place to ask about identifying fonts and working with prints, web-design and such this should be a great place to learn and get help.\n\nI'm looking for the font that RipCurl uses, on their website, in ads, prints etc.  \nIt might be a custom font, I've searched and asked all my usual places and now here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150413075257im_/http:/typophile.com/files/riprip_4573.jpg)\n\n",
