  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am trying to avoid using a double hard return between my paragraphs. The problem I am running into is when using 2+ columns that baselines are not lining up. Is there a trick to keeping them aligned (using cs3) or due to the difference of number of breaks there is no way.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013172935im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Example_4065.jpg)\n\nSecond question: If there is no way then what do you feel is more important, keeping the sentences aligned across the columns or keeping to the no double hard returns.\n\nthanks!\n\n [‹ New yrmk logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013172935/http:/typophile.com/node/48189 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typophagy ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013172935/http:/typophile.com/node/49163 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In these cases, for lines to line up across columns, the space after paragraph has to equal the leading or a whole number times the leading. / Make sure your Align to Baseline Grid button (in the Paragraph panel or Control panel) is pressed. / By the way, in your example, I would go with no extra spacing and an indented first line (indentation equal to body size). This makes it clear to the reader that he’s looking at a coherent text, not a collection of excerpts, and it makes sure that the reader is never in doubt whether or not there is paragraph break hidden in a given column or page break coinciding with a period.\n\n"

Is this wrong? I am using 10pt type with 12 pt leading, so I was decreasing the paragraph break to about 9.5 pt. Should I keep them at 12 pt?\n\np@rick\n\n"

      "content": "No, you’re right, when you use spaces between paragraphs, they should be small enough that they can’t be confused with blank lines. I would say 8 points in your case. Trouble is, with good looking paragraph spaces like these, you have to sacrifice aligning across columns. To me, this is just another good reason to abandon the whole space between paragraphs idea altogether and stick to the good old indent. Elegant, robust, working.\n\n"

      "content": "Another option, if you prefer the look of space between paragraphs, is to use a blank line of half the leading. (Personally, I’d probably set it up as Space Before, rather than a hard return). You can also then set your Baseline Grid to half the leading to facilitate layout.\n\nBy using exactly half the leading, you’ll get a fairly pleasing syncopation between your columns: lines will either be exactly aligned or a half beat off, coming in and out of alignment in a regular rhythm with each paragraph.\n\nThis can be an acceptable scheme in some layouts. You won’t be able to count on aligning the bottoms of all columns, so it works best with a looser, less formal page design.\n\n"

It really comes down to what degree of order you want in your layouts.\n\n"
