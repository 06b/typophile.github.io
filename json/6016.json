Papers such as Glama Natural and Neenah UV may do the trick, but he would like a _clear_ business card--like acetate. Can anyone offer any advice concerning this? Is silkscreening an option?   \n   \nThanks,   \nAddison\n\n",

To check just go back one page and scroll up to topics, you will see your name listed as the last post in your forum.   \n   \nAddison, I would think silk screening would be the way to go but, what I would do first is contact a print broker. A print broker usually has a small plant but is wired into other printers who have different kinds of presses like letter press and of course silk screen.\n\n"

You can reach [UR Unlimited](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052536/http:/www.urunlimited.com/) best by phone (707 528 8871) since their website doesn't have much information. You want to speak with Gary or Mayumi.   \n   \nMy dad helped him build a huge laser for his business and we hire them to hot-stamp our plastic injection-molded pickup covers.   \n   \nI've mentioned in another thread the usefulness of nameplate makers for these unusual requests. These are the guys that regularly diecut and print on plastics, and they are pros. I think there's a danger of a clear business card looking hoaky if it isn't done very well.\n\n"

The idea of working with a print broker is to build a relationship and with the relationship - Trust.   \n   \nAddison, have you tried looking on the internet for speciality printing?\n\n"

Anything unique like that would be great.   \n   \nDaniel, no, I haven't done much looking yet, but I've got to do that. You all have already helped a lot.   \n   \nThanks,   \nAddison\n\n"

By working closely with me they can even give me ideas that will make the job look great but also save my client money. They don't want to piss me off I make them money too!   \n   \nSorry for diverting the subject from Allisons need. In Photoshop users magazine there are lots of short run digital printers throughout the US. My guess is they are in places with cheap facilities (Rent). You might check out one of these sites, but, you probably won't end up doing a press check in a traditional way. They might post a proof online. One site you might check on is CreativePro.\n\n"
