  "content": "hi all,\n\nI am starting a typographically based art project. I would like to use one large font family - i.e., several weights, italics, ligatures (standard and discretionary, if possible), etc. Less commonly used glyphs like fractions and so forth are not as important. Also, it should simply be beautiful. (Open to interpretation, of course.)\n\nI’m leaning toward serif faces but both sans and serif are welcome. Feel free to throw out the usual suspects, but I’m also interested in more, let’s say, obscure possibilities.\n\nOf course, it has to be purchasable (not proprietary).\n\nthanks much!  \njarrod\n\n",

Or designed individually, but staying close to each other. Usually there is something like a ’skeleton’, so to speak, to be seen, on which both faces are based.\n\nBut I’m not sure if I would call it ’one’ family. Most of them are sold seprately, so based on that I would say they are not.\n\n"
