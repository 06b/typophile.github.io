Such was the case with Arial, and Liberation Sans is similarly stunted. The Serif is more interesting.\n\nI'm not surprised to hear it's Matteson. He's done this sort of [metric matching work](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319044107/http:/www.ascendercorp.com/Ascender_fonts.html#ascendersans) before.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140319044107im_/http:/typophile.com/files/liberation_3803.png)\n\n"
