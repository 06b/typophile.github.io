  "content": "I can feel vibes of displeasure from some people regarding   \nthe Critique threads, and it's coming out in   \nlittle barbs and jabs.   \n   \nConsider me jabbed.   \n   \nSo I thought I'd clarify.   \n   \n1. I am not the one who proffered the   \nnotion of it not being 'okay' to post your own logo versions in   \nanother person's thread.   \n   \nIf I remember correctly, Joe (Joseph Pemberton) was the first to say something   \nto the effect of, \"Let people do their own work!\"   \n   \nIt made sense, and I took that as an edict.   \n   \nIn another thread, Stephen lamented about the practice, calling it selfish, if i remember correctly.   \n   \nSo...   \n   \n1. The posting of Joe and Stephen curtails.   \n2. New typophiles join who don't know of the edict.   \n3. Posting work in someone else's thread becomes the norm.   \n   \nI thought it was the right thing to do to speak up ...   \n   \n [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25795.html?1076278621](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111030152/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25795.html?1076278621)   \n   \nSo if anyone would like to discuss, please feel free.   \n   \nMy opinion is that the practice is okay if you ask offline. Very simple.   \n   \nI'd appreciate it if you'd use this thread as a forum to   \nvoice your opinions ...   \n   \nthanks,   \n   \nbj\n\n",

      "content": "Memoirs of a rehabilitated sketcher:   \n   \nI think there's actually quite a bit of difference. Verbal suggestions are clearly supportive � encouraging the designer to use their own skills to improve their own design. Sketching can also be supportive, but not neccesarily so. Here the sketcher is using their skills to improve the design. Who's skills are we developing? And in the end, who's design is it? Can the original poster take ownership of it (not legally, but emotionally)?   \n   \nI like the icon idea, since for many it is a non-issue.   \nOne suggestion for future sketching might be to try and make it as loose as possible and still communicate your suggestion. This (i think) may help with the ownership idea. � R\n\n"

      "content": "personaly i don't see how a visual/graphic critique is any different from a written/verbal one. in any case a critique is just a suggestion which one is free to accept or reject. everyone has opinions and insight to offer, not all you will agree with. making final decisions allows the person whose work is being critiqued to \"own\" their design (at least that would work for me emotionaly) for example, if someone recommends a certain typeface for a project and someone else says the same face would be a bad idea, i have to come to the final conclusion of whether to use it or not. the final decision is mine, my own. i always appreciate any comments, critique that anyone on here has to offer and take them all with a grain of salt... from what i've experienced here we're all capbable of playing nice and if the person whose work is being critiqued doesn't want certain types of suggestions, they can always request that they not be made, but then what's the purpose of the critique?\n\n"

He uses sketching to point out areas that could be improved, and offers general direction on how to do it. But he doesn't redraw characters (or logos or...) for anyone.\n\n"

      "content": "I've offered visuals as examples, so I'm 'guilty' in this case. Offering professional help means opening yourself up to giving away what you normally get paid for. It may be 'bad form' to do it here, but how often do you sketch something for a colleague at your office rather than verbally articulate it because it's just easier? It's the difference between a quick sketch (digital or otherwise) and a fully refined 'suggestion'.   \n   \nWe're visual, so it makes sense that this happens.   \n   \nBut, I see how it gets out of control sometimes. I agree that an icon/ standard invitation to sketch will probably diffuse the issue.\n\n"
