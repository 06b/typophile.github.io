Stewf, any chance FontShop could keep sample text set by the user until it is reset or changed? It’s a pain to keep re-doing it for each page.\n\n"

You can temporarily see them at [my site](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830001216/http:/niels.kicks-ass.org/public/buildings/). It is a block of 91 houses in the style of the [Amsterdam School](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830001216/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_School), so bowfinpw was pretty right in his art nouveau-assertion.\n\nI would not be surprised if these numerals were either designed by the architect or if their design was especially commissioned for this project. As the block of houses is on the list of protected monuments and is currently being renovated, there is actually some chance I will find out.\n\nIn the mean time, I set about digitising these figures, as a way of learning how to use FontForge. I’ll keep you posted on either development.\n\n"
