But it's still significantly different from the original.\n\nHere's a quick-and-dirty rendition I've thrown together using [Granby EF Extra Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041854/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/granby/ef-extra-bold/):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041854im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Superman_titles_Granby_5558.jpg)\n\nIf it looks a little odd, it's because I've fudged the spacing to match that of the original -- which doesn't really work, since the widths of many of the individual characters don't match. I've avoided the temptation to stretch or squoosh anything to make the spacing look better.\n\nAs you can see, some of the characters, such as <cite>P</cite> and <cite>R</cite>, are way off.\n\nCan anyone find a closer match?\n\n",

      "content": "FWIW I think you have found the closest match. Gotham and Govan have rather similar letterforms, but are not as close as Granby (and too new to be used for the movie, which was made in 1978). Granby Medium has more open counters and the R leg farther from the stem, but other proportions and letters like the J and C seem less like the Extra Bold. It's probable that photolettering was used at that time, and tweaking widths might have been relatively easy, but the wide variety of Sans faces available to them may have included this exact typeface, but I was unable to locate the match in my Photolettering catalogs in a cursory scan. Perhaps more detailed hunt would locate it, but my point is that you have probably found the closest digital font match.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The samples do not show the J, which would be the other clincher.\n\nSince Photo-Lettering wasn't the only one making film types, this may not mean much in terms of my basic point -- that you have probably found the best available digital equivalent.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your responses, guys.\n\nChris: It's not a screen grab of a DVD played onscreen; it's a frame grab from the DVD MPEG2 video stream itself, which I have then manually cropped and stretched to the proper aspect ratio. (The DVD is encoded in anamorphic widescreen, so it is easy to figure out precisely how much to crop and stretch, by using simple arithmetic.) The resulting frame has an aspect ratio of 2.32:1, which is only around 1% off the original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The tiny discrepancy can be accounted for by small roundoff errors introduced by encoding into the relatively low-resolution DVD frame. Whatever distortion is present should be visually negligible -- certainly not enough to account for the large differences seen in Granby EF Extra Bold. I suspect that the internal inconsistencies you've pointed out in <cite>C</cite> et al. were already present in the original film.\n\nMike: Thanks for taking the time to go through your catalogs. It's good to hear confirmation that I have likely already found the closest digital equivalent. I do have to admit that I'm curious about this Bryant Open family that you've managed to find. If it's not too much to ask, would it be possible for you to upload some scans if you have the time? I'm idly considering a personal project to render my own version of the <cite>Superman Returns</cite> main title sequence in a more faithful <cite>Superman: The Movie</cite> style. Access to clean facsimiles of the original letterforms would be a big time saver.\n\n"

Volume 2, where I found these does include some very tiny samples in the back of the book that show other letters from each typeface, but even there the samples do not show the entire alphabet. I am not claiming that this is the exact typeface used, but it seems very close, and shows that there was a wider variety of film-typefaces than were ever converted to digital format.\n\nAs for making a scan, I'd be happy to do it, but I can't upload it to this thread, because this new 'improved' Typophile only allows that with newer operating systems than mine. I will have to set up a web page for it, and maybe someone can copy and post it.\n\nI will give you a page location in a few minutes.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I appreciate it very much.\n\nWes, the end-result of the project I was talking about was not the font itself but rather a full replacement main title sequence for <cite>Superman Returns</cite> in the style of the original <cite>Superman: The Movie</cite>.\n\nConsidering that I'd pretty much have to make the font in order to be able to do that, it would be a shame if I kept the font to myself. Unfortunately, I didn't design Bryant Open, so I think the legality of releasing a digital version of the font might be dubious.

If you digitized something that was as close to the credits as possible, it would probably be your own digitization. If I understand our copyright laws in the US, only the names are copyrightable anyway, which seems dumb. I think this is the reason so many re-named versions of things are allowed to exist, but I may be wrong about that.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It seems that as long as a type design is sufficiently old (e.g., Garamond), no one has a problem with it being digitized and sold for profit by a multitude of independent outfits. When a design is relatively new (e.g., Palatino), redigitizations are heavily looked down upon -- even if they share no curves or points, and have a completely different name.\n\nWhere exactly does one draw the line?
