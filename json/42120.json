  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm working on a simple book design. The writer requests a Times New Roman, because all previous books in the series were set in times. Is there any alternative to Times that looks a lot a like but has more subtle feel? I know they won't allow me to change the typeface drastically, but maybe they won't notice a slight difference :) It's worth the try.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",

Some certainly won't look much like it at all, but at least some will, and you may get some ideas. You can also drop out or modify one or two attributes and see what you get. You can be the judge of how close you would like to get to Times.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
