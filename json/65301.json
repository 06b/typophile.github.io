  "content": "As title says - I'm looking for a designer who crosses out words/lines in long bits of text (newspapers I think) to create illustrations (pretty sure the ones I saw were portraits).\n\nI've seen their work before, but can't remember for the life of me their name. Really annoying as I really need their stuff for a main bit of research in a small university project.\n\nAnyone know who I am talking about?\n\nHope I have explained it well - if not let me know, and I'll try reword it!\n\n",
