It’s an interesting-looking slab serif, which at first reminded me of Joshua Darden’s Freight Micro.\n\nThe site belongs to a Finnish book publisher.\n\nOlli\n\n",

I searched with 'tammi' as the sample, using 'slabserif' at MyFonts, and went through all 340+ fonts, and the only one I noticed there with off-center foot-serifs was [Corzinair](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018221229/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/corzinair/) from Typodermic. As you can see, it's close, but not exact.\n\nThis says it's not a foundry that MyFonts sells, or it's a custom font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Nothing shown as slabserif seems to match this, so it seems like it must be from an independent foundry, or custom.\n\nI'm curious if anyone will pin this one. Olli, have you tried writing to the site and asking what they used?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
