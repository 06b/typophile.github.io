The other characters look like they are from [Cochin Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052117/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/cochin/italic/testdrive.html?s=ascades&p=48) or possibly [Snell Roundhand](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052117/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/snell-roundhand-script/snell-roundhand-script/testdrive.html?s=ascades&p=48) (or maybe even a combination of the two) with further modifications, such as the slant. Given the general unevenness of the characters, it may be that it is several generations removed from the original artwork. Either that, or it's just not very well drawn.   \n   \nI think the tag line is actually [Casablanca Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052117/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/casablanca/urw-t-light-condensed/testdrive.html?s=A%a0SERENITY%a0DAY%a0SPA&p=48), not Bodega Sans.\n\n"

The previous agency on this account was using Bodega for all headers, so I assumed that's what it was since they do look close in style.   \n   \nI think you're also correct on the Cascades thing. I finally received an EPS of the logo, and it looks just as bad in its original format as it does in this JPG.   \n   \nOh well, they're looking to revise their identity soon anyway, hopefully I'll get a shot at it.   \n   \nThanks for all your help.\n\n"
