There never was a period where there was so drastic a change so quickly come about. The arts replied with various attempts at trying to either follow or lead the transformation of an agrarian society that had done everything by hand to the world of mass production, consumerism, and much more leisure time.  \nIt was an exciting time and a confusing time. People interpreted it in various ways, one being Futurism. The concepts of time and motion were rethought and given some attempt at form. Remember that this time period also gave birth to the Theory of Relativity, Quantum theory, two world wars with the Great Depression sandwiched between and ultimately, nuclear weapons.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Making typefaces in those years involved time, money, technical knowledge and therefore a connection to an established foundry. Young avante garde arty folks rarely could put that combination together then. Even the Constructivists did mostly hand lettering or linocuts. Bayer's work waited years before someone else made type of it. Renner spent years at it and required working with a foundry to finish the real work. The Futurists never made the cut though.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "\"Start with Benito Mussolini’s Wikipedia entry.\"\n\n\"i know they were all fascists\"\n\nPainting every futurist as Mussolini's servant is too simplicistic; Italy's cultural history is much more complex. For example, one of the most famous futurist book, a \"latta\" by F T Marinetti published in the 30's, was designed by Bruno Munari, one of the greatest XX century designer, a man whose democratic feelings can't be denied by anyone. The same can be said of many of the greatest designers belonging of the \"futurist\" era - the 20's and 30's decades - like Bertieri, Frassinelli, Mardersteig, Butti, Tallone, whose work cannot be related, in any way, to a totalitarian attitude. (As a sidenote, I guess that Futurism was much more an aesthetic than a political movement, but this is another matter; not that they hadn't political issues, anyway).\n\nRegarding futurist typography, in a sense, Marinetti's aim was to create a visual complement to the \"new century\" milieu - something that could express the dizzy flush of trains, cities, machines, metal, industry, and so on. Most of all, it was a reaction against the old world of late XIX century bourgeoisie. Graphically, it was an experimental (and perhapes necessary) approach which, after the first enthusiastic times, soon lead to a more clean and traditional typography, towards the end of the '30's. I'm no expert in the matter, but it's difficult to find \"typographic principles\" in futurism, in a traditional sense; it was much more a matter of \"us against them\". Somehow, their approach (not different from other early century avant garde movements) resembles what happened in graphic design in the 80's with people like Neville Brody, David Carson, Rudy VanderLans.\n\nIt was also a great time for typefaces - besides more traditional stuff, in 1930 Italian typography spawned its response to Futura, Nebiolo's foundry \"Semplicita\":\n\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/fountaineer/278176955/in/set-72157594342848...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108152313/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/fountaineer/278176955/in/set-72157594342848887/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fountaineer/278176955/in/set-72157594342848887/\")\n\n"

In 1938, hearing that Adolf Hitler wanted to include Futurism in a traveling exhibition of “degenerate art”, Marinetti persuaded Mussolini to refuse to let it enter Italy. In the same year he protested publicly against anti-Semitism, which was being copied from Germany by the Italian Fascists.\"\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo\\_Tommaso\\_Marinetti](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108152313/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo\\_Tommaso\\_Marinetti\")\n\nI'm not sure how strong this source is, but if true it does provide a shade of grey between the black and white.\n\n"

Let us not forget Russian Futurism, little did Mayakovsky, Malevich, Goncharova or El Lissitsky to name just a few to do with Marinetti, or Balla who allthough they shared with the Russians a love of modernity, machinery an dynamism weren't a bunch of italian neo-pagan counts who loved dressing sharp, driving fast Bugattis, betaing up anarchists and communists, instead considering themselves revolutionaries interested in world revolution and an international revolutionary art (a term open to interpretation in those days here are two points from the futurist manifesto which may make you look deeper into your \"interest for futurism\" which seems merely aesthetic. Heres a few pearls from their manifesto:\n\n9. We want to glorify war — the only cure for the world — militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas which kill, and contempt for woman.  \n!0.

If you are still interested in Futurism there is a great book in Italian \"L'arte de la Publicittà Il manifesto italiano e la avaguardie 1920-1940\"....\n\n"
