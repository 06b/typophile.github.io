      "content": "Based on the E and A, I would say this is a Caslon typeface. It is unlikely, I think to find this exact type in digital form, because each size in metal type was often a slightly different design. There are at least 6 different type sizes on this title page.\n\nThe most similar font I have found is [LTC Caslon](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701093144/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-caslon/?refby=bowfin). Unlike many Caslons it has the single-serif C (as does Adobe Caslon Pro).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you Mike, I think you're probably correct! Adobe Caslon Pro was the first one I compared it too, but I decided against it because of the capital A if I recall correctly. However, looking at [this Caslon specimen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701093144/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Caslon-schriftmusterblatt.jpeg) it looks very similar, and it seems Caslon would fit in well at the time and place it was printed.\n\nThanks again!\n\n"
