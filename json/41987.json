It shows an \"old-fashioned\" printing shop [excuse me: \"printing office\"]. You know, guys in neckties and sleeve garters at work at a platen press, a composing bank, and at a stone. Then in the background you can see a typesetting machine, maybe circa 1900. But the machine is a dang Linotype machine.\n\nThe clowns at Monotype's ad agency must have had no idea what a Monotype looked like. Nor, obviously, did the clowns within Monotype who ran the ad work have any idea what their own machines of not so many years before looked like.\n\nThis was back when Lino and Mono were still battling it out for the emerging \"desktop\" market, and each was trying to establish its heritage. An old typesetting machine meant \"heritage,\" I guess. Who cared what kind of machine.\n\npowers\n\n"
