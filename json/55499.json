It is very intriguing at large sizes (and indeed it is meant for display) but anything close to what typophile is using it for and it turns to mush.\n\nIs there anyone who has used this font yet or can testify to its success in their own work? Appreciated.\n\n-Jesse\n\n",

The light is more 'normal'. I agree that the black weight didn't work particularly well on typophile. It looked ok on the frontpage, but the headers above the forums were just too small for the tiny counters in the black weight.\n\n"

We did some tests at a variety of sizes before publishing Klimax here, and even at a tiny 30px I could see the counters quite clearly.\n\nThis conversation often comes up when the Featured Face changes. Some people prefer personality over readability, and vice versa. We can't always please everyone equally, unfortunately, but perhaps one day in a magical world, users can choose their own\\* :)\n\n\\*anyone want to volunteer dev time? ;)\n\n"

I think it's great compulsory New Font Exposure. I've had initial reservations about a featured face a couple of times, but then it grew on me during its week; and sometimes the opposite. I suspect if I could choose another font anytime, I'd probably switch faces more than actually read Typophile.\n\nBtw, Klimax (Plus) must have the craziest sexiest \"g\" since I don't know what.\n\n"
