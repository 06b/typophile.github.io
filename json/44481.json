I don’t even like it that much. And I like myself (I think?!), so that’s not right! :P  \nI’ve been thinking about this for quite a while, though, this relationship between people and typefaces. For example, to me, Palatino really looks like an old, somewhat distinct, calm and collected man, someone who has lived a life and has lots of experience but doesn’t flaunt it at all. Galliard is also someone with experience, but he can be a lot cooler and edgier than Palatino – which I see in the italic –, but a kind of an educated coolness that only years of experience can bring. But I only seem to be able to do this with some typefaces, and few.  \nI’ll get back at you, missgiggles. I’m really thinking about this! :P\n\n"
