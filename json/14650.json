The only thing I recommend is checking out some of the free fonts distributed by foundries and/or the designers that make them (versus a site whose content may be pirated or poorly rendered rip-offs). Here are a couple foundries/distrib. that are worth looking into\\*:\n\n[Mac Rhino](http://web.archive.org/web/20120726231451/http:/www.macrhino.com/)  \n [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20120726231451/http:/www.fontshop.com/features/free.cfm)  \n [Storm Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20120726231451/http:/www.stormtype.com/free.html)\n\n\\*Please be aware that when using these free fonts, that they are still under protection of copyright and license agreements. Each font may have a unique set of restrictions (almost always for non-commercial use), so please read them carefully.\n\n(I also realize that my definition of cool might not be the type of <cite>cool</cite> you are referring to. :) )\n\n"
