  "content": "Hello!   \n   \nIm a graphical designer that just recently got completely addicted to typeface design. Im very happy i found this forum because obvously i will need some professional help =)   \n   \nThis is one of my first attempts at designing a typeface. Im making it mainly for use as a display font in print graphics and websites.   \n   \nThanks in advance.   \n- Lasse   \n   \n ![Typeface: SNAP!](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819211738im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68555.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "I quite like this concept, altough there's some issues with the way its working technically.   \n   \nThere are a few characters in the lower case that could use tweaking:   \n   \n\"m\" i like, but consider splitting the two strokes that make it up (the \"r\" like shape and the other curve) and spacing them a little. At the moment the two are so close we almost lose the mid-stem all togther - it's losing it's \"m\"iness.   \n   \n\"t\" not working yet. try some other solutions, like the reverse J look - if you know what i mean. (sorry don't have time to mock-up visual samples).   \n   \n\"q\" seems that the stalk is too short. \"w\" seems too flat and the mid-stem needs to come up higher.   \n   \nIn the uppercase the C, E, F, J, P & R are all significantly skinnier than the other glyphs. I guess this was intentional, any reason why these characters?   \n   \nSolid effort overall. Forgive me everyone for getting my type-anatomy wrong. It's too late and I'm too tired to whip out Bringhurst's Elements to cross-reference. Please, give me some feedback in turn on my sans-serif.   \n   \nCheers.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree with Linus.   \n   \nThe font looks great when you spell your name out in it. Those characters looks good together. For now I will assume that that is the flow you want to achive with the rest of the font.   \n   \nI would add some suggestions.   \n   \nUse more space between the letters so we can see them better. They seem squished together in the sample.   \n   \nCaps: Maybe pull the ends of the cap C around further fallowing the path of the cap O. The D is overly wide. Why not drop the foot of Cap J down below the baseline? The Cap K seems like an H. A small adjustment could make a big difference. The cap M seems a little wider than it needs to be. Again small change is what I suggest. What about Pulling the foot of the R out from the stem farther? Or a Bigger counter for both the P & R? Not both probably. How about a straight vertical tail on the Q? The W needs work. I can imagine 4-5 ways to change it. The Z is a little regular compared to the other interesting letters. Maybe treat it a bit more like the S?   \n   \nLowercase: The e needs work. It stands out & doesn't flow. it's an important character so I would do lots of versions until you get one that flows. I like the a. I thing the f most be taller. Otherwise it is a mixed lowercase small cap thing which is too wonky for the cool spacy elegance of the Caps. I really like the ghij. Same for the k as the f. What about a double mid stem for the m? Like two overnapped 'n's? Maybe too wacky also. Just a smooth double hump might be good... I think the q needs a decending tail. The s feels cluncky to me. Whay not adopt the approach of the elegant Cap S? As Linus said the t needs reworking. I would try several ideas & see which ones feel closer to the feeling of the caps. Not that they should use the shapes of the caps - just the feeling. The w also needs reworking.   \n   \nSweet font!\n\n"
