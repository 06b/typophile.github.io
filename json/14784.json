      "content": "I think their reasoning is that you place the cursor in the spot for insert first and thereby select the font in use and the glyphs available for that font. The problem coms when you want to use a pi font just in one spot. You first have to click in the spot for insertion and then go to text\\>character and select the pi font before you look at the Glyph palette to choose the dingbat. Yeesh, now I sound like a dingbat. I just read what I wrote and wonder if it is at all understandable :-)\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I still can’t think of a way to say it better. It would be much easier to show you on screen. Maybe the Adobe guys have a kinder-gentler way to state “the case”.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "David,\n\nApparently, the way it works is that when you choose insertion point in the text or select some text, the Glyph palette (or job case, if you wish) switches to whatever font is before the insertion point or in the selected text. (If the selected text includes more than one font, it switches to no font at all.)\n\nSo, the trick is, choose the location first, then you can switch to a different font in the Glyph palette and when you double-click on a character, it will insert the correct character from the font you chose, even if it is a different font from the surrounding text.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n"

      "content": "“Does that make sense?”  \nNo, but thanks: The Job case/glyph window, should behave as though it’s useful, and not some sort of extra appendage. I understand why is switches from font to font, according to the location of cursor in the text, but it makes no sense at all to move the case to the high-lighted glyph when that is selected because, (HEY DUMMY!) the high lighted glyph’s already in the text! Why in the name of Ptah would I want to replace it with itself…Sometimes…I wonder if they use it at all, or if they’re only allowed to listen to monkey’s talking and focus group “translators”…:)\n\n"

      "content": "The glyph window only jumps around if you size it smaller than the glyph set you have selected: ‘alternates to selection’, ‘numerals’ ‘all characters’ etc. The highlighted character has to default somewhere, I guess; what do you suggest? The current highlight at least has the merit of confirming to you what character you will be replacing. Maybe Adobe will change it if you have a better idea. I find the most useful feature is the ‘alternatives to selection’ choice of palate. This gives you a relatively small, relevant set of options.\n\n"
