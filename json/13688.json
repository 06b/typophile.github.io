AIGA is the place design professionals go to exchange ideas and information, participate in critical analysis and research and advance education and ethical practice.\n\nAIGA was founded in 1914 as a small, exclusive club, AIGA now represents more than 18,000 designers through national activities and local programs developed by 52 chapters and more than 150 student groups.\n\nAIGA supports the interests of professionals, educators and students who are engaged in the process of designing, regardless of where they are in the arc of their careers. The disciplines represented in the profession range from book and type design through the traditional communication design disciplines to the newer disciplines of interaction design, experience design and motion graphics.\n\n[http://www.aiga.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415214025/http:/www.aiga.org/ \"http://www.aiga.org/\")\n\n",
