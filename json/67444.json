  "content": "A  \nContemplation  \nupon  \nthe Mystery of MAN's Regeneration,  \nIn Allusion to the Mystery of  \nPRINTING.\n\nGREAT Blest MASTER-PRINTER, Come  \nInto thy Composing-Room:  \nWipe away our foul Offenses;  \nMake, O make our Souls and Senses,  \nThe Upper and the Lower Cases;  \nAnd thy large Alphabet of Graces  \nThe Letter, which being ever fit;  \nO haste thou to Distribute it:  \nFor there is (I make Account)  \nNo Imperfection in the Fount.  \nIf any Letters Face be foul,  \nO wash it, ere it touch the Soul;  \nContrition be the Brush; the Lye,  \nTears from a Penitential Eye.  \n Thy Graces so Distributed,  \nThink not thy Work half finished:  \nOn still, O LORD, no Time defer,  \nBe truly a COMPOSITOR.  \nTake thy Composing-Stick in Hand,  \nThy Holy Word, the firmest Band;  \nFor sure that Work can never miss,  \nThat's truly Justify'd in this.  \n The End of Grace's Distribution,  \nIs not a meer Dissolution;  \nBut that from each Part being cited,  \nThey may be again United:  \nLet Righteousness and Peace then meet,  \nMercy and Truth each other greet;  \nLet these Letters make a Word,  \nLet these Words a Line afford,  \nThen of Lines a Page compose,  \nWhich being brought unto a Close,  \nBe Thou the Direction, LORD;  \nLet Love be the fast-binding Cord.  \nSet, O LORD, O Set apace,  \nThat we may grow from Grace to Grace;  \nTill tow'rds the Chace we nearer draw,  \nThe Two strong Tables of Thy Law,  \nOf which the Two firm Crosses be,  \nThe Love of Man, next after Thee.  \nThe Head-Sticks are Thy Majesty;  \nThe Foot-Sticks, Christ's Humility;  \nThe Supplications of the Saints,  \nThe Side-Sticks, when our Faith e'er faints;  \nLet the Quines be Thy sure Election,  \nWhich admits of no rejection;  \nWith which our Souls being join'd about,  \nNot the least Grace can drop out.  \nThy Mercies and Allurements all;  \nThy Shooting-Stick and Mallet call.  \n But when all this done we see,  \nWho shall the CORRECTOR be?  \nO LORD, What Thou Set'st cann't be ill,  \nIt needs then no CORRECTOR's skill.  \n Now tho' these Graces are all Set,  \nOur Hearts are but White-Paper yet;  \nAnd by Adam's First Transgression,  \nFit only for the worst Impression.  \nThy Holy Spirit the PRESS-MAN make,  \nFrom whom we may Perfection take;  \nAnd let Him no Time defer,  \nTo Print on us Thy Character.  \nLet the Ink be Black as Jet;  \nWhat though? It is comely yet,  \nAs Courtains of King Solomon,  \nOr Kedars Tents to look upon.  \n Be Victory the Press's Head,  \nThat o'er Oppression it may tread.  \nLet Divine Contemplation be  \nThe Skrews, to raise us up to Thee:  \nThe Press's Two Cheeks (Unsubdu'd)  \nStrong Constancy and Fortitude:  \nOur slavish Flesh let be the Till,  \nWhereon lay what Trash you will:  \nTo move the Work with Easiness:  \nThe Platten is Affliction,  \nWhich makes good Work, being hard set on.  \nThe Bar, the Spirit's instrument,  \nTo sanctifie our Punishment.  \nThe Blankets, a Resemblance hath  \nOf Mercy in the midst of Wrath.  \nThe Frisket, thy Preventing Grace,  \nKeeps us from many a sully'd Face.  \nCHRIST JESUS is the Level Stone  \nThat our Hearts must be Wrought upon.  \nthe Coffin, wherein it doth ly,  \nIs Rest to all Eternity.  \nThe Cramp-Irons, that it moves on still,  \nAre the good Motions of the Will.  \nThe Rounce, the Spirit's Inspiration,  \nWorking an Holy Agitation.  \nThe Girts, the Gift of Continence,  \nThe Tether of th' Unbridled Sense.  \nThe Winter, whereon all doth ly,  \nIs Patience in Adversity.  \nThe Footstep, Humbleness of Mind,  \nThat in it self no Worth can find.  \n If there be such a Chance as this,  \nThat any Letter batter'd is,  \nBeing come unto thy View,  \nTake it out, put in a new.  \nOr if Satan, that foul Fiend,  \nMarr, with a Pretence to Mend,  \nAnd being at thy Goodness vext,  \nMakes Blasphemy of thy pure Text,  \nFind it out, O LORD, and then  \nPrint our Hearts new o'er agen.  \n O LORD, unto this Work make hast,  \n'Tis a Work that long will last:  \nAnd when this White-Paper's done,  \nWork a Reiteration.  \n FINIS.\n\n",
