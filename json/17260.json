  "content": "I hope to spend next academic year producing a faithful revival of Griffo's last roman in its 1499 state - the font, in adulterated form, of the Hypnerotomachia - and his 1503 italic for Soncino. 'Faithful' here means avoiding the potentially banalising effects of human interpretation; with incunables, it can't really mean the copying of selected printed letter-forms. That worked better for Justin Howes with the relatively limited variation of Caslon's printed letters than it would for the mess of an Aldine page.\n\nSo I've written a little program which takes a large number of copies of a letter, normalises their colour, finds the right offset at which to superimpose each on a master-image, blends each with the master, repeats the process with the completed master from the first round as seed-image, and then thresholds the result to give a monochrome image around which to draw an outline. The degree of boldness from inkpress one wants determines the threshold. But I had previously had a very helpful exchange of emails with Sergei Egorov on his own method, by which tracings from a smaller number of characters were superimposed and an outline for the font drawn through the resulting blur. Still another method would be to try to model in software the Aldine printing process from punch to paper, which, run in reverse, could get to the punch - a thing at least of interest, even if an averaged character better represents Griffo's expectation of how the letter would look. The question: which method is best, and why? Would another method be superior?\n\nA 'p' from the 1501 italic for Aldus is shown here, with Sergei's method shown in the second and his end result in the third image. My blended composite is fourth, and final image for tracing is fifth. This p shows, I think, something which I suspect Griffo practiced pretty consistently in his later work: rotation of the counter. I don't have enough data to be sure yet, but it's finding that sort of thing which makes painstakingly literalist revival interesting.\n\nGeorge\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150210130946im_/http:/typophile.com/files/p-1501.PNG)\n\n",

      "content": "_Would another method be superior?_\n\nI think the best way to do a revival is by eye, with a magnifying glass.  \nWhatever method of revival you choose, you are making an interpretation, by the mere act of choice. IMO, it is not \"human\" interpretation that is banalizing, but attempts to automate the process of interpretation.\n\nBy using any system of averaging, you are opting for a composite which is softened and blurred, which is counter to the visually arresting effect of a letterpress impression. A flat two-dimensional photo-reproduction can never convey the _bite_ of letterpress into paper, so the digital revivalist has to find some way of compensating, of adding an ingredient. But averaging does the opposite. The end result looks crude and ugly, whereas Griffo's intent and sense of style is clearly apparent in most impressions -- the calligraphic ductus underlying the form -- which averaging obscures.\n\n_...even if an averaged character better represents Griffo’s expectation of how the letter would look._\n\nIt doesn't. Griffo was well aware that the individual impressions of a particular character would vary, and would have designed his glyphs accordingly, to account for that variation of the final image. Had he been assured of a uniform reproduction of letter shapes, he would have designed them differently. More like Bodoni.\n\nThe variety of serif treatment in Incunabula type accomodates the fact that had they been made the same, they would have ended up different, due to the vagaries of the printing process. So the reader's attention would have been drawn to this deviation from the ideal. However, to make them varied to begin with is logical, it disguises the depradations of the printing process.\n\nThere is something disconcerting about a page of Poliphilus, especially when it is digitally set. Perhaps not if one only reads it once. But if one is to savor the text by rereading, and if one is reading the typography as well as the content, it palls. Hence Monotype Bembo, the antithesis of banality.\n\nSo if you want to use digital technology to reinterpret old letterpress printing, I think you would be better off exploring the possibility of contextual alternates in an OpenType font, to capture the variety of impression, which is an integral part of the original design. I suspect that Incunabula printers used textual context to inform their selection of a particular sort of a letter, and may even have physically \"fine tuned\" some of them, especially the lower case \"r\".\n\nThe long left side of the main stroke has acquired a texture (of paper?) in the original, but in both the derived versions shown it is straight. This texture is part of the design, like the resonance of the room in which a piece of music is performed. You cannot produce a \"faithful\" copy without finding some way of paraphrasing this quality of the printing.\n\nPerhaps you could start with an idealized glyph -- clean, sharp and simple outline -- then apply a \"letterpress\" filter to it, similar to the way that the texture brushes in Illustrator can be applied to a glyph outline. This, and my comment about contextual alternates, is along the lines of your thought \"to model in software the Aldine printing process from punch to paper\".\n\n"

The calligraphic ductus is partly your imposition on the actual form, though it's probably the interpretation Griffo wanted his readers to impose: in 1500 departure from calligraphic ductus was thought of as simply erroneous. But Griffo was clever, and made small (in this p's case not so small) deviations from calligraphic ductus, presumably in order to better unite the word-image. My averaging makes this this very clear - perhaps too clear, because the illusion of calligraphy necessary to the total effect is weakened.\n\nMust sleep now, more later.\n\n"

      "content": "Very interesting. I think I've written approximately the same program. I've wondered what would happen when applied to very old samples - I know I've been pleased with the results I've gotten from originals in the 100-year old range.\n\nMy own approach is simply _not_ to threshold. In my curve editor, I use the grayscale averaged image to trace from. In my opinion, there is valuable information present in the grayscale which is lost in thresholding.\n\nLook closely at two places you have grayness - the top join of the bowl of the 'p' to the vertical stem, and the spur that protrudes to the left. In the first case, it's reasonable to conclude that the grayness is caused by varying amounts of \"glutinous deposit\". Arguably, the truer shape of the metal can be recovered by tracing towards the light side.\n\nOn the spur, the grayness represents the probability of damage to the metal type - much, much higher for delicate projections such as this spur than, say, along the edge of a stem. With this interpretation, it should be clear that the truer shape of the metal is recovered from a trace of the dark side.\n\nSo when I'm tracing, I leave the image in grayscale, and make these judgements by eye.\n\nA couple of other notes about my \"recipe\".\n\n1. Start with a really high resolution scan. I almost invariably use 2400 dpi.\n\n1a. Use as many impressions as humanly possible. I'm astonished by the difference in clarity between a handful and dozens, and again in the jump to hundreds.\n\n2. I do my contrast adjustment _after_ the averaging. There's no need to get the paper white pre-averaging, because the contrast of the paper texture will be dramatically reduced. In my opinion, this increases the chance of being able to see subtle gray variations.\n\n3. After averaging, I sharpen the image pretty significantly. I believe this compensates for the blurring caused by the (inevitable) errors in aligning the individual impressions to the master template.\n\n4. After sharpening, I tend to lighten the image so I can see the subtleties in the darker gray shadings more accurately.\n\nNick has a point about variation - you're likely to get results similar to what printers _would have_ produced had they combined Griffo's punches with the type founding, paper, and printing technologies of, say, the 1912 ATF specimen book. If Griffo lived 400 years later, he may well have designed his letters differently to suit, but then again, perhaps not.\n\nI disagree that averaging obscures the calligraphic ductus of the original letters. I think it lets you visualize an image much closer to the actual shape of the metal than can be seen in any of the individual impressions. In some ways, I think it's even better to work from the averaged image than if you knew the shape of the metal, because the latter was probably overthinned to compensate for the ink gain on the press.\n\nNote, though, that in saying this I'm assuming that there was one punch, so each individual letter is a fair copy of the same original shape. Averaging together impressions from _different_ punches would, I agree, be a travesty. If I recall Sergei Egorov's research correctly, part of what he found is that, for many letters, there may have been two or three similar, but subtly different, punches. If you carefully classify the impressions so that the vast majority come from the same punch, that should take care of that issue.\n\nA \"letterpress filter\" for type is a very, very interesting idea. I've been toying with the idea of building such a thing, but the research, both into characterizing the letterpress process, and into getting usable digital outlines of the results, is nontrivial. How strong would be the demand for such a thing?\n\nAnyway, George, very best of luck with your project. It sounds very much worth doing.\n\n"

      "content": "If your aim is to capture something of he 'mess of an Aldine page', then I think Nick's suggestion of making multiple versions of each letter and using contextual substitution to vary their use makes a lot of sense. I think the peculiar sensation that I sometimes get when looking at a page of Aldine italic type comes from the tension of variation constrained by the typographic identity of each sort. The italic text seems to hover somewhere between the chirographic and the typographic, in way that the roman doesn't and which later improvements in printing technology gradually diminished and erased.\n\n"

I doubt that this was the primary motivation, when variety of seriffing has so many other virtues. I think the 1499 caps are the best proof of this: the serifs are designed to scoop white into a convincing counter (L) or eject it (C), thus making perceived counter-size sufficiently similar for the caps to make a readable text face - something not repeated by Garamond and the later tradition, and certainly not by Bodoni!\n\n<cite>Texture is part of the design, like the resonance of the room in which a piece of music is performed. You cannot produce a “faithful” copy without finding some way of paraphrasing this quality of the printing.</cite>\n\nI could take the averaged letterform, toughen it, and then consistently waver the outline, paraphrasing the texture without simulating the actual and extreme variations of the printed letters.\n\nAs for Poliphilus, in 13+ point letterpress on suitable paper the only problems I see are in the consistently inconsistent weights of, for instance, h compared to m, resulting from Monotype's own attempts to paraphrase this texture. In fact I think letterpress Poliphilus is nearly one of the very finest typefaces - letterpress Bembo is the finest of all, but some of its letters are too wide and so too white (above all y) and its caps are a little too Garamondian.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Raph,  \nThanks for your help, and there goes my patent. Tracing from a sharpened version of the blended master sounds like a good idea. To clarify what you say about tracing the light side and dark side, presumably you're urging that I trace hard against the black at the top join of bowl and stem, but trace around the paler grey of the spur, on the understanding that it has been often blunted by damage. That would make sense - though it would be nice to investigate just how this damage characteristically operated, because I want to avoid unfounded interpretation. And Aldine type-metal was unusually good for the time, though the press-work was of course generally far below the level of a Ratdolt performance.\n\nFailing to normalise the colour in advance means each letter contributing very different amounts to the blend, and also increases errors in superposition. It's a compromise: with these scans I think careful normalising is a good thing. I've tried without, incidentally. I'm careful not to mix punches - and that's something software is very good for. Sergei's conclusion was that mixing of punches was not done in a form consistent enough to be aesthetically motivated - more likely an all hands on deck response to a big job, or large number of concurrent jobs. And the compositors were, according to Aldus himself, a pack of dunces, while nothing but good came from the 'daedaleis Francisci manibus Bononiensis'.\n\nFinally, is there a way to automate the selection from scans of all the letters from each punch? Cutting them out one by one is a bore.\n\n"

      "content": "As you say, John, the degree of mess varies: in the 1499 Scriptores Astronomici Veteres, which I expect will be my roman source, inkpress is less noisy than in most pages from a Hypnerotomachia, and much less noisy, simply because of font size, than in a page of Aldine italic. Meanwhile the Soncino italic, though approximately the same size as its predecessor, received better treatment than the Aldine: [UPenn page](http://web.archive.org/web/20150210130946/http:/www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/petrarch/petrarch_23-01.html/). So in neither of my sources will there be the sheer randomness of the Aldine italic, such that using alternative glyphs to represent the same punch might look like affectation, if only because of the obvious artificiality of the simulation. On the other hand some Beowulf-style postscript coding to provide a letterpress filter would be valuable - as it would be, in carefully regulated doses, for almost any text face. Minute variation is good for orientation on a page, and the sense that the reader is making progress through the word-stream.\n\n"

What you are planning is a convincing deception. Nothing wrong with that, as it one of the destinies of new technology to perpetuate the virtues of the old, and mimicry is the sincerest form of respect. But the idea that new tools remove the element of interpretation is mistaken.\n\n_...it can’t really mean the copying of selected printed letter-forms._\n\nIt's a pity Justin Howes isn't around to explain his method. Copying in this instance is not like duplicating a digital file. He was digitizing an analogue 3D image, for offset reproduction, which requires not just selection, but interpretation. For instance, every digitiser has to decide \"how long to make the coastline of Britain\" -- and you too are doing that by picking a certain number of specimens to average. The more you choose, the shorter the coastline.\n\nI just had a look at \"The Well Made Book\", Updike essays, published by Mark Batty, which is set in Founder's Caslon. Read for content, nice. Looked at for typography, one thing that stikes me is the bounce, i.e. the deviation from baseline. Howes has incorporated this quality --- I first noticed that the \"o\" rides high. That's not mere copying, it's a design specification. En masse, it adds to the personality of the page, but damn my typographic reading, (which must come into play when passages are re-read, certainly in a book for typophiles!), I'm thinking, \"why is the 'o' always up? -- contextual alternates could fix that\".\n\nIt's all about the mise-en-page.\n\nThere are two approaches to \"redoing Griffo's last roman\", engineering or design. The engineer would perhaps provide a tool that gives the font-user sliders to control simulations of:  \n- alternate character shape (corresponding to variable wear and sorts from different punches)  \n- paper texture  \n- ink spread  \n- bounce\n\nThe designer would work from an exemplary specimen (or edit several), choosing specifics for the above variables.\n\n"

What I am not trying to do is simulate Aldus' or Soncino's page, which I agree is not remotely possible without (as would be very pleasant) making a separate version for matrix engraving (and even then...). So: I've got to interpret, but I want to avoid selecting specimen letters. Now perhaps Griffo's expectations for his letters were so irreducably plural that modelling them in their most characteristic forms (ie averaged, then drawn rather than traced to take into account damage, clean out inkpress, and harden angles) would be pointless. But would he really, with his graver, have excitedly anticipated all the splodges and blurs given his work by second rate press-work?

In giving a crit, I have to separate emotion and method, and focus on the latter. Trying to get people to make fonts I would make just makes everybody miserable. Like when I once showed a \"progressive\" design to a Famous Designer, and I told him the intent is such-and-such, and he come (sic) back to me with a ton of details of how to make it all homogenous like him (sic) own fonts, that's just a waste of everybody's time (not to mention arrogant).\n\nBasically I guess I don't think anybody (short of a medium :-) is capable of subverting his own preconceptions to allow what was in the mind of another person to surface - especially not centuries apart.\n\nhhp\n\n"

And so on.\n\n_Trying to get people to make fonts I would make just makes everybody miserable._\n\nI would hope that by answering my criticisms, George could be a little clearer in his own mind of what he's doing and why. Especially as this is an MA project, and he can expect some harsh crits there. I also made a number of what I consider to be constructive contributions, rather than criticisms, such as the contextual alternates for varying wobble thing, and the outline texture filter idea. I've used the outline-filter technique, but not the contextual.\n\n_Basically I guess I don’t think anybody (short of a medium :-) is capable of subverting his own preconceptions to allow what was in the mind of another person to surface - especially not centuries apart._\n\nBut don't you feel that you have a different understanding and greater insight into why Baskerville's type is the way it is, now that you have been working on a revival? And why wouldn't such an understanding correspond to what JB had in mind?\n\n"

But the chances are slim enough that my own ideas are sure to overpower what I think JB might have been thinking if I look too far beyond the forms themselves. Thought patterns are not some mathematically pure, eternal things; they're entirely individual, highly dynamic and contextual to boot; there's no way a 21st century Armo is going to get inside an 18th century Brit's head (at least not enough to make type like him).\n\nI think that in a revival it's important to distill the essence of a design, which comes from the forms, not what happened to be in the original designer's head. For one thing, stuff in people's heads changes. Should I revive the JB on the morning he decided to get into typography? Or the JB the night he finished printing his Virgil? Or maybe the JB on the verge of giving up on typography in disgust? It's hopeless to approach it that way. So for example when I'm making the British Pound character, I can look at what JB made and say \"that was wrong\", and make one that fits the <cite>design</cite>, as opposed to JB's perceived mindframe, better.

I find it bizarre that 'emotional' and 'expressive' are instantly assumed to be the predominant characteristics of human interpretation, as if we are somehow unable to actually see what we see and perform a rational analysis, but must rely on machines to get past our overriding emotional and expressive faculties. This is bollocks. I also think Hrant is wrong to attempt to try to frame this in terms of his favourite 'art vs craft' dichotomy, as if craft cannot come from the eye and hand: where else has it come from for the millennia of human making? We have an analytical faculty and the ability to make rational judgements regarding what we observe. Among other things, we have an obligation to employ this faculty critically in considering the value of methods and tools. Looking at the images in the first post of this thread, the first thing I immediately see is that all of the derived forms based on averaging have a large black bump in the lower left, while the one photographic image shows something quite different; this seems to me to be a problem of method, because the averaging does not take into account relative lightness and darkness of the type image. Similarly, in the photographic image, there is a clear but very faint indication of the full extent of the terminal of the upper bowl where it crosses the stem, and this is completely lost in the derived shapes, presumably because it was too faint to be preserved in the threshold conversion. So these are just two places in a single letter where the human eye tells us more than the proposed methodology and tools. This is not to say that the methodology and tools are without merit or promise but, ironically, that they must be subject to the same critical and interpretative analysis that we can also apply to the subject.\n\n"

He didn't say that this was good for readability, in fact he explicitly stated that it might not be a benefit. It is simply an observation about the way italic letters fit together as compared to the way roman letters fit together. If you consider even one factor affecting the fitting of italics vs romans, that the typical italic _a_ is a cognate form with _d_ and _q,_ then you have identified a significant reason for the need for fewer kerning pairs.

So even if someone disagrees with my criticisms, he or she can further the conversation by responding to them directly. But you tend just to repeat your original assertion. You have not once even tried to explain why what everyone else calls rhythm is not rhythm, and your rejection of that term is based in the very mistake of associating it with flow, so the rejection is begging the question. You keep saying that rhythm implies flow and therefore there is no rhythm. But I've been demonstrating precisely that rhythm does not imply flow -- indeed, flow implies lack of rhythm --, but refers to the spacial relationship of letters within words. I come back to this again and again because I think your rejection of the term is unfortunate, because this spacial relationship is crucial to bouma construction and good notan. At its simplest level, the distinction between the rhythm of letters within words and the rhythm of word spacing (which you have elsewhere insisted should be even, i.e. rhythmic) is key to identifying what constitutes a word. But if word recognition does indeed involve bouma recognition, then regular, i.e. rhythmic, spacial relationships are also important at the sub-word level because it is only in these relationships that role architecture can define recognisable shapes larger than a single letter.\n\nIt seems to me, as I write this, that we have spent a long time talking at cross purposes, because you've jumped on the word rhythm with the statement that 'There is no rhythm in reading because there is no flow'. We don't disagree about their being no flow (although, discounting regressions, saccades have an average length, and when they skip words they do so in a predictable fashion, and periodic pulse is the very stuff of rhythm; in fact, if there were smooth flow then that would really be a lack of rhythm). But has anyone actually been talking about rhythm in terms of reading physiology? No, we've been talking about rhythm in terms of spacial relationships of letters in word formation. And my 'contrived' illustrations, have shown how word formation falls apart if you mess with the rhythm of the letter relationships. I've never understood why you have taken so strongly against this commonly understandable and accurate terminology. As soon as you recognise that there needs to be a relationship between the white space inside a letter and the white space between the letters, you are moving in the area of rhythm. This is what rhythm is: a proportional relationship. If you are not going to call that rhythm, then you'll have to come up with another term, because the phenomenon is real, demonstrable, and important to the matters that concern us both.\n\nGive some serious thought to the nature of proportional spacial relationships in the way letters form words, and tell me why it doesn't make sense to talk about rhythm in letter spacing. I've adopted 'notan' and even 'bouma', and I think you should reconsider a term that accurately describes a phenomenon that we need to be able to talk about.

Looking with a magnifying glass would allow access, as you imply, to information that scans cannot provide - the shape of the metal's indentation into paper, as opposed to ink absorption. Unfortunately there is no way to measure these indentations accurately enough to inform, except in very general terms (like \"ink tends to overextend indentation at this point on that letter\"), the positioning of digital outlines, once one accepts the aspiration to preserve intentions on Griffo's part of which one is not aware. As Hrant says of Baskerville, Griffo's intentions will have altered during his work - that's consciousness for you - making any theory of his intent reductive.\n\nI accept that I would learn more about type design from your method than from mine (in whatever its final form is) but that's not the primary goal here. My final result should be something that I can learn from - and if I've done my work properly then its interpretation should be interpretation of Griffo's letter design, and so should remain arguable.\n\nA further note on \"bite\": the swerves in direction of interior and exterior outlines will in my version be much more similar to those of the punches than in most instances from the original 3D page; since a good deal of bite comes from these outlines working against one another, as they do in Griffo's but not in, say, Garamond's work, some of the bite that comes from the 3D impression will be made up for naturally (though I wouldn't begin to pretend that it's a tradeoff any sensible typographer would welcome).\n\nI'm very interested in your outline filtering - how did you do it? It'd be best to apply it to the PDF rather than the beziers, of course.\n\nAs for a trial of averaging from known punches, one would have to ensure that the process of printing was very similar to Aldus' for the results to be useful. That means matrix engraving, type cast from historical alloy, repeated impression at slightly varying angles and depths onto uneven rag paper, a small amount of ink of totally different consistency and composition to the modern stuff... Hard, as well as time-consuming and expensive, but not quite impossible: I think that we (not I!) know a surprising amount about Aldus' methods. I agree that it would be worthwhile.

It wouldn't be a perfect simulation, but you might uncover some useful information/principles nonetheless.\n\nOutline filtering: I've only ever done it in Illustrator, using that app's \"pre-built\" filters.  \nI haven't used the Brush filter, which i suspect could be the most malleable and useful.\n\n"

This is why in the various threads that touch on this subject I have insisted on the all-at-onceness of perception of visual rhythm, stressing that it is not sequential. It seems to me that simply surrendering to associations of rhythm with sequence or flow is to accept a kind of phenomenological blindness. It impoverishes both discourse and experience, not only in understanding of typography and reading, but in a broad range of visual experience.\n\nEverything you need to know about the non-sequential nature of visual rhythm is embodied in [this painting](http://web.archive.org/web/20150210130946/http:/www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/mondrian/broadway.jpg), and by the same token this painting cannot be understood without suppressing 'sequential processing associations' of the word rhythm even though, brilliantly, the painting alludes to several different kinds of sequential rhythm: jazz music, traffic, street noise.\n\n"

      "content": "Peter, I think the strategy you're talking about is the most attractive kind of reductionism I can think of. Are you recommending in practical terms that I get to the punch outline if possible, and if not that I take an outline derived with consideration for inkpress in corners and blunting at spurs from an averaged image like the one two posts up, write a fixed-front ductus over it, see where the ductus doesn't match and how the metal departs from it, assess the consistency of those modifications, and of second-order variation in manipulation (going on potentially ad infinitum but really it wouldn't be, not with humans), and then redraw the font appropriately, making further alterations until the result is intuitively satisfying and perceptually authentic?\n\nIt might help if I say that, though the primary purpose of this project is merely scholarly, a secondary purpose is in the production of fine digital books. I will Multiple Master for optical size, probably from 10 to 15 point, the maximum range for which I suspect MM is going to work effectively and manageably. Titling and photopolymer/matrix engraving versions might eventually follow, as might a set of sans titling caps (the 1499 caps would make an absolutely gorgeous <cite>very</cite> lightly modelled sans).\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the new images, George, especially the last which is, as you say, rather beautiful.\n\nMy concern, looking at the variation is as stated much earlier in this thread: it is the variation itself that contributes to the look of the letterpress Aldine page, so averaging the variation to produce single letterforms seems to me not to be a very good way to produce a 'faithful revival' of the type. To a very large extent, what you are averaging is not letterforms per se but printing artifacts affecting letterforms. Consider, for example the scan of the third _p_ from the left in the four examples a few messages back. In this specimen, the spur is very clearly present as a part of the letterform: it is really there in a very clean and structural way. Looking at this occurence of the letter, one knows for certain that this feature of the letter is Griffo's design. But in other examples, perhaps even the majority of examples, this feature may not be so clear. But lack of clarity does not imply lack of presence and certainly doesn't imply lack of design. It just means that the impression was very often bad or that individual sorts were worn or broken, _such that the design cannot be ascertained from those examples._ This means that you have to apply judgement about which samples display the design and which obscure the design through printing artifacts. Looking at that beautiful combined image, we can see that what is a clear design element in one example is, through averaging of printing artifacts, made to disappear: the averaged form embodies the lack of clarity.\n\nTo me, this suggests that the averaging methodology has merit relative to the careful selection of input. There needs to be an analytical process to determine which specimens show forth the design, and which are simply poor specimens.\n\n"

      "content": "I sort of agree. But that third p is very unusual in the length and solidity of its spur, and I think it shows some perhaps unknowable degree of merely random ink-press. We need something to sway us besides aesthetics - Griffo might chosen to make only a little spur. So we turn to the averaged master and see that, as one might anticipate knowing the properties of softish metal, beyond the spur and also to the right of the descender serif there are darker pale-greys - ie more than background-random cases of ink impression in these regions, implying that yes, these projections have been blunted and should be restored, according to judgement. On the other hand if one chose to believe that the splurge on the bottom of the second p of the four was a ravishing example of Griffo's real intent, lost in too many instances by blunting, then one could check this aesthetic choice against the average and see that the progression from darkest to lightest is much quicker moving vertically down from the serif than to the right of it, so that the descender of the second p is simply botchy.\n\nAlmost all the impressions are visibly poor in some part or other, and when errors coincide it can be hard to see them as such - in other words two 'p's can both look convincingly perfect but be wholly unlike. Thus in selecting good material one must be careful not to exclude too much, though in moderation I'm sure it's sensible, and I have done so in previous runs of the software.\n\n"
