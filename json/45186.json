I don’t see that option anymore.\n\nIt was debated quite a bit but I think there was still a lot of support on the forum for allowing edits. Myself I prefer that the edited post remains in its place in the thread, perhaps with some sort of indication that the post was edited.\n\n [‹ Single-use fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907162741/http:/typophile.com/node/45310 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [LCD or CTR monitors? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907162741/http:/typophile.com/node/45278 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I guess there is no solution that is commonly agreed on.  \nPeople were [complaining](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907162741/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42737/) about edited comments that spoiled the order and logics of whole threads. Others want to retain the opportunity of fixing typos or adding links (esp. on the Type ID board).\n\nNow the good Punchcut people have taken action. It might not be the final answer, but I’m quite happy with it.\n\n<cite>every word I say here is not golden</cite>\n\nExactly! So why would I want to go back and fix my prattling from yesterday? ;-)\n\n"

      "content": "Well, the fact that the order is messed up by edits is just the kind of craziness some people get used to far too easily and others are driven ’round the twist by. Also far too easily. Me, I pass it off as a an amusing quirk, like a car with crossed wires that honks when you use the turn indicators. Of all the forums I’ve seen, this is the only one that does that. Obviously the quirky coding is fixable. Using it as an excuse the get rid of the edit feature is like getting rid of the car because of a couple of crossed wires. Either live with the flaw (It’s not that big a deal), or fix it. I would wager that no one is _really_ all that confused when posts drop out of sequence because of edits.\n\n<cite><br>\n - every word I [or anyone] says here is not golden [russell]</cite>\n\nExactly! So why would I want to go back and fix my prattling from yesterday? ;-)\n\nThat argument works both ways, Florian:  \nI don’t know... Maybe you don’t want your spelling mistakes, bad grammar and poor judgment immortalized for all time or until the the day the Internet crashes and no one made a backup copy? (_hypothetical_ spelling mistakes, bad grammar and poor judgment, of course! :¬)  \nYour words are yours and if you want to change them why would anyone want to prevent you from doing so? One is of course at the same time, free to not change a thing if that is one’s choice.\n\nThat’s my 2 cents\n\n-=®=-\n\n"
