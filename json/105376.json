The results are in from [last post’s survey](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213903/http:/typophile.com/node/104961) on what I should pay for [_Butterick’s Practical Typography_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213903/http:/practicaltypography.com/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213903im_/http:/typophile.com/files/surveymonkeyresults_6736.png)\n\nI’m not sure what the results do to inform the discussion around reader-supported web publishing endeavors but here are a few of my own thoughts on this little experiment:\n\n1. Most Typophile readers are not interested in what I pay for _Practical Typography_.  \n2 . Very few people actually read this blog. OK, maybe a few more than 16, but definitely not more than 23.  \n3. My 150+ Twitter followers have failed me. Can one “fail” at Twitter?  \n4. Anyone with a decent Klout ranking wouldn’t touch this one with a ten-foot ascender. I can’t blame them.  \n5. Maybe this was a silly idea.  \n6. I should probably go back to, you know, _designing stuff_ and _teaching other people how to design stuff_.  \n7. I just paid $7.50 to take my kid to a local children’s museum. _He spent the whole time playing with a train set we already have at home_.  \n8. $7.50 is a respectable payment for _Practical Typography_.  \nI think.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213903im_/http:/typophile.com/files/practicaltypographypayment_5831.png)\n\n",
