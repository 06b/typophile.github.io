  "content": "Hi!\n\nThe query is related to the Helvetica typeface. Normally, Helvetica comes as a default typeface on both PCs and MACs. Though Helvetica comes as a default, it is not licensed ( for e.g, arial comes packaged with windows hence there are no restrictions on its usage). Therefore, what do I do if i have to recommend Helvetica as a typeface to the client. Do I ask them to buy it for use in their communications or can they use it freely?\n\n",

In your case the natural fallback would be Arial, as neither Helvetica nor Helvetica Neue is bundled with Windows or MS Office.\n\nGiving them the typeface is illegal, so designers should purchase a license.\n\n"
