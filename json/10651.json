It was done   \n_very_ quickly and I'm thinking of leaving it somewhat 'uncorrected',   \nand not tweak it very much, except any glaring problem that you see.   \n   \nAbout Tyson B: it wasn't my intention to make a 'distressed' version   \nof the face (my interest in distressed type is very low). In fact it's   \nan experiment: to create ink- and light-traps _through blurring_.   \nHow did I do it?   \n   \n ![Tyson](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414153011im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7244.gif)   \n   \nTyson looks tough but is quite delicate in fact.

The main problem with the Goudy Center database is that they wanted to charge money for name searches, which put people off using it or even bothering to submit to it.   \n   \nFontLab now has a nifty 'Check at MyFonts.com' button in the FontInfo naming panel, which goes off and checks to see if MyFonts lists any fonts with the name you are using. This is handy, but of course is limited in that it only checks the one source. If another freely accessible database were available, FontLab could check multiple sources and so provide more reliable feedback.   \n   \nRegarding the kind of abuse that Hrant suggests might happen (people submitting cool names for as yet non-existent typefaces to prevent other people from using them), you can only legally claim trademark on a name that you are actively trading goods or services under in the marketplace. You are also legally obliged to defend a trademark: there is no automatic protection. So if I start selling a pair of fonts called Nour & Patria, Hrant would be obliged to sue me or lose his trademark on the names. I suggest that names should be accepted for the database _only_ if the submitter is claiming them as trademarks, i.e. submission to the database constitutes a trademark claim.\n\n"
