  "content": "I know that weird stuff happened with fonts when you exported pages intto pdf:s in InDesign 2, and that the only proper way to get printable pdf:s was to print ps:es and distill them. When the cs version came, I was told that the problems were gone and that InDesign cs actally does everything ps+distiller did. However, when I analyze all possible problems with pdf:s created with cs in Acrobat, it still says that fonts are cdi type 0. Why? What are cdi fonts anyway?  \nJesper\n\n [‹ PC Laptop vs. Virtual PC for font testing.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205033635/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12913 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [OS X Font Weirdness ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205033635/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12957 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

They report that characters drop out, & we’ve seen it happen. Whether this is a problem due to a non-Adobe RIP or an older RIP, I don’t know.\n\n"

      "content": "CID’s (also called ’double byte fonts’) are used by InDesign to facilitate the use of another-language-typesets. They are supported by PostScript since 1999.  \nDue to a bug in older versions of InDesign even typefaces with only Western-encoding were converted to CID’s during the PDF-ing process. This has been remedied in the last version of InDesign (CS2 or 4.0).\n\nMind: All up-to-date RIPs should not have any problem processing CID’s. It is known that some of the third-part ones do, eg Harlequin (upto the last update, I guess).  \nUsing Distiller on a PS-dump removes some of the CID-encoding (mostly that on those Western-encoding fonts), but possibly not all of it, depending on the kind of font(s) you are using.  \nBeste way to ascertain a problem-free work flow is to use up-to-date RIP’s, preferably one with the real Adobe’flavour’...\n\n"
