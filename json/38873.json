  "content": "Hi all.\n\nA month ago I posted here concerning a logotype that I’m making. Thanks for your advice! I’ve devoloped a new one, but I’m not satisfied with it. Could you please help me develop a new one? Please take a look:\n\n[http://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/b90aee2697.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184900/http:/img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/b90aee2697.jpg \"http://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/b90aee2697.jpg\")\n\nThe logotype is for my (small) advertising and PR firm. The company name is my last name (the one you see above).\n\nThere’s one logotype that I really like. It’s a fictional one, but it’s really cool.\n\n[http://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/3383b76e87.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184900/http:/img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/3383b76e87.jpg \"http://img3.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/3383b76e87.jpg\")\n\nThe thing I like with the typography is that the Y is in the center of the word, and being wrapped by “WA” and “NE”. Two letters on each side. The font is also well made. Unfortunately I can’t use this technique as the name has seven letters.\n\nThe symbol is the best one I’ve seen so far. A “W” which is formed like a trident. The only symbol which have anything with the letter “G” I’ve found is the G-clef. But I don’t work with music so it’s nothing for me.\n\n**—————————————————-**\n\nThe font I use now (Adobe Garamond Pro) is okay. But not good enough. Do you have any suggestion conerning font/space et.c.? Should I use capital letters instad?\n\nI’ve got no idea what I should use as a symbol. The one I use now is a bit childish. Please help me with this one, I’ve got no clue. I’m stuck on this one.\n\nI would prefer if the symbol reminds one of a “G” or something similar.\n\n**—————————————————-**\n\nWhen writing in a design forum, I could take the opportunity to ask you about colors. I have experimented with colors, and 722A7E (C67/M100/Y14/K3) is the one color I like best. This is my profile color and I use it on my website too. Is it to aggressive? If so - which color do you think could fit “my profile”?\n\n**Thanks alot!**\n\n [‹ Bookman Swash Complete](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184900/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33223 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lubalin Graph - Ligatures/alternates ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203184900/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39158 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

For the third row, try lining up the bars to the edge of the square and see how that looks.\n\nTry one with the D hilighted, using maybe a sans with more squarish lettering so it looks overall symmetric. I don’t actually have a font that matches what I’m thinking outside of pixel fonts, and that’s not the right look either.\n\n"
