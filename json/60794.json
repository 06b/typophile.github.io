This pushes me towards the idea that this is an amateur font that is perhaps a custom font made by the 'artist' who did the lettering.\n\nIn case you cannot find the original font, [Klang](http://web.archive.org/web/20130416020917/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/klang/mt/) is pretty similar, and could be backslanted a bit to make it more vertical.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "If you want some choices that are even less formal than Klang, Robert Schenk of Ingrimayne Type has some hand-lettered pen fonts (at MyFonts): Gretchen Hello, Xahosch, Xaltid, Balboat and Hermainita. The last one is perhaps the neatest lettering, and most professional looking. The others are less formal.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
