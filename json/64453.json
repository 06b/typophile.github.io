However i was wrong with the code and it doesnt need that much.\n\nAnyway the thing i made above was made because my original idea failed, which has to look like this (it's not a font atm it's made in illustrator):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203134926im_/http:/typophile.com/files/example_4546.png)\n\nThe code looks now like (small part, and classes are same as in the top of this post):\n\nsub A.5 A' by A.6;  \nsub A.5 @all A' by A.6;\n\nsub A.4 A' by A.5;  \nsub A.4 @all A' by A.5;\n\nsub A.3 A' by A.4;  \nsub A.3 @all A' by A.4;\n\nsub A.2 A' by A.3;  \nsub A.2 @all A' by A.3;\n\nsub A.1 A' by A.2;  \nsub A.1 @all A' by A.2;\n\nsub A A' by A.1;  \nsub A @all A' by A.1;\n\nWhere the .# has to reach to 100 (or even more if possible).  \nOnly now when i type ABABABABABABABABA then it goes good but when i type  \nAAAAABAAAAABAAAAAABAAAAAAABAAAAAAB then the B just stays the B.1 version.\n\nI know why this is, instand of this:\n\nsub A.# A' by A.#;  \nsub A.# @all A' by A.#;\n\nit should grow to:\n\nsub A.# A' by A.#;  \nsub A.# @all A' by A.#;  \nsub A.# @all @all A' by A.#;  \nsub A.# @all @all @all A' by A.#;  \nsub A.# @all @all @all @all A' by A.#;  \nsub A.# @all @all @all @all @all A' by A.#;\n\netc.\n\nBut i have chars from A to Z and 100 alternate versions, if i want a max distance between 2 letters to be 50 for example (which is even a low amount cause i counted in a text and sometimes it takes even 50 chars before the letter b is coming back) then that would mean  \n26x100x50 = 130000 lines of code.\n\nSo if you ore someone else can help me to archieve my original idea then that would be great.\n\n"

You'll then be in a much better position to decide whether your projects are feasible, and whether opentype fonts is really an appropriate technology to use for that project.\n\nFontLab and FDK are both fairly complex tools, and while GSUB rules can be fairly powerful, they also have many limitations and are not designed with the kinds of things you have proposed in mind. Learning how all the pieces fit together is a lot easier if you are working on the kind of thing which can be readily compared with existing OT fonts. OpenType coding also differs in some fairly salient ways from programming which may not be obvious until you're more used to working with OpenType lookups.\n\nI'd start by reading through the FontLab manual as well as the documentation on Adobe and Microsoft's sites with the goal of understanding the big picture rather than using them as 'troubleshooting guides' whenever you encounter an error.\n\nAndré\n\n[p.s. Some of the you are doing would likely be more readily implemented using AAT rather than OpenType, though the set of tools available for developing AAT fonts is both more limited and less user friendly than those available for OpenType, so I definitely wouldn't recommend that as a place to start; however, if you are determined to do this as a font and find that OpenType doesn't meet your needs that might be an option to consider somewhere down the road].\n\n"
