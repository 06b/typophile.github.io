  "content": "Hey Everyone, I have been tasked with developing a new magazine... from scratch (pause) and I need some help with font choices.  \nHere is a short hand version of the project:\n\nMetro-style magazine  \nLifestlye and arts focus  \nclean text blocks  \nlargely photo-driven  \nPublished in WV (believe it or not)\n\nWhat I need from my fonts:\n\nSerif family - Reasonable sans mate  \nNo more than about 3 familys altogether  \nfresh look (Not garamond, or TNR)  \nOTF please, with SC, Ligs and Con. Alts.  \nTitle, Subheads, callouts, captions, the WORKS\n\nHow I will be abusing them:\n\n10/12 w/ -10/1000 letterspacing  \n8/9 captions  \nJustified... less hyphens.  \nI will figure the rest out when I am actually setting them up\n\nMy Boss and Co. Like:  \nGaramond  \nAkzidenz Grotesk  \nCaecilia  \nand a whole pantheon of other specimens I showed them = clueless.\n\nPlease, I know that this is alot of info, but you can live vicariously through me and pick anything you want, as I have an unlimited font budget(up to $300, LOL)\n\nFeel free to pimp your own work, or your friends, or your moms... :) TIA\n\n",

Anything from H&FJ will be cost prohibitive since they don't sell single weights.\n\nI like Hrant's suggestion of a Fleischmann-based design.

Very few text fonts are spaced too widely to begin with. I would expect you to open the spacing of a normal text face for use at caption size.\n\n"

My boss is carrying around the sheet of the Cæcilia sheets that I printed, I am going to try to pry them from his fingers...as I don't believe that is what I am looking for exactly.\n\nThe reason for the negative tracking spec is that when I am showing sheets, they keep using the words tighter. I have Cæcilia set at 9/10.2 and -25/1000 tracking... and it may still be not enough. It is killing me.\n\nSo far, I have liked the Fleischmann revivals alot, but I am not sure the x-height is what I need, since they keep talking smaller. I downloaded a pdf of it, and will be printing it tommorow. ( I LOVE TYPE SPECIMENS ) Thanks, everyone... your thoroughness and dilligence is much appreciated. I will be sure and post a proof of the \\*finished\\* product. I have to get my æss to work\n\nOh yeah, Stefan, thanks for pimpin' and for Hattrick... what is the license on that anyway? I converted it to PC TT and would like to use it on my site...\n\n"
