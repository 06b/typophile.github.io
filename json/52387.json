      "content": "You're discovering the difference between beziers in fonts vs in illustrator. Illustrator uses decimal values for coordinates on the art board, while fonts use integer values on the em square. The em square is pretty course as a result. Eg, say you have a square that is 3 em units wide. You scale it up 150%. Illustrator mentality says it is now 4.5emu. But fonts don't use decimals, so Fontlab rounds up to 5emu.\n\nWhen you try to draw a circle it's even worse! The following illustrates drawing a \"circle\" using the circle tool in fontlab (I added the pink em grid). The first is 1 emu in diameter, the next 2 emu, 3, 4, 5 etc. You can see the limitations of the coarse em square in this brutal example, and how scaling will introduce distortion. There's no way around it. But its a font issue, not a Fontlab issue.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101128114314im_/http:/typophile.com/files/em_coarse_4163.gif)\n\nHowever, it's not so bad. You'll generally not draw shapes 3emu in size! It does become a pain for ultra hairline fonts (you'll also want to keep an eye on symmetrical objects as they will not be if they're an odd emu width). This is one of the main reasons I gave up on drawing fonts in illustrator even though I love it as a drawing tool. I've learned to appreciate and become proficient FL too. Somtimes it's an advantage to be able to quickly say \"yes those handles are the same length.\" Tricky in illustrator. Now if FL would \\*borrow\\* AI's pathfinder and smart guides.. that would be fantastic.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "Please remember that by default settings, 1 pt in an EPS drawing (Illustrator file) corresponds to 1 font unit in FontLab Studio. So to get a glyph that is 700 units high in the font, you need to draw it 700 pt high in Illustrator. If you've drawn yours smaller, scale them up accordingly in Illustrator before bringing them over to FontLab Studio. The FontLab Studio manual has an entire section about using Illustrator to draw fonts, I recommend taking a look.\n\nBTW, it is not a limitation of FontLab Studio per se. It is the limitation of the digital font formats: they can only use integer coordinates. In Fontographer, we have code that supports fractional coordinates but the designer needs to explicitly snap the points to integers or the application will do that for him while generating the font. We agree that during the design process, non-integer coordinates are an advantage because you can losslessly scale down and up while drawing. So our goal is to have fractional coordinates support in FontLab Studio 7 (but not yet in version 6 which is planned for 2009).\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

      "content": "_say if you would size a character up that was created in fontlab would one still get the same problem?_\n\nSort of.\n\nThe inconsistency when importing from illustrator happens on import. You can import two identical shapes from different locations on the Illustrator art board and they can have different node placement in FL.\n\nOnce inside fontlab, it consistently rounds (distorts). So two identical shapes, scaled identically will be identically distorted. Fontlab will always try to best-fit a scaled object to the em square. If you scale again it will best fit the distorted shape in a distorted way, further distorting.\n\nAgain, small scale amplifies the distortion. To show this, I'll take a circle and scale it 115% in succession. First a 6emu circle, 60emu:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101128114314im_/http:/typophile.com/files/circlescale_small_5924.gif)\n  \nWow, that first scale was a doozy. Then FL does a decent job of approximating.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101128114314im_/http:/typophile.com/files/circlescale_large_4504.gif)\n  \nAt larger size, the distortion is hardly noticable. But if you look, our circle started symmetrical, but isn't throughout. **Bottom line: If you import from AI or scale something in FL, check it closely.**\n"

However, this potential has been \\*very\\* little used.\n\nPersonally I would not trust the reliability of a font that used this functionality. Or put another way, I'd bet real money (even in my newly self-employed state) that at least some consumers of fonts have assumed integer coordinates and will behave badly when confronted by something else. Which consumers, and how badly, would need to be determined by extensive testing.\n\nI should also note that in a Type 1 or CFF charstring there are (at least?) two ways to represent added accuracy in coordinates. The obvious one is to use decimal points directly. The less obvious one, which I gather some of Adobe's engineers would favor, is to use a \"div\" operator in the charstring. So instead of \"10.2\" in the charstring you'd have \"102 10 div\". And no, I can't tell you why this would be preferable. :)\n\nAdam wrote: <cite>So our goal is to have fractional coordinates support in FontLab Studio 7 (but not yet in version 6 which is planned for 2009).</cite>\n\nI take it this is only for internal use within FontLab?\n\nBill asked: <cite>Why the wait? Why force designers to have another five years of lousy data and bad transformations?</cite>\n\nWell, for the reasons I mentioned above, introducing it into \\*output\\* fonts (Type 1 or CFF) is rather risky and should be carefully tested and approached with caution.\n\nChanging assumptions in FontLab internals is not so risky, exactly, but is likely to be a pretty pervasive issue throughout an awful lot of code, not just a switch they throw in one spot. Seems to me it's kind of like switching an application from single-byte text handling to Unicode.\n\n<cite>Moreover, you don’t address the issue of floating point bcps, which Fontlab cannot do, but which have been present in PostScript for decades, including countless fonts made by Adobe.</cite>\n\nReally? I don't recall ever running into an Adobe made Type 1 or OpenType CFF font that used floating point coordinates for either off-curve or on-curve points. I'll admit that I don't usually spend a \\*lot\\* of time directly poking the charstrings, but I did look at quite a few in my \\>11 years at Adobe. When I talked to David about this whole question last, he certainly didn't bring it up.\n\nAll that said, I'd love to see an option for FLS to use floating point or at least a few decimal places for coordinates internally. That would be a good thing.\n\nEqually or more important, though, would be using hinting information to achieve intelligent scaling. As long as the final output fonts have anything less than floating point coordinates, inconsistencies are introduced not only by scaling, but even by MM interpolation. Two stems that are the same thickness in all masters of an MM may end up different in generated instances, due to rounding issues. Intelligent scaling applies hinting information to ensure that hinted distances are maintained during scaling, and during interpolation/extrapolation, including instance generation.\n\nMust go now - crying baby.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Because Fontlab always rounds up, a bcp which happens to be, say, 100.1, 200.1, would be rounded to 101, 201, and that would show as a serious distortion. Such imports do not often create a visible problem, but they do frequently enough for it to be a serious concern that anyone who has such data must consider very carefully, as it requires minute re-evaluation of the imported fonts.

Text based programs where initiating the use of graphics and graphical interfaces and effects and some of the Graphics programs were smart enough to offer the reverse cross over. Photoshop was doing wonderful things. Illustrator looked and felt like a kids paintbox program. FreeHand & even CorelDraw was years ahead in how the programs ran and felt. They treated the Graphic Designer like a professional.\n\nIllustrator and its creators could have easily grabbed 'pop out & hide away' menus that freed up the professional straight from CorelDraw, multiple page layouts from FreeHand or even QuarkXpress.

What they would look like in disassembled code I have no idea, but I imagine that they are the result of a division operator or some other indirect mechanism like that. Unless, of course, they simply reveal a colossal and hitherto unreported bug extant in Fog for over a decade. For the time being, I am operating on the assumption that Fontographer's reading is correct.\n\nI reluctantly becoming convinced that Fontlab's inability to perform floating point arithmetic either in scaling or in multiple master manipulation is a serious obstacle to high quality font production. At the very least, the rounding-off mechanism should be revised so that round-off errors below x.5 are rounded off to the next lower integer, rather than the current, crude system, whereby even the smallest fraction is rounded off to the next higher integer. However, that would only slightly mitigate, rather than solve the problem. I think Fontlab should go fully floating point immediately, and I think it should be either a free or low-cost upgrade. I don't think the company should work on anything else until this problem has been solved.\n\nNearly everyone uses Fontlab to create mulitple master families which are then generated as single instance fonts for sale. But considerable manipulation goes on before that point, and Fontlab's gross rounding off errors create an enormous amount of unnecessary work.\n\nWe need, too, to know more about how and when floating point BCPs are rasterized. I am inclined to think they _are_ rasterized, but I don't _know_.\n\nOne thing is certain: no align to grid or other rounding-off command in Fog will change the non-integer nature of non-integer BCPs. (To the extent, obviously, that they are accurately reported.)\n\nWhen developing a MM, you have only to make a few transformations before the round-off errors pile up to create gross distortions. That isn't what we pay computers to do!\n\nNo to mention which: we also, as I warned earlier, need to know how safely we can import pre-Fontlab fonts into Fontlab. And if we should do so at all.\n\nThe absence of comment from heavy hitters reveals either that they have been caught with their pants down or I have. Which is it? Obviously, one hopes it is the latter. Don't worry. I can take the embarrassment! But can they?\n\n"

In the case of PostScript, these are based on the particular device implementation. Most 32-bit architectures running PostScript use single byte accuracy (often referred to as just \"single\"), meaning that they can handle approximately 8 significant digits of accuracy.\n\nDoubtless somebody will disagree with me, but I think 8 digits of floating point accuracy is probably sufficient for almost all fonts. I might feel \"safer\" with 16 digits a.k.a. \"double\" precision, but I think there will be very very few cases where the difference matters.\n\nI have no idea what a single-precision PostScript interpreter will do when faced with a number with more significant digits.
