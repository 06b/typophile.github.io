      "content": "The words \"ideas with vision\" mean absolutely nothing. Global Investment is rather vague, is it investing globally for clients or is it investing in global markets like a countries economy. I don't get the orange, its pretty but not conserative, I also don't get the shape of the orange mark, is it a person? Just some thoughts, nothing mean meant.\n\n"

      "content": "thnx for the feedback. The client I am working for is through the sba, small business association, of Oakland. The owner of Global Investments co. already registered her ficticious name of business as the one stated above. I can agree its a very generic name and global is not even about of her mission statement. but I cant get her to change the name. its what she wants. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023205057im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nMY school has a program with sba to help small companies getting online. Her orginal logal was some clip art. The logo wasnt really thought out well because she doesnt have a big idea. If you know what i mean. Anyways, she wanted something that was friendly. The cirlces are just some thing I was playing around with and came up with a person. I guess its hard to tell I, and I should rethink the logo but I fear we dont have time. Do to our scope of the project. I feel though that these small business's do need some identity and branding strategy's. I suggested to my teacher that the graphic department should help these company's with their identities because since we are an html class we dont have time to develop it..   \n   \nAnways, I sad to hear its hard to read. and ideas with visions is her tagline, but it doesnt make sense either.\n\n"
