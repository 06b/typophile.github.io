  "content": "I’m looking for a version of the Times New Roman font, but it’s a little difficult to explain. Basically a few of the lower case letters have similar qualities to the capital case letters, such as the A and E and H and I and R, in such a way that they’d be just as tall and wide as the capitals, but would still be in lower case format.  \nThe alphabet might look a little like this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080909074230im_/http:/typophile.com/files/obscure%20times%20new%20roman%20type%20face_6394.PNG)\n  \nNow obviously this isn’t it, I just took the basic Times New Roman font and attempted to make it look like the one I’m looking for. But you get the basic idea (I hope).  \nI know this typeface has been used on a few book covers, I just can’t get to thinking of which ones. Young Adult Fiction I’m sure, I can’t quite put a finger on it though.  \nAnyways, if you could help me out, that’d be fantastic.\n [‹ (x) \"Alberta\" 70s style logo - Nordic {Sander de Voogt}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080909074230/http:/typophile.com/node/40842 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) NSGA logo slab serif - City, URW Egyptienne {Erik S, Florian} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080909074230/http:/typophile.com/node/40834 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
