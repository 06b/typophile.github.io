  "content": "Hi all,  \nHopefully, I do not upset anyone with this question if it is off-topic or not...I'm new to fonts and unsure if this forum is focused purely on the world of print, or also includes digital fonts :-)\n\nThe question - are there any available True-Type Font files that actually include glyphs for the control picture range, specifically SOH-STX-ETX... type of control codes to display when those codes are used (vs some of the standard ones I see are smiley, hearts, and upside-down 'L').\n\nA stackoverflow post referenced this document which is indeed what I'm looking for: [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2400.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803220232/http:/www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2400.pdf \"http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2400.pdf\")\n\nyou are open to flog me if I'm in the wrong area, otherwise I may need some hand-holding if I must 'craft' my own font file if none exist :-)\n\nthanks!  \n-Darren\n\n",
