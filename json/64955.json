  "content": "I've been making fonts since 1992 (even though those first ones I'd like to forget), and during this time I've developed a very effective system for producing a full character set font:\n\nAfter design/conceptual/idea stage, I start with lower case 'i' to determine the weight, x-height and basic form. From that comes 'l', and then 'n' to determine the width of the font. From 'n' comes 'h', 'u', 'm' and with some fiddling 'r'. Then I make'o'. And combining 'h' and 'o' I get 'b'. And 'p', 'd' and 'q'. And so on.\n\nUpper case starts with 'I', and from that comes 'H', 'L', 'E', 'F' and'T'. Then 'O' and from that 'C' and 'G', and combining 'E', there is 'D'. And so on.\n\nI've tuned this method to be pretty effective, and in ATypI Helsinki 2005 I managed to make a full Western character set font in 3 hours and 4 minutes from starting from nothing to a pdf-sample. It is a very, very poor font, but it is a working one, with more than 200 hand-made kerning pairs. I used RoboFog for glyph design and kerning pairs, and FontLab for OT-font production.\n\nThe reason I'm writing this is: if any other designer has a similar (or very different) method of making a font, I would love to hear of it.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Marathon Sample.indd\\_.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201093431/http:/typophile.com/files/Marathon%20Sample.indd_.pdf) | 21.98 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "If there is commonality in design elements between letters I will copy, paste, join and transform to add glyphs.  \nOften, I work by morphing an earlier of my fonts, or cannibalizing from them and transforming the pieces.  \nHowever, I try not to rationalize and repeat my method, preferring to let the emerging type's voice find its own form, rather than be the product of a system.\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, I thought as much, James. The method I've come up with is just economics. And I agree with Nick as well; the design does dictate the final production. However, I do not go back to my earlier designs, but rather keep one design as one design, and not take from earlier work.\n\n"
