  "content": "Hi all!\n\nNeed some comments about that:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120508010323im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Eservices_logo_proposal_6592.jpg)\n\nTo get you into the picture:  \nI've been ask to redesign the Identity of a web design, development hosting, marketing etc. company based in mauritius ( [www.eservices.mu](http://web.archive.org/web/20120508010323/http:/www.eservices.mu/ \"www.eservices.mu\")). Its a small agency aiming high, they want to be the leader in the sector in mauritius and looking forward to export their services. They want to be seen as professionals, reliable, proactive and responsive.\n\nThis what i've come with.\n\nWhat do you think guys?\n\nThx\n\nJean-Lou Désiré\n\n",

And the circled \"e\" is too big. You have just scaled up the normal proportion of \"e\" to make it bigger..try to reduce its thickness to the thickness of the word\"services\".\n\nSatya\n\n"

It's certainly readable within the name of the company.\n\nThat said, I read it as 'services' with a round logo.\n\nYou might want so spell out 'eservices' completely.\n\nOf course, I'd suggest they pick a better name than 'eservices'. That's sort of like calling the company 'web design'. But I'm guessing that's a different battle. ;o)\n\n"

Also you could look at the r, whose form is making a large space with the v, maybe cutting the curve and closing the rvi kerning. Ultimately the look is attractive and _fairly_ modern, I think this logo will date fairly quickly, which I suppose is part of the nature of the business it is serving.  \nTim\n\n"

Cliche, indeed, but if you are going with the cliche, one probably needs to stick with it, and keep it lowercase.\n\n"
