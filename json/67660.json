I am also including some additional elements I plan on incorporating to help represent the different types of wildlife.\n\nTo be honest, I think the wildlife text below UTAH needs to be punch up in some way, any thoughts?\n\nThanks for your time and candid feedback.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [utw\\_logo.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108002622/http:/typophile.com/files/utw_logo.png) | 30.1 KB |\n| [utw\\_icons.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108002622/http:/typophile.com/files/utw_icons.png) | 15.48 KB |\n\n",
