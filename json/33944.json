Rather than bookmark the website i wrote down names of typefaces in hope of later purchase; now in desperate search of that website since i can’t find this two typefaces anywhere on the web.\n\nGoogle is returning results regarding “picking up the right font” and “using the font wich is closer to ..” not paying attention to zilion of my keyword combinations and tricks.\n\nI’d be very grateful for any information regarding this two typefaces!\n\n [‹ greek ductus](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205012449/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33869 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Headline Serif to Compliment Dax ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205012449/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33969 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
