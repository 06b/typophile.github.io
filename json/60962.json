I think it's in part of reintroducing themselves in a more competitive (thanks to the recession) market. If you see something thousands of times, it loses its impact, much like the nike logo and mcdonald's arches have become fixtures in our modern culture. We see them too much, and therefore pay less attention. Should this theory hold water, it gives me hope for future endeavors - business always needs graphic designs. ^\\_^\n\n",
