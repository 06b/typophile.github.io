  "content": "Hello.\n\nI'm fairly experienced in Illustrator, but there's a technique that I can't seam to figure out.\n\nHere the designers used some circles as guides. Very sharp and snapping the guide.\n\n![]()https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/368240/screenshots/1784157/bravura-bratus\\_1x.jpg\n\nMy Problem:  \nI know how to make an object into a guide, but how do I get my objects curves to be as clean as the guides. I can do it by eye, but it's never exactly on point.\n\nDoes this technique have a name I can google or can somebody send me some tutorials.\n\nThank you.  \n1 Se Tags (rediger): logoIndhold tagged with logo, objectIndhold tagged with object, logotypeIndhold tagged with logotype, circleguideIndhold tagged with circleguide, custom guideIndhold tagged with custom guide, object-guideIndhold tagged with object-guide, smartguideIndhold tagged with smartguide\n\n",
