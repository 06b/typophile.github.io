Medina.\n\nCubanica believes that design comes from the investigation and interpretation of culture. It is our job to find the cultural essence of each project we work on and speak in its language through the medium of design.\n\nOur work was included in the Design Triennial exhibition at the Smithsonian’s Cooper Hewitt Museum as well as the Art Directors Club Young Guns III exhibition. A Cubanica book design for Coisa Linda is part of the Library Archives Collection at the Museum of Modern Art. Our work has appeared in numerous publications, among them Communication Arts Magazine, How Magazine, Idea Magazine, and Extreme Fonts.\n\nSome of our clients have included The Museum of Modern Art, Teen People Magazine, Harper Collins Books, The Art Directors Club, ESPN The Magazine, The National Hockey League, Ogilvy & Mather, Persea Books, Smithsonian Institution (Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum) and Upper and Lowercase Magazine.\n\n[http://www.cubanica.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019015001/http:/www.cubanica.com/ \"http://www.cubanica.com/\")\n\n",
