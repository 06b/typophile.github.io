      "content": "Font Bureau sells \"Carter & Cone\" Miller. I believe FB has augmented the number of sizes/weights of Miller with the work of other designers, but what Carter drew up is available. According to Cherie Cone, Carter & Cone get the same amount of money whether they sell you the font, or FB does.I got my fonts from Matthew Carter only because I wanted some special characters.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nBoth Miller and Monticello are very good fonts, but you'll probably find more uses for Miller if you can only afford one family.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
