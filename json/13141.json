  "content": "Recently, after learning of the roots of italic, I have been paying more attention to them and how it seems that majiscules in Italic sets never really seem to fit. The more I look at them, the uppercase is basically just angled. I realize they have been redrawn for the set, but does anyone else sense that disconnect between the upper and lowercase in Italic sets ?\n\n [‹ Plaka Joke](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013184335/http:/typophile.com/node/13165 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Photoshop Users Headline ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013184335/http:/typophile.com/node/13099 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
