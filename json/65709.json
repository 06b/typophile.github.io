  "content": "Hi Guys,\n\nI appreciate that there are a lot of wise heads here and people who know the Font industry's online presence backwards, so I'd love to know the hierarchical state of third party Font sellers.\n\nFor instance, as I regularly get the MyFonts newsletter I was wondering whether MyFonts has a direct competitor? Are they the biggest? Is there someone bigger? Or someone on the horizon taking ground?\n\nWho has the greatest piece of the pie when selling other designers Fonts?  \nWho's below them?\n\nCheers In Advance for any knowledge.\n\nDrj\n\n",
