Script, text, and display typography - all are welcome. Big clients, little ones, or self-promotional - it’s all good to me. Work can be already published or in process. Please email examples and a brief description of your project to: tamye {a} typelife.com. Looking forward to seeing what you’ve been working on.\n\n [‹ Help!
