This catalog contains the complete typeface with Kursiv, Halbfette und Fette and with the complete character sets. I addition, I also have Ratio Latein samples from the later photo-composition era. However I have only a slow modem connection. Therefore I cannot upload high-resolution reproductions of these samples.\n\n"
