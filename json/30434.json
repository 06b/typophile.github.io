      "content": "When I was in college I went through a phase like that as well. I was obsessed with hand cut lettering used on store fronts and once off signage jobs for building sites. So under the cover of darkness I would visit such places where typographic niceties were to be found and i would, ahem, 'borrow them'. Over the years I built up a pretty impressive collection and had the whole house decorated. It became a kind of phenomenon here in Ireland - every student seemed to be doing it (borrowing them I mean - I'm sure they did not have the same appreciation for letters as I did) and it even made the news on TV and National press etc. It was a slow news week. But I've grown up now and no longer condone such activity :(\n\n"
