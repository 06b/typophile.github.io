  "content": "Here's the main weight of Patria, my first \"serious\" Latin text face. It's part of a larger system which contains \"counter-balanced\" Armenian fonts (it's a long story - as you might suspect).   \n   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/plat\\_reg.swf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/plat_reg.swf)   \n   \nYou'll need to do a fair amount of zooming, and please pardon the occasional outline infidelity that Flash introduces (like in the inner part of the lc \"j\"'s tail, the top-right of the numeral \"2\", et alia).   \n   \nI'm daring to cast Patria as a next-generation newspaper face (or at least a face fit for magazines). Its x-height is somewhat small for this purpose, because I place more value on boumas (word shapes) than most designers. Also, it actually sets narrower than it looks, maybe because the open, generous forms increase its apparent size/width.   \n   \nI've tried to give Patria a full-bodied rigidity (read: masculinity) that seems to me to be lacking in the field of text face design. The Carolingian structures are generally very fluid/feminine, which is nice, except I feel there's too much of it now. Blackletter is very masculine, but it's not really usable any more (or at least not right now). The post-modern boys use a lot of rigidity, but they tend to apply it too literally to allow for immersive reading - I've tried to be more subtle. On the other hand, in certain places I've consciously sacrificed readability in order to reinforce the design's character (like in making the lc \"s\" somewhat wide).   \n   \n----   \n   \nI hadn't looked at Patria for over two months, but now that I'm re-evaluating it, I can see a few things I'd like to change, pending feedback from you guys:   \n   \n1. I want to make the beaks that come off of horizontal bars (like in the UC \"F\") much larger.   \n   \n2. I'm going to rethink the numerals. I'm considering making them Carter-style (\"hybrid\") numerals, but the all-horizontal stress I really cherish. Any ideas?   \n   \n3. I'm also unhappy with a number of the non-alphabetic glyphs, but I'll wait for you to tell me which ones \\*you\\* don't like! And I guess that applies to the \\*alphabetic\\* glyphs too...   \n   \n4. I personally prefer the alternate UC \"U\", but hesitate to place it as the primary form.   \n   \n5. Are the accents too small?   \n   \n6. In the Italics: even though I want it to be rigid like the Roman (in fact, I like it to be as close to the Roman as aesthetically and functionally possible), I think I'm going to make the beaks/terminals (like in the lc \"s\") softer in contour.   \n   \n7. The spacing was a rush job - it needs to be redone. Also, I'm starting to think that it's too loose overall, unless I should account for severe ink bleed - in case my original target medium (newspapers) is reasonable. Lastly, I've yet to add any UC-UC kerning (there are just some manual tweaks right now). For this, I'm considering giving all UC pairs wide spacing, since it helps all-caps setting. Crazy?   \n   \n8. I'm considering making midcaps (like in Fenway). If I do, then I might implement that overall loose UC spacing I just mentioned for the midcaps, but not the regular \"full\" caps.   \n   \n9. I will eventually put trapping in the font - the degree of trapping depends very much on the best usage medium for this face.   \n   \n----   \n   \nI have a lot of trouble evaluating my own work (especially something outside Armenian, my specialty), and have to constantly fight myself to find the right compromises, so any insight would be greatly appreciated.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

It is very readable, from what I can tell of the small paragraph.   \n   \nI can tell you what I don't like far easier than what I do, because I like the sum of the parts, but not neccessarily the parts themselves.   \n   \nI don't like the numbers at all. I think you should go back to the drawing board with them. I don't think any newspaper designer would want to use these as they're more designery (is that a word?) than utilitarian.   \n   \nThe italic is a little too subtly angled. The word \"system\" hardly stands out at all in that sample paragraph. Also, given the overall aesthetic I don't think it's neccessary to make the italic version so similar in lettershape to the regular.   \n   \nI cannot see this working as a headline or subheading font, unless you have something up your sleeve for the bold and black versions. The individual letters are not pretty enough, at least not in this regular version, and at least not in my opinion.   \n   \nThe \"g\": I would have thought that with a vertically stressed font you should avoid the diagonal swoop of the top of the lower bowl. Apart from the \"s\" this is the only letter that doesn't conform vertically.   \n   \nThat \"U\" works fine, like Stephen says. But apart from that one instance I can only say that I like the overall effect, but I can't point to anything specific as I think that for the most part you've successfully designed a font that works for word shapes and high readability.\n\n"

I'm surprised to hear that.   \n   \n\\> the overhangs on the 'f' and 'r' distract.   \n   \nIn the Italic, right? Well, I think I agree.   \nProbably the paucity of serifs in the Italic   \nis causing the beaks to stand out too much.   \n   \n\\> The beaks bigger? A la Eureka?   \n   \n(I assume you mean in the Roman only,   \n and not the \"f\" or \"r\" in any case.)   \n   \nEureka is a great design, and there's stuff in Patria (eg the   \nserifs) that's pretty similar. Some of my beaks are larger, and   \nsome of them \\*need\\* to be larger, but I'll note one significant   \ndifference (which is also the case with Foundry's Form, as well   \nas FF's new Zine, and Parkinson's Azuza): the beaks are abrupt,   \nnot adnate like mine. Formally, that's the way to do it, since   \nthey then match the structure of the serifs. And I almost went   \nthat way myself, except I realized that it makes the design too   \nmechanical in a way. I wanted to express more depth in my design,   \nso I'm going for a different level -or maybe flavor- of harmony,   \neven though I'll surely get some flack for it.   \n   \nI might still change my mind, but some people have actually   \nappreciated the duality, so I've kept it. But if I do change   \nmy mind, I'd soften the serifs instead of hardening the beaks.   \n   \n\\> Why hesitate on the 'U'?   \n   \nBecause many people hate it. My main reason for preferring it   \nis authenticity: I think that's how the Romans would've made it.   \n   \nMy \"d\" is in a similar vein, except I found a compromise   \nbetween the pure structural form (like Gill used), versus   \nthe established one (which is way too homogenous with some   \nother characters -most notably the \"b\"- for my taste).   \n   \nOh, and there's some of my Alphabet Reform in there too... :-)   \n   \nMartin:   \n\\> I don't think any newspaper designer would   \n\\> want to use [those numerals] as they're more   \n\\> designery (is that a word?) than utilitarian.   \n   \nYou have a point.   \n   \nBTW, the best word I've encountered for   \nwhat you're describing is \"mannered\".   \n   \n\\> The italic is a little too subtly angled. The word \"system\"   \n\\> hardly stands out at all in that sample paragraph.   \n   \n\\> I don't think it's neccessary to make the italic   \n\\> version so similar in lettershape to the regular.   \n   \nThis is a complex issue, and I worry about getting too deeply   \ninto it here. I think I'll start another thread (eventually).   \n   \nFor the moment, let me quickly state the following (hoping   \nthat it's not too cryptic): when it comes to text fonts, I   \nthink there's a huge difference between what we consiously   \nsee versus what we think we see when immersed.   \n   \n\\> I cannot see this working as a headline or subheading font,   \n\\> unless you have something up your sleeve for the bold and   \n\\> black versions.   \n   \nYou're right.   \nThe display cuts would have to be much more regular.   \nNote that my bold is a text bold, not a display bold.   \n(But as with the italics, a full elaboration of the   \n argument is certainly needed.)   \n   \nIt's actually an interesting paradox, the text versus   \ndisplay conflict. Certainly, a text font can be made to   \nlook less ugly than it can get away with at small sizes,   \nbut I ponder the true limits of that. I have this hunch   \nthat any real -I mean really real- text font has to have   \na certain ugliness. If that sounds crazy, just look at   \nsome of Tracy's work.   \n   \nBut maybe Patria could be less ugly.   \n   \n\\> The \"g\": I would have thought that with a vertically stressed   \n\\> font you should avoid the diagonal swoop of the top of the   \n\\> lower bowl. Apart from the \"s\" this is the only letter that   \n\\> doesn't conform vertically.   \n   \nNot surpisingly, I've thought long and deep about the \"g\".   \nMy conclusions are somewhat unorthodox, but if I don't   \nfollow them I'd be hypocritical. More to come...   \n   \nStephen:   \n\\> I think they stand out \\*too\\* much, and only because the weight is   \n\\> too light. Even it up with the roman and keep the angle as it is.   \n   \nNote also that the x-height of the Italic is smaller.   \n   \nThe weight calibration issue doesn't bother me, because everything is   \non an axis. I just need to do some real print runs from Lino output to   \ndecide the exact weight locations. What is increasingly worrying me,   \nthough, is the extremes: they might be too close, especially the Bold.   \n   \nTiffany:   \n\\> maybe there is too much 'scotch' in [the numerals]?   \n   \nNow that's interesting. Do you mean that they're too   \ncurly or something? Or that they need to sober up? :-)   \n   \n\\> The '2', '4' and '6' seem the most in need a fewer curves??   \n   \n(What about the \"9\"?)   \nI agree on the \"2\", but the \"4\" is my darling.   \nAs for the \"6\"/\"9\", I'm probably going to change them   \ncompletely, making them bowl-with-curved-diagonal-stick.   \n   \n(BTW, concerning the numerals, I'm sure you can tell that they're coming   \n from that thread I once started about \"Latinized Arabic\" numerals.)   \n   \nStephen:   \n\\> [The 'f' and 'r' hang too much] in the roman as well.   \n   \nRemember my penchant for promoting boumas (word shapes).   \n   \nThe Roman's \"f\" especially I'm pretty content with.   \nBut its \"r\" is admittedly more difficult to justify.   \n   \n\\> Not fan of the 'g' either.   \n   \n:-(   \n   \n\\> I'd buy.   \n   \nCool. Just send me 500 Euro in advance, wire-   \ntransfer to my Cayman Islands account is fine.   \n   \nOle:   \n\\> can you explain the design concepts of the fl and fi ligatures   \n   \nWell, Bob, I'm very happy you asked that question! :-)   \n   \nDifferent fonts need different tactics for the f-ligatures,   \nbut for some reason most designers appear to be to shackled   \nto some strange standards that were established who know how   \nlong ago and for what peculiar reasons (maybe for showmanship).   \nMy ligatures look like that because to me making a font work   \nis more important than pleasing the establishment. If my x-   \nheight were smaller, I'd probably merge the \"f\"'s beak with   \nthe \"i\"'s dot in the \"fi\". On the other hand, the conventional   \n\"fl\" ligature in particular usually looks horrid; it's really   \na mannered display-font trick, not something text-worthy.   \nI decided to chop off the el's top serif.   \n   \nMartin:   \n\\> there seems to me to be not enough difference in the weights.   \n   \nThis is actually the same deal as with   \nthe Italic issue you were making above.   \n   \n\\> looking at the screen is less than optimal   \n   \nIt's difficult to over-emphasize that. The lack of   \ncongruence between the screen and the actual printed   \nend-result is really staggering. Even a 1200 dpi laser   \ndoesn't cut it.   \n   \n\\> it's of primary importance in designing a text family.   \n   \nTotally.   \n   \nJacques:   \n\\> You are using more flat curves (Lc 's' e.g.)   \n\\> and very round ones (Lc 'c' e.g.).   \n   \n\\> I would to try to make the 'flat'   \n\\> curves a little bit rounder.   \n   \nThis opens up another interesting world! Remembering that my   \nintention is to give Patria a certain rigid masculinity, let   \nme ask: what's more rigid, a perfect circle, or an ellipse?...   \n   \nI totally agree that making the \"s\" more curvy would make   \nthings more harmonious, overall. But a very circular form is   \nperhaps \"closer\" to a straight form in a more nebulous way.   \nAlso, a curvy \"s\" would make the font too feminine. Note the   \nother important glyphs which have some unexpected straight   \nsegments: \"a\", \"e\", \"g\".   \n   \n\\> Lc 'g': I would close his belly,   \n\\> or try to find a more subtle ending.   \n   \nLike I said above, I'll try to elaborate more   \nin the future, but for now let me just say this:   \n1. I believe that the closed-bowl bicameral \"g\" is a flawed   \n structure in terms of the nature of the Latin alphabet.   \n2. The strong ending reinforces boumas.   \n   \n\\> If this face is to become a face for newspaper,   \n\\> I wouldn't experiment too much with structure,   \n\\> as you did with Lc 'd'.   \n   \nThat's a good point. Although I feel my structure   \nis more readable, it might be going too strongly   \nagainst expectations. Gill got away with a much   \nmore unconventional form... but that was Gill!   \n   \n\\> the eye of the Lc 'e' is too big   \n   \nIt's too big for optimal readability, true. But that's   \none place where I decided to sacrifice a little bit of   \nreadability for character. Some other places:   \n1. The \"a\"'s middle bar is too rigid.   \n2. The \"a\", \"g\" and \"s\" are all too wide,   \n and too big-headed (which are actually   \n structurally related things).   \n   \nBTW, check out this \"e\" (on the bottom-right):   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.myfonts.com/Character0065Style8019.html)   \nIt's butt-ugly, but man, does it ever work like a charm!   \n   \nAnyway, I should consider making a more tame/readable version   \nof Patria, but in any case the differences will be very subtle,   \nat least on the surface. What to call it?...   \n   \nBTW, very much of these critiques here seems to me to be related   \nto the display versus text issue. When I hesitate about some of   \nthe good points you all make, it's because I'm cautious in my   \nhazy understanding of the feral wolf that is text face design,   \nversus the domesticated hound that is display design.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Which doesn't mean I don't respect Catich's \\*work\\* (just like so many people hated Jan van Krimpen, but admired his designs, and even thoughts). In fact, on my next trip to UCLA I will be checking out a copy of his \"Reed...\" book, to see what I can learn from it.   \n   \nNow, two questions (for now) to you:   \n1. What do you think of Adobe's Trajan?   \n2. Are you the same person as \"Teri\"?   \n   \nIf you refuse to answer these questions, then I think I (and most probably others) know who you really are.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Partly to clarify the development of Patria, but also hoping to spur others into providing glimpses into their work method, I thought to present a partial elaboration of Patria's development. BTW, it's pretty jet-set, so you might even enjoy it!   \n   \nNour came first, and although it incorporates much of my thoughts on readability, it's based on the first style of Armenian type (which is still used, but is seen by many as being old-fashioned at best - I won't go there here/now). This first Armenian type was in turn was based on medieval Armenian manuscripts - a sample:   \n [http://www.armsite.com/miniatures/mnshow.phtml?slide=3](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.armsite.com/miniatures/mnshow.phtml?slide=3)   \n   \nHere's one of the six sheets of drawings I made for Nour, while I was in Yerevan (during the summer of 2000):   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour\\_yerevan.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour_yerevan.gif)   \n   \nSince I consider \"authentic\" Armenian writing to have a slant (noting again that Armenian doesn't really need italics), but weighing that against the bulk of current Armenian designs (which are upright), and furthermore minding readability, I decided to give the font a slight slant, specifically 1/16 = ~3.58 degrees. And this is actually where the slant of Harrier and Patria-italic comes from.   \n   \nAlso, since I had plenty of time and no handy access to a computer, I went ahead and drew the letters as close to their (hopefully) final form as I could. It feels like I did more erasing than drawing, but as you can see I still made some small markings concerning adjustments. But in the end, only one letter (out of 38 x 2 characters) underwent a structural change.   \n   \nDuring ATypI's conference in Leipzig I realized that I simply \\*had\\* to make a Latin partner for Nour, and the evening after I went to a bar (called \"Letterman\"!), and over some Obsolut Mandarin I drew some rough stuff:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier\\_leipzig.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier_leipzig.gif)   \nI with I could blame the vodka for the poor quality, but the truth is my freehand-drawing skills suck.   \n   \nA couple of days later I drew these at a sushi bar in Frankfurt:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier\\_frankfurt.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier_frankfurt.gif)   \nIt was over some Sapporo and a spider roll, so I guess that explains \"krab\"...   \n   \nThe next day in Amsterdam, a few hours before boarding my plane back to LA, I was having some mint tea in a place called Goa, and I made a breakthrough:   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier\\_amsterdam.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier_amsterdam.gif)   \nI say breakthrough because I figured out exactly how to apply my beloved \"rigidity\", and drew the \"a\" and \"e\" (a couple of \\*very\\* important characters) to satisfaction. You can also see the original \"g\", which I saw as too rigid in the end. That \"g\" also had a \"rationalist\" stroke contrast distribution, but I decided to compromise it with what other type designers expected to see. :-/   \n   \nBack in LA, I started doing the \"scannable\" drawings, but since I then had much more time-pressure as well as easy access to a computer, I didn't bother to \"normalize\" the weight, slant, width, or even the proportions - since those can be done with software. I drew the structures, and experimented a bit too (note the \"k\").   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier\\_la.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier_la.gif)   \n   \nAfter a pretty long, sporadic process, I ended up with the beta version of Harrier (around the spring of 2001):   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/harrier-beta.gif)   \n   \nAt this point, I decided to make a somewhat complex \"balanced\" typeface system which combines Armenian and Latin fonts in different ways to maximize versatility. Among other things, this included the creation of the weight extremes for each of the 5 master designs. Harrier changed a little and became the Latin style subordinate to Nour, and it also spawned Patria and its italic, in parallel. After that, Patria got a subordinate Armenian style - which looks a lot like most of those current Armenian designs I mention above!   \n   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/nour-latin.gif)   \n [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/patria-italic.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418114114/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/nour&patria/dev/patria-italic.gif)   \n   \nAlthough different in proportions, \"serif-ness\", terminals, and even some characters (like the \"a\" and \"g\"), the two are structurally the same. As for the roman of Patria, it also comes from Harrier, but it required deeper changes, like in the arches of \"hmnu\", the armature of the \"k\", and other places.   \n   \nPatria's atypical provenance makes it admittedly somewhat unorthodox, but I hope I've applied everything with enough subtlety to avoid rejection.   \n   \nOne last thing: I've decided to make some improvements to Patria, but one thing continues to escape resolution... Should I reconcile the abrupt serifs with the \"adnate\" (smooth) beaks (like in the lc \"s\"), or should I hope that they form a higher order of harmony (but maybe to the point of discord)? And if I reconcile them, should I make the serifs smooth (going towards early 20th century transitional designs, like Times), or should I make the beaks abrupt (like a lot of contemporary work - Eureka comes to mind)? Once I answer this line of questioning (hopefully with your help), I can start thinking about releasing this thing already!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Part of the reason for this is that -even if you're a submissive person, which I'm not- practically nobody will teach you too much these days unless you pay them.

It kind of meanders without strength or direction.   \n   \nWell, I hope that the tail has \"inner strength\": note the rigid section in the middle. But quite possibly the join is too soft - maybe something more angular (like in the cedilla?) would be better. One thing I won't do is make the top of the tail horizontal: that has no place in the Latin alphabet - sorry everybody. Also, I don't mind picturing what the/a hand might do in drawing a letter, but I don't actually draw forms by hand - just the outlines - otherwise it's not really type. The forms are in my head - the less things interfere in their eventual physical manifestation, the better.   \n   \n\\> I really like the g from harrier.   \n   \nInteresting.   \nHarrier's is the original, and Patria's was derived from it (mostly) my shortening things vertically. Maybe something got lost in the translation (or something needs to be added).   \n   \nThanks for the comments!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
