I think that some of the text samples (on the right) are too small and too dense to be seen easily, In particular, it's very hard to distinguish the three different justification examples - hard to see the title and hard to see the differences. - Herb\n\n"

      "content": "I was referring to the thumbnails - quite honestly I didn't even realize they could be clicked on! However, my comment on the alignment examples still holds. They aren't sufficiently ragged to be noticeable. Similarly, the rivers aren't wide enough or long enough to be really disturbing (even if they're quite realistic). Pedagogically, exaggeration can be more effective than subtlety.\n\n"

The text describes typographic terms with examples folded into the text. F.ex., the paragraph on rivers (flod)... well, a river runs through it.\n\n"

      "content": "\"the basics of type in a super dumbed down way\"\n\nI think you succeeded in doing that — but who is your target audience supposed to be? Are the people whom you want to read your site likely to want things presented in a dumbed down way?\n\nI think there's a fine line between simple, laid back, and easily understood vs. patronizing. I'd be wary which side of the line you fall on — it's always good to be funny, but being \"fun\" in the way you're being might suggest \"childish\" or an attitude of talking down.\n\nAs an exercise, it's well done.\n\n"
