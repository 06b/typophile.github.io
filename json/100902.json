  "content": "What is a good serif font to pair with Futura? I'm using Futura Std Heavy/Bold to be more specific. I've been on the website typeconnection.com and it says that ITC Century is a good one but I'm not sure yet if that's the best right now. Does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably fonts that could be found on the Adobe Font Folio Package because that's what I have access to.\n\n",
