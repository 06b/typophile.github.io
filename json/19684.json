As a fellow kiwi and someone who studied with Kris not so long ago it is fantastic to see a new NZ type designer (and one I have had the pleasure of knowing) breaking into the international market. Keep going mate, I look forward to owning some of your faces in the not too distant future.\n\n-nic\n\n"
