At lunch he told a joke i found quite humorous:\n\nQ: what do making love in a canoe and american coffee have in common?  \nA: they're both too close to water.\n\nFor a few more insights, you can check out [my other blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021153737/http:/www.pilcrowtype.com/blog) (still very much a work in progress).\n\n",
