  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nIt was with much pleasure that I discovered this website and the wonderful enthusiastic discussions that typographers have here!\n\nAs a designer in her first year of professional work, I've encountered a question that has gone unanswered for some time.\n\nHaving read books by great designers (Vignelli, Bringhurst etc.) as well as this forum I became enthusiastic about the use of baseline grids in my work. This technique had not been taught at university and once I began to practice using the baseline grid in my personal work I found that I could hardly do without it.\n\nHowever, at not ONE of the studios I have worked in to date (about 4 or 5 so far)has any designer been in the practice of using a baseline grid. Furthermore, I have found that rather than hard using hard returns, half line gaps etc., most designers specify their paragraph spacing in millimeters. My question is, is using millimeters for paragraph spacing bad practice when line spacing is being specified in another unit (points) as therefore the values for line spacing and paragraph spacing have no relationship?\n\nMy second question arises from an art director having asked me to make the y-co ordinate of each object on a page in InDesign a whole number as they believed that this reflected typographic discipline, as opposed to placing objects with a y-coordinate that involved a decimal point, e.g. 5.65. What are your opinions on this?\n\nSorry for the long post! I would appreciate hearing everyone's thoughts on these two questions!\n\nmany thanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Your art directors are asses!\n\nSince the proper and classic unit of measurement for type is points, so should the measurement for paragraphs be. Otherwise, as you said, there is no relationship. It's very hard to tell what a corps 9 points does with leading 6 mm, but everyone (except your art directors possibly) understands 12 points with leading 14 points. Using points in stead of millimeters gives you way much more control and finesse of what you're doing.\n\nThere are some classic formats to paragraph layout, for instance 8 leading 10, 9 leading 11, 10 leading 12, 14 leading 18 et cetera. That's typographic discipline! Possibly this answers your second question too. Because in most cases the leading will be expressed as a whole number, but in points, not in millimeters.\n\nThe baseline grid is one of the most important things in layout software, especially when designing magazines or books.\n\nIt all comes down to practise of course, so when you're used to using millimeters, no harm done. But for me, as a classicly trained graphic designer, millimeters is not the way to go.\n\n"

I can't even imagine why anyone  \nwould use millimeters (and I grew up in Canada).\n\nI'm a firm believer in working on the baseline grid.  \nThat said, I also think you can break rules if you know the rules. There are some times when it's not essential to the solution.\n\nAs for y-coordinate relationships...  \nPrecision is key and rarely does something need to sit at Y: 3.2713\" instead of 3.3\". If multiple people are working in documents it's important to work on A GRID (even if it's not the baseline grid). Tidy design is good practice to adopt (the production team will love you if you make their job easier).\n\nMy pet peeve is type set at weird random sizes (9.674583 pt???).  \nIt's just sloppy.\n\n"

Blame the software and paper sizes.\n\n<cite>My question is, is using millimeters for paragraph spacing bad practice when line spacing is being specified in another unit (points) as therefore the values for line spacing and paragraph spacing have no relationship?</cite>\n\nIn InDesign the typographic units don't match. It wants you to define leading and type size in points but all of the layout decisions are in mm or inches (margins, tabs, indents, even baseline grid and paragraph spacing). The best thing you can do is find a baseline grid that works in both points and mm or inches.\n\n<cite>My second question arises from an art director having asked me to make the y-co ordinate of each object on a page in InDesign a whole number as they believed that this reflected typographic discipline, as opposed to placing objects with a y-coordinate that involved a decimal point, e.g. 5.65.

      "content": "My opinion is somewhat different.\n\nAs type uses points, makes more sense to use leading also in points. This makes easier to identify the relationship between one and other measure. The same is less evident in space after/before paragraphs as these measures are completely independent from type sizes.\n\nOf course, to use points in all measures is more natural to most people as we set type size with this unit since the very first time we got in touch with type. But in countries where the metric decimal system is adopted, people learn to _think_ in meters, centimeters and millimeters since childhood. In this scenario, to use millimeters in measures except type itself is not so strange.\n\nI don't think this a clear matter of right-or-wrong, but much more a question about the measurement system which people are used to. If a designer feels comfortable to use 4,8mm as leading and has the exact notion about which space this represents, there is no problem to prefer mm instead of pt. Difficulties may arise only due to the workflow of this publication. So the real good practice I see here is not to adopt a schema which just you understands or manages.\n\nAlthough I use type/leading in pt, I prefer to use space before/after in mm. In my brain the notion of space in mm is more exact as I always used them. I do this for many years and never found any problem. Rules? Well, one must respect the rules as they are here for some reason. But one must not blindly follow a rule just because it exists.\n\nTalking about rules, take for example Bringhurst's deep study about page margins and proportions in _Elements of Typographical Style_. It's a very good set of criteria to define page sizes and margins. But must I adopt them just because there is a geometrical definition behind? These large external and bottom margins Bringhurst himself uses are geometrical results. Anyway, as a reader I look to the book and find these margins excessive. There is very much blank space at bottom of page and this uneven fulfilling is not comfortable for me –and for many other readers, as I verified while teaching design. So, I don't follow these highly geometric rules, even if they are presented by a master as Bringhurst.\n\nAs someone already said, you must known the rules, you cannot ignore them –but you may not follow a rule it if there is a good reason to do so.\n\nAbout the position for graphics, it seems that art director read half of the instructions and mixed something. To put graphic elements at integer positions is correct when you're using a grid with integer increments. Outside this, IMHO just the position of other elements (titles, boxes) need to be observed.\n\n"

Their reasoning was that tiny fractions made the job more complex when communicating or matching sizes & coordinates.\n\nAt the time it seemed silly to me, but I've gradually adopted that practice myself. For example, if I draw a border guideline and notice its 2.99 picas from the page edge, I'll make 3 picas.\n\nIt just seems a bit more clean and precise, plus it makes life easier if later you're trying to confirm that sizes are consistent from page to page. \"I need to remember that column one should always be 20.03 picas wide, and column 2 should always be 11.97 picas wide\". Easier to make it \"column one is always 20 picas and column 2 is always 12 picas wide\".\n\nBut obviously design considerations should come first.\n\nJames\n\n"
