And in fact it used to be much more candid before the spinally-challenged watered it down.\n\nNick, why is it so hard to admit there's a problem? Puppy love? Your hypersensitive idolatry of Licko is quite strange, especially at your age, especially a decade after it's no longer fashionable. And I know how important fashion is to you. But most of all I think it's misplaced because your work is better!\n\nThe war is over if you want it? I guess you don't want it. To me, the war is natural, it just has to be balanced. And most of all, when you see something good/bad enough to point out, you do so. Mrs Eaves is a prominent font, so it naturally gets extra attention; the more it's used by indiscriminating designers, the more people like me will point out the beautiful blonde's speech impediment.\n\nCommercially successful? Maybe I should become a prostitute.  \nBut then I can't have people like Nick thinking I'm untouchable.\n\nhhp\n\n"
