It is very easy to parameterize chirography (note how their difference between strong/weak contrast is just about strokes with slants like | or \\ ). Very few people have a clue how to properly parameterize “two-sided” strips of paint…\n\nOne exception I know is [http://www.typophile.com/node/73827](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124083130/http:/www.typophile.com/node/73827 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/73827\").\n\n"

If _one_ person can do that, fewer people should do it the other way.\n\nOne key idea BTW is to see letterforms as _not_ things with painted bodies, but things with drawn borders, as instances of notan.

And: as far as 31095 went, my impression was that nobody got any idea what your point was… Me neither.\n\n"

Anyway progress is pretty much never about following the herd.\n\nAbout chiroliminography (that thread): I think most people got my drift (even if few of them saw much practical use in it). John Hudson for example tried to help me explain to Michael \"Two Coats\" Clark that there's a fundamental difference between the work of Salden and Okano. In fact here's some evidence -please read my comment there- that people got my drift even before I said it: [http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/quintet/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124083130/http:/typographica.org/typeface-reviews/quintet/ \"http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/quintet/\")\n\nhhp\n\n"

You giving (explicit or explicit) positive remarks about **two** chirography fonts — in one thread!\n\nQuintet is very impressive — and I’m very interested in its provenance w.r.t. [http://typophile.com/node/31095](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124083130/http:/typophile.com/node/31095 \"http://typophile.com/node/31095\") — but it is clearly pure chirography. A glyph consists of two parts: a flourish, which is a single chirographic line; and the skeleton, which (according to my very cursory inspection) is an algorithmic expansion of the character's spine (so it is also chirographic). (I find it very helpful to imagine that what you see in the skeleton is two edges of a 3D band going about the spine and twisting as needed. Of course, after you can see it as this, it is very easy to describe the transformation as a 2D operation too. This 3Dness is somewhat similar to one of [Calypso](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124083130/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Calypso%20PF%20free%20download).)\n\n\\> _Hmmm, so what proportion is lower: the number of people who make parametric fonts liminographically versus chirographically, or the number of people who make fonts versus who don't?_\n\nI do not know. Anyway, I find it completely irrelevant.\n\n\\> _You want easy? Don't make fonts. :-)_\n\nI do not want it easy — unless it **can** be done algorithmically. What I want is results, and results yesterday.\n\nWhile it is obvious that designing one edge of a stroke separately from the other edge of a stroke allows one more freedom, it is also obvious that this more or less prohibits parametrization. And where I live, optical scaling is a must; other types of parametrization are also of great use. So unless you design your font for the audience used to the character repertoire of a non-IBM typewriter, you will not have resources to manually design separate flavors.\n\nAlso, I cannot omit that in certain endeavours, more freedom gives worse results than less freedom. Remember: when people have an especially complicated message to transmit, sometimes they choose verses and not prose. (Same happens in math: for many topics, a free-style discourse turns out to be less comprehensible than a strictly formal one — I wrote something on this tune [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124083130/http:/ilyaz.org/interview). But, frankly speaking, I know no typographic examples of this.)\n\n"
