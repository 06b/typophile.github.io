      "content": "Hey June,   \n   \nI think the best you can do is read some books on the subject.   \nThere are some wonderful specimens out there.   \n   \n_Elements of Typographic Style_ by **Robert Bringhurst** is the first that comes to my mind.   \n   \nAmazon link:   \n [http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0881791326/qid=1076442246//ref=sr\\_8\\_xs\\_ap\\_i1\\_xgl14/104-0860516-9368748?v=glance&s=books&n=507846](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110135805/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0881791326/qid=1076442246/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-0860516-9368748?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)   \nI think it's a very nice introduction to the wonderful and weird world of typography.   \n   \nAlso, a large number of outstanding typographic books can be find on this site too; see:   \n [http://www.typophile.com/books/archives/1%20Essentials.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110135805/http:/www.typophile.com/books/archives/1%20Essentials.html)   \n   \nOh, and don't start too early with those pesky computers... There are some nice \"manual\" ways to start a typography student's career...\n\n"
