I intend for this to be a fairly serious type. Comments are more than welcome.   \n   \nThanks, kris.   \n   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417094326im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24833.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "The disconnect on the b is interesting, but isn't duplicated in any other characters. You're a lot better at getting your binocular g right than I am, but it does seem to lean forward a little bit. Your f has a non-standard lower serif; is this intentional? Also, the f doesn't thin like others through the top curve. The taper at the top of the t seems odd, but maybe I'm feeling the effects of the hour.   \n   \nGiven a more perfected form, I'd use this for published materials.\n\n"
