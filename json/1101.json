  "content": "For those of you in the San Francisco Bay Area (USA) I wanted to announce I will again be teaching a class, in September, titled \"Digital Type and Typography for Letterpress\". I discuss font formats and production, typographic controls in Quark and InDesign, and look at fonts better suited for letterpress (and compare text printed from hot metal type with their digital versions printed from photopolymer plates). The San Francisco Center for the Book web site has the details- [http://www.sfcb.org/php/classes.php3?id=t3-091003-prt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113315/http:/www.sfcb.org/php/classes.php3?id=t3-091003-prt)   \n   \nI can also send an information sheet in pdf form.   \n   \nThis is an intermediate level class, and while students really should have both page layout software and letterpress experience, I'm particularly interested in reaching graphic designers to help them better design for letterpress. I'd appreciate your passing this note on to anyone you know who might be interested.   \n   \nThanks a lot.   \nBrian\n\n",
