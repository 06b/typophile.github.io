  "content": "Hi,\n\nI need to create a document that has both English and Japanese translation. When I select text in Illustrator and choose one of OSX’s, e.g., Hiragino Kaku, Hiragino Maru (which, incidentally, show up as Kanji in Ill’s Character Pallette, I just get English letterforms.\n\nI tried installing the Japanese “Language Translations” from the system CD to no avail. I think all tha does is allow you to run OSX in that language.\n\nThis is driving me plum crazy. Any else solved this? The fonts show up in FontBook, Textedit, etc., but don’t apply when chosen.\n\nRegards,\n\n-tim\n\n [‹ Printing Font Spec Sheets](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217130922/http:/typophile.com/node/21462 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Euro sign problems in Quark ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217130922/http:/typophile.com/node/21509 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
