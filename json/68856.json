      "content": "Welcome to Typophile. Sansarah is not a bad choice, but I looked through almost 3000 hand lettered informal fonts and couldn't find an exact match. (I looked at Dafont and Abstract Fonts to cover the freebies that are easier to search; I checked the ClickArts set that is widely used, and I scanned over 800 'informal handwriting' fonts on MyFonts.)\n\nThe most similar styles (all at MyFonts) I saw were from FontGarden: FG Abby and FG Erin, and Murbia from PizzaDude.\n\nThe problem with this sort of font, as our FAQ states, is that this kind of font can be made by literally anyone, and very cheaply, so there are many thousands of them. Finding an exact match takes as much luck as skill.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
