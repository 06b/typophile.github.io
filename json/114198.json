The A could be made with inverted V, but the numerals are not exactly the same. Old Image Club font [Pacifica Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317131827/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/pacifica-condensed/?refby=bowfin) has the A, but is more squared.\n\nCould be custom design for the phone app.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
