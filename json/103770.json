  "content": "Anyone know what the Chinese equivalent of Times New Roman or Arial would be?\n\nNormally when I design, I copy and paste content from my client's ms word doc that they typed on their PC into my design projects on my mac. Or, I flow it in. This works perfect.\n\nNow, I need to copy content that is traditional Chinese typed on PCs and paste it into my projects (inDesign or ms word) on my mac. I do not speak or read Chinese.\n\nI have lots of adobe and other fonts, but I believe I need the Chinese equivalent of Times New Roman or Arial that would be come standard on PCs sold to Chinese people.\n\n",

      "content": "The OS comes with fonts; the problem is to choose. For the fonts on the Mac, here is a list on Yales' site [http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/osx7.html#fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082902/http:/www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/osx7.html#fonts \"http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/osx7.html#fonts\")\n\nThe extesions TC means traditional Chinese and so I guess that Heiti TC would be suitable (I am no expert). I also understand from the list of characters sets [http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/character\\_sets.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141123082902/http:/www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/character_sets.html \"http://www.yale.edu/chinesemac/pages/character\\_sets.html\") that Big-5 corresponds to Traditional Chineses and thus LiHei 儷黑 Pro and LiSong 儷宋 Pro as well as Apple LiGothic, Apple LiSung, and BiauKai should fit the bill but I would double check.\n\n"
