If so, then using the system default fonts is almost always a good idea unless there is a compelling reason otherwise.\n\nWhat Unicode coverage do you need? How many languages will the software be translated into?\n\nThe [DejaVu](http://web.archive.org/web/20100326143340/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DejaVu_fonts) fonts are pretty good for screen / UI. The Unicode coverage is excellent, it's legible (nice open apertures, large x-height, good balance between economy of space and not being too narrow, spacing is decent). It's not an artsy design at all, but it doesn't look frumpy or old-fashioned. It's also free.\n\nYou might also look at [Droid Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20100326143340/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_%28font%29). It's very recent, a little square (which is very trendy right now), and even higher x-height and narrower than Deja Vu. Also free.\n\nIf you've got budget and want to do something really creative, there's tons you can do. The [Prelude fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20100326143340/http:/gizmodo.com/5288932/palm-pres-fantastic-fonts-custom-designed-by-font-bureau-type-foundry) by Font Bureau for the Palm Pre are an awesome example.\n\n"

I especially like the Prelude fonts and it's very relevant to look at newer mobile phone fonts (I have also looked at Androids font, which also looks good) for some of the software. And yes, there is a budget :-)\n\nUnfortunately I can't go into much details here, because of confidentiality. The fonts will be used in the interface, for buttons, menus, body text and numbers. The Unicode coverage is important, good point!\n\nSii, you don't need to get all Jacob Nielsen on me ;-) Let me rephrase, The font (family) should look modern and fresh, and at the same time be user friendly.\n\n"
