  "content": "In the course of the XIX th century, there were two countries that launched the new production of sans serif typefaces: England and Germany. The most famous German foundry was Liepzig-based **Schelter und Giesecke** which gave grotesk typefaces from 1825. Other German foundries like **Berthod** and **Stempel** will produce grotesks but at the end of the century.\n\nThe only references of **S&G** grotesks belonged to the last quarter of the XIX th century: _Schelter Grotesk, Schlanke Grotesk, Breite Grotesk_.  \nDesigner Nick Curtis attempted to reproduce the style of these typefaces.\n\n1. Is there any leads to pinpoint the very first German grotesks from 1825?  \n2. Is there any book dedicated to the **Schelter und Giesecke** foundry?\n\n",

In current type terminology it would be called thin condensed or light condensed.  \nWithin the context of German type terminology around 1900, Breit is the formal opposite of Schlank, it can be translated as wide or broad. Today one would call such a face bold extended. Some of the typefaces that used to be called Breit, are wider than the extended typefaces of today. Many foundries did not use the word ‘normal’. Instead, type could be called either mager (regular) or fett (bold), or either schlank (thin condensed) or breit (bold or bold extended). And then of course there is breit mager, which would now be light or regular extended.  \nOr what do you mean by idiosyncrasy?\n\n"
