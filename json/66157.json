Do you want to learn \"Stam\", \"Yerusalmi\" etc  \nThere are so many styles...\n\nMike\n\n"

So you can ask these people.\n\nAnother way: google \"scribe sofer new york city\" that will get you the Torah scribes.\n\n"

I've actually found and ordered a used copy (even though it's online, it's awfully nice to have physical books). As to style—the traditionalist in me is tempted by Stam, but my main goal is to have a good foundation in lettering and alphabet \"anatomy\" to aid in designing contemporary Hebrew type, so something closer to modern Hebrew scripts might be better.\n\nDespite growing up in Israel, I didn't get into typography until grad school in New York. My understanding of the Hebrew alphabet is scarcely better than a layman's, having read some essays (Raphael Frank's and others) and done some analysis of my own on readability and letterforms. Learning lettering in school was a great preparation for working with Latin type, and I'm sure it will be as effective for Hebrew. And as much as books are nice, I learn best from direct experience with another person.\n\nThank you all for the advice, in any case! I probably need to do some more research into the styles of Hebrew calligraphy before I seek out a teacher.\n\n"
