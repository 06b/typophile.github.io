  "content": "Hi everyone,  \nI need some suggestions for a font to compliment Bank Gothic: [Bank Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150106212351/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/)  \nThe client has a logo in dark blue and orange set in Bank Gothic Medium with a Nikeish swash around it. They specialize in energy consulting. Now they want a different font to embed in documents to make their profile more distinct. When this is not possible they will use Arial.\n\nThe new face has to work in both text and headlines. Bank Gothic is a square geometric font, and I'm looking for a flavor of this in the text font as well (without losing legibility). They need at least regular, medium and bold in italic as well. Small caps would be good as well, but it's not a requirement. Opentype would work best, otherwise PC postscript.\n\nThanks,  \nOystein\n\n",

I think to use a different squarish font - and Eurostile is another of course - might fight with the Bank Gothic and be difficult to read for running text.\n\nYou could then use Bank Gothic or Agency for the headlines.\n\n"
