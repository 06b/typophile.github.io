  "content": "Looks like a font, but the odds are it is of Japanese origin. The only place I know to see these fonts are in the [Font Pavillion collections](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518053342/http:/www.p22.com/pavilion/index.html) at P22/IHOF. P22 says they have limited stocks of these and cannot get more from the Japanese vendors. Most have a Latin version as well as Japanese characters.   \n   \nIf someone else knows good links in English for Japanese fonts (with Latin characters), that could be a useful resource.\n\n",
