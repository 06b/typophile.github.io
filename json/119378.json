  "content": "Hi\n\nLooking for assistance in customizing the template into a wedding agency website - [http://icetemplates.com/shop/freddie-and-kristy-responsive-one-page-theme/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417110457/http:/icetemplates.com/shop/freddie-and-kristy-responsive-one-page-theme/ \"http://icetemplates.com/shop/freddie-and-kristy-responsive-one-page-theme/\")\n\nBesides chaning over the content such as texts and imagery with the custom one, and getting rid of irrelevant design elements, we also need to have a contact form created, because there's none in the template and a few new pages added to showcase each type of service the agency provides, that is at least 4 new pages.\n\nThanks for your offers\n\n",
