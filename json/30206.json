I'm sure that you saw the big announcement several weeks ago.\n\nTo find definitive information regarding Art:21 and RETINA, perform a Google query for those terms. Or simply check the Open web presence. Check the \"we are\" \"network\" section about HTF. I would post a link but I cannot figure out how to do so here.\n\nRETINA is a large family. I refer you to the May/June 2004 \"Communication Arts\" article about HTF for more details.\n\nHow do I change the title of this section of the Forums to indicate that this typeface has been correctly identified?\n\nSincerely,  \nRandolph T. Burke\n\n"

      "content": "Dear Bald Condensed,\n\nNo offense was taken by me and I certainly hope none was taken by you. I did not intend to give the impression that I was trying to stymie your efforts to provide a validated identification to our friend Drmns. I have spoken with Johnathan recently and he mentioned that they are very busy with EXCHANGE. I simply was trying to help you ferret out the truth in a timely manner. If any offense was taken by you, I offer my most sincere apologies. My colloquial expressions often get in the way of my meaning.\n\nIf facts are what you are after, I have a handful of leads for you:  \n- The two sources I previously mentioned are relevant to this discussion.  \n- Check with Scott Stowell at Open. He commissioned the font. I am sure that he will offer good information since he has been a friend of Johnathan's since before Jonathan shared that tiny office with Barry Deck. My goodness! What a scene that was!  \n- If my memory is correct, this particular version of RETINA was shown as an example of Tobias' work in the TDC Annual in 2001. I believe that the caption mentioned Art:21. I could be mistaken on that last point. I do not have this annual anymore, but you should look into it.  \n- Do check with H&FJ. They are busy but they are also very generous. They will eventually reply to your inquiry. Please tell them I said hello.\n\nDo you go through such extensive lengths to validate all type identifications in this forum? Impressive! Thank you for all your hard work!\n\nDo you know what Stephen finds funny about my earlier comment? I think he is making a joke at my expense.\n\nSincerely,  \nRandolph T. Burke\n\n"

I'll tell him you said hello next time I talk to him. ;^)\n\n\\> _Do you go through such extensive lengths to validate all type identifications in this forum? Impressive! Thank you for all your hard work!_\n\nWhy, thank you, you're far too kind, I aim to serve. It's a pleasure to be able to give something back to the community. The crowd here is very friendly and helpful -- I don't know if I'd do the same voluntary work for any other board. And hey, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. ;^)\n\n\\> _Do you know what Stephen finds funny about my earlier comment? I think he is making a joke at my expense._\n\nI can assure you that Stephen is far too gracious a person to do such a thing. As my predecessor as head moderator of this board, he thought me everything about having a patient, kind and generally more mature online persona (though I sometimes still have a slip of the tongue I must confess).\n\n"
