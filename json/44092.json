I've been investigating upright and sanserif scripts for a while, but these guys have already done it. i've tried to convince Mark Simonson to do a fully connecting version of [Coquette](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103235706/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html), but don't think i sold him. Oh well, will still give it a go someday to make a full-fledged font similar to what the If You Could guys have already done.\n\n",

(Not that Mark couldn't pull it off, I just think it would cease to be Coquette.)\n\nI think the first challenge is simply doing an upright italic. I think of Veronika Burian's [Bree](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103235706/http:/www.type-together.com/ampl_font.php?idpuente=13) (although not technically an italic it feels like a sans-script) and Sibylle Hagman's [Odile](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103235706/http:/www.vllg.com/Kontour/Odile/mudTyper+Weights/) has an upright italic.\n\n"

I also have some other plans to enlarge the Coquette family, but I don't know how soon I will be able to show anything. Hopefully yet this year.\n\n"

      "content": "I think the example Paul linked to from \"If You Could\" is an entirely different thing than any of the other examples mentioned above. It is much more a grotesk being itself yet connected and has no caligraphic feel. Instead it has quite a lovely spacial relationship in figure ground--therefore it seems a whole new breed. I rather like it and hope Paul or whomsoever would pursue it.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "chris is right, i'd like to do something quite literally like what If You Cold has done with the word 'make.' of course i would want to do stylistic sets that added in more cursive elements in the lower case and upper. i haven't got past the [investigation stage](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103235706/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/sets/72157604469560514/), and the closest things i have to sketches would be my experiments with [Not Gill Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103235706/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/2102146814/). I would like to try do something similar to [Tempo's Swash Caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20131103235706/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/pauldhunt/2346630291/in/set-72157604469560514/) just to round it out. Still, this is all just floating around in the ether for a few more years, most likely...\n\n"
