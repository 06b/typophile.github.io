I dont see any good solution to it anyway. The other thing is that I feel maybe the font is too ordinary, I dont know. But I think it will gain more character in the bolder versions.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello T,   \n   \nI really like the concept of this typeface.   \nI'm not sure about the proportions... your ascenders and descenders seem to short at a quick look. You should print some samples on small sizes to check it out.   \n   \nSome details:   \n   \n1 The hairlines of 'a' and 'e' are too thin. This will cause the character to break at text sizes. You should make it the same constrast as in 'n'.   \n   \n2 The 'a' needs work to me. It's curves don't seem to match with the rest of the font.   \n   \n3 The 'r' can be narrow.   \n   \n4 The upright diagonal of 'x' can be thinner.   \n   \nIf you work more on the constrast of individual charcaters, having 'o' and 'n' as references, your typeface will be more even.   \n   \nKeep up the good work!   \n   \nFabio H\n\n"

But I like it how you did in e and a!   \nI would try do do this in the other faces...   \n   \nThe bowls of o, e, d b and the other differs a lot i guess. The width of d, b, p ... seams for me to wide.   \n   \nThe middle stoke of the a is to high   \n   \nThe curved middle of the z is great!   \n   \ns seams to be to wide, also the stroke-width is bolder than others   \n   \nWhere is the uppercase? ;-)   \n   \nGreets Jens\n\n"
