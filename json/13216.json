  "content": "Hello,\n\nTo those who know quite a lot about Japanese fonts, I'm asking this question : according to you, what is the Japanese font that would look good when placed close to some Times New Roman?\n\nThe ones I've chosen are :  \n- DFGyoSho-Lt-WIN-RKSJ-H  \n- DFHS-Mincho-W7-WIN-RKSJ-H\n\nWhat do you think about this choice?  \nDo you have a better idea?\n\nThanks ! :)\n\n",
