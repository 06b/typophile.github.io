We’ll kick things off with acclaimed rock poster design documentary, “Died Young, Stayed Pretty,” by filmmaker, Eileen Yaghoobian. Next up will be “You SHOULD Judge A Book By Its Cover” - an insightful and amusing presentation on 40+ of the weirdest book cover designs - by NYC designer/comedian, Patrick Borelli. And, last but certainly not least, we will conclude with the national premiere of Punchcut’s newest installment of the Typophile Film Fest, a collection of typographic film shorts.\n\n",
