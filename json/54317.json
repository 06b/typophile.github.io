Rob got his start in the 1980s working as a lettering artist  \nat Hallmark Cards. Eventually Rob decided to pursue a freelance career and  \nposted samples of his work online, which led to many requests to purchase  \nhis lettering designs. In 2000, Rob and P22's International House of Fonts  \ncame to an agreement giving IHOF the right to distribute five of his  \ndesigns, Corinthia, Imperial Script, Ohley, Petemoss and Ruthie. Now P22 is  \nvery pleased to announce that it is distributing all 75 Rob Leuschke  \ndesigns. You'll find a script font for every occasion in the TypeSETit  \nCollection, whether you need an expressive brush script or elegant formal  \ncalligraphy.\n\n[http://p22.com/typesetit](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204121532/http:/p22.com/typesetit \"http://p22.com/typesetit\")\n\n",
