Another G like this with perhaps a better n is [ITC Galliard](http://web.archive.org/web/20080708214225/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-galliard/), although this G is not as close. Neither font has a flat top serif on the i, but perhaps we should consider that some customization took place.\n\nI think there are a few G’s with the chin spur, beyond the two i have picked so far, but I am not thinking of them yet.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
