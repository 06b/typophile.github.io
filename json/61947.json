      "content": "Christopher, if a thread goes in a direction that you think gets away from the original topic, while leaving some things on that topic unsaid, I think you need to re-strike the original topic, not just provide a new thread. In other words, it would help if you were to identify those aspects of the previous discussion to which you would like to return.\n\n"

      "content": "Actually, it was kind of a blunder on my part. As my last post said, \"I've been away for a while.\" After I posted this, I noticed a \"next page\" button on the original thread (as is the technical convention here so you know the start regardless of what page you're on). I saw the original post at the top of the thread, and mine immediately below. I guess what happened was upon my original post, there was only one page. After I posted, it created a 2nd page.I thought the post at the top of the page was Duggan re-posting his original statement in an effort to \"bring things back on topic.\" Sorry for the confusion, But It _has_ been a question on my mind regardless. I like Hudson's idea: If you think a thread is going off topic and want to create a \"redirect,\" state in the new thread the main points from the previous thread/issues to be addressed in the redirected thread so that participants need not go through the entirety of the old thread.\n\n(did I get that right?)\n\nI think moderators should make this call though. Potentially a complex issue. Had I not had technical confusion, I probably wouldn't have started this discussion I don't have a problem with wandering conversation. Please don't misinterpret my tone as angry &c. I am going to re-title this thread accordingly. Sorry for the confusion.\n\n"
