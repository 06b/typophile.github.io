  "content": "So, I’m trying to draw letterforms in Illustrator. I’m working on a display/sans-serif face. I’m wondering if anyone has any tips on the matter. I’m pretty well introduced to vector drawing in general, but I’m wondering about better ways for being sure your letterforms are consistent, or perhaps what others do with baselines, etc.\n\nI’ve attached some experiments, I’ll get more ofwhat I’m working on later.\n\nBrian\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [letterforms.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20091004032039/http:/typophile.com/files/letterforms.pdf) | 294.86 KB |\n\n",
