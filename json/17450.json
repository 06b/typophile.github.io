Seems like Johnston was a much better calligrapher than typeface designer.\n\nIt also seems that Eric Gill, who worked quite a bit with Johnston on the London Underground typeface, either had learned a lot by the time he did Gill Sans, or was well served by his collaboration with Monotype, as it is much better executed in this regard. Of course, one also sees the same errors in Paul Renner's original drawings for Futura, but the good folks at Bauer fixed it up nicely....\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
