And since there are never hard and fast rules about kerning, i thought a discussion will put my mind at ease!\n\nI just came out of the new Bond movie. And it is not my intention to sound like a smart ass, but i would like to bring two examples to the table for discussion.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140123071412im_/http:/typophile.com/files/london_final_web_6125.jpg)\n\nFirst, Did they kern the O so close to the D on purpose? Leaving a a large gap between the O and the N?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140123071412im_/http:/typophile.com/files/siena_final_web_5895.jpg)\n\nSecond, In my opinion space between the E and N is too wide compared to N and A. And \"ITALY\" seems to be really loose compared to \"SIENA\".\n\nI just wanted to know what other people think, so I know if its the type, or if its just me...\n\np.s. Apart from squinting... do any of the more experienced typographers in this forum have techniques they use? In particular, I find myself 'lost in the type' after kerning it for a while, and i am unable identify the problematic spacing as easily.\n\nThanks!\n\nEric.\n\n",

But, I'm not surprised by this, I've seen poor kerning on book covers, logos, etc. I guess it's something that younger designers aren't trained to pay attention to. Maybe there's an assumption that the computer will do it correctly.\n\nAs far as working on kerning, it's easy to get lost after a while, since you can adjust between two letters, which affects another pair, and so on. I think the best thing is to work on it for a bit, then step away. In my earlier days I remember working with an art director who had me kern a headline for an entire afternoon.\n\n"

In InDesign you can globally increase or decrease space between letters--tracking. And you can adjust spacing between specific letters--kerning. As I understand it, in Quark Express, you can also globally adjust pairs, such as AV.\n\nIn adjusting the spacing of a title people usually say 'kerning' but whichever way you slice it it's a species of spacing.\n\n"

Good kerning is that kerning which makes spacing visually consistent (as Bruce also said, basically). Wat is \"visually consistent\"? Ahh, well now, there you get into the realm of some subjectivity.\n\nIf a typeface is spaced well, and depending upon the combination of letters under examination, a title setting might not need any \"kerning\" at all. If the spacing of the face is overall consistent and even, but too loose or too tight for the particular application, then that setting might need overall \"tracking\" or \"letterspacing,\" positive or negative (i.e., adding or subtracting, overall) but no individual futzing (i.e., \"kerning\").\n\n-- K.\n\n"

HERE IS A REVISED (A SLIGHTLY EXPLADED VERSION):\n\nKerning/letter-spacing is something that conscientious typographers & designers, as well as type designers & typesetting system programmers will always struggle over, because there are various approaches that can be taken.\n\nWhen a typographer/designer is working with a line or two of display copy and is using typefaces that have relatively heavy thin-strokes, it generally works well to try to visually balance the space on each side of the characters and to try to have the inter-character space throughout the text to appear more-or-less even.\n\nOn the other hand, when fonts have very light thin-strokes (as in the Sienna Italy sample above), it becomes necessary to also take into account the visual space WITHIN the characters, as well as the space on either side of them.\n\nWhat to do with the vast array of fonts that fall in the middle, is where the art of kerning, and the individual taste of the typographers/designer comes in.\n\nSomewhat congruently, when a type designer is setting up the overall kerning for a font, or a typesetting system programmer is devising the kerning algorithm that will output large blocks of text, he or she can choose either to focus primarily on the negative space around the characters or to draw an imaginary line down the center of each character and try to visually balance the space on each side of the character (sometimes called “optical letter-spacing”). Both approaches produce text that appears fairly evenly spaced, even though the resulting spacing is somewhat different — and those who prefer one approach will generally not care for the results of the other.\n\nThe end result of all this is that even when you try to carefully kern your type, you can be never be certain of satisfying everyone — but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t make every effort to do so.\n\n"

Then the program runs and presents the designer with a proposed set of kerning, at which point the designer can look at individual pairs and say 'No, this kind of combination should be more like this...'; then that adjustment becomes additional knowledge in the next pass of the program. In other words, the program doesn't seek to replace the informed eye of the designer, but to capture what the designer thinks is appropriate to the design and apply it across the glyph set.

Type design and typography are arts as well as crafts, but they do lie on a different point in this continuum than musical performance.\n\n"

      "content": "> The tricky aspect of automating kerning is determining how much knowledge is enough, given that the amount of knowledge required is likely to vary from design to design. A few years ago, at dinner with some of the clever folk from URW, I outlined how I thought an automatic kerning tool should work: it would accept iterative 'knowledge' from the designer, starting from a set of spacing for key glyphs that are determined by the designer not to need kerning. Then the program runs and presents the designer with a proposed set of kerning, at which point the designer can look at individual pairs and say 'No, this kind of combination should be more like this...'; then that adjustment becomes additional knowledge in the next pass of the program. In other words, the program doesn't seek to replace the informed eye of the designer, but to capture what the designer thinks is appropriate to the design and apply it across the glyph set.\n> \n> To my knowledge, no one has built this yet.\n\nI have played around with a similar idea ( knowledge → suggestion → refinements ) for a Spacing Macro.  \nIt's not a finished product yet... it's more like a \"proof of concept\" test (It works only on the lowercase glyphs so far)... but the results are quite decent, and far better than the FL autospacing.  \nI think it has potential if someone else what to improve it... as it is 100% customizable.\n\nScreencast on how it is supposed to be used: [https://vimeo.com/45648496](http://web.archive.org/web/20140123071412/https:/vimeo.com/45648496 \"https://vimeo.com/45648496\")  \nDownload Macro and play around: [http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/spacing-macro](http://web.archive.org/web/20140123071412/http:/www.impallari.com/projects/overview/spacing-macro \"http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/spacing-macro\")\n\n"
