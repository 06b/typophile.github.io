  "content": "okay, so i'm trying to put together a portfolio and i've only tried my hand at a couple of logos. The first, Tessa B's, i rather like, but i think it needs a bit more polish. The second, ShoeBox, is really rough. I pretty much swiped the design idea from the Beatles. Is it even worth salvaging? showcasing? anyhow, i thought i'd just see if i got any response here. thnx for any help you can give me.\n\n<!--attachment: Tessa_B_logo-39169.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*4.3*Tessa4Flash*Tessa+B+logo%2eSWF --><!--attachment: Tessa_B_logo-39169.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*4.3*Tessa4Flash*Tessa+B+logo%2eSWF -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131022210958im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">Tessa4Flash<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131022210958/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Tessa_B_logo-39169.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Tessa B logo.SWF</b></a> (4.3 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n\n![Tessa.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022210958im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39170.gif)\n\n<!--attachment: Shoebox_logo-39171.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*2.8*Shoebox4Flash*Shoebox+logo%2eSWF --><!--attachment: Shoebox_logo-39171.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*2.8*Shoebox4Flash*Shoebox+logo%2eSWF -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131022210958im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">Shoebox4Flash<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131022210958/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Shoebox_logo-39171.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Shoebox logo.SWF</b></a> (2.8 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n\n![Shoebox.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022210958im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39172.gif)\n\n",

I'd open up Boxtoo   \nwhich is pretty tight.   \n   \nTracing over the logo always helps me to get rid of inconsistencies.   \n   \nI'd put a \"polished\" shoebox in my 'folio.   \nGood stuff.   \n   \nAndrew\n\n"

I don't know why they need the too in the name at all, but that's their thing.   \nthnx again for yer help. anyone else have suggestions?\n\n"
