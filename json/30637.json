      "content": "I love the mark. Very sexy. However, the only logo that really integrates the type and the mark well is #2. The others seem as though the type is a completely separate element.\n\nIn the logos you've created, I'm reading \"Black\" as one idea and \"Blue Ball\" as a second idea, and I keep wondering why the circle (ball) isn't blue. I believe \"Black & Blue\" should be read as one single phrase (unless \"blue ball\" is some sort of pun re fetishism).\n\nThe ampersand in logo 1 is my favourite. It reflects the whip from the mark well. As for typeface suggestions: I'll have to mull it over a bit more.\n\nGreat job so far.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

But I'm certainly open to it going in that direction if the type works with it.  \nIt definitely should read as Black and Blue Ball, no puns though it certainly does present like that. And the colours are not really final, I haven't found a blue I really like to use as the primary colour that isn't overpowering while still being strong.\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm going for as far as typefaces for this logo. I like the bold strong letters, but I think a strong bold cursive might be good too.\n\n"

As a matter of fact, I believe that you don't have to be very adventurous in the type at all. A bold, clean sans serif set over 2-3 lines on the right should be sufficient. Maybe try using the blue colour for \"BLUE\". Anyway, good luck with the project. I am looking forward to seeing how this will turn out.\n\nSeb\n\n"

Have you tried a black boot on a blue or white background? Possibly viewed from the side (which would make the subject more obvious), something like this perhaps  \n [http://www.thevincerayexperience.com/mugs.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215181455/http:/www.thevincerayexperience.com/mugs.html \"http://www.thevincerayexperience.com/mugs.html\")\n\nThe Kada version achieves some balance, it could be even larger in proportion to the mark.  \nTim\n\n"
