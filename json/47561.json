I would like to hear some Arabic typefaces suggestions. I need 2 typefaces one for titles/display purposes, and one for reading (and this one is the pretty hard to find). Do I hear any suggestions?\n\nA.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi!\n\nB:\n\nThank You, I know most of that, they wouldn't work for a fashion/life style magazine. AXT fonts have poor design and poor development too. Boutros may be the most nice typeface among them I know but I am not sure it has been designed to appeal for a fashion/ life style magazine.\n\nWhat I don't know is:  \nI want to know how to find: Rhotes sans, Yaqout, grapheast.\n\nSii:  \nI think Your suggestion makes a lot of sense to me, only I have 2 problems:the sheen doesn't look elegant. Another problem I find in most arabic font and annoies me is: the black is not enough in small sizes such as 10/12 size.\n\nA.\n\n"
