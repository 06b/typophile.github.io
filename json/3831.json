      "content": "If the concept of people feeding one another is important, perhaps you pull it out of the type altogether and look at other ways to transform \"loftus\" into an ownable logotype, whether through ligatures or another treatment.   \n   \nA final logo system might be flexible, allowing the client to use the logotype or logo by itself, or combinations of both to accommodate horizontal and vertical applications.   \n   \njb\n\n"

      "content": "I did get the idea that they were people (although reading your description probably created a motivating context), but I couldn't see the feeding idea in there. Is it health care for birds? ;-)   \n   \nSeriously: I think you need to make the \"f\" and \"t\" more like people - and as a result a little less like glyphs - just don't sacrifice legibility too much.   \n   \nAnother idea: the name sounds like it's \"elevated\"; if your client wants to amplify that, put some kind of \"elevation\" in there, like making the \"ft\" rise higher; one nice thing about that is that it would convey \"our customers are more important than our company itself\" (never mind that's unlikely to be what they actually think at all).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "I think it would look better if the tail you added was shorter...for the moment I prefer the logo without the tail, that makes the spacing tighter. When the \"l\" does not have the tail, it is close to \"o\", as close is \"s\" to \"u\", which gives a symmetry to the logo and considering the white that \"o\" and \"u\" have, the \"ft\" gets more vivid.   \nI liked the idea of Hrant to elevation \"ft\", but I am afraid if then the logo would be read \"loft us\"...which maybe is not bad now I think over.\n\n"
