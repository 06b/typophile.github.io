  "content": "Hi there,\n\nNurembergs (Bavaria, Germany) radio station [HIT RADIO N1](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116161819/http:/www.hitradion1.de/) communicates with a new designed logo from now on. What do you think?\n\nThis is the new one:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116161819im_/http:/typophile.com/files/N1-Nx_4836.jpg)\n\nThis is the old one:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116161819im_/http:/typophile.com/files/N1-Ox_4144.jpg)\n\nNo. HIT RADIO N1 is not an 80s station. Their playlist consists of todays hits in pop, hip hop & r’n’b. Their listeners age ranges from 12 to 30... yes...\n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nBest, Frederick\n\n [‹ Because of a EULA, I need something similar.](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116161819/http:/typophile.com/node/19378 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [truetype fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071116161819/http:/typophile.com/node/37397 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

My only critique is that the spaces between “RADIO N1” and “N1 92.9” are very close together, while the space in “HIT RADIO” appear looser. Otherwise, well done!\n\n"

The new logo might have a longer lifespan (although radio stations tend to change their visual identity about as frequently as they change station managers.)\n\n"
