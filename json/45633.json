He’s a big guy with a beard who wears glasses and is very into typography and writing. He is one of my favorite teachers so I made this for him, I’m screen printing it this weekend and presenting it to him at graduation, as always feedback is greatly appreciated\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081123102912im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Picture2_4036.png)\n\n",
