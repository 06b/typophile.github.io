  "content": "hi all,\n\ni saw the logo for FX’s new television show “Dirt.” here it is:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119231927im_/http:/typophile.com/files/dirt_3777.jpg)\n\nof course, i’m curious about the “i.” here’s a show synopsis:\n\n“Courteney Cox stars as Lucy Spiller, the hard-driving Editor-in-Chief of tabloid “Dirt” and “Now” magazines. Lucy has a maniacal dedication to finding the truth, for reasons even she has yet to fully fathom. With the help of Don Konkey, a schizophrenic paparazzo blessed with a genius for getting the money shot, Lucy exposes the hidden truth behind celebrity lives - and also determines their fate.” (from fxnetworks.com)\n\nany thoughts on why the “i” is upside down?\n\njarrod\n\n [‹ Design of Gourmet Food Labels](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119231927/http:/typophile.com/node/30461 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Favorite Typefaces & Combinations ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119231927/http:/typophile.com/node/29961 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I was pondering this already, thanks to heavy advertisement featuring ’Digging in the Dirt’ by Peter Gabriel.\n\n[Choz](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119231927/http:/www.chozcunningham.com/)  \n [!Exclamachine Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119231927/http:/www.exclamachine.com/)  \n [The Snark](http://web.archive.org/web/20080119231927/http:/www.exclamachine.com/snark)\n\n"
