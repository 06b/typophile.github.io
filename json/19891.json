I'm a graphic designer and do buy fonts for jobs and would like to patronize Typophiles when appropriate. This is a 'community' after all, and reading another thread ( [http://typophile.com/node/19846](http://web.archive.org/web/20120129114804/http:/typophile.com/node/19846 \"http://typophile.com/node/19846\")) in which Rory expresses frustration trying to communicate with foundries it occurred to me he might find a more supportive group here - and perhaps end up buying a font.\n\nIt also gives some perspective on their contributions to the threads.
