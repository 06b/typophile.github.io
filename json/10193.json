The   \nArt Deco era was a period of rebirth and discovery in the   \nworld of the arts and design. Just in time for spring, we�ve   \nbundled together five Art Deco fonts into one low-priced   \nValue Pack. Coming out to just 6 USD/EUR per font, this   \npackage includes the Arnold Boecklin, ITC Rennie Mackintosh   \nand ITC Manhattan � three fonts based on some of the most   \npopular type styles used during the Art Deco era. Plus,   \nAuriol Black and ITC Benguiat � two additional   \ninterpretations of the spirit of this age � are included.   \n   \nGot an antique poster to finish? This Value Pack�s bargain   \nprice is only available through the end of the month!   \nDownload the Art Deco Value Pack now at:   \n- [http://www.linotype.com/6-2413-6/artdecovaluepack.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222433/http:/www.linotype.com/6-2413-6/artdecovaluepack.html)   \n   \n   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_   \n   \n2.

Certainly   \nthe typeface plays an important role! The unusual antique   \nscript ITC Johann Sparkling offers a great injection of   \npersonality into any piece of text. Created by Austrian   \ndesigner Viktor Solt, this typeface is a perfect imitation   \nof the academic handwriting from the 18th century. \"ITC   \nJohann Sparkling is intended to close the gap between highly   \nformal copperplate scripts and the scribbled look of 'true'   \nhandwriting,\" says Solt. \"I am not very interested in highly   \nformal and perfect calligraphy, but rather in quick,   \npersonal-looking scripts.�   \n   \nMore samples of ITC Johann Sparkling in use, as well as   \npurchase and download information can be found here:   \n- [http://www.linotype.com/7-2414-7/itcjohannsparkling.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222433/http:/www.linotype.com/7-2414-7/itcjohannsparkling.html)   \n   \n   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_   \n   \n3.

Seeking a   \nsans serif with more of a humanist quality than the   \ngeometric styles popular in Europe at the time,   \nW.A. Dwiggins drew what he believed to be the ideal sans   \nserif for headlines and advertising copy. Later expanded to   \ninclude other weights, the Metro family has a warmer   \ncharacter than the European Modernists' typographic   \nachievements. Metro fonts are full of mannered curves and   \nangled terminals; Metroblack also has an astoundingly   \nbeautiful Q!   \n   \nA popular sans serif family for over three-quarters of a   \ncentury, Metro is spec'd less often than similar bestsellers,   \nsuch as Futura or Kabel. Perhaps because of this niche charm,   \nMetro has found many diverse uses: it has appeared throughout   \nEurope and the North America for decades in newspapers and   \nmagazines, and can even help create a great brand image when   \nused in logos and corporate identities.   \n   \nTake a deeper look at the Metro types:   \n- [http://www.linotype.com/13229/metroseries-doc.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050526222433/http:/www.linotype.com/13229/metroseries-doc.html)   \n   \n   \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_   \n   \n4.
