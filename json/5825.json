The font is very monotone, and the 'g' doesn't look like it fits well. The closest 'g' I found to that so far has been [David Quay's Titus](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111092548/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/titus-ef/). Not much else about Titus looks close, though. I still haven't found anything else with that 'r'.\n\n"
