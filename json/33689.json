I use an internal drive as the main system and everything else drive, a second as a scratch disk, and a third as a document backup. The externals are all full drive back ups, including a portable (OWC Mercury) and a large multi-partitioned (for sequential back ups).\n\nSuperDuper (a cloner) is great for backing up everything to the external drives, quickly and reliably, and has saved my butt a couple times now.\n\nThe word of wisdom with a drive is, \"not if, but when\" it will fail.
