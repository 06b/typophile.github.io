What do you like or dislike?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416150819im_/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen_013_4280.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [specimen\\_01.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416150819/http:/typophile.com/files/specimen_01.pdf) | 376.75 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Great work, I like it. Reminds me of the seventies.\n\nYet the T, P and R look a bit unstable - gravitationally challenged, as if they might break a leg one day. IMV the F is a bit too massive, crossing the baseline with not only a line but a triangular shape.\n\nIf you want to try alternatives:  \n- use a triangle instead of two legs for the R (open the bowel to compensate too much weight)  \n- try to give the T some kind of umbrella stand.  \n- give the P a stronger stem (cf. I and H)  \nFor the F I could think of something like: upper half as it is, lower half like the H without the vertical line at the right.\n\nAndreas\n\n"

      "content": "I disagree with the above, as I think much of the face's distinctiveness is that it has no need for a regard for gravity, like it makes its home in outer space. However, the lines of T and L are too thin; they ought to match the thickness of the lines in the other letters.\n\nThe B seriously looks like it may be a K. I'm reading \"fakergraph\".\n\n"

      "content": "+I like the lower case letters in general, although the f, l, g, and s [the eternal problem in this style] don't seem to blend as well as the others. The i,j,k series is very nice, but the two small diamonds in the l don't seem to help. The f and g seem too busy, too many pieces. They don't \"read\" as easily as the other letters. Great work, keep it up. I could be a customer! Please keep me informed.[michael@bsiw.us]\n\nmgk\n\n"
