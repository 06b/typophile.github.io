A typeface that claims to be based on it ( [Quant Antiqua, from Paratype](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124747/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/quant-antiqua/quant-antiqua/charmap.html)) is available, but that may be all you can find these days. It has a few resemblances, but many more differences. For example, the a, i, e and y in your sample are quite different in Quant Antiqua. The M is similar, but that is the only u.c. letter in your sample.\n\n",
