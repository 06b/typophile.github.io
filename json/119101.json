I need to replace the numbers on the badge with another Garratt's number. Any ideas what the font might be - just for the numbers really.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n FF Good Pro Wide Bold \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [fvilanakis](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317133557/http:/typophile.com/user/176276 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
