[Helvetica fighting Arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012142928/http:/www.engagestudio.com/helvetica/)\n\nI think I know which one you’re talking about; I found [this in an article](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012142928/http:/www.mediabistro.com/unbeige/on/ellen_lupton_my_shirts_coming_unbuttoned_26001.asp) about [Ellen Lupton](http://web.archive.org/web/20081012142928/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Ellen%252BLupton):\n\n<cite>a film made by her son Jay Miller, called “Rated R.” It’s “about how to recognize fonts by the letter R.”<br>\nFonts are: Interstate, Helvetica, Arial, and Futura, “four of the world’s most fearsome fonts,” battling to the death.<br>\nNow it’s just a fight between all the letter R’s. We can’t really explain any more than that, but it’s exactly what it sounds like. R on R R-hating.</cite>\n\nAlas, I don’t know if this film is online.  \nF\n\n"
