So I propose to make my title good by adding to six Champions of Typography — Spacing, Leading, Indentation, Ink, Paper, and Imposition — one more — the most important of all, without which (as is alleged of charity) the rest profiteth nothing. That Seventh Champion, dear Reader, is _You._ And it all depends on how seriously you take the following pages, whether my title turns out to be truth or falsehood! I assume for it no further responsibility.”\n\nAnd No, sorry Inka, I won’t key in the whole essay for you. Perhaps you could assign the task to one of your students for extra credit.\n\n"
