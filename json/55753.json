  "content": "I feel really burnt out at my teaching job & have felt that way for approximately the last year. So, I handed in my resignation, which will become effective at the end of this spring semester.\n\nMy #1 destination is NYC. Since last summer, I've wanted to work there, but it never happened. Despite the economy woes, I feel that it's a good time for me to relocate from CT to NYC. I've heard different opinions from different people; some say that it's a horrible time to move, others say that freelance opportunities are readily available.\n\nAny NYC designers here that care to chime in with their feedback? Would be appreciate!\n\n",

The print/identity job market is terrible; there are still a fair number of interactive and fashion design jobs turning up on a daily basis, mostly mid-level positions. But the competition is tough—one AD told me he got over 300 applications for a job, and it wasn’t the most desirable job. And some jobs are evaporating with the money supply before anybody gets hired—it happened to me just yesterday. The only real upside is that rents are in free-fall; even super-hot Brooklyn rents started crashing in the last few weeks.\n\nSpend a few days watching Craigslist (where most NYC job postings go), Krop, and Coroflot. If you really want to come here, make sure you have a big pile of cash to live on. Don’t sign a lease unless they’ll let you out with no penalty if you get laid off and can’t find work (this is already common in Manhattan). It might even be a good idea to submit a resume/portfolio to temp/headhunting firms for feedback before you come.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>From Pre-k to getting my BFA, not once was I required to take any form of Economics course work.</cite>\n\nMost of the Ph.D economists out there didn’t seem to have anything especially smart to say about America’s insane economy in the last decade; neither did all of the MBAs who studied macro- and micro-economics from those economists. People didn’t need education to prevent this, they needed common sense and some grip on reality. Any idiot who applied a little critical thinking could see that the real estate market and the stock market were grossly overvalued and that the entire nation was overleveraged. But people chose to ignore what made sense, to ignore the few economists and pundits who were pointing out that the system was a joke, and followed the herd. Economics education can’t prevent that sort of mass delusion any more than religious instruction can enable the devout to see the absurdities in their faith. It just gives people a better vocabulary to discuss their fantasies.\n\n"

But it leads to booms and terrible busts, fueled by speculation and crooks, without regulation.\n\nI blame the Reaganite philosophy--all taxes and regulation is bad--which infected also Clinton to some extent, for the current financial collapse. Right now, China is attempting to expand credit, agreeing that you need a system of both savings and credit to work well and be stable. I've heard economists saying that part of the problem is that we had too little savings, and China too much.\n\nYou need to realize that in China the savings rate is so high because they haven't been able to trust the banks or government to help them with anything. For example, the government will just quit paying employees for months on end. This kind of thing is also very dysfunctional.\n\nThere are no simple solutions, though there do seem to be solutions, and the Obama administration is working at them.\n\n"

It's not a greed as much as a \"that's what we're supposed to do as Americans.\" And when folks do that in a time of increasingly upward home values, the trend is to 'get in while we can before we can't afford a place' rather than a careful study of long term trends and analysis of the mortgage models that were being sold.\n\nAs a culture, we've grown accustomed to economic short sightedness. That's partly due to how our system works (consumer driven) and partly due to lack of personal education on the matter.\n\n\"Economics education can’t prevent that sort of mass delusion any more than religious instruction can enable the devout to see the absurdities in their faith.\"\n\nI disagree. I think education goes along way. Along with economics 101, I've always been a proponent of theological history taught in the schools as well. :o)\n\nFor instance, there's a giant lack of art and design education in our system. It wasn't until college that I found it and had it instilled in me via education.\n\nAs for the current situation, there's plenty of blame to go around to all parties involved.\n\n"
