On paper it’s quite ’plump’, so I could easily start with a bold or black design in FontLab. It’s my understanding (mainly from other threads) that to easily interpolate a family I should make a bold and a light. This design may well suit that. Is this an appreciable intention?\n\nUntil now I’ve not really been able to visualise things that aren’t a medium/in-the-middle weight. Working from the outside in sounds a bit perverse!\n\nAny thoughts warmly appreciated.\n\n [‹ Merge Font Families Into Single Suitcase](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709015339/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44469 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Font Family Menus? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709015339/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44305 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "If you feel comfortable with it then designing from the outside in is okay. You will probably find out that the interpolated regular needs some corrections.\n\nThe other problem, however, is that during the process of making test printouts and modifying your font(s) you will probably end up making the “same” corrections to the bold and the light, especially when you are testing your regular, so you have double the work. This has happened to me and I have wasted lots of time. That is the only reason why I now tend to develop the regular first.\n\n"

The chances of the medium being really good based on the design that arrives from a interpolated light & bold seem small.\n\nBut to be fair I don’t know this per se. I haven’t done it yet myself. But type process are not direct - they always need tweakage.\n\nI am sure other folks here can say more about it.\n\n"

I guess I mean that I would usually visualise the regular weight, as that’s probably both easier and the most used in a family. Designing the bold (as I’m currently doing) is fine, as I’ve already drawn it it all out on paper anyway, but I need to visualise the regular while I’m going. I just think the regular weight is supremo and therefore the one most likely to require direct design attention.\n\nAny tips on the whole MM process would be most welcome.\n\n"

I’m not tracing them though, but drawing them from my reference drawings in FontLab. I’m deliberately making them consistent and more bold at that stage.\n\nYou’re kind of onto what I mean. It’s a job letting the ’vision’ mould itself to weights other than the drawn original.\n\nInevitably, as I’m digitising my drawings things are changing. The process is very interesting. Here’s my 3, sketched and digitised. The contrast on everything has been reduced now I’m in FontLab.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709015339im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/three_4356.png)\n\n"

Having the ball terminals thinner than the horizontals looks weird - as does the whole weight distribution on the digitized version, to my eye.\n\nEben wrote: <cite>The chances of the medium being really good based on the design that arrives from a interpolated light &amp; bold seem small.</cite>\n\nInterestingly, our experience at Adobe has generally been the opposite. If the masters are really good, the middle interpolations will often be even better. If there’s something wrong in the middle, it’s almost always indicative of something wrong in one or more masters. (The exception being if you’re working with masters that are too extreme, and then you have to do something more complicated to compensate.)\n\nThat being said, the question of how early in the design one switches to an MM basis is a tricky one. If sweeping changes are going to happen, then yes, making those changes in several masters is more work. But working directly on a “regular” weight when one is ultimately going to have a light and a bold is also extra work. Different people have different ideas on this score, even folks who have a lot of experience working on MM based designs. Personally, I favor going to MM early, at least the weight axis, but some of my colleagues work differently.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

Since then, I have begun with a black and a regular. My point is that you can go any way with it. The advantage of trying several scenarios is that you learn something different each way. There is nothing perverse or magical in it, it is just a method to begin. The key is not to feel compelled to keep using your first attempt even if it is a Master. Try it and learn what happens when you interpolate. It will help you with the next face you begin. I don’t think there is a one and best methodology.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

But....\n\nI had an example of a case where I needed the design space to be as big as possible, using intermediate masters was not practical, plus I needed the axis values to relate linearly to measurable attributes of the font. So I allowed the bold condensed master to turn essentially inside out, and defined a “no fly zone” near that master where the instances would be no good. This allowed me to expand the design space a bit.\n\nThis really begs for a more visual explanation. I have some slides on this, but they are intended to go with an interactive demo using the font. Maybe I can get to cleaning this up or recording a video version some time.... No promises, but I’ll add it to my list of future blog topics.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
