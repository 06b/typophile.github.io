  "content": "Hi there  \nI was stopped in my track when I tried to use Ben Kiel's 'Accent Tools' script to build my diacritics characters in a Multiple Master font. I guess his script uses RoboFab to do the copying of the base glyphs and diacritics, and thus only does it for one weight (Wt0) – confusing the heck out of Fontlab. At least that is how it looked to me. So is there another method (script?) that will honour my anchors AND both weights (Wt0 and Wt1)?\n\nThank you,  \nClaus\n\n",
