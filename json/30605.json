Oh and bonus points if you can ID the film the text is referring to.

If you write a pop song, tone-deaf people will sing it in their bathtubs. Or – much worse – at Karaoke. Whatever the circumstances, your work has entered the public domain and you have to see any usage at all as a compliment.\n\nMind you: people who pay for their type usually take a little more care not to harm it.\n\nI bet that 90% of all ITC Officina in use that I see comes from a font that somebody “found“  \non their hard drive. The license fees are certainly not in step with its widespread use.\n\n"
