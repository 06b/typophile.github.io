  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI’m in the middle of a rush job for a friend who needs an identity for his startup…cornerstone 1 media. He’ll be publishing books about the key knowledge that helps influence decision making before the adaption of technology. That’s it in a nutshell.\n\nI’ve already shown him one round of designs and he gravitated toward the logo with the number one. This is the second round. Unfortunately, neither of us has a lot of time to spend on this so I’m trying to nail it down quickly. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions about the attached direction.\n\nThanks so much for your help.\n\nTammy\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [c1m\\_b.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200618/http:/typophile.com/files/c1m_b.jpg) | 361.48 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Tammy, personally I see “Cornerstone Media” and don’t read the “1” as part of the title. I’m not sure what anyone else will think, but I would look at trying to integrate the 1 better. It’s always difficult to achieve legibility with this approach, personally I would look at using the dimensional 1 as a separate icon, and pull out the name as another element to avoid confusion. Best - Chris\n\n"

      "content": "How does this shape relate to the idea of a cornerstone? I know it’s a corner but it just looks like the 1 is a dorr or something. I get a vague feeling from it.\n\nTake a look at this\n\n[http://www.senate.michigan.gov/Virtualtour/Virtual%20Tour%20Pictures/CapitolDome/cornerstone%20copy.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200618/http:/www.senate.michigan.gov/Virtualtour/Virtual%20Tour%20Pictures/CapitolDome/cornerstone%20copy.jpg)\n\nThats a cornerstone. And with type too.\n\nI also saw this but I didn’t like it.\n\n[http://www.cornerstone.edu/](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522200618/http:/www.cornerstone.edu/)\n\nWhat if you had 3 lines & a random stone shape. Get it? Corner, stone?\n\nIt’s a tricky thing on short notice. But then you can’t expect a miracle on short notice. Maybe you can talk him into more time.\n\nWhatever happened to \\*your\\* logo?\n\nCheers!\n\n"
