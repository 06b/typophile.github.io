I frequently see almost identical logos thought up around the same time by different designers for different companies.   \n   \nExample: that \"Rohr\" logo in the Critique forum is almost the same as the logo for the \"Creativity 32\" book that's coming out.   \n   \nPaul\n\n"

Unlike copyright, which accrues to the creator upon the act of creation (under all copyright laws that I know of anyway), trademark protection is usually only offered after registration and a period of review. Also, the guidelines for determining infringement are specific to trademark law.   \n   \nIf \"Satan\" has any concerns, he/she should contact a trademark attorney for a professional opinion.   \n   \n_Svastika_ is a Sanskrit word derived from _svasti_ (\"well-being, fortune, luck, success, prosperity\"). Svastika can refer in general to any auspicious mark or object, but it is most commonly used to indicate the familiar swastika symbol. Some claim that the direction of the arms has significance, but I suspect this is a post-WWII revisionism designed to distance the original symbol from the Nazi appropriation/corruption of it. Steven Heller wrote an entire book about this.\n\n"

This guy was so outraged he virtually accused us of being Nazis! I fear this negative conotation is so engrained in our collective memory that it won't ever go away. Then again, he was the only customer in the entire FS network we ever heard of who was irked by the character.

I have not read his book, but I have read an article on Baseline and what I actually consider wrong is the preconception against blackletter (raised by Heller in another article). This is all part of a project I intend to develop on the redemption of the blackletter (and maybe the swastika) considering that, as Miles Newlyn pointed out talking about his Ferox typeface, perceptions towards graphic symbols always arise in context.   \n   \nWhen I will do it I will ask for the opinion of Typophile members.
