  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nConsidering my update options here, I'm eager to know this: Will I get Adobe Garamond Premier (with the Opticals), Adobe Jenson, and Minion with Creative Suite 3 Standard? How about Creative Suite 2.3 Standard/Premium?\n\nI did see the recent threads about [Arno Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015181543/http:/typophile.com/node/33096) and [Hypatia Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015181543/http:/typophile.com/node/33092) (but I want the Slimbach classics!).\n\nOlli\n\n",

Check this out: [Bundled fonts in Creative Suite 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015181543/http:/www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/type.html).  \nYou may optionally download Garamond Premier Pro (with opticals) for free (as a registration incentive—just as Thomas’ Hypatia now with CS3).\n\n"

See [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015181543/http:/www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc3a49f/2). Thomas, please?\n\n**Add:** Oh well, I'm looking to update from InDy 2 to Design Standard CS 3, and I guess there's no comparable update to Design Standard/Premium CS 2.3 anyway (I don't have Photoshop). Please correct me if I'm wrong!\n\n"

What is the reasoning behind dropping one of the best typefaces in Adobe's catalog from the bundle? Sure, Arno is great, but at the expense of Jenson? I dunno if I like that.\n\nAdditionally, if there are 4 weights of Garamond Premier Pro, why also include the same weights of Adobe Garamond Pro? THAT doesn't make sense to me.\n\n"

While it would be nice to see Arno as just an addition to everything else, it’s better than just expecting people to keep paying for the same fonts over and over.\n\n"
