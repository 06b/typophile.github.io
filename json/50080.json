As a Brit these signs are just so glamourous, they say ’America’- you don’t get vertical signs like that over here. So much work goes into making them, but I suspect they’re fast disappearing, being replaced by soulless laser-cut vinyl. As you can see some of them are a bit battered and rusted. They should be preserved but will probably end up in a skip. I drove past lots of fantastic examples, but couldn’t be stopping every five minutes. I wish I had had much more time to photograph many more, but captured as many as possible. I’ll be back, as The Governator would say. Hope you like them.\n\n[Signage photos](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121162352/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/30758026@N02/sets/72157607664316638/)\n\n [‹ Mac Newbie - Best way to add a lot of fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121162352/http:/www.typophile.com/node/50078 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type 90/Memories? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121162352/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41671 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Be fair here. Vinyl is cut with a knife plotter, not lasers. That, or hydrojet, is for cutting heavier material.\n\nThe problem is not the materials, it’s that sign shop owners (the ones who aren’t designers themselves) don’t want to pay designers more than minimum wage and a half.\n\n"
