Andika, tho well intentioned, is not ready for the production environment.\n\nAnd besides its a sans which might not be the best choice for a book. Century School is my all time favorite for this... it’s old, I know.\n\nThere are fonts just for younger readers... I don’t very much about this genre tho. Hopefully someone else will chime in.\n\nIf you like the mood of Andika, Miramonte from Ascender has a similar feel but it does not have Andika’s special features. Miramonte does have a two-story a which increases cognition.\n\nYou can get it here:\n\n[http://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/miramonte-pro-family.aspx/292](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819233731/http:/www.fontmarketplace.com/font/miramonte-pro-family.aspx/292 \"http://www.fontmarketplace.com/font/miramonte-pro-family.aspx/292\")\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"

D Series for the two storey a and g, then if you want a defined q that's another series. Not fun to work with in a book.\n\nBut like what is saying—if you like—go for it.\n\nMikey :-)\n\nPS... Paul what are infant types? ... are these for young readers?\n\n[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438582&grab\\_id=0&page\\_id=4...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819233731/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438582&grab_id=0&page_id=46149&query=infant&SCOPE=Fonts \"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438582&grab\\_id=0&page\\_id=46149&query=infant&SCOPE=Fonts\")\n\n"
