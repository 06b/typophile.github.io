For example, input a range (say, start=0600,stop=06FF) and a font name: Then the resultant pdf gives you a unicode code chart covering that range (as supported by the named font), with the code point as caption per each cell...\n\nAnything like that available? Perhaps an online utility? Seems like a common enough task that a utility may be floating out there somewhere...\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

      "content": "The AFDKO command `tx` gives you charts and if you use the `-g` option with a list of characters, you can get the chart for those glyphs. However `tx` does not appear to accept a unicode range. On the Mac or on Linux you can however easily generate the list of character names if you have the FontForge python class installed. Here is a script that does that. Let us call it `listcharnames`\n\n    ---- cut line\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n    \n    import fontforge,sys\n    fnt=fontforge.open(sys.argv[1],1)\n    \n    start = int(sys.argv[2],16)\n    end=int(sys.argv[3],16)\n    \n    unilist=[g.unicode for g in fnt.glyphs() \\\n        if ((g.unicode <= end) and (g.unicode >= start))]\n    unilist.sort()\n    print ','.join(fnt[u].glyphname for u in unilist)\n    ---\n\nThen you can also give yourself the command `mkchart`\n\n    --- cut line\n    #!/bin/sh\n    tx -pdf -g `listcharnames $1 $2 $3` $1\n    ---\n\nand to get your chart say for Arno Pro for the hex values between 0x0060 and 0xFFFF, you need only type  \n`\nmkchart ArnoPro-Regular.otf 0060 FFFF > ~/sheet.pdf\n`  \nand you get your sheet (to get it on the desktop on the mac, you rather redirect to `~/Desktop/sheet.pdf`)\n\nHere the sheet I get with  \n`\nmkchart ArnoPro-Regular.otf 0060 00AF > ~/sheet.pdf\n`\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724065751im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ArnoSheet_5282.png)\n\n"

The only one seems to be able to export is the basic preview on the main page. Any advice would be appreciated...\n\nThanks!\n\n"

I am on Macs.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have problems with FontForge, here is some replacement code for `listcharnames` written in Lua for LuaTeX. That avoids having to install the Fontforge python module but I think LuaTeX uses some Fontforge code anyway. If you have tex live installed, this should run.\n\n    --- cut here\n    #!/usr/bin/env luatex --luaonly\n    \n    local f = fontloader.open(arg[1])\n    local startcode=tonumber(arg[2])\n    local endcode = tonumber(arg[3])\n    local listcodes={}\n    local i = 0\n    while (i < f.glyphmax) do\n      local g = f.glyphs[i]\n      if g then\n        if ((g.unicode >= startcode) and (g.unicode <= endcode)) then\n          listcodes[g.unicode] = g.name\n        end\n      end\n      i = i + 1\n    end\n    local keys={}\n    for n in pairs(listcodes) do table.insert(keys,n) end\n    table.sort(keys)\n    local names={}\n    for i,n in ipairs(keys) do table.insert(names,listcodes[n]) end\n    print(table.concat(names,\",\"))\n    fontloader.close(f)\n    ---\n\nHere is a trace of execution on my mac: the hex interval needs to by written with 0x...\n\n    % listcharnames texgyrecursor-bold.otf 0x050 0x060\n    P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,bracketleft,backslash,bracketright,asciicircum,underscore,grave\n    %\n\nOn windows, unless you are running cygwin, my scripts would not work as is and the previous call would become\n\n    luatex --luaonly listcharnames texgyrecursor-bold.otf 0x050 0x060\n\nThat gives as output the list to be used with `tx -g`\n\nI dont' find that Lua code very elegant compared to the Python script but I am not experienced enough in Lua to improve.\n\nIncidently, should it not be possible to generate the desired chart directly with LuaTeX or LuaLaTeX?\n\nMichel\n\n"

I could probably design my own, but I don't have the skill to design a chart macro quickly and no longer have the time these days to spend hours working on TeX macro-programming. In ConTeXt, it would probably be more efficient to write a fontchart module in lua anyway, and that's definitely beyond my skill set.\n\nThanks again!\n\n"

Still exploring its possibilities.\n\nSurprised this one isn't better known.
