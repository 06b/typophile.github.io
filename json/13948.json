PDFs can also contain interactive elements such as web and email links and form fields.\n\nThough other applications can create PDFs, the primary application for creating and modifying PDFs is [Adobe Acrobat](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102823/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe%20Acrobat). Portable Document Format has gained in popularity and credibility as many professional printing houses request high resolution PDFs as the default format.\n\nSome type designers and type [foundries](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102823/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Foundry) have reservations about the security PDFs as it is still possible for dedicated hackers to pull font [outlines](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102823/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Outlines) from a PDF. For this reason some foundries' [EULAs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102823/http:/typophile.com/wiki/EULA) disallow embedding their fonts in PDFs.\n\n",
