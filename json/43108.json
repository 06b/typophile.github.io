I am especially looking for something that is similar (in style at least) to [this computer display](http://web.archive.org/web/20110518010900/http:/memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Image:TranswarpComputerDisplay.jpg). Now, that is quite obviously a pixel-y raster font. [This example](http://web.archive.org/web/20110518010900/http:/memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Image:Kobayashi_Maru_data.jpg) seems to be more of a vector-y type.\n\nAgain, I am not necessarily looking for these exact shapes, but rather some fonts that evoke the idea of 1980s computer interfaces in a similar fashion.\n\nAny tips or comments would be appreciated.\n\n",
