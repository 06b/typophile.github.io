Apologies for the poor quality of the photo - I tried to find the poster on the Cavallini website but without luck.\n\nI suspect it's not a font as such, as each letter looks individually handwritten, but wondered if there was a chance someone had done some kind of reproduction of it.\n\nMany thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [IMG\\_1295.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111225140031/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_1295.jpg) | 523.27 KB |\n| [IMG\\_1293.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111225140031/http:/typophile.com/files/IMG_1293.jpg) | 797.73 KB |\n\n",
