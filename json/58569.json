If this is the final logo... it is very bad (from my nerdy-exclusively-typographic point of view) .\n\n",

Original above, my version below. This is really for the benefit of non-Typophiles who have trouble expressing or perceiving why the logo is ugly. Quite apart from the shapes and proportions themselves, mathematical ellipses just look bad without optical correction. The pointier ends need to be rounded a bit. It's one of the reasons why squooshing without optical adjustment yields such ugly results.\n\n"
