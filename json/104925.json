  "content": "Hello, first time poster here! :)\n\nI'm looking for some critique on the typesetting & layout of this white paper. Initially I wanted to do a two-column layout, but the text has so many breaks that the columns didn't flow very nicely, so I'm kinda stuck with one-column, which seems a bit boring to me.\n\nThe fonts used are Neutraface 2, Belizio, and Chronicle Text for the main copy. This will be mainly for screen reading (that may change) so I didn't do facing-pages.\n\nAny comments/critiques are welcome!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [whitepaper-critique.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419160436/http:/typophile.com/files/whitepaper-critique.pdf) | 207.17 KB |\n\n",
