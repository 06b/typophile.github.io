That’s ironic haha.  \n [Its what you can do with the design that will make the difference.](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201162946/http:/www.spiekermann.com/mten/2008/04/helvetica_can_be_nice.html)\n\nThere are a lot of good alternatives (in the link above) and some of them could work quite well.  \nBut none of them are Helvetica, and none of them really could replace it (but yes they are alternatives), as you will get a different feel.\n\nUnivers & Helvetica are quite different, and you will get a different feel with both of them. Helvetica is warmer than Univers and has more character.\n\nBest Helvetica [Helvetica Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201162946/http:/www.linotype.com/2048/neuehelveticapro.html)\n\nThe spacing is slightly better than others, as well as on-screen rendering (in Indesign anyway).\n\nAkkurat is a good modern alternative, but is quite different again.\n\n"

If I was told that I could only use the Helvetica Neue family for the rest of my life, I’d be totally fine with that. But isn’t switching from to Helvetica because you’re bored with Univers kind of like switching to a Sanstone-colored car because you’re bored with beige?\n\nHave you thought about moving towards something a bit more obviously different (Meta, or something like that)?\n\n"
