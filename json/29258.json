If you are interested, get in touch with me and I will pass on further details.\n\nAlthough there will be another Open Day in the spring, anybody interested in investigating funding support options needs to start work on applying soon.\n\n [‹ Trends for 2006](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202144050/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16762 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Quotes ON designers ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202144050/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29228 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
