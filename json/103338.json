  "content": "Used by Decca Music Group in cover and booklet for DVD set released in 2012.  \nNo luck at Bowfin, where I flipped through \"formal connected scripts,\" Identifont, or MyFonts search--which produced over 900 non-matching fonts for the tags \"script-calligraphic.\"  \nThe Z is very Germanic -- appropriate for Mozart's Die Zauberflöte.  \nSo any idea as to the ID of the font?  \nDon\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420030025im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DieZauberfl%C3%B6te_5626.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks.  \nThis is indeed a version of the same font . My copy of French111 is an old t1 with the notice \"Copyright 1990-1998 as an unpublished work by Bitstream Inc.\" I checked the character set at Myfonts and note that BT has not updated the font to include the German Z as an alternate.  \nAnyway, it seems that the design predates the digital era.  \nMyfonts says about Linotype Gando that it is \"The classical French Ronde, as it appears in the work of Nicholas Gando in the middle of the eighteenth century, adapted for photocomposition at Mergenthaler in 1970 by Hans Jurg Hunzicker and Matthew Carter. Typo Upright is similar.\"  \nAs far as I can determine Linotype did not digitize it. A search at the Linotype website produces an offer of the BT font. Similarly Myfonts does not sell Gando and a search leads only back to French 111.  \nAs for the Decca image, I can only guess at the source of the Z. Presumably it is from a digital source.  \nBowfin & Identifont did not add anything.  \nDon\n\n"

      "content": "I think Gando Ronde might be seen as the Linotype-version of [ATF’s Typo Upright](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420030025/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/typo-upright/) It has to be noticed though that the upright French Ronde has been rather popular in Germany in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Seemann’s ‘Handbuch der Schriftarten’ from 1926 lists eight German foundries such as Berthold, Stempel and Bauersche Gießerei that sell a ‘Rundschrift’ (round script). The design is credited with W. Woellmer (a typefounder/typefoundry in Berlin), 1860.\n\nNote that, unlike in Gando or Typo Upright, the ‘i’ in ‘Die’ tilts to the left … not very Germanic I’d say!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the book reference -- I'll see if I can find a copy -- and the designer credit.  \nAs for the tilt to the left of \"i\" in the sample, you are correct that it does not tilt left in the BT digital Gando. Indeed, the BT version clearly tilts to the right.  \nHere is Gando's \"i\" as displayed in Jaspert's Encylopedia of 1970, presumably the metal font:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420030025im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hij@GandoRondeLC@Jaspert1970__3647.jpg)\n  \nAnd here is the photocomposition version prepared for Mergenthaler by Hans Jurg Hunzicker and Matthew Carter in 1970, as displayed in Rookledge's Interational Typefinder:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420030025im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hij@GandoRonde@Rookledge1983__4013.jpg)\n  \nI don't see a tilt to the right of either the metal and photocomposition versions to quite the same degree as the BT version. Nor do they tilt to the left as shown in the Zauberflöte sample.  \nThis almost suggests that despite the 2012 release date of the DVD the sample was made in the old way, from a set of photocomposition transfer letters and there was a lack of attention in pasting the \"i\". This may also explain the source of the Germanic Z as a Germanized set of transfer sheets. But I have no way of knowing any of this.\n\nDon\n\n"
