  "content": "Hello typo aficionados  \nI am at the moment looking for a sans serif typeface to be companion of [Maga](http://web.archive.org/) typeface (a serif typeface erlesed by DSType foundry).\n\nI'll be using this typeface on Light and Bold weights (light for running text and big quotes and bold for main titles ) in a website I am creating at the moment .  \nI will use the sans serif companion for the captions, figure caption, and sub-heads, as well as in bottoms and secondary text.\n\nI looking for something that is beautiful, readable, modern, and web friendly.  \nSomething with the size, color and beuty of Rijks Museum [custom typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111915/http:/www.boldmonday.com/en/rijksmuseum/). I know that they develop the typeface based on Penno, but Penno doesn't have the same qualities as in this one.\n\nGive me some hits guys  \nThank you all  \nFábio Santos\n\n",
