To me, the true heros who really deserve our praise are the ordinary folk who have very little of their own but still give what they can to those less fortunate. Some volunteer time at soup kitchens, others pass out blankets to the homeless who have nothing but a steaming grate to keep them warm. They don’t get recognition for their work, they just do it because it is right.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
