On this system (and this is at work, not on my OWN machine) it shows only two fonts with yogh: MS Sans as Chris suggested, and a pixel-font I made myself (LOL).

Since MS Sans falls within both definitions that sorted me out wrt that. The subsequent discussions have been interesting nonetheless! :-D\n\nBTW, agree with you on keeping the design of the character in keeping with whatever level of modernity the rest of the font has. I've read more than one linguistics book where the author has had to use yogh (and wynn, etc.) in discussions of OE, and the thing has stuck out like a sore thumb because it didn't look like it belonged to the same font...\n\n@si: thanks, didn't know that.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working.\n\n"

(I was poking gentle fun, because I know your position on bundled fonts.)\n\nBut you raise a good question about the definition. Technically, I think you're probably right.

But if enough of you contact MS with a request for an expanded Constantia, it might happen. Ideally, all the CT fonts would be brought up to the same level of Unicode support. It's a bigger job than for most other MS fonts, because the CT fonts all have proper smallcap support.\n\n"
