      "content": "So HermesSoft are the only ones producing fonts in Bulgaria? That's rough... So what kind of Cyrillic types were produced in Bulgaria or used by Bulgarians historically, before digital fonts? How would those types be judged by today's Bulgarians?\n\nIn your opinion, what constitutes good Cyrillic design on the Bulgarian model? Are there any good, thoughtful examples being produced--lettering, custom logos, calligraphy, etc.--that might point the way? Or any historical high marks--models from the past that epitomize good Bulgarian Cyrillic design--that could be a good springboard for a present renewal?\n\nIs there one model or a diverse range of models to follow for Bulgarian Cyrillic? Sorry to barrage you with questions, but I'm eager to learn about Bulgarian typographic traditions and the current scene.\n\n"

What's specified as the default for a specific language may be an issue, however.\n\nI've been developing some new typefaces (to be released this Fall/Autumn) in Cyrillic and Greek, and following a seminar given by Maxim Zhukov, I became aware of the Bulgarian issue. So I've included a Bulgarian \"language specific\" option to the standard Cyrillic letterforms in the fonts. Serbian too.\n\nSo while the basic Cyrillic typeface (below) is a fairly authentic 19th century revival (close to a type published by Adolf Darre in Harkov in 1888) the Bulgarian alternates are \"historical fiction\" based on a study of fonts published by HermesSoft. Given the logic of typographic style, and its relative portability across cultural (well, Latin-Greek-Cyrillic anyway) and temporal boundaries, that seems reasonable.\n\nHere is the upright style of the serifed face, which shows the most distinction between standard and Bulgarian Cyrillic forms:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820232933im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bulg_3601.jpg)\n\nTo clarify how this works: when the language used in the layout application is specified as Bulgarian (\"BGR\"), the Bulgarian alternates are substituted.\n\n"

Though I agree it looks like an animal shape composed of matchsticks, and would be fun to design just because.\n\nNew question for Bulgarians (and other native Cyrillic users): I came across [this page with PDF files of the Bible in Church Slavonic](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820232933/http:/www.sbible.boom.ru/slavpdf.htm). Does the style of Cyrillic used there have specific connotations as being appropriate only for religious literature or recreations of mediaeval texts? Or does it have broader appeal?\n\nI'm thinking of a possible parallel example in Korean typography. The older Hangul (Korean alphabet) Bibles--the ones where the text is set vertically, not horizontally as Korean is written now--were set in a typeface designed by Seo Sangryun and Baek Hongjun in the late 19th Century and first used for printing in 1882. Because of the drab uniformity of Hangul book typefaces in contemporary use, the unique type style of old Korean Bibles is all the more distinctive.\n\nIn 1998, the Sandoll foundry produced [a digital revival](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820232933/https:/www.sandoll.co.kr/SandollWeb/shop/product_down_read.asp?idx=182&listType=2) of this typeface under the direction of Lee Kyungbae, calling it Seonggyeongche (literally, 'Bible face'). Since then, I've seen it pop up on book covers, advertisements, and signs in uses that have nothing to do with the Bible. Although it was jarring at first, I've become accustomed to the type style being used in wider applications. Although the uses I've seen were all for display purposes, I even think a cleaned-up version would be good for contemporary book typography (as the Sandoll version is deliberately rough in imitation of the antique printing press outputs).\n\nWith the type style used for Church Slavonic typography, you similarly have a slice of older typographic history preserved through the conservative medium of religious literature. Is there a similar situation in Bulgaria and elsewhere where that type style is used for display purposes outside of the church context? To what extent could the style serve as an inspiration for contemporary developments in Cyrillic typography?\n\n"
