You’re bound to run into the designers sooner or later and sometimes it’s a totally unexpected person. :^P\n\nBut David knows I like (almost) all of his other designs, and he’s always been a good sport in our previous “run-ins”. I remember a hilarious response to a remark I made about how poorly Escrow was used in [the new De Standaard](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202055458/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=179).\n\n"
