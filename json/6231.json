      "content": "Tanya wrote: _The goal of the Org should be to keep profits down to 0._   \n   \nYou'll be glad to know that ATypI has been extremely successful in meeting this goal for many years. Unfortunately, this is often due to lack of revenue, rather than because revenue has been spent on providing resources to members. This is what I mean when I say that ATypI needs to increase revenue from membership fees, and in any other way it can, in order to improve its operational effectiveness. Every year, we get together and discuss all the things we would like to do to provide members with more benefits; we even make plans. Then we go back to our jobs, and over the course of the next year we're lucky if enough volunteer time is available to do a 20% of the things we discussed doing. Ideally, I would like to see ATypI in a position to make grants available to subsidise worthwhile projects that will benefit all type designers and typographers. Unless we find ways to increase revenues, this is unlikely ever to happen. I agree with Hrant that finding ways to make membership available to designers in countries with developing, unstable or depressed economies can have a positive impact on both the culture of the association and on its finances. While Tanya's idea is interesting and creative, I think it would distract the already over-extended volunteers who keep the association ticking. We need to find more efficient solutions, not more complex ones.\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant writes: _Well, \"We have members in over 40 nations\", but from going to 3 conferences ... it looks like maybe 90% are from Europe and North America._   \n   \nI did some analysis of membership figures today (I don't have the latest figures yet, or a breakdown of full vs. student membership by country), and can report that 90% of members not only come from Europe and North America but, more specifically from countries in the top 26 nations ranked by GNI per capita. This convinces me that adjusting membership fees relative to this index is both viable and desirable.   \n   \nI reject the idea that ATypI is 'geographically elitist': the figures I provide are explained by the historical origins of the association in an Anglo-European type industry. I've argued for a long time that the demise of that industry provides a positive opportunity for reform and renewal in the association; unfortunately, the demise of the industry has also produced the financial difficulties that make such reform and renewal a slow process. It has been too slow, and I intend to do whatever I can to invite membership from a more truly international community.   \n   \nThank you to everyone who has participated in this discussion, which has prompted me to take a close look at the membership issue relative to national economic indicators.\n\n"

Designers aren't usually the most rich or the most poor...)   \n   \nMy point with this early comment that if you built different prices by countries, we will have immediatly more complains from actual members who can't afford as \"poor in rich countries\" when others will have lower price.   \n   \nIts difficult to set up various prices depending countries, very complicate, take time, so this new idea really need to be strongly built in way the balance move to the correct side to achieve that idea.   \n   \nThis problem in some aspect similar as if you set up various value of a vote depending from where you came from: cities, surburb, country side. Its not democratical at all, I think.\n\n"
