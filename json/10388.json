Am I right? Or not?   \nI know that it's possible to buy it at Adobe, Monotype Imaging, Linotype and Ascender. The prices are different. And what about fonts. Are they different?   \n   \nartur\n\n",

The retail TTF's Ascender is offering are the latest shipping versions of these fonts. These may be important to people who need complete compatibility with the Office or Windows version of a given font.   \n   \nCheers, Si\n\n"
