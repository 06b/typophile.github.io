He had this to say:\n\n\"These used to be the fonts cartographers used. Left-leaning italic for rivers, etc. They used to be engraved, thus the look. Berthold used to credit them with the administration responsible for the standard, i.e. Bayerisches Landesvermessungsamt (Bavarian Office for Land Registry or something -- the state cartography office). They're really cool and i've been meaning to use them for years. I set maps with that stuff on a Diatype, back in the 60s (i know, i know...)\"\n\n"
