Mayflower is a classical Roman font taken  \nfrom a Bible of 1610, the edition likely carried to America by the pilgrims  \non the Mayflower. True to the original source, Mayflower featured a  \ndistressed look to simulate the appearance of inked metal type. Mayflower  \nSmooth Pro lacks the inked look and is ideal for cleaner design  \napplications and letterpress work. Both styles are evocative of  \nearly-Colonial type styles.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103125029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MayflowerSmoothProPoster_5043.jpg.jpeg)\n\nMayflower Smooth Pro features Small Caps, ligatures, fractions, historical  \nforms and ligatures, Central European characters, discretionary ligatures,  \nold style figures, lining figures and ornaments.\n\nIntroductory offer through May 31st\n\n[http://p22.com/sherwoodtype/mayflowersmooth.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103125029/http:/p22.com/sherwoodtype/mayflowersmooth.html \"http://p22.com/sherwoodtype/mayflowersmooth.html\")\n\nSherwood Type is distributed exclusively through P22 type foundry Inc.\n\n",
