Four weights with alternates turned into four weights with alternates, alternate-alternates, italics, small caps, multiple numeral styles, extended language support and two completely new widths: Condensed and Compressed. In addition to the expansion, each glyph of Bryant was redrawn to improve what needed improving while retaining its key qualities: a san serif with open, geometric forms and rounded tips.\n\nTry out any of the new Bryants with our Test Typer or view the PDF Specimens:\n\nBryant 2 and Pro  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141318/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/ \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/\")\n\nBryant Condensed  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcon/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141318/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcon/ \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcon/\")\n\nBryant Compressed  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcom/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141318/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcom/ \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryantcom/\")\n\n————————————————————-  \nUpgrading From Bryant to Bryant 2  \n————————————————————-  \nIf you previously purchased Bryant through us and would like to purchase the new Bryant (now called Bryant 2 or Pro), there are several options for upgrading at significantly reduced prices:\n\n1.) Purchase the same weight or style configuration for a small upgrade price.\n\n2.) Or, purchase additional weights or styles in conjunction with the upgrade of the original purchase.\n\nFor a full explanation of upgrade options and pricing visit:  \n [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/upgrade.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808141318/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/upgrade.html \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant2/upgrade.html\")\n\n————————————————————-  \nMaple - Now 20% off!  \n————————————————————-\n\nMaple, released the first half of 2005, was recently named by Typographic as one of their favorite fonts of the year (http:// typographi.com/001045.php).\n\nTo celebrate, we’re offering Maple at a 20% discount for one month.
