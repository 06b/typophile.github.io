  "content": "Hello everyone, I have always gotten great help on this forum and I am hoping someone will be able help me with this issue. We are working on a catalog and there is a portion of text that needs to be set in Vietnamese. When it is set some of the characters come up as blanks, I am guessing because the font does not have these characters. I need to set this one block of copy and would like to not buy a font for this. Are there any fonts that include these characters or free fonts I can download. Especially wanting something sans serif. Thanks in advance for any help.\n\nOk sorry, should have looked a little deeper first, found a goldmine in Arial's glyph palette.\n\n",
