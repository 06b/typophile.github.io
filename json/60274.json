Good lead with the Venetian serifs, I'll take a look.\n\nAn authentic look isn't particularly required, I was just wanting to look at the authentic ones to better understand the characteristics. I've come across a lot of interesting revivals of Italian faces of the time which I may consider using too.\n\nThanks again\n\n"
