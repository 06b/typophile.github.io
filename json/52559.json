  "content": "Hi,\n\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to control how FontLab decides the size of bitmaps pasted in the background? When I paste my capital letters from Photoshop, the bitmaps are automatically scaled to the caps height. This is fine with 'A' and 'H', but not with 'C' and 'O' which I want slightly taller than the caps height. And when I do the same with 'Å', the bitmap is suddenly enormous.\n\nI would simply want them all to be pasted to the same scale. Is that even possible?\n\n/Måns\n\n",
