      "content": "It is a custom design based on Erbar.\n\nErbar was a face from Bauer by Jakob Erbar in the 1920s. Only a few display weights of that have been digitized and made commercially available, sadly.\n\nBut if you want to match the Berlin city street signs, you are in luck!\n\nVerena Gerlach and Ole Schäfer digitized this (and the East Berlin street signs) for the [FF City Street Type family](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_city_street_type/). To get this style, you should use FF Cst Berlin West Regular or Medium, I guess.\n\n"

      "content": "Actually, this is not a classic, because this looks like one of the new signs.\n\nThe original Berlin street signs were painstakingly digitized by type archaeologist [Verena Gerlach](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Verena%20Gerlach) and [Ole Schäfer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Ole%20Sch%C3%A4fer) for [FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontFont) as [FF City Street Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_city_street_type/) in bothe East and West Berlin variants, before they started changing these wonderful signs into the somewhat less wonderful signs they have now.\n\nI think the modern signs might use FF Transit, the typeface [Erik Spiekermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erik%20Spiekermann) and MetaDesign specified for the Berlin subway system. Is is available in three versions, the first one being [FF Transit Print](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_transit_print_ot/) for use in print. The two other versions are intended for wayfinding -- [FF Transit Front](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_transit_front_ot/) for front lit signs, and [FF Transit Back](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074111/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_transit_back_ot/) which compensates the weight change of the characters in backlit signs so the weights of both front lit type and back lit type appear identical.\n\n"

'b' and the wonderful eszet (and tz!) ligatures. It has a marvellous 'period' feel, although I'm not 100% sure _which_ period :-)\n\n"
