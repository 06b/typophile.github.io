BTW, [WhatTheFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203233407/http:/new.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) gets pretty close for this.  \nThe [BE version](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203233407/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/baskerville-be/) is quite similar too, but the BQ has the inktraps, and looking at your \"M\" that's probably a closer match. There might be other versions, but I think the general direction is right. :)\n\n"
