  "content": "Has anyone else had any problems with OpenType font names and Mac OS 10.7? We are running into issues in which fonts that have worked in every OS for a decade suddenly aren't working. It seems to be involved with naming conventions. It seems to be font names which are over 29 characters or have any non-alphnumeric characters are failing. Unfortunately, since we don't have access to a machine which runs OS 10.7, troubleshooting is problematic. The symptom of the failure is that the font does not appear as available for selection. This is happening in Indesign and Illustrator CS6.\n\n",
