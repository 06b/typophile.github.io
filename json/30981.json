I have created a page listing all of them I know of:\n\n[http://mic-ro.com/metro/metrofonts.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/mic-ro.com/metro/metrofonts.html \"http://mic-ro.com/metro/metrofonts.html\")\n\nDo you know of more corporate metro/subway fonts?\n\nThanks in advance  \nMike\n\n",

      "content": "Non-Latin metro fonts, anyone? I'll give it a go with what I can write about the Hangul (Korean alphabet) faces in use in the Seoul metro, where I've spent an inordinate proportion of my life recently. I won't mention the subordinate Latin and Chinese character faces (the Latins are Frutiger-derived, I think, though I haven't examined them closely).\n\nThe metropolitan subway system in Seoul and surrounding areas is run by three different organizations: Korail, Seoul Metro, and Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corporation (SMRT). Which explains why I can identify at least three different faces in wide use for the signage.\n\nOne is HY Ullungdo (HY 울릉도), developed by [Hanyang Information & Communications](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/www.hanyang.co.kr/font_pds/php/view.php?idx=41). It feels like Korail has used this font for ages, though Hanyang was founded in 1990 so it can't have been in use before that.\n\n(As an aside, trying to find information on hangul typefaces can be really frustrating, as often the only information one can find is who is selling them. Most Korean foundry websites provide no info on the designers, and some don't even give the year of design. One reason might be that hangul fonts are generally made by teams, not individual designers, and developed and updated through many years.)\n\nI don't think HY Ullungdo is a custom metro face though; although it was probably designed for a signage purpose, I haven't come across any information that suggests that Korail commissioned it. Anyway, here's an example courtesy of Flickr:\n\n[http://flickr.com/photos/wrs111445/458693146/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/flickr.com/photos/wrs111445/458693146/ \"http://flickr.com/photos/wrs111445/458693146/\")\n\nOn their newer lines, though, Korail does use a custom face called 'Korail (코레일)' developed by [Asiafont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/www.asiafont.com/) (2003?). It's a nice, clean update to the Ullungdo genre, in my opinion. I found a Flickr photo example here:\n\n[http://flickr.com/photos/zinka/255634677/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/flickr.com/photos/zinka/255634677/ \"http://flickr.com/photos/zinka/255634677/\")\n\nThe other widely seen face, and perhaps the one most familiar to Seoul commuters, is the one used by SMRT, but I have no idea what it's called, whether it is a custom face (I suspect it might be), and the general story behind it. It's a pity, because it's a beautiful face that has a warmer, friendlier feel than Ullungdo/Korail. It's the face I associate with Seoul subway, having grown up along SMRT-operated Line 4.\n\nI'm quite positive that it's not available as a digital font; if it were, I would have been able to find at least some info on it. The Flickr photo example I found (one of several I could have used):\n\n[http://flickr.com/photos/kwongcharles/131999361/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/flickr.com/photos/kwongcharles/131999361/ \"http://flickr.com/photos/kwongcharles/131999361/\")\n\nCan anyone help me with that last one?\n\n"

I know the signs were hand painted and can vary from sign to sign but after looking at quite a few different signs, the font is more similar from sign to sign compared to the downloadable fonts I have found.\n\nDoes anyone know a true usable version of this font found on the signs???\n\nThanks for the help.\n\nThe closest I've found is this one below but it's still a bit different  \n [http://www.fontcubes.com/browse/m/page8.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/www.fontcubes.com/browse/m/page8.php \"http://www.fontcubes.com/browse/m/page8.php\")\n\nAny opinions?\n\nImages:  \n [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Metropolitain.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Metropolitain.jpg \"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Metropolitain.jpg\")  \nAn original sketch of metro sign:  \n [http://www.GreatBuildings.com/drawings/Paris\\_Metro\\_Elev\\_B.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315143256/http:/www.greatbuildings.com/drawings/Paris_Metro_Elev_B.jpg \"http://www.GreatBuildings.com/drawings/Paris\\_Metro\\_Elev\\_B.jpg\")\n\n"
