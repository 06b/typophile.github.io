What is your favourite A, K, Ampersand etc.\n\nWork in progress just did it [http://www.workinprogressblog.com/?cat=11](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018040628/http:/www.workinprogressblog.com/?cat=11 \"http://www.workinprogressblog.com/?cat=11\"), but I think it would be cool to make a better one, which shouldn't be a problem, with a little help from all you expert fontheads : )\n\nI enclosed a picture of the letters I have done so far, just to give you an idea of where I want to go with this, but it is very far from done.  \nAs you can see, most of it is already custom-made, so it doesn't have to be an existing font. It can be a scan from an old magazine etc. Anything goes!\n\n// Mark\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [allstar.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018040628/http:/typophile.com/files/allstar.jpg) | 29.43 KB |\n\n",

I still can't see how that can be illegal. If i was using 20 or more different fonts in a design assignment, it wouldnt be illegal, and that would even be profitable which this project isn't.  \nThe main reason I want to do it, is for educational purposes. I thought it would be very interesting to hear what people's favourite letters etc. is, and maybe make a costum font based on that information.\n\nSo please start spilling some font-wisdom : )\n\n"

It seems to be an homage done for fun...not profit in any way. It's fun.\n\nYea, yea, any of the foundries could make a stink if they wanted to, and they'd probably be within their rights, but I can't possibly see how Lubalin has any intention of doing anything malicious here (at least based on what I've read in this thread.)\n\nI'm not against protecting copyright...I just cringe when I see 'copyright!' used as a way to shout down creativity.\n\n"

Besides that though, I'm not sure what \"wisdom\" is required spilling of, nor what \"fun\" there is in making/using Ransom Note fonts, as opposed to, for example — the study of, use of, and discourse upon whole alphabets, which is mostly what most of us do most of the time.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

Sampling, I guess.  \nIf the final form of a 'collage' were whole or part of previous works not owned by the 'artist' but given to the viewer to make a collage — is that 'giving' a 'valid art form'? ;-.\n\nI like this work by the way, the letters in composition are well worth looking at. If one were to say, let's make squares out of our favorite letters and talk about 'em, I might think otherwise. But an 'homage' ransom note font would not be so unless each person who viewed or used it knew, or could find from the work itself who made each letter, would it?\n\nCheers!\n\n"
