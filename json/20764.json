I have to use a font from bitstream.\n\nthe brochure is going to internal coporate managers to push the companies IT guys, hence technology.\n\nany suggestions very much appreciated from you smart people!\n\n [‹ Design Melt Down](http://web.archive.org/web/20080606035858/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20779 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [50 ways.. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080606035858/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20777 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
