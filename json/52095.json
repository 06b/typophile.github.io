When it gets that silly / sardonic you can be sure I'm putting peeple on. For the curious, \"gripe-o-phile\" is a pun on typophile I extracted from Ray Larabie. I made him coin it by saying \"tripe-o-phile\" to him one day. The pair of us compete to see who can be the silliest and get into the most trubble.\n\nNow Ricky, I'm disappointed in you ;^) We haven't had a joke from you yet. That's hardly in the festive spirit is it? Wot say Ricky? Wot's your joke?\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

I suppose there is a vague kind of a theme going there, if 2009 can be called a theme. All I can really tell you is that I would have been stuck for something interesting to post if it wasn't for layers and gradients and hard lite.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106070103im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jimi_08_5401.gif)\n\nSo I am thinking of giving away release copies of Jabberwub to typophilers as free xmas gifts.\n\nThink that's a good idea?\n\nDo you?\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
