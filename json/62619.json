  "content": "Almost ready to release my new sarcastic robot font.  \nIt's a monospaced, fixed-wdth font, but it's also a handwriting font and it is fun, too.  \nBecause programmers are always looking for an interesting new fixed-width font.  \nHere's something a little different.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419021207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sarcastic_robot_display_6348.gif)\n\n",
