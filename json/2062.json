I would like to get into professional type design but the cost of font software is holding me back, as a starving artist.\n\n"

      "content": "You can give it to us that way, if you want to create a pixel font. If it is of good visual quality and original design, we will font-ify and publish it for you. For outline fonts, the biggest slice of professional type design, you will need a font tool. Free ones are available on sourceforge, FontLab is expensive and excellent.   \n   \nArtists can work in the GIMP, Photoshop, and/or anything that can create a GIF, PNG or TIFF.   \n   \nWe are interested in picture fonts too.\n\n"
