Followed by it being digitized by Scangraphic, but not how the rights were acquired or any of that info. Then I get to E+F buying the Scangraphic catalog, but due to legal issues, Haas Unica is no longer distributed.\n\nIf anyone can fill in the sketchy details I have above, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance.\n\n",

Then from another source, I have heard that URW digitized it (but never released it) only to have it distributed by The Font Company, with no explanation to why it is no longer available.\n\nDoes anyone know the correct story?\n\n"

Not only have I sold an identity and several rounds of printed matter, I could possibly have put my client in a legal situation, and in turn myself in regards to the foundry that digitized and sold the font.\n\nA not so funny turn on the usual font piracy issue. Maybe I should hike my prices on other jobs to compensate for the potential legal liability until the selling foundry clears its legal claim to the face and puts it on the market again.

I would be interested in their take. It is possible that Hrant's idea about it is right. Maybe I am missing something. But in the meantime look into \"fair use\". Admittedly it is something which is still quite fuzzy legally speaking and may take some time to understand. But as Bill points out it really does seem to cover this instance very very well.\n\nAlso, please look up “schizophrenic”. The popular use of the word to mean \"of two or more minds or personalities\" is misleading. Further using it as an Epithet is also marginalizing for people who suffer from it and doesn't help people to understand the illness or to treat it properly.\n\n"
