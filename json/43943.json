  "content": "Hello Type peoples.\n\nLooking for an equally elegant alternative to the Edwardian Script Ampersand. I'd like to find something that also has the really exaggerated swashes and light weight qualities of this as well as keeping with the \"expected\" look of the \"&\" as cited.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n",

Perhaps [the Pro version](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017160513/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=426947&grab_id=0&page_id=7331&query=edwardian%20script&SCOPE=Fonts) sorts all this out?...\n\n"
