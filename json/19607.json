I guess the answer is a little bit of both.\n\nHypothetically, **if I had actually purchased that font** , I would expect that Garage fonts would replace it, at least at a small fee. If they were unable or unwilling to do that, personally I would have no qualms about going to where I know it can be found and getting it.\n\n"
