  "content": "Hello  \nI’m considering showing my students samples of Jonathan Hoefler’s HTF Gestalt as part of a short lecture about “minimal” typefaces – Pierre di Sciullo’s Minimum, Herbert Bayer’s Universalschrift, Wim Crouwel’s New Alphabet and so on. I have some HTF specimen booklets as visual documentation, but I'd like to show the typeface in “regular” use as well. Does someone over here know if HTF Gestalt has ever been used in some “real” context – magazine layout, book cover, anything ?  \nThank you very much.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140928090454im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gestalt_6584.png)\n\n",
