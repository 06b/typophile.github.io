  "content": "Hello people, just a bit of fun and extremely useful for my dissertation research!\n\ncan anyone find a font or a single character from a font that would represent a human being? does a typeface or a single character represent yourself and your emotions?\n\nAn example: The font Baskerville, the letter g in lowercase: Fragile, gentle, delicate, soft, lightweight, fashionable, fun.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130324052117im_/http:/typophile.com/files/baskerville_5744.jpg)\n\nBusinesses and companies choose a font that represents themselves and what they do, why cant a font represent us!!!\n\nLook Forward to your response\n\n",

Hands down the most beautiful alphabet I've ever seen. I learned about this while taking in an interview on [Typeradio](http://web.archive.org/web/20130324052117/http:/www.typeradio.org/loudblog/). Now we are talking!\n\n"
