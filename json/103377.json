  "content": "Hello everyone.\n\nHere I am to present you this Riviera, my first attempt to design a font. The project started in the late 2005, when I hand-designed some capital letters to present a project.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414210443im_/http:/typophile.com/files/13-05-29_09-29_RivieraReg1_6705.jpg)\n  \nNow I'd like to complete it. In my mind it should be a display font inspired and recalling the modern movement, '50 etc. Until now I designed a to z lower and uppercase. Numbers are just sketched, I need some time to fix the thicknessess; punctuation and glyphs are not yet drafted. Maybe in future I'll develope different weights versions, but now I want to define this medium weight one.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414210443im_/http:/typophile.com/files/13-05-29_09-29_RivieraReg2_4401.jpg)\n  \nHere there is a little test page:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414210443im_/http:/typophile.com/files/13-05-29_09-29_RivieraReg3_3623.jpg)\n  \nI know there are some problems. /S/ is quite ugly, although /s/ satisfies me more but not at all; /r/ is not so good, the cut seems sharp; and many more things that probably now I can't see. Expecially I'd like to ask you an opinion about the general rythm and the relation between letter width. I think there's something that doesn't work but I can't understand what.\n\nThank you in advance  \nBest regards  \nStefano\n\nPdf is attached to take a closer look\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [13-05-29\\_16-25\\_RivieraReg.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414210443/http:/typophile.com/files/13-05-29_16-25_RivieraReg.pdf) | 303.13 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I took a close look and i really like the shapes. Especially the K’s are beautiful. So i started to wonder what thicknesses you where referring to. IMO the thicknesses are fine.\n\nTrying to write about potential to improve i would say:  \nThe /g’s and /e’s lower curve may be a bit to small for my taste but as a monitor font it will certainly work well i think. The optical baseline is a bit bumpy because there are no down-/upstrokes on /u /r ect.\n\ni hope this helps\n\nbest regards\n\n"

      "content": "Nice. On balance, I wonder if the lowercase t/f and /j might not be wide enough? I agree with 37DMK on the loop an the bottom of the /g.\n\nI wonder why the uppercase /W doesn't match the lc /w or the /V ? ...In fact, it looks like you flopped the /M for this one....\n\nLooking good, keep it up! :-)\n\n"
