      "content": "I think the S is more closed than Avenir's, but not as much as Helvetica/Arial. With that said, these letters are not the best for ID purposes, because there may be too many candidates. Maybe that's the good news, because it would be hard to prove them wrong.\n\nFor the sake of argument I will pick [Felbridge Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723082256/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=406034&grab_id=0&page_id=35232&query=Felbridge&SCOPE=Fonts) and say that it would match if you just widened it a bit. The truth is it could probably be many fonts, with no other letters for comparison.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Try this font: Media Gothic\n\n[http://www.dafont.com/es/media-gothic.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723082256/http:/www.dafont.com/es/media-gothic.font \"http://www.dafont.com/es/media-gothic.font\")\n\nIt's near exact to SUUNTO's font.  \nI hope it helps to anyone that reads this now.\n\nRegards.\n\nGuillermo Velasco, from Madrid, Spain.\n\n"
