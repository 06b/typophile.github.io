  "content": "I'm working on a personal photography web site project, in my spare time, so it's unlikely it will be out anytime soon, but nevertheless I'd like it to have recognizable identity.\n\nI’d like to put couple of personal collections, like seascapes (examples 1 and 2), subtle suburban shoots (example 3), there’s one nostalgic grunge collection I’m working on, etc. and there’s one ongoing project I’m working on with local photo club that includes on location people shoots like example 4 (it should be interesting locations and use of external strobes).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130808051715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/example1_3731.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130808051715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/example2_4647.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130808051715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/example3_6693.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130808051715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/example4_6130.jpg)\n\nI’m attaching the logo I like best of those I’ve played with until now (so far i like light gray, blue, orange combo):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130808051715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/identity_5536.jpg)\n\nI've also played with logo from letters GZ, I'll post best what I came up until now (by my opinion) a little later, because I don't have it with me right now.\n\nI’d like the logo, type and color used to say:  \nvision in photography (hence my idea for the stylized eye)  \nurban  \nart  \nprofessional (as in high quality)  \ngrunge (eyelashes and pupil on the eye are sort of grungy to communicate that)  \npositive (by the use of blue, green colors, maybe put pupil in orange for accent).\n\nI'd like to attract young crowd.\n\nI was looking for type that would not be to strict, but not too loose either, and that has sort of \"artsy\" feel to it (possibly countered by word \"photography\" in sans serif). You can see on the logo what I thought might be a good idea, but I'd really like more input from experienced people.\n\nAny help and input appreciated!\n\n",

I suppose being a photographer helps :-)  \nSome random thoughts:  \n- I would revise the colour palette (they seems too many and don’t blend well together). Also, if you think of the logo in a portfolio website, too many colours could distract away from the photographs.  \n- I don’t like the slanted light grey “photography”. You could try an upright light (as in font weight) black version.  \n- Compared with the serene samples you provided, the eye in your logo appears almost menacing...\n\n"

A good idea is to make black, white and gray only versions, before colorizing. Look at it upside down too. It'll help you balance the shape and air around the logo. Hope that makes sense. \n"

Good stuff.\n\nAs for the logo, I think you’re heading in the right general direction, but perhaps down the wrong road. I like the simplicity, but not crazy about the type choice, super-tight letter spacing or mark.\n\nTake a look at [this photography logo I found on Google](http://web.archive.org/web/20130808051715/http:/38one.com/cleverblog/kristy-harrison-wedding-photography). I think its pretty awesome. The whole shutter/aperture thing might be overdone, but it’s geometric qualities make it well-suited for a logo, and this particular one I think was extremely well-executed.\n\nHave you thought of a typeface as simple as Frutiger?

It's not really noticeable or distracting, but I like it a lot. I like how the \"holes\" of the o, g & c resemble the circle of the lens/eye, so the type looks like it belongs to the mark. Nice! I like the thickness of the outer circle of the lens/eye, cause it matches the thickness of the letters. I'd maybe play the lens/eye some more and see if you can make more resemble a camera lens. Myself, I don't mind it al all.\n\nIn the other versions, the type doesn't especially balance with the thickness of the mark, except maybe #8 & #10. On #5 as all uppercase, the name seems to long to me for all uppercase. I think it would be painful reading on a large scale sign for your studio. Like emails \"shouting\" being all uppercase.\n\nSome of the letters stand out badly to me in certain versions: The s in 3 & 4, the i in 3 & 9, the accents in 13 & 14, the t in 14, the g in 3 & 4 will look like an 8 at small sizes\n\nThe first zg logo is interesting, and is worth some exploring - it might not be recognizable unless you repeat or resemble those characters in the name.
