How should I go about this?\n\nTypical norwegian usage is «arrow qoutes», but the auther provided me with “curly qoutes”. Should I still hang the qoutes if we change them? And how about paranteses?\n\nAdvice would be apreciated.\n\nf\n\n [‹ Alternative Characters and \"Logotypes\" in Monotype Metal](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220142544/http:/typophile.com/node/41366 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Valentype | Declare your love for a FontFont and win the FontFont you love! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080220142544/http:/typophile.com/node/42119 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If you want to change it (e.g. to arrow quotes), make sure to check that with the writer of the poem, because from experience I know poets often consider everything in their poems very carefully. But that is obvious.\n\n"

      "content": "As long as we’re giving personal points of view . . .\n\nWhen setting poetry, I usually do not hang quotes. It would depend on a number of factors. Since we only work for publishers, the publisher’s editor usually has a strong preference. Lacking that, if for some reason I really want to hang the quotes, I would try to get up with the poet (assuming the publisher doesn’t mind, i.e., we’d go through the publisher).\n\nBefore even thinking of hanging the quotes though, I’d look at the poetry. Since hanging punctuation is not much used in the States in bookwork, hanging quotes tends to look like jacket blurbs & other advertising. Maybe it’s different in Europe & other parts of the world.\n\nAn advertising look is usually not what you want in poetry. But poetry sometimes has multiple levels of indented lines, and sometimes there is a pattern to these indents. It use to be that the poet prepared the MS on a typewriter, i.e., always monospaced. Translating that feel into typeset copy can be challenging, and it was the comp’s job to do that.\n\nOne of the hardest jobs I worked on had long selections from A.R. Ammons. A copy of the tape had been cut apart & pasted up on 8.5x11 sheets & then photocopied, so it was now pages rather than the roll as split by Ammons. When you went from one sheet to the next, it was devilishly hard to tell you where you were in the indent structure.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI have yet to find anything that overrides Ward’s \\*Crystal Goblet\\* dictum for design & composition, but also find very few designers (or design teachers) who don’t abandon it to strut their stuff & tart things up.\n\nFWIW\n\n"
