  "content": "Hi Everyone!  \nYou all have helped me in the past, so I'm turning here again.  \nI am a pastor who needs to get information to my congregation all the time in the form of fliers, & brochures, (Church clean-up, spaghetti dinner, etc.) It would be great if we could hire graphic designers to do the work, and someday we may be able to do that. For now, I need to find a way to do the fliers myself. I have a good sense of what looks good and I know what I DON'T want (by this I mean that I don't want to reproduce cheesy looking MS word brochures with tacky clip art and horribly counterintuitive formats.)Still, I'm not a professional, and so what I'm doing is pretty basic and hobbling. So the question...\n\nWhat program do you think might help me to do my non-fancy publicity for my church members in a way that still looks decent? Suggestions? I am particularly interested in programs that might have some basic templates included or for purchase.\n\nThanks so much in advance.\n\n",

I've played with Pages A LOT, though, and have a very good idea of what it is capable of. The interface alone shows a lot in this regard. It's well thought-out and very clear. Not a lot of extraneous junk that most users will not use. And, I can say that it does fairly decent typesetting, especially compared to Word.\n\nclauses:\n\nThat Scribus app looks intriguing!\n\nChris\n\n"

You only get out what you put in. Perhaps Apple should include the boilerplate, \"Your Results May Vary.\"  \nA good designer can make something good looking with any program and a bad designer can screw up any program's abilities.  \nIt is not that you can't do something decent in Word. It is that the agony involved is not worth it. I can dance while hanging from my thumbs but why would I choose to? Pages is cheap and more sensible for page layout. Word is a bloated word processor that should stay a word-processor.  \nI had a client a few years ago who asked me for a bid on a brochure. After I gave him the price, he said, \"Can I get it as a Word file?\" I told him that would triple the price.  \nI have been using Word since it came out on the Mac in 1986. Back then WordPerfect was THE PC word-processor. It was a great and small app then. It was darn good through version 5.5. Then it got Cancer and all its cells mutated and grew huge tumors. MS tried chemo which made a funny little paperclip guy jump up and get in the way and made you want to play whack-a-mole.\n\nIt is not that you can't do visually complex stuff with it Si, it just should come with the Surgeon Generals warning.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

True, I've made some fairly nice looking pages in Word, but the process was absolute agony and time-consuming beyond belief.\n\nPages is a good page layout application that beats anything else I've personally seen for beginners/intermediate use.

I just have a natural suspicion when someone claims that a product will be like having an army of graphic designers working around the clock.\n\nI think \"results may vary\" comment is a good one - like the get rich quick schemes and diet pill ads perhaps a \"results not typical\" or \"profesional graphic designer portrayal\" would be good too. ;-)\n\n"
