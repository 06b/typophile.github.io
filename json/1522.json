Here are some things I notice:   \n   \n**n,m,h,u,b,d,p,q,t:** Check the stroke modulation. It seems a   \nlittle wobbly. Particularly in as the horizontals lead up to   \nand transition into the verticals in the branches and bowls.   \n   \n**t:** Crossbar is too short!   \n   \n**g:** Check the spacing in the waist. You may need to   \nopen it up a bit to prevent clogging.   \n   \n**w:** Looks wide. I think you took two v's and put them   \ntogether. This is fine, but I usually narrow each before   \ndoing so. It makes the fit better with other characters and   \nkeeps it from getting too wide. (same goes for an m made   \nof and n + an n branch\n\n"

Foot serifs on the roman r and f could extend to the right a tad to balance the letters.   \n2. g appears to be leaning right. try moving the head left a touch to fix. The bicameral g is way too grotesque, consider... wait, wrong font.   \n3. The spacing on the italics is loose (agreed)   \n4. Try the dot of the italic i a hair to the right. Actually, you may want to revise the structure at the top. It looks identical to the n stem. The result is too left leaning at the top. It shows up as a hole when next to round letters (as in the song: old mcdonald had a farm, eieio). To correct follow the italic angle a bit longer before exiting into the pothook.   \n5. The k seem ok to me, just a little wide. Too much spacing to the right too!   \n6. The w. Kern baby kern.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

I've been referencing Caslon and Janson (mainly Caslon) and it seems that the capitals are slightly more upright than the lowercase -- except in cases of the A, V, and W, which are more angled. Please take a look at page 2 in the PDF below.   \n   \nI've modified the italic p (smaller bowl), f (exaggerated the curves a little more), i and j (fixed the top and moved the dot), and t (the top is scalloped and leans more to the right). The lowercase spacing is better, but the capitals are a nightmare. I've restrained myself from kerning anything until the sidebearings are resolved.   \n   \nOn the roman I extended the the right foot serifs on the r and f and the g doesn't lean anymore. Hrant, can you explain more about the k and the s? I want to make sure I understand what you mean.   \n   \nI'm still tweaking, but I've got to let this one go one of these days. I feel the need to take Randy's advice and try something \"anti-funky\" and more refined. I still want to add small-caps, at least to the roman. Anyway...   \n   \nLet me know what you think, and thanks in advance.   \n   \n-Addison\n\n<!--attachment: Specimen_1-13-04-24176.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*31.2*Specimen+with+italics*Specimen+1%2d13%2d04%2epdf --><!--attachment: Specimen_1-13-04-24176.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*31.2*Specimen+with+italics*Specimen+1%2d13%2d04%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150419204129im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">Specimen with italics<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150419204129/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Specimen_1-13-04-24176.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Specimen 1-13-04.pdf</b></a> (31.2 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n"
