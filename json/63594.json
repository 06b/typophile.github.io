  "content": "Imagine that you are the Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee and just resigned after twenty years of holding that office. There is considerable speculation that you resigned due to an FBI investigation that has been underway by a federal grand jury for months related to your openly corrupt administration. You receive a letter from the FBI informing you that you are the target of this investigation. That letter essentially means that a federal felony indictment will soon be on its way. Due to the seriousness of this information, you want to reply directly to Eric Holder, the Attorney General of the United States of America. What typeface do you select for your personal heading?\n\n[http://files.wmctv.com/2009/herentonholder.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018063734/http:/files.wmctv.com/2009/herentonholder.pdf)\n\nI only hope that this isn’t the actual typesetting of the letter and is just a PDF created by someone from the news station with a sense of humor.\n\n",
