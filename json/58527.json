      "content": "Those are not great diagnostic letters for an ID. Seems like many sans fonts might work, but I scanned MyFonts looking for 'humanist' sans fonts with a somewhat closed S. Depending on how obsessive you are about exactness, you might be able to use [Travis](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021031935/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/protimient/travis/). The S is a bit more closed than your sample, but the W is relatively narrow and the M is straight-sided. Those three letters are about all you've shown that can be used as a filter.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
