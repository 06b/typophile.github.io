Like Picard said, I’m not telling you to let the client design the logo, I’m saying that it’s your job as the designer to communicate visually, however you see fit, the values and personality of the brand. Your ideas thus far communicate nothing at all. It honestly looks like you put a bunch of letters and shapes in a hat and chose at random.\n\nThe client won't design, the client only decides...\n\nAbout the company:  \n- OF COURSE they produce more than only lawnmowers... but everything they build has got wheels...  \n- All the leading people in company are engineers/technicians...  \n- It's a family enterprise with NO identification still yet...\n\nUnder that new aspects my logo of course communicates!\n\nAbout the \"E\":  \nI've seen thousands of logos where a symbol was designed in a 'cramped' (artifical) way.  \nDesigners (mostly rookies) did awful things in putting letters together for creating communication.\n\nHERE it seems to be a 'present of heaven' ;) where the both \"E\" are positioned.  \nFurthermore the \"E\" and one of theyr self-developed parts (E-Splint) fit together in a perfect way...  \nAnd if I won't use that facts everybody can insult me 'blind'!!!\n\nru :)\n\n"
