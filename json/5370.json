Later, when I began studying design I fell in love with Rodchenko.   \n   \nSo, here it is--some traditional Cyrillic to start--in regular and bold. Followed by some more constructivist inspired stuff in heavier weights and sizes.   \n   \n ![sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317135948im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/394.gif)   \n   \nYour honest feedback is appreciated.   \n   \n//joe\n\n",

However, is this awkward or somehow   \nhistorically inaccurate? What do you think?   \n   \nI'm hoping to get this thing ready before bukva:raz.

Looking at this again after   \nseveral months, the inline is much truer to the   \nconstructivist inspiration than the outline.   \n   \nBy the way, while we're talking about Cryrillic   \nalphabets, check out House Industry's latest   \n [Cyrillic addition](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317135948/http:/www.houseind.com/samples/chaletfamily/sampl_cyr_fonts.html?cart=311528552347396) to their Chalet Comprimé family.   \nWell done. In my opinion, the alternates (see   \nthe Kiev 80 and St. Petersburg 80 weights) are   \ntruer to Cryillic heritage with the flared K, etc.   \n   \nBut do yourself a favor and request the new   \ncatalogue, their site doesn't show the versatility   \nof this family very well (i.e. inline!)\n\n"
