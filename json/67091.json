Answering a few simple questions regarding context makes the task far easier and removes aesthetic guesswork. Garamond and Sabon are pretty good fallbacks. [Nick Shinn](http://web.archive.org/web/20101002050245/http:/typophile.com/user/2021) would be a good person to ask.\n\n"

Geared towards a diverse resident base covering major departments such as Environmental, Transportation, Public Health etc. Each has a Page and/or a spread dedicated to them but they all have to fit within a theme. This issue is all about how their tax dollars are spent. It usually has a \"Newsweek\" feel for content and a \"Wired\" style for layout and graphics with a size similar to the \"T magazine\"\n\nI don't dislike Minion I just want a modern version. Currently Minion is paired with Din and Titling. I have explored the use of FF Yoga as a good all round super family, Brioni because of its suitability for magazines and Premiera for its X height. Would these substitute well?\n\nThanks\n\n"
