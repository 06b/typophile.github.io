These aren’t strict revivals, for they are not accurate recreations, nor are they interpretations per se. Instead they reduce the historical models to their basic skeletal forms.

It was registered by Miller & Richard in 1869. Perhaps one of our Typophiles in England, or elsewhere, has access to an old Miller & Richard book with the font and could post a good quality scan or put it on a file hosting service if it is too large for a post at Typophile.  \nUnfortunately for modern font makers, it was very rare for Victorian foundries to publish complete alphabets. This might be obtainable from the English registration or from a font acquired by the McBride Museum in England.  \nDon\n\n"
