      "content": "THANK YOU all for your kind respective input!\n\nI would like to concur with Ryuk, in that the original font most definitely has been INFORMAL GOTHIC and in its digital revival being SOCIAL GOTHIC. The finding fits the timeline as well (font creation 65 - recording 66 - cover production 67). It is not the first columbia/emi cover from the late 60s either which I have encountered that mixes upper/lower case letters of then 'modern' fonts.\n\nHence I'd say: CASE CLOSED!\n\n(Since there is no free version out there, I'll have to fumble around in PS a bit to recreate the cover text)  \n:)\n\ncheers!\n\n"
