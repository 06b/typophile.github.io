(For reference, see here: [http://www.instablogsimages.com/images/2007/08/06/debeers-1\\_25.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150215140043/http:/www.instablogsimages.com/images/2007/08/06/debeers-1_25.jpg \"http://www.instablogsimages.com/images/2007/08/06/debeers-1\\_25.jpg\")).\n\nI know it's very \"generic,\" but it has many subtleties. Be specific.\n\nThe Tiffany and Co font would work as a backup.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n",
