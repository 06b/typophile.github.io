  "content": "Gohan is a font I came up with back in 2001, just as an exercise in making a heavyweight sans font with some idea about some sort of optical properties inspired by an article I read about a font called [Gararond](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/gararond-bold/). Well what resulted probably had nothing to do with the ideas that inspired it but it did turn out to be a very bold font that held up remarkably well at small sizes. Still, it had many deep flaws, and clearly was not ready for prime time.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2205_5970.big.png)\n\nSo now I'm taking it upon myself (in the interest of getting used to using FontForge instead of my old reliable Fontographer as much as anything) to redesign much of the font, and once that is covered, to develop book and medium weight versions.\n\nThe original is available for free at [1001 Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2205). Works in progress are in the attached PDF files below.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pr-Gohan-original.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-Gohan-original.pdf) | 58.16 KB |\n| [pr-ShinGohanSix.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-ShinGohanSix.pdf) | 65.6 KB |\n| [pr-ShinGohanSix-text9pt.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-ShinGohanSix-text9pt.pdf) | 65.93 KB |\n| [pr-ShinGohanSix-text12pt.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-ShinGohanSix-text12pt.pdf) | 66.03 KB |\n| [pr-ShinGohanSeven-plain-chlist.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-ShinGohanSeven-plain-chlist.pdf) | 84.55 KB |\n| [pr-ShinGohanNine-plain-full.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123033026/http:/typophile.com/files/pr-ShinGohanNine-plain-full.pdf) | 56.93 KB |\n\n",

I too like how it looks in the 8 on its own, but it stands out too much amongst the rest of the font, so I've changed it in the revision.\n\nAs I'm progressing through the plain weight, I may have to go back and change more things in the bold to keep them consistent. I only have a few more letters to go in the plain, so a new sample should be up before too long.\n\n"
