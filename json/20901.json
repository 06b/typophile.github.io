  "content": "Hello.\n\nI am a student in art school studying graphic design. Typography is by far the subject which peaks my interest the most. The textbook I read for school was Robert Bringhurst’s Elements of Typographic Style, which was wonderful. I must have read the entire book in the first few weeks of the semester.\n\nI am looking at ordering either Emil Ruder’s Typographie or Muller-Brockman’s Grid Systems in Graphic Design.\n\nSo, I wanted to ask working designers which book they would recommend a design student read first. Also, are there any other recommended books?\n\nThank’s for your advice!\n\n [‹ Have you see the 'KPN Display' face at Cake type?

Unsurprisingly,  \nas he is essentially putting forward his manifesto, it is written quite  \ndictatorially, but as long as you are aware that there are other ways  \nof doing things, it’s a good book to have.\n\nTo be honest I would say buy as many books as you can afford. Just  \nhoover up every bit of knowledge you can find.\n\nPhil\n\n"

It is unfortunate however, that quality books and periodicals are not more readily available in most bookstores though. I usually have to order most items online.\n\nJustin\n\n"

A chance we all take.\n\nListen, I finally got “Robert Brownjohn Sex and Typography.” A must-see!\n\nAnd Willi Kunz’s book—I’ll delve into that tomorrow and let you know.\n\nSorry, you’ve contracted the obsession. There is no cure, but a lot of good books. Happy reading.\n\n"
