  "content": "Good day, typophiles. I was wondering if anyone could help me identify this font. I know I’ve seen it somewhere before, but I can’t seem to put my finger on it.\n\n[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/unmei\\_shinpai/g2lof-phoenix-wrigh...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060540/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/unmei_shinpai/g2lof-phoenix-wright.png \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/unmei\\_shinpai/g2lof-phoenix-wright.png\")  \n(Trying to identify the font in ’Ace Attorney’)\n\nAny help would be appreciated. I also cropped it down and put it through whatthefont as well as a few other font recognition websites with no luck. I have no idea how those work, so it could possibly be the large stroke around the lettering cause it to give me funny results. Who knows.\n\n [‹ Sang Bleu zine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060540/http:/typophile.com/node/40821 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [radiohead / in rainbows / front cover type / ??? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060540/http:/typophile.com/node/45825 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
