It's a very sterile design with one goal in mind, legibility. It has sacrificed unique features to be extremely usable in a variety of typographic situations.

      "content": "I'm only a beginner, but I personally think it's terrific. Very readable. My only thoughts at the moment are that for some reason, the opening at the top of the x gives me the illusion of being larger than the bottom. It would probably help the x to look a little more solidly \"grounded\" to open the bottom just a tad. Also, personally I think the lip (right word? bottom bit) of the e could come just a teensy bit further out. I didn't notice this in the running text, but in the display \"furtive\" the e seems to be slightly too far right.\n\n"

But what a great learning opportunity. Just looking at the hamburger sample above I see three things you can learn from Frutiger's genius.   \n   \n1. The first is the terminals on the a, e and g. Frutiger brings the weight farther into the curve which makes for a more natural modulation.   \n   \n2. The bowl of the g rests above the baseline. Yours looks raised maybe a hair, but still low (ie. very close to the b).   \n   \n3. Check out the stem endings in the following glyphs: a, m, b, u, r, and g. Notice how Frutiger shaves his stems a bit to open the join, but also to appear optically the same width as the other side of the join. By comparison, yours are looking hefty.   \n   \nThe resolution is too low to tell, but check to see if the counters on your b and g eat in to the stem (rather than run tangent, actually overshooting the stem).   \n   \nThat said, yours is very well crafted. Nicely done.   \n   \nRandy\n\n"

The top and bottom of the bowls also hit the stroke lower/higher to make more room for ink collection at small sizes.   \n   \nSecond, I canted the top of all of the ascenders and tops of the vertical strokes.   \n   \nThird, the \"i\" and \"j\" now have round dots.   \n   \nThe letters most changed were the \"a\" and \"b\" and \"q\".   \n   \nNow the question, should I keep going and try to sell this thing or start over?\n\n<!--attachment: furtive_test_02_09-26119.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*12.9*test*furtive_test_02_09%2epdf --><!--attachment: furtive_test_02_09-26119.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*12.9*test*furtive_test_02_09%2epdf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131013011533im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/pdf\">test<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131013011533/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/furtive_test_02_09-26119.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>furtive_test_02_09.pdf</b></a> (12.9 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n"
