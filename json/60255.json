If anyone can drop me the name of a free one that might be out there, it’d me much appreciated.\n\nSecond, I’d love the font used in this flier:  \n [http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v249/isa-ma-bel/dangerous.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090731144224/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v249/isa-ma-bel/dangerous.jpg \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v249/isa-ma-bel/dangerous.jpg\")\n\nor the font used to spell ’garage’ on this album cover:  \n [http://www.sundazed.com/shop/images/SC11139-300.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090731144224/http:/www.sundazed.com/shop/images/SC11139-300.jpg \"http://www.sundazed.com/shop/images/SC11139-300.jpg\")\n\nor any other font that may carry the same characteristics.\n\nThanks so much to anyone who can help me out!\n\n-Isabel\n\n",

I think you need to isolate the image you want to show us.\n\nThe GARAGE font looks like some of the House Industries “Shag” stuff, which also means it may be like some of their Benguiat fonts. This is a sort of late 60’s look, I think, and it seems to be coming back. Jason Walcott at Veer also has done some revivals of fonts from this era.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
