      "content": "Anyone?  \nI have zero proficiency in Cyrillic languages, and require a native-speaking designer to create (3) and (4) below, and therefore also (1) and (2), for the sake of consistency:\n\n> 1  \n> The entire font complement of a design submitted to the competition should be shown on the first sheet, in a large font size. Depending on the design of the typeface, a single font size should be used for the capitals, the lower-case, and the small-cap glyphs. The font should include a Cyrillic glyph set, either the standard complement based on the Mac Cyrillic or Windows CP1251 codepage, or their part, allowing the composition of a text in one of the languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet.\n> \n> 2  \n> If the entry is a type family, the font complement of each constituent style should be shown on a separate sheet.\n> \n> 3  \n> On other sheets examples of the potential use of the typeface should be shown. They should be reflective of the purpose and the special features of the design, and to display the typeface in the very best way possible. These specimens or their details may be later used in the catalogue of the winning entries, and the publications related to the competition.\n> \n> 4  \n> The examples may include, but are not limited to, headlines, short or long passages of text, sample pages or double-page spreads of books and periodicals, screen shots of monitors, tablets, smart phones, and more. For body text typefaces designed for print, a sample text setting in various font sizes, from 6 to 14 pt., is mandatory.\n\nPlease contact nick–at–shinntype.com for information about my typeface.\n\n"
