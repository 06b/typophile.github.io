However, I agree with Stephen that [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Fountain) is probably the _“most appropriate home”_ for your design. As an added bonus, if you do end up being published through Fountain, you will be represented through Veer [2] as well.\n\n[1] [http://www.veer.com/umbrella/](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111232733/http:/www.veer.com/umbrella/)  \n[2] [http://www.veer.com/fountain/](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111232733/http:/www.veer.com/fountain/)\n\n"
