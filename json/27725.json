Does anyone know who made those? Or more importantly, where I can get more of them from? Any leads would be much appreciated!\n\nAndrea\n\n",

Bother him a little, offer him some money perhaps :)\n\nIn addition, Typophile had a nice selection of buttons floating around and you may have seen the black and white \"I love helvetica\" and \"I hate helvetica,\" provided by Gary Huswit of the [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018023545/http:/www.helveticafilm.com/) documentary.\n\n"
