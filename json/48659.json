In this case, it feels like it was done by hand, before it ended up on a T-shirt. It could be the handiwork of an LA artist/art director, Jose Soto.\n\nIf it was indeed based on Sloop’s outlines (adding flourishes to an existing font) ... you could call it Customized, or you could call it a Type Treatment.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825150028im_/http:/typophile.com/files/todiefor_6120.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825150028im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sloop1_3460.jpg)\n\n"
