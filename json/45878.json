  "content": "Hello again,\n\nI would like to have your opinion of this poster I’ve made to post on my blog. The idea was to show how every little thing can make a difference.For that I counted every word used on the Kyoto Protocol text and created a way of showing the different proportions between all the letters used. When I’ll post this on my blog I will explain all the design process. The type used is Helvetica.\n\nWhat do you think of it? How would you improve it? I’d really appreciate to ear from you.\n\nThank you so much\n\nPedro Monteiro  \n [http://whatype.wordpress.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603213910/http:/whatype.wordpress.com/ \"http://whatype.wordpress.com/\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603213910im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kyoto_peq_5860.jpg)\n\n [‹ Seeking San Serif Suggestions](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603213910/http:/typophile.com/node/45409 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [So I am finishing a logo and the client wants to pay more. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603213910/http:/typophile.com/node/45789 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Or different languages into which the Kyoto Protocol has been translated. Just a thought. Probably doesn’t work with the assignment.\n\nAlso, the placement of the letters within the bars seems problematic to me, especially where letters with descenders sit next to thought without. I’m not sure how to resolve it though.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi guys, thanks for the feed back. As for the feeling it was a bit intended. I was trying to give it two levels of reading. The first is the literal one, the black blocks of proportion. But what I was really aiming for was a second level, the one where after you’ve been ’smashed’ by the simple and almost naked feel of the message you can go deeper and find out that even if the E block is so big, you couldn’t have the protocol if there weren’t any Z’s (35 only).\n\nSo, if you want, for as much as the signature from the USA is needed on the protocol (the USA are obviously the E) you still need us mere mortals and Z’s to have the protocol.\n\nEric, I agree with your point of view on the placement of the letters and has I didn’t want to use all caps (because it’s not in the feeling of a protocol text) it is really my own incapability to find a better way of dealing with it. And yes, it is a first of a series of work I want to do around this document but mostly because of being worried about global warming. I’ll be annoying you very soon.\n\nAll the best\n\nPedro Monteiro  \n [http://whatype.wordpress.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603213910/http:/whatype.wordpress.com/ \"http://whatype.wordpress.com/\")\n\n"

You will have to tell me about the pumpkin because I don’t get it :-D\n\nFor me, one can always improve on our work and that is achieved with opinions outside your own. That is why I’ve posted this. If it was your own project what would you do different?\n\nThank you so much\n\nPedro Monteiro  \n [http://whatype.wordpress.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603213910/http:/whatype.wordpress.com/ \"http://whatype.wordpress.com/\")\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Pedro,\n\nWell, I could say I am both. My family immigrated to Brazil in the sixties. Then returned to Portugal after becoming a EU member (1986). My great grand father, Cristovam Colombo da Silva, immigrated to Brazil in the beginning of the 20th century and worked forever in the railway (REFER EP). He too come back to Portugal when he retired. So, yes, I have the discoverer blood.\n\nAs for the pumpkin, it is that the halloween pumpkin is suppose to inspire chills, but ends up in candy for the kids. I guess the pumpkin symbol in the Kyoto project of yours would add a subliminal ’chill’, that is maybe more universal then black boxes. The boxes are ok, I just wanted to add a thought to you idea.\n\nSalud! E viva ó Sporting!\n\nAndré\n\n"
