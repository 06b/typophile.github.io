  "content": "Hello everybody,  \nI just discovered this lovely forum and I’m hoping you can help me with an issue.\n\nWe do packaging here using Adobe Illustrator v10 through to CS2 (more often than not CS2) on the Mac. A lot of our work is multilingual and often involves non-roman typefaces.\n\nI am looking to buy a really good set of Helvetica Cyrillic to help overcome some of our Cyrillic issues. I had this in mind:\n\n[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438768&grab\\_id=0&page\\_id=4...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014145533/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438768&grab_id=0&page_id=4731&query=helvetica%20cyrillic&SCOPE=Fonts \"http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=438768&grab\\_id=0&page\\_id=4731&query=helvetica%20cyrillic&SCOPE=Fonts\")\n\nI’d love to know if anybody has purchased this, what they think of it etc, whether there are any other comprehensive sets that people can recommend.\n\nMy other issue is that we have some files that have text that has been set in RusHelvetica-Bold. This font was lent to us by the originator but it seems to be corrupt. We were going to buy the Helvetica Russian family but it seems to be an ancient font and impossible to buy now. So this is another reason why I find myself looking for a good Cyrillic Helvetica. What I am concerned about is whether I will be able to select my text and switch from RusHelvetica-Bold to the new font without any issues. Can anybody advise me on this?\n\nThanks\n\n [‹ Python/robofab-help?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014145533/http:/typophile.com/node/33363 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [ClearType, in XP and Vista ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014145533/http:/typophile.com/node/33005 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

From what you say, I suspect that the font you have is \\_not\\_ Unicode-compliant. If that’s so, then you will have problems when using an Unicode-compliant font, like OpenType fonts tend to be. You can, however, make your text Unicode-savvy, by using this tool: [http://www.2cyr.com/decode/?lang=en](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014145533/http:/www.2cyr.com/decode/?lang=en \"http://www.2cyr.com/decode/?lang=en\")\n\n"
