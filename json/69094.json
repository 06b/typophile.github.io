Opti, for one, offered a version years later with the pointed top to the 'A' and downward vee of the 'M' - as well as that 'R' as an alternate.\n\nJeff Levine's [Hand Stamped JNL Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20100415211836/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/hand-stamped/) is a deliberately crude and inexact version of this.\n\n"
