So, here it goes:\n\nIs it just me, or fonts with names that include the sequence ’ding’ do not work properly in MS PowerPoint 2004 for Mac (v11.2)?\n\nI mean, I’ve generated and tested several dozen fonts, and I always arrive to the same result: In all the ’ding’ fonts, the access to characters outside the ASCII-area is completely messed up.\n\nIs PowerPoint treating these fonts as if they were **ding** bat fonts?\n\n",
