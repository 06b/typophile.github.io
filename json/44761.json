  "content": "Working on a film set in mid 50s, much of the typography on signage and logos was hand drawn, and in some cases we'll be doing that. But many times I find font designers are using those handwritten signs as inspiration for recent fonts that I could revise for a hand drawn look. Some I've found on myfonts, but what I am having trouble finding is the very thick curvy script fonts; so hard to create, I know, but there must be some out there. Any suggestions? Thanks. I'll attach an example.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DB logo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110515104228/http:/typophile.com/files/DB%20logo.jpg) | 6.3 KB |\n\n",
