  "content": "Hello Typophiles,\n\nAbsans was initially started as a classroom project while I was still in my 2nd year. It was a simple sans designed to understand the basic proportions and how the letters work together. But now I have made some changes to give the design a new look.\n\nI would really appreciate if you guys can spare some time and mark me some feedback on the design. I want this face to work in the text as well as in display settings.\n\nThanks a bunch,  \nSatya\n\n",

Just a few remarks/things I noticed:\n\n• Make vertex in 'M' the same as in 'V' or apex in 'A'\n\n• 'S' and 's' still leaning back\n\n• Lower the connection on stem 'r'\n\n• Liked first spur solution of 'G' better\n\n• 'Y' a bit wider\n\n• Make top 'J' as 'f'\n\n• Inkttrap solution for tail 'Q' ?\n\n• Bottom stem of 'd' and 'u' like 'a' or 'l' ?\n\n• Slash (/) too bold (backslash seems better)\n\n• '!' narower at bottom\n\n• Not sure about 'K' and 'k'\n\nThese (short) bullets read a bit harsh but they are just what I would do ... absolutely not binding :)\n\n"

I like most of the changes you made.\n\nHere's a new staccato unordered list :)\n\n'S' is better, but it seem to lean a tad forward now.  \n'G' is great.  \nI like the first 'J' better.  \n'M' is fine  \n'Q': tail maybe a bit the left?  \nI like the second 'd' (also 'u') most  \nNice improvement on 'C'!  \nThink second 'r' is better. Top maybe a bit lighter\n\nMaybe for K/k you could consider a solution like this very rough sketch:  \n(K should be broader.
