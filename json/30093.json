  "content": "Greetings all, just wanted to let you know that we've uploaded a few Quicktime video clips from <cite>Helvetica</cite> on the website:\n\n[www.helveticafilm.com/clips.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131105104605/http:/www.helveticafilm.com/clips.html)\n\nIt's tough to get the feel of the full documentary in a few minutes, but hopefully these will give you a taste. We've put up a snippet of our interview with Wim Crouwel, a nice piece of footage from the streets of Berlin that segues into part of Erik Spiekermann's profile, a few minutes with Experimental Jetset, and a clip featuring Neville Brody and Rick Poynor. Hope you enjoy them.\n\nThe full list of participants in the film now includes Matthew Carter, Massimo Vignelli, Wim Crouwel, Hermann Zapf, Erik Spiekermann, Neville Brody, Stefan Sagmeister, Michael Bierut, David Carson, Paula Scher, Jonathan Hoefler, Tobias Frere-Jones, Experimental Jetset, Michael C. Place, Norm, Pierre Miedinger, Alfred Hoffmann, Mike Parker, Bruno Steinert, Otmar Hoefer, Rick Poynor, Lars Müller, and more.\n\nWe'll have a few more clips, a proper trailer, and news on our 2007 world premiere and screening dates soon.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Gary\n\n",
