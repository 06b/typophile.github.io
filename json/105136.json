  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nI'm getting ready to start working as a freelance graphic designer but before i do i still need to get a few things in order, one of them is setting up my own website. I was wondering if maybe you guys could point me to some of the websites you think are very well executed and give a good straight forward overall view of the work and the designer.\n\nI'm not a web designer so i'm hoping some of your suggestion might lead to a few ideas on which direction i'd like to go with the website.\n\nThanks in advance !\n\n",

It's due for an update, which I'll be doing in Adobe Muse — a program I highly recommend for print designers who want an easy-to-understand, InDesign-like web design program.\n\n"

When you'll get more accustomed to web design, you can make your own from the very beginning.  \nSome samples:  \n [http://www.iliasmeletis.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110141/http:/www.iliasmeletis.net/ \"http://www.iliasmeletis.net/\")  \n [http://www.hiromuradesign.com/#/vi/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110141/http:/www.hiromuradesign.com/#/vi/ \"http://www.hiromuradesign.com/#/vi/\")  \n [http://www.ferhatcelik.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110141/http:/www.ferhatcelik.co.uk/ \"http://www.ferhatcelik.co.uk/\")  \n [http://www.redcreative.gr/en/work/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110141/http:/www.redcreative.gr/en/work/ \"http://www.redcreative.gr/en/work/\")  \n [http://www.mousegraphics.gr/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110141/http:/www.mousegraphics.gr/ \"http://www.mousegraphics.gr/\")  \n [http://www.clintonstringer.net/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117110141/http:/www.clintonstringer.net/index.html \"http://www.clintonstringer.net/index.html\").\n\nGood luck:)\n\n"
