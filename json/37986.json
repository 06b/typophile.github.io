  "content": "Thanks to Stephen Coles and the numerous requests from the international typophiles Fontshop.com has removed the redirect on their website to a deeper level of the site. So linking to the font won't bug the international users anymore.\n\nGreat work, people, thanks.\n\nThis is what Stewf wrote to [Ralf Hermann](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224084756/http:/www.typografie.info/typoforum/viewtopic.php?p=32551#32551):\n\n_Ralf, I'm pleased to say we've integrated new FontShop redirection behavior. You can now visit FontShop.com without being redirected until you want to purchase. I hope you like the change._\n\n**Yes, we do!**\n\n",
