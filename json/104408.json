Now I'm stumped by the punctuation.\n\nDoes anyone have any guide, tips or resources on designing these? I would especially like to know if there is any kind of logic, or best practices for the sizing, placement, spacing and so on of punctuation. A testing text would be nice too especially for the punctuation in use (English is my only language!),\n\nthanks,\n\n",

But your best bet is to check what other quality typefaces do, and then decide for yourself.\n\n"
