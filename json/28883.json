  "content": "Hi all,\n\nCan anyone make a recommendation. I am looking for a curvy, sold font. Something along the lines of Ronda but with a more rounded f character, if that makes sense, also not too keen on the e and the r. I quite like the font; Oh Sweet Pea, all though too over the top, I really like the g on TS Koblenz.\n\nIts for a font.\n\nAppreciate any recommendations, I really want to get a solid curvy font, similar to above. I am considering creating a custom font, well just the letters I need, I have done this one before, took me ages.\n\nThanks\n\n",
