Is there a term for referring to it? I see this treatment compiled in a lot of work that you might consider vintage/classic. I wanted to know if creating this effect is easy or something the designer would customize themselves (drawing each stroke)? I know of a similar technique but it doesn't render the same way as the specimens i see on aged labels, etc. I'm perfectly fine with treating the type letter by letter but, if there's another way, I'd like to learn.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
