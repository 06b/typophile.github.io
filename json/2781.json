The ultra all lowercase might look great, as the title is only 6 letters. It has 'edge' and is very stylish. It is so bold you could also do an outline and stick pictures in it.\n\n"

It was printed on a light bees wing book paper. Truly beautiful.   \n   \nSparkly can be a really good thing.   \n   \nWhen I am completed with the project I will send everything along to you. The bold is in question, Jim has redrawn or refined the bold. I am not sure what Lanston's status will be with that? The naming will be more self explanatory throughout. We have dropped the Monotype operators codes.   \n   \nIn otherwords, it will not be Albertan L, it will be Albertan Lining Figs.   \n   \nBut I no longer have your e-mail address. We changed web hosters, naturally loosing many e-mails. If you drop me a note, I think the Metropolitan is finished. I could send it along. At least I will try before I move.\n\n"
