Hairline seems too thin, while thin is too thick! so i'm looking for a new typeface altogether.\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\n[http://www.typotheque.com/fedra\\_sans\\_display](http://web.archive.org/web/20150221212143/http:/www.typotheque.com/fedra_sans_display \"http://www.typotheque.com/fedra\\_sans\\_display\")\n\n",

So I think you should be able to find exactly what you need there. And if you can't, contact Luc(as) (or, probably, Peter Bil'ak of Fedra Sans Display) and they could whip you up a custom weight (for a price).\n\n"
