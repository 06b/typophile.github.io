It's an integral part of the ancestry of the popular DIN Schriften fonts.   \n   \nAs for your question, well, Google is your pal:   \n   \nLinotype Font Lounge - [http://www.linotype.com/7-540-7/wilhelmpischner.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051410/http:/www.linotype.com/7-540-7/wilhelmpischner.html)   \n   \nKlingspor Museum - [http://www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Pischner/WPischner.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051410/http:/www.klingspor-museum.de/KlingsporKuenstler/Schriftdesigner/Pischner/WPischner.pdf)   \n   \nHistory of the Stempel foundry - [http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/stempel/stempelhistory.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051410/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/stempel/stempelhistory.html)\n\n"

      "content": "When you say 'typographers', do you mean type designers? There is a book called 'Rookledge's International Handbook of type Designers - A Biographical Directory' by Ron Eason & Sarah Rookledge. There is another one called 'Twentieth Century Type Designers' by Sebastian Carter. Both would be excellent resources if you want to know about type designers. Of course, these are not 'autobiographical', because they were not written by the designers, but I presumed that maybe your assignment didn't require more than biographical information. Your other course of action is to use [Designer links](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051410/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/index.html) at MyFonts.com, and to use Google to search for biographical information about well-known designers.\n\n"

On the MyFonts designers page they have [Jonathan Barnbrook](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518051410/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/barnbrook/jonathan/) with a bunch of links that would probably have information about him. When you look up a font in MyFonts and many other vendor sites, they often tell you when the font was first used. I think you are trying to sit back and take the lazy way out, and I'm done helping if you won't do any work.\n\n"
