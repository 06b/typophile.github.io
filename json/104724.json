And given the variety of international type conference options available these days (ATypI, TypeCon, TYPO, Ampersand, TypeTalks, ICTVC, Typography Day, Granshan, Kerning, oh and [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20140702221650/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3k5oY9AHHM)), how does one even chose what is worth attending?\n\nNew Yorkers may be familiar with The Rent is Too Damn High Party, a political party that has, since 2005, nominated Jimmy McMillan for mayor of New York City and governor of New York state. As its name implies, the party’s continued focus is on the impossibly high rental prices that fail to meet the demands of the city’s population.\n\nAre type conference fees too damn high? Despite the variety of events, price points and locations, like New York City’s rents, are there still enough affordable and accessible options to meet the demands of the ever-growing typophile population?\n\nCurrently petitioning to include McMillan on the 2013 mayoral ballot, [the Party’s website](http://web.archive.org/web/20140702221650/http:/www.rentistoodamnhigh.org/) makes its position pretty clear: _\\*\\*Rent Is Too Damn High There Is Nothing Else To Talk About. Absolutely \"NOTHING\".\\*\\*_\n\nPerhaps we could talk about some webfonts for its site but hey, I’m just a type nerd.\n\n",

Not only is paying for the equipment, its operators, and post-production substantial, but we've learned that proper lighting is also crucial to producing reasonable-quality video. There's an interesting balance to strike between what the live attendees see and what is adequate for video.\n\nOf course it's done all the time with other conferences... but it certainly wouldn't help lower the registration fees, and it would limit our choices of venue (because lighting for video requires the right kind of space).

      "content": "I could not agree more. I used to love attending these meetings – I went to TypeCon and ATypI regularly. They were professionally very useful, and academically interesting. I made a lot of friends this way - in fact, I met many of you folks this way.\n\nHowever, that was back when my employer could foot the bill. There is no way an independent designer, unless they are very wealthy, can afford to attend these meetings as they now exist. As long as these organizations insist on having the meetings in very expensive hotels in very expensive cities, it's going to remain impossible.\n\nI haven't gone in years. I just can't afford it. I could justify it, sure - but I can't afford thousands of dollars, even with a shared room, to take time off work.\n\nAs someone who has co-planned one of the largest annual regional academic meetings in the United States for more than 15 years, I know it's very easy to get swept up by big hotels and great locations and think that people won't come if you don't have it in those place. I know it's easy to let hotels woo you into having a meeting at a place with a $150 room, and spending $10-$15,000 on catering. I know!\n\nBut you can say NO, organizers. My client does every year - their (volunteer) staff puts together a larger meeting than Typecon or ATypI combined, with more than 200 sessions, for a registration cost between $55 and $75, and an annual membership cost of $35 to $55 (students vs. faculty, sliding scale in between for low-paid instructors, grad students, etc.). They don't sign a contract with a hotel unless they can keep the price down about $100 a room, and yet they still have meetings at Hiltons and nice Marriotts. You just have to play hardball. You can't charge sponsors buckets of cash AND charge attendees as well; one or the other.\n\nIf you encourage a culture of participation, then you end up with a much bigger group of volunteers to put these things together. It does work if it's part of the culture. I think that's why it hasn't so far in our trade: that culture just doesn't really exist yet. Maybe someday it will, and these meetings will again be affordable to everyone, and we can bring in the students and the rest of us without deep pockets again.\n\n"

Instead of making a journal or magazine part of a giveaway for attendees, make it instead a tool to make money.\n\nWe have a lot of smart people, good writers, historians and others in our trade.

Thankfully there are some other initiatives providing a day or 3 for a sub €100, which keep my ability to meet up with the type world afloat.\n\nStill, having almost triple the costs of an academic conference is quite weird, something must be off.\n\nPerhaps I should try to offer sleeping accommodation, breakfast and dinner ;)\n\n"

In fact, this last year I purchased a ticket specifically to have access to the videos because the cost of attending was due more to the travel, accommodations, and time off from work expense than the conference itself. Again, these are the same limitations that keep me from attending TypeCon.\n\nAs far as the cost for video production, I point to Creative Mornings and what that team has been able to do. The ability to view past meetings also addresses another issue mentioned here which is how to keep these conferences feeling neighborly. If people are able to watch the processions without attending and paying the cost associated with travel, then they would be encouraged people to do so. In addition, if you charge people for only video access, then you should be able to keep that cost from impacting the regular attendee cost, though this assumes a high enough demand for such a product.\n\n"
