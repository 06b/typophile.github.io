      "content": "You should study the discographies of metal bands in the 1970s, in particular the album covers, to see when and where the trope emerged.  \nThe seminal bands did not use blackletter until the early ’70s.  \nThe style was generally more glam than goth at ﬁrst.  \nA lot of the gothic subsequently came from the punk ethos, eg the Damned (Dave Vanian).  \nMötorhead’s look came more out of the British rocker tradition.  \nHawkwind (psychedelic rock?)—from which Lemmy was ﬁred—was an early adopter of blackletter.\n\nThis from 1972 has a strong Art Deco influence (popular retro at the time), but there’s a bit of darkness and the lettering leaning towards blackletter:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/220px-Doremi_Fasol_Latido_-_Hawkwind_6028.jpg)\n\nCSNY had blackletter on their 1970 _Déjà vu_ album, but the connotation was quite different from gothic.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CSNY_5243.png)\n\nhere’s an early one, Rainbow’s Rising, 1976\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Unknown_4747.jpeg)\n\nEarliest?

It would be interesting founding that information.\n\nBy the way, like the example of CSNY, another band: The Allman Brothers used blackletters on their albums, with another connotation.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Allman-Brothers-Band-Back-Where-It-All-352980_3883.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "One of the first rock albums showing classic blackletters on its front and back covers was probably Jethro Tull's \"Aqualung\" (1971):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Aqualung_6011.jpg)\n  \n[The Fette Gotisch typeface (with a misplaced x instead on an r in Jethro) on the original vinyl release was replaced by Notre Dame in subsequent re-editions.]\n\nFor some reason, Ian Anderson decided to pack his \"bunch of songs\" inside an antique/medieval visual framework, an it was there that the blackletters played a role. Nothing to do with Jethro Tull being a \"Hard Rock\" or \"Heavy Metal\" band.\n\nIn 1976, Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (as noted in a previous post) and Judas Priest released \"Rising\" and \"Sad Wings of Destiny\":\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Raising-Sad_4297.png)\n  \nThese were true \"Hard Rock\" albums, but it is my impression that the choice of blackletters for the visual framework had to do with the epic/magical/medieval aspects of the music and the lyrics, rather than with the kind of music itself. In fact, Rainbow changed their logo a few years later for the release of \"Down to Earth\" (1979), and Judas Priest sticked to classic blackletters for just one more release (\"Sin After Sin\", 1977). In both cases, although the music remained great Hard Rock, the epic/magical/medieval themes were, for the most part, gone.\n\nHowever, after departing from Rainbow, shortly after their last \"blackletter logo\" release (\"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\", 1978), Ronnie James Dio's solo career was accompanied from the beginning to the end with classic blackletters:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141108102458im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dio_4504.png)\n  \nDio always sticked to epic/magical/medieval/fantastic themes for his masterful Hard Rock, an this is why, in my opinion, classic blackletters were always present in his releases as well as in his live shows.\n\nThese are just a few examples (many others could be found outside the Hard Rock realm) showing that classic blackletters in music, as well as in many other arts, have to do mainly with the subject being contained in it, and not so much with how this subject is expressed.\n\nThe modern trends concerning Black/Doom/Death/Gothic/... Metal, are just another story ...\n\n"

I would argue that blackletter came to metal for its Nazi connotations, although its mediæval quality is not out of keeping with other aspects of the genre. \n"

      "content": "This subject has come up before, though I can't locate the thread. Heavy-metal music burst on the scene in the US and UK in the 1960s and 70s, and the musicians and their fans were mostly children of the generation that fought in WWII.  \nBlackletter resembles Fraktur, which is commonly associated with the Third Reich (even though they officially banned its use in 1941). As Nick points out, it was the perfect branding for music that was meant to piss off your dad--the letterforms of the enemy he fought against in the War.  \nThat's not why they used blackletter on \"Aqualung.\" Side 2 of \"Aqualung\" is subtitled \"My God\" and consists of five songs that mock the hypocrisy of the institutional church, and I suspect that they used blackletter to evoke the look of Bibles and other church documents.\n\n"
