Being a (poorly-served) Chase customer, I have spent a lot of time on queue looking at their new promotional materials, all of which use a handsome sans serif which reminds me a great deal of Jeremy Tankard’s work. But the only thing vaguely like the new logo is the new logo. And I must say that I agree with that decision: your logo is your logo, and you shouldn’t try to “brand” every word you utter in your logotypeface.\n\n"
