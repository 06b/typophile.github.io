  "content": "Hello everyone,   \nthis is a work in progress I've done for a public university in brazil.   \n   \nThe original logo, created in 1927, had one main element: the fire. The council behind it established it as the \"knowledge fire\", the fire that burns eternally. Almost 80 years later the university wants a new logo but with the same concept. They want a stand alone, strong and simple symbol.   \n   \nAfter 2 months, this is where I am. The symbol is quite closed because it merges the national with the states flag, what represent literaly the name Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - Federal university of (the state) Minas Gerais. And subjectively keep the symbol fire really simple.   \n   \nI'm not happy with the type options and I'd appreciate your help and comments. Basically I've chosen glypha, franklin and corporate because the \"g\" creates a support for the symbol. Univers as an option is merely a practical issue. The name is easy to remember for those who will handle the quotidian of the logo: the 40000 people in academic community.   \n   \nLet me know your opinions and suggestions.   \nThank you all.   \n   \nHelder Araujo   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108002920im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22023.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Ok. Once again Thank you all for your sugestions.   \n   \nThis week we had a meeting and we decided to go back to the all UC option. That Upper-lowercase option was a try to avoid a plain vanilla word mark but then we figure it could bores after awhile.   \n   \nWe need a simple and timeless word mark but not ordinary.   \n   \nBOLD OR LIGHT: Well. The branding project includes several attachments to UFMG logo. Those will be faculties names, course, departments and events. The UFMG has to stand out from this second name.   \n   \nCOLORS: Navy Blue is the old logo's color. The council love it but they agreed with us that it's difficult to keep the same pantone in all prints. So our proposal is to use cyan as an option to yellow or red (our first proposals, both reproved). Cyan provides an easy reproduction in all medias and still could stand as the \"blue fire\".   \n   \nSLABS-SERIFS-MODERNS-HUMANIST-SANS?: As you see our option is going toward the sans, some overused sure, but neutral and nice. If we find a way to customize it a bit.   \nthe sans also represents a historical link to UFMG since they start to be developed at late 19th and early 20th century.   \n   \n[Some modern faces are really beautiful and work corporative branding but didn't fit (in our opinion) the UFMG glyphs]   \n   \nSO: THESE are the fonts we are working on, the black ones are ours handpicks. With akzidenz and avant garde we have try something different putting together U and F. What do you all think of that and also of the other fonts?   \n   \nReally thanks.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108002920im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22267.jpg)\n\n"
