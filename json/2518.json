  "content": "Hello   \n   \nI'm trying to develop a logo for freelance work, to be used initially on a business card, letterhead, etc. Maybe later on a website.   \nI would like to keep the mark type only.   \nMy name is Robert King.   \n   \nHere are four ideas. These are all in grayscale at this point... I will address color when I am closer to a final design.   \n   \nThe \"KD\" stands for \"King Design,\" although as you can see from the other options, I'm flexible about how my name is listed.   \n   \nI like the 1920s-looking faces, because I'm leaning towards a non-coporate image, but I tried a variety here to get some reactions.   \n   \nThe fonts are, in order: Adobe Garamond, Bitstream Clarendon Light, Toot Sweet and Bergling Fantasia, both by Nick Curtis.   \n   \nAny comments would be much appreciated.   \n   \nThanks,   \n   \nRob   \n   \n ![clarendon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019034711im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22932.jpg) ![garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019034711im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22933.jpg) ![toot sweet](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019034711im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22934.jpg) ![bergling](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019034711im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/22935.jpg)\n\n",
