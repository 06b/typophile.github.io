Together with Andron-Latin, Andron-English, Andron-Deutsch, Andron-ABC and other brothers and sisters it forms a unique set of specialized typefaces in a classical style.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102351im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_3_4197.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102351im_/http:/typophile.com/files/schild_Andron_Irisch_4_5266.png)\n\nAndron-Irish is a comprehensively furnished suite of 5 fonts. Now you can use Italics, Bold and small caps as with Latin, the usual way. A fancy extra is the middlecase font with uncial glyphs. It follows the proportions of the [Andron MC series](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102351/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/andron-mc/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102351im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_6_5582.png)\n\nOpentype features have been implemented to enable the easy use of alternative insular glyphs as well as to switch from modern orthography to the tradional one.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102351im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tschild_Andron_Irisch_8_6723.png)\n\nBest wishes for St Patrick’s day … !\n\n",
