It will be projected for a Craft magazine and I am looking for some good typefaces that I could use as a reference for my studying.  \nDo you have any suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance,\n\ncheers,\n\n",

      "content": "You are totally right, Hrant, I forgot to say that: the typeface is supposed to look elegant for big titles, like 48 pt size, for magazines of Arts & Crafts.  \nThe aims of my project have to do with unbracketed serifs, certain contrast, humanist axis and a x-height relatively small. At first, I will develop a regular weight and later, variations like bold and italic.  \nSo far, this is all I have.\n\nThanks again,\n\n"
