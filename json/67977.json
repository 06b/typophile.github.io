      "content": "You're right about artificially extending fonts. A good rule of thumb is to include a picture of a face (preferably yours) and scale it along with the font. As long as the face doesn't look distorted, you're probably OK. Usually you can scale between 95 - 105% without it being too noticeable.\n\nI can't really think of too many extended serifs. You might want to try Engravers Roman, Americana, Newtext, or even Copperplate Gothic, although none of them look like your sample. If you want to go for a slab serif, Hellenic Wide could do the trick. Also, Black/Extra Bold weights of serif fonts tend to be wider than their regular counterparts.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

Optically, higher contrast between verticals (thicks) and horizontals (thins) is usually okay, but reversing that contrast is a Bad Thing.\n\nWhile I don't like to squish or stretch type at all, my rule of thumb would be more like 95%-120% is the reasonably safe range.\n\nThe other special problem is the letter \"S,\" which just does not survive such manipulations very well. Depends a bit on the typeface, but....\n\nT\n\n"
