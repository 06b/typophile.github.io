  "content": "this post is more of a question, i suppose, of technique and purpose, than of a normal character set.\n\nwhich of the following samples do you like better? A, or B? my eye seems to glide over B better, so even though A is slightly more sophisticated in its 'curve bending', i think i like B better, with its more consistent color.\n\ncan anyone post a quick vote one way or the other?\n\nas for my earlier 'purpose' comment, please feel free to jump in and offer your thoughts: a pixel font such as this, is at its core, functional as opposed to decorative. as such, shouldn't i always design with readability in mind? that is to say, forego touches that i might personally like on a glyph level, in favor of flow once they are set into blocks?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [slim\\_question.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102947/http:/typophile.com/files/slim_question.gif) | 795 bytes |\n\n",
