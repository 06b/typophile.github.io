Our competitors will form a community where they will interact with each other, a judging panel, and the wider Changemakers network to expand their knowledge and improve their game. It’s a competition and a community in one aimed at creating opportunities for women to win.\n\nVisit [http://sportforchange.changemakers.net/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821085143/http:/sportforchange.changemakers.net/ \"http://sportforchange.changemakers.net/\")\n\n",
