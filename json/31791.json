Or 8, when you include rotated squares and triangles) and just a multiple of that number of different ways of arranging them. I'd say it's just part of the design and not the design, As long as the client doesn't come out looking like the completion across the street and the shapes relate to the company somehow, I don't think It's an issue.\n\n"
