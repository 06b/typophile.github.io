Here are some of my initial explorations where I have played around with an upper case and lower case G.  \nThe logo has to look sophisticated and feminine.

This reduces the letters to abstract shapes, gives a distant echo to the Coco Chanel logo, and integrates the two Gs in a way that is less forced and less \"clever\"; not to mention that it sort of resembles a bracelet or earring or some other fashionable ornamentation.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022114030im_/http:/typophile.com/files/GG_5904.jpg)\n\n"
