  "content": "I am currently working on setting a book, and wonder about a few typographic rules. The book is set in Norwegian, and I am not sure wheter specific rules apply to that specific language, however, any comment would be greatly appreciated. The question is, have the sentences been set with the right punctuation regarding the use of ellipsi and comma/period.   \n   \n� Ellipsis   \n�It's not that hard to notice �� he continous, �� just look at what you're wearing.� �Fifty.�� she whispered.   \n(Should there be a space between the ellipsis and the words in the first sentence, and should there be period after Fifty, which is really not a complete sentence?)   \n   \n� Comma/period   \n�The money.� he said.   \n(Should The money be followed by a period or a comma, such as �The money,� he said.)   \n   \nOystein\n\n",
