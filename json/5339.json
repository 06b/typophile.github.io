If you're lazy to read that, a good recommendation would be to check out [Fontalicious](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121105606/http:/www.fontalicious.com/super/fonts.html) which has some great retro-looking fonts. As for being typographically and historically accurate, perhaps someone like Mark S. can help you. Be careful how far you delve into accurate 70s type though, the results can be [frightening](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121105606/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24826.html?1075527026) to say the least (think flare).\n\n"
