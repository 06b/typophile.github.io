      "content": "The only downside that the book is printed with toner and not with the less reflective ink of book presses. I recently bought a book from amazon that was printed on demand. It was printed with ink not toner, but the scan was somewhere around the neighborhood of only 300-400dpi. More readable than the pdf on my screen of course, but janky nonetheless. If this machine uses pdfs with embedded fonts or 1200 dpi scans, I imagine customers will be happy. There should be a warning if the file you're printing from is less than 600 dpi.\n\nAlso, their home page has a new video for a \"2.0\" version: [www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDe\\_Jy4HnMY](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131084809/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDe_Jy4HnMY \"www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDe\\_Jy4HnMY\")\n\nThere are also other photos on the web of models in use, such as here:  \n [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6205386/Google-Espresso-pro...](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131084809/http:/www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6205386/Google-Espresso-promises-on-demand-book-printing.html \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/6205386/Google-Espresso-promises-on-demand-book-printing.html\")\n\nThe machine is ugly and not friendly at all, unlike those trashy but easy photo kiosks. There needs to be a counter/shelf under the keyboard (I'm looking at the telegraph article) for people to put their backpack/pocketbook and coffee on. Otherwise you feel like a tool standing in front of that thing.\n\n"

Many out-of-print books exist only as scans, often at 200 or 300 dpi, due to the size of a raster-based book file.\n\nI suspect that quality will vary widely. But if the book is something that has been out-of-print for 30 years, and you really want it, 200 dpi is better than nothing.\n\n"
