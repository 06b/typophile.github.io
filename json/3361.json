  "content": "[The Society of Typographic Aficionados](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.typesociety.org/) (SOTA) has announced that sales of the [September Eleven font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.myfonts.com/FontFamily21194.html) will end on the last day of this month. The font, a collaborative effort by 90 type designers from more than 20 countries, consists of nearly 100 question mark (?) glyphs expressing the designers' individual reactions to the tragic events of September 11, 2001.   \n   \nInspired by [Claes Källarsson's](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.fuelfonts.com/) Font Aid project benefiting [UNICEF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.unicef.org/), [Stuart Sandler](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.fontdiner.com/) initiated Font Aid II, with SOTA acting as the organizing body for the effort. The resulting font was made available to the public as \"charity-ware\" through donations accepted at [MyFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.myfonts.com/). The September Eleven font has raised over $5,000 to date, with all proceeds going to the [American Red Cross](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.americanredcross.com/) and its victim relief efforts.   \n   \nThe September Eleven font is available through September 30, 2002, for the donation of your choice at [MyFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.myfonts.com/). Although the font will no longer be available for download after that date, the September Eleven character showings and information will remain online in remembrance of the victims of terrorism throughout the world.   \n   \nFor more information, please visit the [SOTA website](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015075715/http:/www.typesociety.org/).\n\n",
