      "content": "Hi - I'm not sure if anyone has replied to your message. The font used by McLaren appears to be a custom font based on Red Roosters Elstron Light font. Their version is extended by 160% and appears to be squared off more than the original. Certainly the lower case \"c\" is special because Elstron is a caps-only font. I would guess that an agency redrew the font for McLaren, or perhaps RR supplied a custom version.  \nHope that this helps!\n\n"
