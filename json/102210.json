  "content": "I've added cyrillic characters to one of my opentype truetype fonts. This is my first time designing anything beyond Latin 1. How do I generate it in fontlab so that the cyrillic characters are included? These are the questions that I have:\n\nin Font Info\\>  \nEncoding and Unicode\\> I already have 1252 Latin 1 and Macintosh Character Set added here, I'm guessing add 1251 Cyrillic?  \nWhat about the Microsoft Character Set drop down menu? Do I leave that Western (Latin 1)?  \nWhat about the Mac script and FOND ID drop down menu? Do I leave that as Roman?\n\nin Font Info\\>  \nEncoding and Unicode\\> Custom [cmap] encodings\\> Do I add anything here?\n\nin Font Info\\>  \nEncoding and Unicode\\> Unicode Ranges\\> I'm guessing I check Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement and then Cyrillic?\n\nanything else I should change in the Font Info box?\n\nIn Options\\> Generating OpenType & TrueType\\> OpenType TT Encoding\\> Do I change anything here before generating the font to support Cyrillic?\n\nWhat about Options\\> General Options\\> Unicode and OpenType?  \nDo I change anything else in Options?\n\nWhen I start to generate the font:\n\nI go to Codepages mode and at the top left hand corner near the Font Info box, in the next box it says Unicode (I'm guessing I leave that) and then the next box should say? MacOS Roman or MS Windows 1252 Western or MacOS Cyrillic or MS Windows 1251 Cyrillic? I want the font to be Western but support Cyrillic.\n\nAnything else I should know before generating? Does anything change if the font is generated as Opentype Postscript?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n",

It is also possible to create your own keyboard layout with the free Microsoft Keyboard Tool (Win) or SIL Ukelele (Mac).\n\n"
