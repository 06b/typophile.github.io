Pagana comes from Latin language and is directly opposite to the word Christian, historically I mean.   \n   \nI'm a creative graphic designer, and i'm searching for a friend of mine, wich is also freelance in the field. He's trying to find this font for redability on Mac platform.   \n   \nPhilippe.\n\n"

      "content": "Ah, ah, fine answer. But the right word is paganus. It means peasant. In french we have a word that comes directly from paganus : paganisme. It may reference to the firsts times of the Christian era : the firsts christians use that word to describe the peasants who still idolizing olds gods. 'Historically' may be used here in a subtle degree : the world have billions and billions of differents significances of history vision. In fact there exists no word to opposite to paganisme.   \n   \nMy mother language is french, and if you know it, french is full of fines subtleties. I opposite the word ï¿½paganisme' to 'christianisme' because it is the only one who have a sense from our vision of history.   \n   \nThe last thing you may wait is that nobody knows the right birthdate of Jesus-Christ, even the bests historians.   \n   \nFriendly,   \n   \nPhilippe.\n\n"
