Any suggestions?\n\nI'm also looking for a font that would go well with Foundry Gridnik - I've tried several different things but haven't found the right typeface yet. Any suggestions? This is for a logo.\n\n",

We'll be using Foundry Gridnik for titles, and we've decided that we need to stick with a sans serif for the body text. I'd appreciate any help you guys could give me...\n\n"
