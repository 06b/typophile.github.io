It would give the user the cue that it sits between the other two.  \nI think the word \"Regular\" is the toad though. It is looked at by software as the basic style.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

These weights and weight names seem to have been common in Germany and used in other sanserifs too (Erbar, Elegant Grotesk, Super Grotesk).  \nFutura Buch(schrift) [book] was added inbetween Mager and Halbfett. (Similarly, a Normal was added to Erbar.) Maybe it is safe to say that the Buch is neither a thinner nor a fatter version of any regular because there <cite>was no</cite> such Regular before, rather, the Buch <cite>is</cite> the missing Regular.\n\n(German) weight names then and now differ, and it's not possible to translate them directly.\\* It seems that these new sanserifs required rethinking of weights -- weight names, number of weights, relation of weights -- which was not an issue in earlier serif types.\n\n\\* Interestingly, Syntax's weights are called Mager and Halbfett, and a specimen (1968?) translates Mager as Regular, and Halbfett as Bold.\n\nBut this isn't much related to Nick's original question any more ...\n\n[Yes, 'Grad' is size.]\n\n"

The ‘Book’ weight should come _after_ the ‘Regular’ weight in my opinion, like the ‘Regular’ of Monotype’s [Bembo Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20150101203901/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=664568) is an emboldened version of Monotype’s [Bembo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150101203901/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=165060)’s ‘Regular’ weight.\n\nEspecially when the transition took place from (hot) metal to photo composing there was a shift in weight, and this effect was even more emphasized by the (sometimes [too] rapid) conversion to digital type. Also the fact that single masters were used for the production of text and display sizes made matters worse. What is considered to be ‘Regular’ in our time is a gradation lighter than what was used as ‘Regular’ in the times of foundry- and hot-metal type. The ‘Book’ weight offers the option to add a slightly heavier weight for relatively small point sizes, hence its name.\n\nSo, I would never replace the ‘Regular’ weight by ‘Medium’ (which is in my opinion a synonym for ‘Semi-bold’, i.e. in between ‘Regular’ and ‘Bold’), and for the DTL Library I use therefore:\n\n[...]  \nLight (300)  \nRegular (400)  \nBook (500)  \nMedium (600)  \nBold (700)  \n[...]\n\nFEB\n\n"
