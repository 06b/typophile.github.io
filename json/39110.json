  "content": "I’ve always been interested to see how (type) designers succeed in incorporating historical models in contemporary graphic design. Case in point, uncial typefaces do nothing for me, but the solution Janno Hahn came up with is very interesting and beautifully designed (yes, the outlines are indeed a bit rugged as they were truly hand drawn). As [David](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830095101/http:/www.typographer.org/) puts it: _“It really is lovely to see such letterforms being updated and used in a modern context, (...)”._\n\nYou can see it in [my Unzipped blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830095101/http:/www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=235), complete with sketches and production images. I’m curious to find out what some of you think of it.\n\n [‹ Portuguese National Library in digital](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830095101/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39114 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Helvetica neutral? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080830095101/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38975 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

And when we explore those old letterforms we get a great new perspective on the letters we use every day now. Or at least I do, and but I’ve been practicing my uncials a lot lately.\n\n"
