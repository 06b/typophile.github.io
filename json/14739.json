  "content": "Hello Everybody,\n\nSince it’s my first post here I hope am in the right section.\n\nI was wondering what size should be my document in illustrator when you design a glyph so when you take it to FontLab it is proportional to the rest of the glyphs that are already there (Having started from a already existing font).\n\nMy first research made me use the UPM and set it to 1000 and then my illustrator file was set in points to 1000 by 1250 pt.  \nThen i had to see the descenders size and set guides in illustrator to draw my glyph there but then I stopped.\n\nI have no idea what size should my glyph be because even when i have the guides drawn and all i still have missing values.  \nI also checked the do not scale when importing .eps\n\nThats about all i know till now about importing from illustrator.  \nIf anyone can explain to me the logic behind the whole process and how to do it in the future without having to memorize without knowing the why’s behind every step.\n\nThanks everyone.  \nTyler.\n\n [‹ made font w/typetool](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007191530/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14793 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [postscript and printing questions ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007191530/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14752 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Although I don’t have access to or own Font Lab so my efforts are purely for self satisfaction or lack there of ;). I’m gonna go put all my glyphs in diff files like it seems you’re supposed to.\n\n"
