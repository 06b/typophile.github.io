It just seems so unnecessarily unique.\n\nDoes this belong to a family to which any of you are familiar, or is this some custom thing where someone thought they were being crafty (and completely spoiling the counter on the three)?\n\nThanks in advance...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706105741im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/8083_3997.png)\n\n [‹ New Computer, and Now I Don't Have/Know the Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706105741/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45078 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [From Frieze magazine ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706105741/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45063 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
