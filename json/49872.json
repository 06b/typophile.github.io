David, you seemed to defend Dr. Chromsky by asserting that there is no simple rule, only chain reactions.\n\n===\n\nMany people believe mistakenly that the two-day High Holiday of Rosh Hashana is in a similar theme as of the other holidays in this season: remorse for past short-comings, and a firm resolve for a better future; blessing for a good and sweet year; a time to get closer to G-d; and happiness for the Torah.\n\nActually, Rosh Hashana stands apart, as it is not self-centered, and having to do mainly with us. Rather, the focus of Rosh Hashana is only upon G-d's role as king of the universe and every single living being in it.\n\nIn that way, Rosh Hashana is a universal holiday, which affects all humanity - perhaps, more than any other holiday (although many people point to Chanukah for its universal message of religious freedom).\n\nThe sealing of ones fate, so to speak, is about three weeks later, on Hoshana Raba. According to Chassidic understanding, based upon the teachings of Jewish mysticism, if one is not satisfied with the outxcome of G-d's judgement, one still has the opportunity to \"turn over the cart\" and earn remarkable blessings by dancing excitedly on Simchat Torah, as is the custom of Lubavitchers.

Rather, I was referring to itsusage in modern terms, as the end of גלות, the 2,000 year old exile of the Jewish people, known as the גולה, the diaspora. By inserting an aleph, א, into the word, גולה, between the gimmel and the vov, the results are: גאולה, redemption.\n\nThis was in continuation to my quotation from the book, \"Letters of Light\", which attributes Divine significance to the meaning of an aleph.\n\nOur discussion was parenthetical.\n\nWhy is a vov included in the spelling of \"גאולה\", and not without a vov, like the Biblical spelling: \"גְּאֻלָּה\"?\n\nOne answer can be like David's pointing to the habit to drop the vov or yud in words spelled with nikkud, and their insertion when words are spelled without nikkud.\n\nI would like to suggest that here too the reason of inserting the vov is because of a lofty reason.\n\nThe Biblical term, \"גְּאֻלָּה\", is different in its usage than \"גאולה\", which refers to end of \"גלות\", or the \"גולה\". A vov refers to the concept in Jewish mysticism of \"hamshachah\", a drawing down from Above to below, or how G-d illuminates this world.\n\nIf so, you might ask, isn't there also a vov in \"גולה\"?\n\nThe basic Chassidic belief from the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov is that even during this time of \"גלות\", exile, G-d is with us in an open and revealed way.\n\nWe say this in Psalm 23:4-:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414065532im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ps_23_4_4198.jpg)\n\n.  \nChapter 23:4  \n...ki atah eemahdee... for You are with me...\n\nAtah, You refers to G-d directly, His very essence;  \neemahdee, are with me refers to an essential relationship.\n\nThis shows that G-d's presense is not normally hidden, but enjoins a person, even in times of trouble.\n\n"

We know for a fact that this mediaeval pronunciation did not perfectly match the ancient pronunciation, because of those places in the text where the vowels do not match neatly the number of consonants, the most famous example being the vocalisation of YRShLM as if it were YRShLYM. As I wrote in one of the other threads, vowels are the most fluid aspect of language, both in terms of individual pronunciation and in terms of regional and historical variation. A vowel is a movement of air through the throat and mouth, and as such is much less precise than a consonant, which is a restriction or stoppage of air at a specific point in the throat or mouth. I remember reading some time ago about a linguistic professor who had trained himself to perfectly produce cardinal vowel sounds according to the open/closed, front/medial/back analysis of vowel sounds, but this was remarkable exactly because this is not how people normally talk.\n\n"

And I assume the ancient Torah scroll, I think one of the oldest, is similarly 'living' proof of one of Masoretic texts.\n\nI know that every Purim holiday, when we recite this passage from the Sefer Torah scroll, we \"read\" both versions out loud, even if only one version is written there.\n\nAbout the wildcard searches, I will discuss with you by email what I have in mind. Actually, I want to use this feature in a few different ways, as we will discuss.\n\n===\n\nIn Michel's example, this is a strong dagesh, because most gimmels which follow a vowel do not have a dagesh. Usually, only a gimmel which begins a verse has a dagesh. Some gimmels that begin a verse do not have a dagesh.\n\nWhat is a gimmel without a dagesh which begins a verse called?\n\n===\n\nOn Rosh Hashana, as I recited in the prayerbook the holiday prayers, I noticed the appearance of the gimmel a lot, whether it had a dagesh or not, and whether it followed a vowel or not.\n\nFirst, I noticed that in general the gimmel appeared with much less frequency that most other letters. Is this why its form is less significant (i.e. more narrow)? :)\n\nSecond, when any noun followed after a \"hei ha-ye-di-ah\", a hei with a patach (eg. the xxxx), the first letter has a dagesh. Hence, even if the gimmel follows after a vowel, in this case it has a dagesh, and is not necessarily a strong dagesh.\n\nIn this second example, what is this dagesh called?\n\n"
