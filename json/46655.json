I have seen a lot of answers on the web to which font is used in the Benjamin Button promo material but don't think it is solved in any of them. Not sure if this is because the typeface keeps getting changed over time or what ...\n\nAttached is the font I'm interested in. Definitely not Minion. Kennerley looks close but has 3 terminals on the upper case W, whereas the BB font has 4. Also Kennerley italic has circular dots on the i and j, whereas this one has diamonds. The leading swashes on the v and w (italic) also don't match.\n\nThanks in advance if anyone can identify it!\n\nEd\n\n"
