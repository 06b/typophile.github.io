  "content": "You could use the shape from the bottom of the q to make the i and j have dots (I would get rid of it from the q).   \n   \nThe y could be just like the g except having a vertical cut out of the top.   \n   \nThe f is quite topheavy. For the k you could use vertical cuts next to the vertical stroke and one horizontal cut on the right side.   \n   \nJust a few ideas for ya.\n\n",
