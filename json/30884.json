  "content": "I'm looking for a symbol that would indicate \"extra weight,\" like a scale. But it needs to be a font and not a graphic. I have searched the Web extensively and haven't found anything. Does anyone know of such a thing? Someone on another site told me to look at the Signs Two font, but I couldn't see anything that fit that description. It seems crazy that with all these dingbats out there, a scale is hard to find (I did find the scales of justice, but that's not what I need.) Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

I always found the predecessor to [ABZ – More Alphabets and Other Signs](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223160014/http:/www.redstonepress.co.uk/abz.html) which was called 101 Alphabets and Other Signs very useful. But this is a symbolic, not typographic train of thought; further research for signs & symbols [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223160014/http:/www.amazon.co.uk/Dictionaries-of-Signs-and-Symbols/lm/3KJPPE6TOZJQL/ref=cm_lm_dtpa_fvlm_cfa_1/202-2667617-3758266)\n\nAlternatively you could set +lbs or +kg (depending where you are) in any font and have done with it.\n\n"
