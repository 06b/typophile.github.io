  "content": "Jeremy:   \n   \nThe only suggestions that come to my mind are to check the library &/or web under \"Superman\", \"comic books\" or \"DC Comics\"; check DC Comics' website ( [http://dccomics.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803090654/http:/dccomics.com/)); or contact DC Comics directly in New York City. A trip to your local comic book store might be fun and productive, too.   \n   \nI know that his \"S\" symbol has evolved considerably since its debut.   \n   \nGood luck! Sounds like a fun project.   \n   \nIt might be fun to start a thread discussing the impact of comic books (and other vernacular, primitive and bourgois forms of illustration -- and I use those terms respectfully in the artistic sense ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803090654im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) ) on modern typography. Cartooning, grafitti, folk art and craft and the like could all be on-topic....   \n   \nDavid\n\n",
