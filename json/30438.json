But below are the proper responses I wanted to make. :)  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTiff: Thanks for remembering! ;)\n\nChris: 21 HA! Yeah, I just bought my first beer! I bow before the Punmaster! But here's my attempt...Steve McQueen is certainly giving me a \"chili reception.\" (Might have to do some research on that one.) ;)\n\nDan: I apologize for the food that night. The beer is much better. If only they could find away to make that in sandwich form. Mmmmm...beer sandwich. I should also note that I have shaved my head and have about as much hair as Chris and Yves! But, um...I'm more like _Bald Extended_. :)\n\nYves: Actually...I enjoy having a birthday so close to New Year's. Christmas...then New Year's, then birthday! It's like a 3 week celebration!\n\nCarl: I'm gonna do it up nice next year I hope you can show up, even though I missed your Beorcana shindig. :( Thanks for the sample, BTW! :)\n\nNorbert: Sure, Norbert sure. :p You're still not off the hook yet for disappearing on us! :)\n\nSatya: Thank you for the very cool, creative greeting.\n\nRicardo: I'll be working on Bizzle-Chizzle again now that the celebrations and the visitin' with the relatives is over. I would like to see it released by this summer at the latest.\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n"
