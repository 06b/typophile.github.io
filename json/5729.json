  "content": "Hi there,   \n   \nI am trying to identify the font that was used for the poster artwork of \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\".   \n   \nMy sample is pretty big, so I'll just link to it:   \n [Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111091200/http:/www.adventurefan.de/birdseed/lxg_font.jpg)   \n   \nI am not sure, but I think the white font and the greenish font are the same. However, the white font uses capital letters only for the 'L' in 'League', the 'E' in 'Extraordinary' and the 'G' in Gentlemen whereas the green font is all in captions.   \nThus I'd assume that only capital letters have those spikes.   \n   \nIn case I am wrong and it is indeed two different fonts that were used, then I'd be very grateful to find out both font types.   \n   \nThanks for your help,   \nChris\n\n",
