Peter Saville has various fonts used for his New Order album sleeves up for download on his site.  \nI can't imagine these are anything more than slight tweaks to existing faces. There's no EULA or anything, and I can't find much more info about it.  \nJust curious, i guess...\n\n",

      "content": "I'd stay away from those fonts if I were you. Saville wasn't really much of a font guy anyway. Most of what is on that page is incorrect or poorly wrought.\n\nIn the case of the Closer font, it is both. That's not the font. And in fact, that's not even the proper name of that font that has been modified. They didn't even bother changing the copyright.\n\nI'm still in the process of digitizing the Closer font, see [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018133935/http:/typophile.com/node/41650).\n\n"

Just found [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018133935/http:/typophile.com/node/4549) older thread with Brett Wickens discussing some of his work on Crouwel's New Alphabet. From what I gather that site must be some sort of fan site.\n\n[edit]  \nJust got a chance to catch up on reading your Closer thread. It looks great! How's progress going?\n\n"
