In most cases I have tried to use the original names of the font designs in my Guides, if I have a way to confirm them. Usually if I know the name of the designer, or get it from an actual foundry, or see it in a font book, then I feel confident about the authenticity of the font name.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
