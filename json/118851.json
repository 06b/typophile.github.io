You have the page numbers.  \nPlease note that the old specimen books did not usually include a large scale character set. Rather they offered a presentation of phrases in various sizes.  \nThe 1923 ATF book was one of the earliest to offer a character set, but only at a smaller scale. This is what is shown in the book:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054457im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915_6357.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054457im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915B_3556.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054457im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915C_5235.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054457im_/http:/typophile.com/files/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915D_5458.jpg)\n  \nDon\n\n"
