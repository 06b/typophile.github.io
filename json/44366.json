I am currently trying to clean up the font, removing overlapping points etc, and I have noticed there are lots of grey arrows on some glyphs. (See image)\n\nCan somebody tell me what this means and what I should do about it.\n\nAlso is there a way of removing single points or incomplete paths automatically?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [grey arrows.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828113124/http:/typophile.com/files/grey%20arrows.jpg) | 96.79 KB |\n\n [‹ Indesign: How do I discard overset text](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828113124/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44629 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Windows ignoring unicode (sub)range ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828113124/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44602 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But be careful if you have delicate shapes – they can be distorted or become something you didnt expect.\n\nUnder the meny “Contour” you have different choices that has to do with the curves and to clean them up, correct etc.\n\nTry them a little and you’ll see what they do.\n\n"

      "content": "Do you mean single points that are not part of the vector? In that case, you can select the glyph parts with the magic wand and then cut them out (. Then delete all points that are left in the glyph box (as they are not part of the glyph). Then just paste the glyph back.\n\nOpen countours you can close with the command “close open countours” I guess. I always do this manually, but I have never worked with a traced letter, maybe there is a lot of extra points then?\n\n"
