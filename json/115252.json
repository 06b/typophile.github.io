  "content": "Hi Everyone,  \nI'm facing a little problem here and thought maybe you could help:  \nI've recieved an inDesign document created on a mac, in which DIN Black and DIN Bold are used.  \nAs I use a PC at work I needed to buy those two fonts, so I bought FF DIN Bold and Black which seemed to be the reference, and installed them.  \nBut when I opened the inDesign document, it kept saying the DIN Bold and Black fonts were missing.  \nIs there any way to make it understand it's the fonts I bought ?  \nI think the problem is the name ?\n\nThanks a lot to take the time to read my request,\n\nHave a good day !\n\nJon\n\n",

      "content": "This does seem like a font name issue since you have a different version of DIN. In InDesign, if you go to Type \\> Find Font... it will show you all the fonts in your document. Choose the font you want to replace, then select a replacement under the Replace With area of the dialog.\n\nI would suggest comparing the two documents after replacing the font. Different versions of the same font could have varying metrics, and the formatting may change.\n\n"
