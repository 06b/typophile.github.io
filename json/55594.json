I'm entirely new to print design, have mostly done web design before. I designed the vcard in CMYK mode in Photoshop so I reckon it should come out ok on paper?\n\n[Webdesign Hamburg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725154440/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n"

Print can be a hassle sometimes because  \nwhat you see on the screen is not what you will get on paper.  \nGood look!\n\nGuerrizmo+Design  \nNo man is an island unto himself\\_John Donne\n\n"
