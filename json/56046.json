What would prove otherwise is to see more lettering in the same style, where we can see repeats of the same letters.\n\nIf you are looking for commercial alternatives, you might check out the scripts of [Rob Leuschke](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326051126/http:/new.myfonts.com/search/leuschke/) (at MyFonts), or the work of [Alejandro Paul at Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326051126/http:/www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Alejandro%20Paul&producttype=TYP&resulttab=vr&category=Type), or Sudtipos.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

If so, it must be something that he does not sell through MyFonts. I just checked [his own site](http://web.archive.org/web/20090326051126/http:/www.typesetit.com/enter.html) and didn’t see this either, so it’s a mystery to me. He may have drawn a custom font for the stationer where you saw these samples.\n\nYou could write to him and ask. I’ve done this before and he responded.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
