For generations, publishing technology has left us with simplified Naskh as the most visually adapted style for mass production and mass consumption. We don't 'see' anymore anything outside of that established style as 'standard' for publication. If we go outside of its boundaries, we are venturing in graphics and not the functionality of the text.  \nThis is partly for the merits of simplified Naskh, and partly because, for generations, the technology limitations didn't leave use much other choice.  \nNow the technology is gradually giving us back what it has taken away from us for generations and although the outcome of this new capabilities is unknown to me, but I think it will certainly have a major impact -not quickly- in what we'd perceive as 'standard look' of a published text.  \nThe graphic side also can fly from here on.

That's why I asked about Saad's simplified and often simmetrical experimental forms, and at the same time about a possible intermixed use of Naskh and black Kufic letters.  \nI see the beauty of Qur'an pages is often obtained by harmony of tone, while I tend to predilige harmony of contrast, and since in Latin we have always had different script forms mixed since the early middle ages (carolingian minuscule, capitals, and many later cursives), I wondered how this variedty could apply with Arabic letters and page layouts.\n\nAre you a native Arabic or an Arabic user of adoption?

I can read -badly- an Arabic text and I vaguely understand few words of it because Arabic language -along Qur'an- had a great presence in our language. But I am a native Arabic \\*script\\* user not native Arabic. If by 'adoption' you mean in the historic sense, yes Persian language uses Arabic script by adoption. But I personally didn't adopt it. I grew with it and lived with it.  \nBut this is an interesting point because the impact of new technology will be more pronounced in non Arabic languages of Arabic script. I don't know how far the change of 'established look' of published material in Arabic language can go from what it is now. Because the handwriting of Arabs is not essentially very far from it. This is not the case with handwriting of Persians, Pakistanis (who have never adopted Naskh for their mass consumption) and basically most areas to the east of Iraq.  \nI'm not knowledgable in traditionally established calligraphic styles but I can easily see that mix and match of different styles can happen.

I use the term 'script' as it is used by Unicode in defining a writing system covering a number of languages. By this definition, Italian is part of 'Roman script' as English is, and Persian, Urdu and Arabic are part of 'Arabic script'.\n\nPersians adopted Naskh exclusively. Because up until now -and even now- Nasta'liq could not be produced by machinery. When it comes to poetry, the hand work of calligraphers in Nasta'liq was occasionally used in school books and literary publications. There is now some speciality graphic applications that do Nasta'liq.  \nPakistanis were more persistent in using the hand work in their publications (for Urdu Nasta'liq) and even now, have put more effort in producing fonts of Nasta'liq for mass consumption.

The Persians had even used specific script styles to differentiate between society classes. Under Islam the Arabs quickly established the Early Kufi style to emphasize their new identity.

But nonetheless, later on, black became also the default dressing color for the catholic clergy.  \nAlso, most things pertaining to German culture became involved in Nazism, but continued to exist after the war (the interest in occultism and the [Ahnenerbe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414233806/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe), for example).
