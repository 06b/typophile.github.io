Any suggestions?\n\n [‹ Do you live in Athens or Barcelona?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013033538/http:/typophile.com/node/45343 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Initial Drop Cap with Slant ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013033538/http:/typophile.com/node/45353 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Seems like it would be a good idea to de-emphasize the physical aggression connotations of his Marine Corps background (as ex-Army myself, that’s definitely not a gratuitous swipe at the military), and transfer the idea of ’fight’ to a more intellectual battleground — reasoning together instead of confrontation, that kind of thing.\n\n"
