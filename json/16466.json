  "content": "The Schule für Gestaltung (School for Design) Basel is located in the north-west of Switzerland. It has a rich history in typographic education. Teachers like Jan Tschichold, Emil Ruder, Armin Hoffman and Wolfgang Weingart were instrumental in making this school a center for modernist typography and education. The Vorkurs (foundation year) is still unique in it's very thorough examination of cross discipline basics following the Bauhaus methods.\n\nThe SfG has 270 full time students and the public courses are visited by over 1000 participants every year. The [summer school](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041334/http:/basics.sfgbasel.ch/) offers an intensive three week study of typographic basics.\n\n[www.sfgbasel.ch](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425041334/http:/www.sfgbasel.ch/)\n\n",
