      "content": "The beginning and end are not problems. Tschi is pronounced like chi in ’chicken’, and ’old’ as normal. The middle ’ch’ in ’Tschichold’ is, however, a problem for English speakers. It is properly pronounced like the ’ch’ in ’J.S. Bach’. This is the gutteral h, a sound not normal in English. I have heard English use the English ’sh’ sound instead.\n\nSo if you can manage to say the composer ’Bach’ correctly, then you can go for: ’chi-CHold’, with the ’CH’ the german gutteral h. Or if you want to Anglicise it it—which is perfectly OK, I think—it is ’Chi-shold’.\n\nedit: I guess the natural way to Americanize it is ’chickold’, but I think ’chishold’ is a bit nicer and closer to the German.\n\n"

The officially correct pronunciation of li and le as palatalized is already frequently perceived as marked (either as a trait of middle and eastern dialect, or as a feature of language zealots). (A similar tendency occurs in yeista Spanish, where however the palatal ll is pronounced like English j instead of λ.)\n\n"
