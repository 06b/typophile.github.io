I particularly enjoy the efficient use of space and the sturdy lachrymal terminals. (’Georgia’ for print???)\n\nMyFonts’s Jan Middendorp interviewed the ’MAN’ for the their February newsletter. Very well done.

I wonder who the other TDC winners are. Any inside info???\n\nPS 2... Is it just me? because the TDC website is ironically one of the ugliest websites ever! They gray on gray color scheme is dated, poor/low res sample showings, pain in the you-know-what navigation, and generally speaking the entire site does not really befit an organization who’s aim is to highlight the best in typography.\n\n [‹ Best way to purchase the Fontshop \"Best 100\" typefaces?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007194323/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32304 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Book Design Question ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007194323/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31888 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
