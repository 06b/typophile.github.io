  "content": "You know those single-page specimens the kool kidz at foundries gin up to exhibit many variants of a typeface family on the same page? Each line tells a little story and uses its own variation, as seen on the left-hand page of the illustration for [<cite>David</cite> (“Fools!”) <cite>Berlow Type Specimens</cite>](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013133242/http:/www.fontbureau.com/books/dbspecimens \"Book downloadable at Font Bureau\").\n\nBut sometimes all the lines put together tell a _big_ story. I have a dim racial memory that one of our number used the lyrics of Duran Duran’s “The Reflex”&nbsp;in exactly this way. False-memory syndrome? If not, who did it? Don’t leave me answered with a question mark here.\n\n",
