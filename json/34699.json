I am redesigning my menu and marketing materials and I am looking for a contemporary font for use in marketing materials. Our marketing materials are understated and classic if that helps at all and I’d like to find something distinctive.\n\nAny and all suggestions would be appreciated. I consider myself skilled at putting together some reasonable layouts and copywriting but I’m not confident enough in my ability to select the best font.\n\nThanks,\n\nBryan\n\n [‹ Josef Hoffman / Wiener Werkstatte fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825142020/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35033 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Condensed Sans Serif w/ Personality ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825142020/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34912 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Is it catering to the money that is out there? What type of fare? What price range? Who are they trying to attract.\n\nAh, so many questions go into play before one picks out what would best marry the “product”....\n\nP.S. If it is just for the menu - I’d try to find a serif font that had a bold and an italic counterpart. I keep redesigning menus here, because the original designers didn’t take into consideration - the 1) lighting of the restaurant and 2) the eyes of the customers.\n\nI just did an “upscale” seafood restaurant myself - they owners insisted on Caslon Antique for all their menu choices - but we gave the customers - Caslon Book for reading purposes...\n\nGood luck with the menu. There is more work involved then most are aware. Especially when you are all finished and the Chef says, “wait a minute...”\n\nP.P.S. You may want to show an example of the restaurant’s logo - because you’ll want a face that compliments... (or is that complements in this case?)\n\n"
