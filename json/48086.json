      "content": "Very interesting font!\n\nThe bottom (lowercase) set has a couple issues that I can see.\n\n-The \"e\" looks too similar to the \"c\" and by itself looks more like a small \"p\". Does the stem (or descender) have to be straight? If not, I'd curve it or give it a tail that came back under itself to the right to give it more shape.\n\n-The same with the bottom of the \"c\". It really looks more like an \"r\" right now.\n\n-The \"z\" looks more like a \"3\" to me. I know it's supposed to be a cursive/script \"z\", but as it is right now, you'd be spelling 3ebras, not zebras.\n\n"
