The conventional stress for an \"A\" is with the thin stroke on the left, and the thick stroke on the right.   \n   \nI would also reverse the stress of the uc \"N\", making the vertical stems thin and the diagonal thick. (That may help the uc \"M\" look more natural in this setting, too.)   \n   \nDavid\n\n"
