This font format was capable of generating variations of different fonts based on [axes](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/axis) and [masters](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/masters). A [weight](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/weight) axis might change the weight from [light](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/light) to [bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/bold). An additional axis for [width](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/width) might change [condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/condensed) to [extended](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/extended), Users could dial in anything between the masters' extremes. The idea was to let the user select the degree of weight or width, &c. The maximum number of axes allowed by the format was four, i.e. sixteen principal masters.  \nAfter several years of production, Adobe abandoned the concept as an end product. However, MultipleMaster (MM) axis are used today by [type designers](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/type%20designer) in programs like [FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontLab) to help generate variations of weight, &c. It is now mostly an interpolation tool and assumes some degree of cleanup by the designer afterwards but much less than starting from scratch for each variation.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [Nodes in MM-fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/typophile.com/node/39965)\n\n**Additional Articles**\n\n[LettError Wiki : MultipleMaster](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/just.letterror.com/ltrwiki/MultipleMaster)  \n [Designing Multiple Master Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20130923060336/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/font/pdfs/5091.Design_MM_Fonts.pdf) (PDF)\n\n",
