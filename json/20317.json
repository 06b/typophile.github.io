Pertaining more to the previous TypeBattles were you are designing whole sets/alphabets...\n\nDo you draw them out and scan them in?  \nDo you use font designing software? If so, what is the standard or preferred application?\n\nYou guys do some great work and i am just curious how you guys do it.\n\n-thanks for any feedback\n\n"
