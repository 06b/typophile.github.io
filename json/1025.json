I noticed that a whole damn lot of   \nnative English speakers frequently make mistakes   \nagainst its use, and it's quite silly a Dutch/French-   \nspeaking guy like me trips over these typos. (I hate   \nthat, it even makes me stop reading on certain   \noccasions.)   \n   \nThen again, I make loads of other mistakes and my   \nuse of the English language is often quite... eh...   \nlet's call it \"inventive\". So who am I to judge?   \n   \nGood article BTW. THX for the link, Mr. Treacy.\n\n"
