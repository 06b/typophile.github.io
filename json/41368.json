  "content": "for a while now (2 years) my indesign has been experiencing lapses in memory when it comes to recognising certain typefaces. so far, it's only been parts of font sets or large chunks of sets (e.g., one day all of Malmö Sans works, but the next finds the alternative ligatures, \"LigAlt\", missing). what's interesting is that the font isn't actually missing, but is being listed under another name (e.g., what was once \"LigAlt\" becomes listed as \"LigaturesAlt\" or \"Ligatures Alt\" or \"Lig Alt\" causing indesign to believe it is missing).\n\nreinstall the font, right? already tried. it does the same thing; doesn't recognise the original naming. the fonts are central, so nothing is coming through a server. it's the same font, no copy of it exists in multiple places. i've also tried completely removing the \"trouble\" fonts and reinstalling them with the fresh, originally purchased files, only to see it happen again. i've also tried different methods of importing them into font programs (adding and copying, strictly adding not copying, and moving).\n\ni started noticing the problem with h&fj's gotham when a file, that was being shared by the art director and i (being copied from a server and worked on centrally), refused to recognise the bold set by the name the art director's computer was using. i figured the problem was in two computers, two different os versions, two different font programs, or two different versions of indesign. not the case, our platforms are identical except that one is a macbook pro and the other a g5 tower. (note: it is not, however, specific to the use of files between two people/computers. it happens with files originating and staying on my computer, as well.)\n\nthe problem doesn't seem so much a \"problem\" when a simple selection of the content and change of font name is the solution, but i'm sure you'll understand that when the problem occurs with manual ligature alternatives (and the nomenclature changing back and forth, back and forth) pages start looking like they're ridden with chicken pox.\n\nthe simplest solution i've come to is restarting my computer, which isn't much of a solution, being that a couple more times of opening/closing the file finds the problem occurring again. it \"seems\" completely erratic, and i'm tempted to assume that my indesign has an emotional quarrel with me for critiquing its limited pathfinder options.\n\nany ideas will be greatly appreciated.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  \nthis has been happening through all variables listed below:  \nindesign 2+ through mac os 10.3+  \nindesign 2+ through mac os 10.4+  \nindesign cs through mac os 10.4+  \nindesign cs2 through mac os 10.4+  \nindesign cs2 through mac os 10.5 (current, and i understand the whole cs2/leopard issues)\n\nprograms used/tried: fontbook; extensis suitcase x1, 10, and 9; linotype fontexplorer x; and also through the os font library folder. currently using ext suit x1.\n\n",
