      "content": "A bit of clarification here ...\n\nYour AKAs, Yves, are actually several slightly different fonts. All are based upon what were originally Filmotype faces. I'll give the original names in bold:\n\n**Apache** was digitized as your URW Apache and Panache's [Stanley](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414190525/http:/www.identifont.com/find?font=stanley).\n\n**August** , then, was a little heavier and wider. Fontbank's [Toledo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414190525/http:/www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/toledo.htm) (and Brendel's Cochise) are digital versions - and some version of August is what I think was used for your graphic, Roy.\n\n**Beaver** was still slightly heavier and wider. Sixpack was made from that.\n\n**Avon** and **Parade** were just plain different in lots of little ways.\n\nIf quality of digitization is a consideration, then keep in mind that the Fontbank and Brendel offerings were made way back in the earliest days of computer fontmaking. I can guarantee that the URW font is much better made. I don't know enough about Panache or have any of their fonts, so can't speak to the quality issue there.\n\n"
