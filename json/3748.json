I thought maybe 3 Islands [\"Professor\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124339/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg3.html) looked similar, but I didn't see anything else, other than maybe Liorah, in Part 9 of the Guide. I didn't have time to check Part 10, but that would be about the only places for the ones I have collected.\n\n",
