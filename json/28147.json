On Google however (which -if I’m not mistaken- uses Arial, I get the following screen...  \nDoes anyone know what happened & most of all how to solve it?\n\nThanks for any help!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Fontproblem.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906165325/http:/typophile.com/files/Fontproblem.jpg) | 198.43 KB |\n\n [‹ FontLab's PhotoFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906165325/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18963 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [OT Compiles, then doesn't on export ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906165325/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28234 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s kind of strange though, since Google specifies the general sans serif if Arial isn’t installed, and in your case that should be Helvetica.\n\nArial is actually kind of nice on-screen, abominable as it may be in print. Just goes to show how different online and print design really is.\n\n"
