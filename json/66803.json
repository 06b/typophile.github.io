Not the usual homage to film title sequences themselves, but of the moment when the film's title and hence it's type treatment is first revealed in the sequence.\n\nBrilliant sleuthing, kudos to Christian.\n\n",

And also some great movie titles such as \"Young Man with a Horn\", \"Dark Passage\" and \"The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse\".\n\nIt would be good to see the same done for [Ealing Studios](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213431/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ealing_Studios).\n\n"
