  "content": "_Dear All,_\n\n[Graphicus magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013091309/http:/www.eurographicus.com/archivio_en.asp?L=2) invites you all to take part in the project “A Library In The Forest” (“Una Biblioteca Nella Foresta”).\n\nIn Congo-Brazzaville, in the hearth of the equatorial forest, there’s a village name Zanagà ; the inhabitants, thank to the wise guidance of young priest Don Rufin, expressed the wish of reading.  \nNo food, no clothes or money, our African friends need books.\n\nWho better than us, people who deal with prints and designs, can understand such a noble demand ?\n\nIf you want to contribute to the growth of “A Library In The Forest” in Congo-Brazzaville please send one or more books (secondhand texts are welcome as well) to the address underneath. The only limitation is that _the books must be in French_ with the exception of picture/children`s books.\n\nThe books will be directly posted to Zanagà by the volunteers who take care of the project.\n\nThanking you all for your solidarity, we wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\n\n_The Graphicus Staff._\n\nGRAPHICUS  \nPROGETTO UNA BIBLIOTECA NELLA FORESTA  \nVia Salvator Rosa 14  \n20156 Milano  \nItaly\n\nFor more informations contact Alexia Rizzi, Editor.  \nEmail: graphicus.age (at) gruppodg (dot) com  \nVoice: 0039 02 30039310\n\n",
