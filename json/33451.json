And i have about 0 ideas that is easy to perform as well as good looking. Any ideas / inspiration links?\n\nI`ve got [http://www.lettermade.com/photos/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416040235/http:/www.lettermade.com/photos/ \"http://www.lettermade.com/photos/\") [http://typographi.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416040235/http:/typographi.com/ \"http://typographi.com/\")\n\nI`m not asking you to do this for me.

I dont know how well it will project, but if it blurs, it may also be nice.\n\n"

If i get this togheter fast, i would be cool to work with different colours and overlays. And solutions for focusing using a lens.\n\n"
