Pre-CS4, InDesign did not support it (at all, or correctly); CS4 should finally support it in full. That's from hearsay, by the way.\n\nIt's also possible Textedit doesn't _need_ the Opentype definitions and can simulate the compositions just by having the right glyphs in the font.\n\n"

Somewhere in the InDesign Glyph panel -- browse & click.  \n- The program (InDesign, preferable) handles the replacement of glyphs; the fonts themselves are not touched.  \n- It's just a data table somewhere in the document; yes, anyone else using your original documents should have the same fonts, but this is already a (reasonable) requirement.\n\n"

One possibility is that, in the font causing problems, the characters are not named uniXXXX (like uni1EAF in Andron Scriptor Web) but are given a name like `abreveacute`.
