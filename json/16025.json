      "content": "There were quite a few \"photo alphabets\" shown from time to time in older issues of _U&lc_, several of which were done by Herb Lubalin. But these were essentially pictures of found articles resembling letterforms. If I can find one of these articles I'll try to post samples. As for an actual typeface, I don't recall a font using photos of handtools.\n\nThere are a few type designs using tools such as [Toolbox](http://web.archive.org/web/20150426204458/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/toolbox/) by Brian Strysko.\n\n"
