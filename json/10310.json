I do have one question though -- how did you get that to display on the screen in cyrillic?   \n   \nWhen we view the files in notepad etc. all we see is the messed up code above, and when we pull it out of the database and display it on a web page, all we see is upside down question marks.   \n   \nAny ideas (you would be lifesaving!!)   \n   \nThanks,   \n   \nJordan\n\n"

There is the Script combo box in the Font dialog. Choose Cyirillic. If there is no Cyrillic for Times New Roman then try other fonts or ask your client to send you a font.   \nPerhaps you will need to switch on Cyrillic support in Control Panels, I don't know. Cannot add anything more since I use Win XP which is more language-friendly than 2k.   \n   \nBy the way, all that Cyrillic text above is readable in IE under XP with proper language settings except letter \"ü\" in 1 -\n\n"
