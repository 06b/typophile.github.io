It's a group for all typographic themed gear, not just ours. We've had over 100 photos submitted in just two weeks covering some of the best tees for designers out there.\n\nType t-shirts seem to be more popular each day and it's a very friendly community of competitors. Several of them have joined our group and we hope that it might become a definitive compendium of the genre.\n\nWe've also got a flickr group for our buyers: [TypographyShop Tees](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018220647/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/typographyshop_tees) We'd love to see more shots there if you've bought one of our shirts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018220647im_/http:/typophile.com/files/flickrgroup_4629.jpg)\n\n",
