      "content": "Anders, your thoughts on old-style numerals are exactly the type of thing many more designers should be going through. Instead, most people are too afraid/lazy/dumb to challenge convention, and we're stuck with the non-sensical stuff we keep seeing.   \n   \nOne could argue that keeping the old convention in numeral design is important because readers are already used to it. But really, do we expect readers to notice and even react adversely to something as subtle as making the \"2\" ascending, for example? On the contrary, I think the functional and aesthetic advantages of improved design could play positive roles in the reader's subconscious.   \n   \nPart of the problem is if/when you try to license your work to a font house, they enforce their own beliefs/needs on the design. This is understandable, and much can be learned from the experience of font houses, but to me it's one more reason to go completely independent.   \n   \nConventional numerals suffer from two main things:   \n   \n1. The distribution of contrast (stroke thickness) is erratic and inconsistent. Gill tried to address this, but I for one don't like the results. In November I will post my own efforts to this list, and see what you guys think.   \n   \n2. The \"extenderness\" of some numerals does not seem to be based on solid reasoning, at least not solid in this day and age. As you allude to, the numerals are too descending overall.   \n   \nIn the case of #1, I think more people should be trying to either: make the emphasis of \\*all\\* the numerals horizontal; or (preferably) align the emphasis of all the numerals to the vertical of the alphabetic glyphs.   \n   \nIn the case of #2, I personally think the \"3\" and \"5\" work much better when sitting on the baseline\\*, and the \"2\" should ascend as well. As for the zero, I'm undecided. :-/   \n   \n\\* Note that some old French foundries used to so this.   \n   \nAlso, the conventional numeral \"4\" is a disaster.   \n   \nBTW, concerning your statement that \"this is not a completely new invention\": Maybe your efforts are not an \"invention\" (very very few things really are), but the mental path you're taking is significant because it's both important and disregarded.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I would make it ascending. :-)   \n   \nI also think your top text sample is truly nice.   \n   \nBDF: If you can get your hands on a Unix system, there's a free utility by Mark Leisher (called XBDF? Check the OpenType discussion list archives) that lets you design bitmaps and output BDFs. I think even in grayscale. And as a last resort, you can always write out a BDF by hand, since it's human-readable, sort of...   \n   \nBTW, more like Nov 30th. :-)   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "FWIW, though it takes some repetitive button-pushing, I've managed to use the shareware Softy font editor to convert bitmap fonts to TrueType. You can get it here: [http://users.iclway.co.uk/l.emmett/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414074116/http:/users.iclway.co.uk/l.emmett/)   \n   \nTo summarize:\n\n- Open up the bitmap font in Softy and use the Edit-\\>Scale command to resize the font to somewhere around 100px wide (with the appropriate ratio for height, of course). \n- Then, in Softy's main window, select Use Bitmap Char from the Template menu. \n- Open up Softy's TrueType editor and use the Glyph-\\>Outline Template command for each character to create a bare-bones TrueType font. \n- Then, once \\*that's\\* done, fiddle with the character mappings, either in Softy or in a program (such as High-Logic's Font Creator Program) that's better equipped with regards to character maps.\nJust a suggestion; there are no doubt more elegant ways of doing this, but I've created TrueType versions of several [bitmap fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414074116/http:/codeman38.cjb.net/font/) from video games and computer programs using this method...   \n   \n-- codeman38 \n"

The increased letterspacing is a major improvement.   \n   \nI especially like the numerals, and I personally don't see any problems with the \"5\" reading as \"s\"; it's main stem is bold enough, I think, to prevent much confusion, especially in context.   \n   \nHowever, is the condensed middle-size \"7\" supposed to be ascending, and if so, is it a bit too tall? In any case, I think I prefer it descending.   \n   \nI also like your treatment of the tails on the bold versions of uc \"K\" and \"R\", as well as the form of the uc \"Y\" and the descending tails of uc \"J\" and \"Q\".   \n   \nAnd those lc \"r\"s are really attractive!
