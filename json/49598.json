I absoulutely love Museo, when you released the sample, I adopted it as my corporate font, not knowing that it was going to be more popular than helvetica, even if if is just for a day, dude... that is frickin' awesome. Well done, thanks and keep up all your hard work... Can't wait to see what's next!\n\n—Justin\n\n"
