Ray has received over 30 graphic and type awards from the TDC, AIGA, and ADC and other art associations. The Cruz Script Set features three script fonts in three different styles (Ballpoint pen, Brush and Calligraphic pen) plus a font of companion ornaments in the same three styles. The three alphabet fonts are available in optional OpenType format for a more natural effect with automatic character substitution and ligatures.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/cruzscriptspro.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014000609/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/cruzscriptspro.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/cruzscriptspro.html\")\n\nSweepy\n\nLettering artist Michael Clark brings us his newest design, Sweepy. It is based on his popular “Pooper Black” but it is lighter and has connecting letters. Sweepy is a brush script that is casual and fluid. The expanded OpenType version is loaded with alternate characters and ligatures that offer more flexible lettering options.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/sweepyOT.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014000609/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/sweepyOT.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/sweepyOT.html\")\n\nOperina Pro\n\n\\>From James Grieshaber, who turned the venerable P22 Cezanne font into  \nCezanne Pro, comes Operina Pro. The font expands on Grieshaber’s Operina font, a set of three interchangable calligraphic script fonts based on Ludovico degli Arrighi’s book, “La Operina” (1522). The OpenType font features Small Caps, Old Style Figures, full European, Cyrillic and Greek character sets and a new OpenType first with automatic Roman Numerals. Just  \ntype any number and with the feature, it will convert to Roman Numerals!\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/operinapro.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014000609/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/operinapro.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/operinapro.html\")\n\nAvailable now from P22. Prices start at $19.95 for single fonts.\n\n[http://www.p22.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014000609/http:/www.p22.com/ \"http://www.p22.com\")\n\nMerry Script-mas!\n\nP22 Type Foundry\n\n",
