  "content": "Hi all!\n\nIn my leisure-time I am working on a Typeface inspired by an old lettering from a Portuguese Pharma company.  \nAfter some search (posts here in Typophile) I found some similarities with Hubert Jocham’s Milk. But even so I decided to go on.\n\nI would be thankful if you could take a look at it.\n\nThere are certainly some problems with some glyphs at the moment (for example I dont like the S, T, Y) The V, W, X, Y and Z also need more work...\n\nJust need some feedback before I can go further with it...  \nThanks a lot for your help\n\nAntónio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418221206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/amarantino_6434.jpg)\n\n",
