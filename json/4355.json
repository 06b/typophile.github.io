It will be used as an option of captioning on a television and other digital applications, mainly cell phones.   \n   \nThe alternate face is used to show vocal pattern inconsistencies during display.   \n   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020195029im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/33835.jpg)   \n   \nYes, the X's in the regular cases are horrible. Any suggestions?\n\n",

Any other bluriness could just be exporting it to jpeg.   \n   \nit works the best at 100% at 20, 40, 60pt etc, though its not meant to be seen at those sizes.\n\n"
