The \\_M\\_ is a very bad fit for the \\_ar\\_, it reads like \\_Moar\\_ more than \\_Mar\\_.  \nAs for the \\_C\\_, it is in the style of Spencerian Script and close versions are found in several fonts. For example the \\_C\\_ in Ambassador Script CT [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ambassador-script/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822080154/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ambassador-script/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ambassador-script/\")  \nor in Parfumerie Script Text [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/parfumerie-script-pro/text/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822080154/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/parfumerie-script-pro/text/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesenses/parfumerie-script-pro/text/\") or in Helinda Rook MT [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/athelinda-rook/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822080154/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/athelinda-rook/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/athelinda-rook/\")  \n\\_M\\_ and lowercase, also Spencerian variations.  \nFor a good general substitute to your image I like Davison Spencerian HI [http://www.houseind.com/fonts/spencerian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140822080154/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/spencerian \"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/spencerian\")  \nDon\n\n"
