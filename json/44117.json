  "content": "For signage...\n\nit has been said that white text on 70% to 80% grey is easier to read than white on black. I think there is certainly less dazzle, and lately I have been seen this colour combo quite frequently recently.\n\nIs there any research on what colour combinations help or hinder legibility?\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ Google funny, or Google Ha Ha?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709015113/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44199 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Veer Member Handbook ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709015113/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44235 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It may be related to text displayed on a display monitor.  \nThere’s a difference between black on white on CRT, on LCD, and in print. Often white backgrounds in computer displays are said to cause eye strain, but I’d guess the effect is not the same, or perhaps not existent, when the white is a flat surface color.\n\nJason C\n\n"

(often described as “dazzle”) ) It seems reasonable that a less extreme adjustment will result in a clearer, more legible image.\n\nDoes that seem reasonable?\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

The common solution to this problem is to make the former text slightly bolder than the latter. Usually jumping from a regular to bold weight is too much for this purpose, though, so fonts with multiple weight options are more desirable.\n\nAs far as interior, non-illuminated signage, a dark shape with light lettering hung on a light colored wall will cause most people to immediately recognize “Hey, there is a sign here”, and if they are seeking an unfamiliar destination they may pause to read it. Black may not necessarily be the best color for the particular interior, but white text on black is perfectly functional.\n\n"
