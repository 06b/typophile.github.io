Type3 is dead, Photofonts is bitmaps. But yeah, I **would** be curious to find out how these things (FF Primary probably being the least obscure example) actually sell...\n\nAs for the forms:  \n- Can the \"e\" be improved? I think it could get mistaken for an \"o\", especially in some contexts.  \n- I wonder if there's a way to pull apart the \"h\" and \"n\".  \n- The \"r\" and \"u\" are not working.  \n- Could the \"x\" be less out of character?  \n- The parens looks just like the square brackets.  \n- I can't tell what the thing between the percent and the question is.  \n- ...  \nNow I'm actually tired - I'm gonna take a break. :-)\n\nhhp\n\n"
