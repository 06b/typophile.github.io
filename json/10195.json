I can find a \"close enough\" font or pull an all-nighter (well, a to-midnighter, which isn't good for my sleep habits) faking it in Freehand, but my sense of proffessional pride begs me to try to get it right before resorting to workarounds.   \n   \nA very close font I found on our communal work computer is \"CG Omega\" but for the life of me I couldn't find the font file to transfer to my own work machine.   \n   \nA coworker suggested Helvetica, but this has a touch of serif and (unless I'm mistaken) Helvetica is a sans.   \n   \nSorry this got so long, and thanks for any help.\n\n",

I had it set to let a clicked-on URL work properly, but obviously it needs tweaking.   \n   \nI did that because I've had problems with people hotlinking pictures from my site. That's when a site grabs pictures from other sites and eats up the others' bandwidth, which is usually limited to so much traffic a month. If it goes over a certain amount, I have to pay a higher fee. I do appreciate traffic to my site, but I'd rather they come to my page instead of seeing my artwork hotlinked without permission.   \n   \nThe link originally led to a .gif that was a scan of what I was looking for. I apologise for the confusion and I'll edit the original post now that my problem's been solved.   \n   \n(And I am sorry about it being \"prissy\" but it's certainly not directed at you. It's meant to be prissy to those who hotlink without permission.)   \n   \nEDIT: Er, it seems I can't edit my original link. I again apologise to anyone who got my pagebreaking anti-hotlink message graphic. Perhaps an admin can edit the post for me and avoid any more faux-pas?\n\n"
