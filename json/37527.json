Any critiques please. Thanks again.\n\nSorry for the size of the red, white and blue logo. Not sure how to adjust.\n\n",

I agree, though, that is not commonly used in Sports - but is that necessarily bad? The colors that I used intentionally represent the uniform colors of black white and gold.\n\nThe second attempt is more patriotic and blatant with the red, white and blue and flag theme. The graphic comes from a tracing of a flag soccer ball photo.\n\nEnjoying the feedback. Keep it coming please.\n\n"

      "content": "you might be able to use the statue of liberty torch with the i of liberty. I would go for a feminine font (girls team) e.g with contrast which will also match in with the heritage of the name. You could do the logo within a shield or cup or ball shape, although i prefer shield. Look at all the words in caps as it will add structure a solidness something you associate with football. Use colour to make it expressive. The logos you have are ok, the second one is much nicer than the first. I could associate the first one with a team called tigers at a push, it doesn't say football or liberty and font isn't nice. The second one is better but doesn't say anything to me.\n\n"

      "content": "Going with the second design was a smart move. Lose the Statue of Liberty—it’s starting too look like a parody of the Fox News in-house soccer team. It’s also just not a remotely appropriate way to treat an important symbl (not that putting a flag on a soccer ball is much better, but people are used to tacky degradation of hallowed symbols when a  \nsaid symbols are flags). Don’t draw the flag to look distorted, it looks unnatural, instead draw it flat and wrap it around a 3D sphere.\n\nRegarding your type, I would recommend not using a serif type, but if you must, go with a simple slab serif. It’s more sporty and more appropriate for the age of the players. Gotham Rounded would be a great sans type to use, Memphis would be a great slab serif that has a great combination of American and European elements that make it especially appropriate for a soccer team.\n\n"

Maybe just use the flame this gives the idea without the degradation that James is talking about. I wouldn't use the flag as I think it doesn't say local it says global, nor does it say liberty. Listen to the guys above as they know more about type and what to use. I'm not getting any feminism from it though. Simplicity is the key, drop what isn't essential. I love Football/soccer, hope you enjoy watching it!\n\n"

It is a New York team and the coach, a NYC Fireman, wanted to add the Statue of Liberty in some context.\n\nThe girls are a lot of fun to watch and are having a ball (no pun intended).

In terms of the image it should either be really well executed or dropped in favour of a simpler rendition at the moment there is too much of a clipart feel to it. My personal feeling is that a team logo shouldn’t need a rendition of the sport.\n\nTim\n\n"
