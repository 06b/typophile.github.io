The Saturday we toured all the banks in the city. There was this one with a huge purple cat on it - later we realized it was a minx. The Sunday morning I figured we should hit the church; not the small ceremonial one on the main street, but the populist one a bit away from the center, next to a train station in a gully of sorts. It was quite immersive, and we drew some visual inspiration from the decorations inside. And then we had to get on our respective flights back home. I did spend just under 24 hours in Moscow though. I'd been there before (for a couple of days, four years prior), and I do adore its raciness, but it's really just another big European city - not Russian enough.\n\n\\* I did some \"crack consulting\" with/for Miles Newlyn on a bank identity redesign proposal.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Although the structure of the triskelion/eternity\\* can be considered \"intuitive\" enough to ascribe any similarity to coincidence (or a shared primordial \"culture\"), there are in fact some very strong visual similarities between the two cultures\\*\\* that actually go well beyond that one symbol. This, in spite of the large geographic divide. Recently I heard an explanation of why that's the case, but I don't remember what it was, and I have a feeling it was apocryphal anyway.\n\n\\* BTW, just like the Nazis \"repurposed\" the swastika, the apartheid organization of Terreblanche in South Africa uses a triskelion!\n\n\\*\\* Another culture that looks Armenian (or vice versa) is the Basque, along with its environs. I was in Banaguás once (a hamlet near Jaca, in Aragon) and the local church looked faintly but clearly Armenian to me. Actually the Basque _language_ and from what I understand even the genotype seem related to us!\n\nThere's this one khatchkar in a very impressive (if run-down) church complex in the town of Talin (close to the Turkish border) that I saw this summer, with all the Celtic knot-work and everything! I'll try to find my photo of it (actually Nina was there too, and she takes better pictures). Pretty amazing.\n\nhhp\n\n"

That is just a rumour without some sort of evidence.\n\nAlso it appears from the SARM comment that two will be needed, right-facing and left-facing. They did explain a particular usage scenario: \"Right and left rotations have accordingly active and passive meanings, as in case of Swastika, and are used in order to accentuate these meanings. For example, a cradle for а boy is decorated with the right whirling eternity sign and a cradle for а girl with the left whirling eternity sign.\"\n\nWe do have RIGHT-FACING SVASTI SIGN and LEFT-FACING SVASTI SIGN so I would see little problem in having RIGHT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN and LEFT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN.\n\nEvery few years I see people complaining that this isn't in Unicode. Every few years I make a plea like this. Evidence, folks, please?\n\n"
