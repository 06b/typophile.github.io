  "content": "I'm having a hard time finding a nice sans that goes with Diotima LT Std Roman. I need something that has a classical vibe (obviously) but that also has a subtle Art Nouveau and/or Arts & Crafts thing going on, too. Nothing too decorative –just open, humanist and especially compatible with Diotima's characters a, b, e, m, and p. Something slightly wide, like the 105-110% horizontal scale range. Thanks in advance.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082405im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DiotimaLTStdRoman_6149.png)\n\n",

      "content": "The thing with pairing a sans with a very trad serif like Diotima is that a sans needs to be based around the classical proportions, and not many are. An example of a classically-proportioned sans is of course Gill Sans.  \nHowever, perhaps you could look at Frantisek Storm's Sebastian. It comes in 6 weights, and is a beautiful design. Only downside is slightly petite Small Caps, but I recommend it.  \nIf you're trying to match Diotima's full bowls and high x-height, try American Gothic OPTI. there's a sans and the 'tick' serif. It's at [http://opti.netii.net/fonts-a/index.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419082405/http:/opti.netii.net/fonts-a/index.htm \"http://opti.netii.net/fonts-a/index.htm\"), a display face in three weights. (the sans is not here). Cheers.\n\n"
