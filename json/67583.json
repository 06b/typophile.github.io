I'm just now feeling like I need to get serious with it ( I feel like I have been faking it really well for a while ). So, I bought Fontlab last week because Fontographer (which I've been using since 1988 has its limitations), and I feel overwhelmed. Yet, I'm excited to know that I have so much more to learn.\n\nI'm hoping that people in this group, can help me learn. I have a host of technical questions. But for now, I just want to say I'm looking forward to checking in frequently.\n\nR\n\n"
