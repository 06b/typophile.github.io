(actually it seems more likely to me that Bodebeck started out as something with serifs that were clipped off later).\n\nIt was just a thought, not a serious ID attempt. As we've often noted, sometimes people posting here are trying to re-create a look, either by finding the actual font, or by finding something close enough that it can be made to resemble the sample (if it doesn't have to stand close inspection by font fanatics).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
