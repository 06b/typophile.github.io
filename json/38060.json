  "content": "Hello, Here I go again with yet another kinda stoopid question : What's the difference between contextual and stylistic alternates? I am in my sixth or seven month of this really stressful learning curve towards the making of open type fonts. I know I haven't shared my ideas in the \"Critique\" side of here but first I want to make sure I got everything right on the BUILD side, so please, if you could share this basic info with a poor type wannabe, I'd be grateful forever. Hi from Mexico, Seneca\n\n",

Stylistic alternates (the 'salt' feature, or stylistic sets, 'ss##') are expected to be discretionary, or off by default.\n\n"
