I could find no suitable commercial font that had all the needed characters, except, as noted, Times and Stone.\n\nSince Adobe allows modifications to their fonts by the end user for their own use, I used Minion, primarily because of its neutral feel, and because it does come with Greek (though you cannot simply use the existing Greek characters for all the IPA \"Greek\").\n\nI then made up the needed phonetic characters, roman and italic.\n\nWhile IPA may not require italic, try telling that to an editor who has been taught that all foriegn words must be set in italic. Many editorial decisions are religious in character, that is, they are reveled truths, brooking no argument. Italic is needed.\n\nIt does not take all that long to draw up serviceable IPA symbols -- maybe a week for italic and roman. Note the word \"serviceable.\" They probably wouldn't pass muster with a real font designer. But at text size, they worked well enough.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI have used Merlo in one book. It tends towards being too heavy, and I'm one of the guys who complains that most photocomp and digital fonts are too light. With a 10-point setting, it worked pretty well. With a larger setting, I doubt it -- a noted designer (Rich Hendel) tried a larger setting size and couldn't get it to work. That said, I will use it again, when it fits the project.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nIn conclusion, I would use a font from a foundry that allows the end user to modify the font for their own work, and make up your own symbols, as needed.\n\n"

About once a month, we get someone, an author, an editor, or a designer, who wants something typographic changed. There have been so many of these instances over the years I can't keep track.\n\nThis week, for example, proof came back where the publisher (probably the author, but who knows), wanted the breath marks on Greek capitals placed over the letter, rather than in front. I could tell them they are wrong. Or, I could admit that Greek began around 1,000 BC, and has undergone many changes in how it is written. Maybe at some point in time, that's how they were written. I'm certainly no expert on the permutations of the Greek language. Or we could just set what they wanted, which is what we did.\n\nThere were only a few occurrences, so we made the change using the layout program. If there had been a lot of instances, I would have gone into the font, created a separate variant, and written a feature to switch them on. The type designer would not have been consulted. Did I mention that second proof is usually due 10 working days from when it is received?\n\nI have also had authors insist that certain phonetic characters appear certain ways, in spite of the \"guidance\" about allowable variance that can be found in Chicago's <cite>Phonetic Symbol Guide</cite>. Again, you usually find this out when first proof is returned.\n\nType isn't hung on a museum wall, and OpenType software can't cover all the users needs.\n\nIf you want to put a clause in your EULA that your fonts cannot be modified, that's your right.

However, support for this feature is generally absent and as you say, no one uses the language tags anyway.\n\nIt will be up to the editor to make the substitution manually. I cannot imagine that there ever would be a text using the two-story italic _a_ extensively; I've never seen an example myself, and I've seen a lot of linguistics texts.\n\nHowever, the Fe'fe' or Nufi language of Western Cameroon uses both a and ɑ in its alphabet, so setting a text in that language may require more substitutions than an editor could handle. In that case, assuming the entire text is in that language, modifying the font so that the italic _a_ is the two-storey version would be the simplest way.\n\nJohn Hudson says he recommends having a dedicated IPA font, since there are examples where IPA symbols share code points with letters used more often in other contexts (like the Greek letters) that require design differences according to use. Distinguishing the italic _a_s in IPA would be another example to support such an argument.\n\n"

In general, I very much agree with Jongseong. The differences between the various \"a\" characters in IPA is meaningful, and probably the only way to effectively handle it in italics is with either a separate font, or an OpenType or AAT Stylistic Variant (sorry, Andreas). As an end-user, I would personally favor the second approach, although I have no idea how much work is entailed in implementing such a feature.\n\nCharles\\_e's comment about fussy editors demanding italicized IPA is dead on, as I've experienced such things myself. In addition, there are a great many minority languages which have developed orthographies which include phonetic characters. When it becomes necessary to cite words or phrases from these languages, italic styles are practically indispensable. Unfortunately, there are very, very few acceptable IPA faces with italics, and none at all which include a matching typeface suitable for body text. This is one of the reasons I find Andron so exciting: it's an actually nice-looking typeface that features a nearly complete set of IPA characters. The requisite two-story variants of 0061 (a), 0252 (ɐ), and 00E6 (æ) (which, although not discussed above, becomes hard to distinguish from 0153 (œ) in most italic faces) would make it perfect.\n\nAndreas, I share your frustration that the designers of the IPA seemingly failed to consider some of the realities of type design, but the truth is that we live in an imperfect world, and we often have to live with the poor decisions made by our predecessors. It adds some complexity and challenge to life, and I think there are more than a few linguists out there who would appreciate your taking the trouble to work out typographic oddities like the italic two story \"a\".\n\n"

In your experience, how would they handle these types of issues? My guess is that lots of them do not have the capable software, and that's why separate IPA fonts would be a reasonable solution for now.

      "content": "Peter, Brian\n\nPeter probably has more to contribute to this thread at this point, but let me echo a few things he mentioned.\n\nFirst of all, while I use phonetic symbols reasonably often, the greatest use I encounter is in languages which never had a written form -- native American languages come to mind -- and the various scholars adopted various orthographies to come up with a written form. In the older days (e.g., Ella Deloria), they used what was convenient to note with a pencil, writing in the field - i.e., diacriticals. Later, phonetic symbols were more common,and are more often used today.\n\nSecondly, by in large the symbols used for phonetics were originally just what was available in type, specifically, foundry or Monotype, with their singly cast letters. So, a turned \"a\" was just that. A long s was just that. I'll speculate that over time, special sorts were created, to aid clarity and consistent usage, but I'm not really a type historian.\n\nDictionary use was probably the financial motivator for making whatever custom sorts were needed. But for dictionaries, italic phonetic symbols were not needed, or at least, not often needed. It was other uses of phonetic characters that brought in the need for italic, and those were quite specialized -- i.e., had little potential for recovering the financial cost of making the characters.\n\nThirdly, not everyone uses the IPA system. There are others.\n\nFor all these reasons, a separate font containing IPA characters is not going to solve all users problems. It may solve the dictionary publishers problem, but that is not the only need.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nLinguist are just going to be limited in the number of fonts they can use. The problem is, at this point the number of fonts suitable for bookwork approaches zero.\n\nThe number of available fonts increases if not all that many phonetic symbols are needed. As I've said, for foundries that permit modification of their fonts, the end-user can add to the character set. But as the number of needed characters increases, and as the use moves toward serious linguistics, more and more precise characters are needed.\n\nFor my money, for serious work involving academic linguistics, I would be better off to fix the several non-phonetic problems of Charis-SIL for bookwork (high-resolution offset printing) than trying to draw up all the needed phonetic characters. Others, whose skill level in drawing up characters is greater, may take a different approach.\n\n"

These allow one to set up kerning tables that work cross the different font styles in a family, so that one can prevent, for example, italic-f from crashing with an upright closing parenthesis.
