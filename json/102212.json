It was Art Deco and the Bauhaus movement, along with modernist architecture, fresh ideas and stricter shapes in interior design, a style influenced by industrial and technological developments, that made Grotesk fonts more popular over time.\n\nEver since the introduction of Helvetica Neue, classicistic sans serif fonts have been domineered by this Swiss style. Over the last six decades, typesetters, designers and typographers remembered and used other constructivist sans serif styles, like Futura and Neuzeit. In the late 1980s, American classics like Trade Gothic and Franklin Gothic were used again in Advertising, so the American newspaper title style has been a second strong influence on sans serif fonts and Adrian Frutiger’s typeface for the Parisian airport, Frutiger, sparked a rennaissance of humanist sans serif fonts.\n\nIt seems impossible to reimagine a constructivist or classicistic sans serif without taking one of these previous styles in account. However, its tone of voice can still be different.\n\nA typeface represents a tone of voice, a memory of cultural aspects of a time, faintly resonating a certain Zeitgeist. It is often hidden in the subtle language of shapes, but also linked to applied documents and works associated with the use of the typeface over time. A cultural association is imprinted in the beginning, but perception changes over time.\n\nWe interpret new things with the language we learned from existing things. It’s interesting to see how typefaces like Helvetica Neue gained popularity in Japan, a country and culture that in the last century stood for discipline, strictness, but also beauty and simplicity in design and architecture. But it was used for English words, an inspill of Western influenced cultural elements, or the Japanese interpretation of those elements.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-02-tiny_5399.jpg)\n\nHikari is a font with a Japanese touch. It is primarily a Latin font with no relations to Hiragana, Kanji or Katagana. And yet, the sense for proportions, a strict architecture and its overall feeling transmits a faint memory of Japanese post war culture assimilating and accumulating Western typography.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-04-tiny_3526.jpg)\n\nHikari will be first released as a family of four cuts, ranging from Light to Black. Italic styles and a monospaced version will follow, with a possible expansion to a super family for various screen and print applications.\n\nA free version for Web design is planned as well, licencesed as a Google Webfont family with a smaller set of styles.\n\nThere is still a lot of work ahead until the font will be released: accent glyphs are in works, as well as special characters. It is also possible that at some point in future, Hikari may be released as a Japanese version.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-03-tiny_3962.jpg)\n\n_(Please have a look at the attached images, which look better on a MacBook Pro retina than the inline images)_\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hikari-01.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-01.jpg) | 328.97 KB |\n| [hikari-02.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-02.jpg) | 380.27 KB |\n| [hikari-03.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-03.jpg) | 238.96 KB |\n| [hikari-04.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typophile.com/files/hikari-04.jpg) | 273.59 KB |\n\n",

I would suggest a tasteful variation on a slanted version of the Roman. But if you want it to be more acceptable to more people, make a predictable Italic. Let me use something I was involved in as an example:  \n [http://ernestinefont.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/ernestinefont.com/ \"http://ernestinefont.com/\")  \nThe Roman is great, but to me the Italic is what really makes it super special.\n\nI think the \"freemium\" model you describe can indeed work wonders (although I wouldn't give away more than one style) but make sure it fits with the overall philosophy you adopt.\n\nhhp\n\n"

I love how it takes a typewriter inspiration and evolves it into something very charming, playful and in the Italic even delightful typeface. The Italic keeps the proportions and rythm alive, but borrows the handwriting element (as rennaissance and baroque antiquas do), which breaks with the Egyptienne sense over the regular style.\n\nI haven’t begun yet working on the Italic cuts of Hikari, as I am still busy with accents, special characters, subtle weight adjustments, spacing and kerning. And then there are Open Type features I want to look at, before I can even start thinking about the intermediate cuts, like Book (between Light and Regular), Medium, Bold and the Italics. I will try out a few things with the latter before I settle with a theme, but like you suggested, it would be challenging but nice if it could take it all a level higher.\n\n"

I have completed work on the special characters, like mathematical and Greek glyphs, as well as accents and little headaches, like the ampersand glyph.\n\nIt’s always difficult to make a decision for the design of a classicist sans serif. Theoretically, the classicist sans serif follows the shapes of the classicist antiqua and the earlier baroque antiqua, which are standing at the end of an evolution of renaissance typefaces. Theoretically, the classicist sans serif ampersand should derive from these shapes, like seen in Bodoni, Times and Georgia (which in essence, are modern baroque antiquas). However, grotesk typefaces have come a long way in abstracting that shape and modern sans serif fonts have even returned to the roots, going back to the original ligature shape of a capital, handwriting E and the lowercase letter t, forming a ligature of “Et” (from Latin, et).\n\nI tried to come up with an ampersand that derives from the classicist form, but follows the clarity of formal language of the typeface as a whole. I am not sure if I succeeded 100%, but it seemed better than following the recent trend of taking “Et” as a literal ligature.\n\nYour thoughts and comments are welcome – Hikari is still a work in progress.\n\n"

One of the students asked our teacher why they used to call those sans serif fonts “grotesk”, and my teacher replied that at the time before it became popular, typographers found the minimalism and abstraction of shape a lack of elegance and sophistication. They found it was a sign of cheapness and mundanity. He also noted the connection to the ongoing industrial revolution that almost demanded this kind of change in typographic spirit. \\*\n\nSo my reference may not be historically complete, if William Thorowgood really invented the term. Maybe there exists a dissertation clearing up _why_ he came up with the term, but to me, the explanation of my typography teacher always made sense, in art historic context.\n\nThe font Frutiger was the first of its kind, which I am sure had an influence on Gerard Unger’s Argo (even if it evolved from Swift), or Luc de Groot’s Thesis family.\n\nGill Sans and Syntax have a stronger connection to renaissance proportions than classicist or baroque antiqua proportions.\n\nEnglish is indeed my second language. The German word “konstruktiv” is not automatically associated with Russian constructivism.

Any sense of culture and style I project into the Hikari type family may be personal and nothing but a tone of voice I want to convey.\n\nNever the less it is true and relevant for the concept I have chosen. As a designer I was influenced by the assimilation of Western typography in current Japanese culture. It is of course completely irrelevant whether people seeing an application of the font will or will not make this connection – just as much it is irrelevant if an audience will think of the Swiss school of design, when they see an application of Helvetica Neue.\n\nThank you for your recommendations.

In etymology this term is borrowed from the Italian ‘grottesco’, which actually means ‘being part of the cave’. It refers to antique paintings and type or carving signs, which were discovered in caves and rooms filled with rubble. In Germany sans serif fonts are called ‘Grotesk’ until this date [4].”_\n\nOriginal text: _“Semantisch stammt der Begiff »grotesque« aus der neufranzösischen Sprache des 17.

As subtle this reference may be, I regard it as a legitimate direction.\n\nWhat is it that gives [Fenland](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typography.net/fontfamilies/view/39) the flair of a flat, grassy landscape, other than the reference in its name and the [intentional art direction](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/eyemagazine/7008972239/in/photostream/) by its designer, Jeremy Tankard?\n\nNick Shinn declares my attempt a _generic neo-grotesque_ and he evaluates the market as a niche. I guess that makes sans serif highlights of recent years, like Dalton Maag’s [Aktiv Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/buyonline/fonts/aktivgrotesk), PS Type’s [Runda](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/cargocollective.com/pstype/Runda), Christian Schwartz’s [Atlas Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas/grotesk) and [Graphik](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik), Eric Olson’s [Colfax](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typographica.org/typeface-reviews/colfax/), Laurenz Brunner’s [Akkurat](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/) and [Circular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/%3Cbr%20/%3E), Timo Gaessner’s [Maison Neue](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.milieugrotesque.com/typeface-maisonneue), Margaret Calvert’s [New Rail Alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.newrailalphabet.co.uk/), Playtype’s [Grot10](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/https:/www.playtype.com/font/grot10) and [Virus Fonts’](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.virusfonts.com/) upcoming release [Doctrine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/virusfonts.com/news/2013/01/david-bowie-the-next-day-that-album-cover-design/), used on the new David Bowie album _The Next Day_, all together _generic_ niche products.\n\nMaybe so. But they seem to have found an active interest and acceptance, resonating in current poster- and book designs for art museums, design magazines and photo books. It seems to me that there is a bunch of designers who like attributes of the tone of voice of a Helvetica Neue, but they don’t necessarily want to wear the same old shoes.\n\nIf typefaces were only designed to follow a trend and become instant hits, we would have the Lady Gagas among them triumph over the ones with a subtler tone of voice. If we called every interpretation of a standard _unoriginal_, we would lose joy in playing jazz.\n\nHikari’s design reminded me of wooden framed paper walls, green tea and futon beds. Through its proportions and expression it resembles to me a distinct purity and elegance I see in one of the many faces of Japanese culture, a culture that sees Latin types with different eyes.\n\nI didn’t intend to reinvent the sans serif, grotesque or gothic font genres or classification. My goal was much simpler: to evoke a similar sensual experience, inspiring designers to use a new tone of voice, to see my font become alive in their works, their designs of identities, websites, magazines, posters and books.\n\nThat, and I didn’t like to wear the same old shoes.\n\nLink reference list:  \n [http://www.daltonmaag.com/buyonline/fonts/aktivgrotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/buyonline/fonts/aktivgrotesk \"http://www.daltonmaag.com/buyonline/fonts/aktivgrotesk\")  \n [http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Runda](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/cargocollective.com/pstype/Runda \"http://cargocollective.com/pstype/Runda\")  \n [http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas/grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas/grotesk \"http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas/grotesk\")  \n [http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik \"http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik\")  \n [http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/colfax/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typographica.org/typeface-reviews/colfax/ \"http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/colfax/\")  \n [http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/ \"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/\")  \n [http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/ \"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Circular/\")  \n [http://www.milieugrotesque.com/typeface-maisonneue](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.milieugrotesque.com/typeface-maisonneue \"http://www.milieugrotesque.com/typeface-maisonneue\")  \n [http://www.newrailalphabet.co.uk/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/www.newrailalphabet.co.uk/ \"http://www.newrailalphabet.co.uk/\")  \n [https://www.playtype.com/font/grot10](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/https:/www.playtype.com/font/grot10 \"https://www.playtype.com/font/grot10\")  \n [http://virusfonts.com/news/2013/01/david-bowie-the-next-day-that-album-c...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/virusfonts.com/news/2013/01/david-bowie-the-next-day-that-album-cover-design/ \"http://virusfonts.com/news/2013/01/david-bowie-the-next-day-that-album-cover-design/\")\n\n"

I was inﬂuenced by what Ivo Grabowitsch, FontFont Marketing Director, had said last week at the Typo San Francisco conference in his talk about “what type customers need today”, in which he proposed more originality and fewer subtle interpretations.\n\nAccordingly, if one is going to riff on a classic, this makes it a commercial imperative to publish large fonts and big families, which seems to be the case with Aktiv, Runda, etc.\n\nBTW, of that list I wouldn’t class Colfax and Grot10 as neo-grotesque.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for your words, Nick. I am aware of the passionate discussion and I didn’t take it the wrong way. Like I said, I was not so much aware of the differences of terminology in the English speaking and German speaking _schools of typography_ (in a cultural way).\n\nFranklin Gothic, Trade Gothic and other classic American grotesque fonts never went out of fashion in the U.S. and Canada perhaps, but they were never really used in Europe prior to the late eighties, early nineties. I was an art director at a European advertising agency in 1993 and we had all recent editions of the TDC books and subscribed to a couple of typography and design magazines (it was the eighties, they still had money). I remember how our art directors were typographically influenced by what they saw in American print ads. For an example, we didn’t use Futura Extrabold Condensed much, but it was popular in New York ad agencies.\n\nWhile I am personally more a fan of books, magazines and posters using refined typography, it is a reality that the big living body of typography (= fonts applied in daily life) live in the mass media, mostly advertising in print and on TV, and lately mostly on the Web – which is why I find it important to cultivate the typography that is meant primarily for screen applications.\n\nThere are a couple of interesting developments going on, among them _responsive typography_, different cuts of the same typeface that are used depending on the use of the medium, which means the screen size, the screen resolution, but also the use of the application (surrounding environments). The _responsive_ part of the term derives from _responsive architecture_, a philosophy or principle that lets people experience their surrounding architecture depending on the circumstances (night/day, winter/summer, few people/a lot of people in the same space, for an example).\n\nI think a modern typeface should indeed be made for multiple purposes and if the designer aims for a wide spread application of their typeface, they should make fonts applicable for these environments – print, screen on TV, high resolution screens on computers, etc.\n\nHikari is not designed to be a bread-and-butter font for book or longform journalism. But I hope it could become a responsive typeface, with enough weight and spacing variations and cuts (like a monospaced version) for various applications. I will definitely look into multiple languages, but this is the part that makes the release such a big amount of work.\n\nLast but not least, it is my first release in 20 years and I am looking into more ideas for future typefaces, like a humanist sans serif and a renaissance or baroque antiqua.\n\nOne last word on _constructivism_.\n\nI did some research last night and found that the source of _russian constructivism_ was demolished by the _Russian Bolshevism_ around the time of 1920s, but its spirit had sparked a fire that lived on in the rest of Europe as _international constructivism_, particularly in Germany, where it influenced the creation of the _Bauhaus_ and the associated movement. It had an influence on Paul Renner, when he began working on Futura, but of course the typeface he released is today not classified as _constructivist_ but _geometric_. Still, in German (and Dutch) language the word _konstruktiv_ is used to describe a dry and strict, rather geometric character of a piece of art, design or article of daily use.\n\n"

Because all endings of open circular shapes (the lowercase “a”, upper left ending, the lowercase “c”, “e”, etc.) are closing with the horizontal invisible line. They are bent towards a 90º up or down direction. Humanist sans serif typefaces often have endings towards a vertical line, or they are slightly bent.\n\nThe main feature that makes Colfax lean towards the geometric sans serif is the lowercase “a” with its round belly, similar like Proxima Nova and early alternative versions in drawings of Futura.\n\nInteresting enough, Avenir and Gotham, as well as Proxima Nova, are all classified geometric sans serif typefaces, but only Proxima Nova has a similar lowercase a shape like Colfax.\n\n"

So I think in older versions of Helvetica it was good design to have the narrow styles break with the \"expected look\" of the typeface, but these days that's a lousy design solution.\n\n\\* Like how _even within one font_ caps could have a different job to do, hence a different look - see my last point here: [http://typophile.com/node/102373#comment-551407](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414165833/http:/typophile.com/node/102373#comment-551407 \"http://typophile.com/node/102373#comment-551407\")\n\nAs for authenticity, I have to wonder: what proportion of users today expect the different weights of Helvetica to look like they used to look for the previous generation, versus following the expected look of Helvetica as a whole?\n\nhhp\n\n"
