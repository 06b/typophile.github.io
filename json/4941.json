      "content": "I think the reason you might have detected a 'tone' is that Bickham is frequently the subject of ID requests. With all its optional characters it can confuse people.   \n   \nIn answer to your question about whether we like it, my answer is that I bought a license for it, but it's a bit of a pain to use fully, because of the gyrations needed to bring up the extra characters. Still, the end result is worth the effort. I use Bickham or Zapfino when I want flashy-looking scripts with a lot of flourish to them.\n\n"
