It's for my freelance company studio513.net better known as Studio513. My tag line is \"Embracing the butterfly effect.\" The 513 was my late grandmother's birthday so I named it after her.\n\nSo the little icon representing me is what I'm talking about....\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Also, have you tried replacing the upwards stroke on the 5 and implementing a ball terminal here as well? Might look more balanced. I'd love to see some subtle refinements to really bring it home.\n\nSeb\n\nPS. I have a few pointers about your website (even though you didn't ask for that) IM/email me if you are interested.\n\n"

Why don't you look into a free blogging software such as Wordpress to show your work (have a look, this is what i use) - You don't have to be a technical whizzkid to implement it and it can be easily customised to meet your needs.\n\nAnd this might just be a personal opinion, but it might be a good idea to remove that counter at the bottom of the page.\n\n"

You need a web stats analysis tool...this is usually provided free by most competant web hosting companies. If not, there are 3rd party apps that can do it for you (like Google Analytics).\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Datura\n\nDoes the butterfly (and your tagline) describe what you do? If so, stick with the butterfly, but I think you could try to make it fly (it's a bit rigid for a butterfly).\n\nAre you totally happy about '513'? Is it well-known among your customers? I mean, choosing a firm name because it is your grandmother's birthday is not the normal way of making an excellent firm name. I knew a person who set up a design firm called 'Magnolia' because she liked the movie. I would say that this is not the best approach.\n\n--  \nsoren olsen\n\n"

      "content": "Maybe I should explain a little more. I am no where near a \"design firm.\" My full time job is for another company. This is more of a place for me to display my freelance work. I'm prob considered and amateur to the people on this site!\n\nMy tagline is \"Embracing the butterfly effect.\" Which to me is a metaphor for the design process--how one thing effects another in the design itself.\n\nAbout the 513--my grandmother was more of my mother and I lost her when I was 18, it changed my whole life. I feel like she is still watching over me which is why I named the studio after her. My goal is for her to be proud of me and my art.\n\n"

      "content": "My point is that you must not choose a firm name (no matter how small a firm) that becomes an obstacle. If your grandmother meant a lot to you, then fine. But if everyone that sees the mark misinterpret it, then you should not use it, but change to something else.\n\nI was in fact only talking about principles. And choosing a name for personal reasons that are not obvious to the spectator \\_must\\_ be the wrong way of thinking.\n\nThat said, your mark probably works just fine. '513' has really no irrelavant connotations. I was more worried about the Magnolia case.\n\nBut one weakness about your mark is this: when people see, they go: \"It reads 53\" or \"It reads 53 or 513\" (the middle digit has a different style than the other two).\n\nI like the way you have flipped the 5.\n\n--  \nsoren\\_olsen\n\n"
