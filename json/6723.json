      "content": "Very nice! It has this old French smell to it. And the way you're dropping out pixels here and there is brilliant (and it's a great example of how bitmap and outline font design are totally different).   \n   \nSome suggestions:   \n- I'd axe the last pixel on the ascenders of \"b\" and \"h\".   \n- The new \"f\" is much better.   \n- I don't get the stray pixels in \"g\" and \"y\".   \n- I think the \"k\" and \"z\" are out of character.   \n- The tick in the \"o\" is more hindrance than help, I think.   \n- The UC \"V\" looks unhappy.   \n   \nBTW, it sounds like you won't be making a Roman. Could be interesting that way - but if so I'd definitely make a less rigid italic and I'd make it a two-pixel-stem design. At 15 PPEM it should work out OK, if you make the horizontals 1 pixel and keep it loose overall.   \n   \nBut whatever you do, please do take this all the way!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
