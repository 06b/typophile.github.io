The font seems to work just fine in FontExplorer, but doesn’t work well in InDesign CS3 (5.01) and Illustrator CS3 (13.02). All fonts are suitcases for Mac.\n\nIt keeps giving out this error:  \n“You might not be able to print with “fontname” or stroke its characters because the font outline file is missing.”\n\nThat the hell does that mean? I never get that error here. I don’t have InDesign CS3, so I can’t reproduce the problem. Is there anyone else that get’s the same errors and knows how to solve this?\n\n [‹ When you make an Ohorn ( U+01A1, U+01A0 )](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131145720/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38218 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Who are some people that are know for their study of layout and/or have created great layouts? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080131145720/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38213 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This is essentially what Font Book does when you tell it to install a FFIL file you double-clicked on. I knows about the companion LWFN file automatically. FontExplorer’s default behavior is to make a copy of the files in its private database, but you have to drag both files to it, not just the FFIL.\n\nGenerally, when I’m testing fonts, I don’t use a font management tool. I copy files manually to either my user Fonts folder or the Adobe Fonts folder ([main hard drive]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/).\n\n"
