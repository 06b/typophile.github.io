  "content": "Hi,\n\nSince applying typography to my work, it has occurred to me that Microsoft Word isn't very efficient. For example, I am using Myriad Pro and I find myself manually adjusting letter spacing and letter kerning all of the time.\n\nBeing that I am relatively inexperienced in matters of typography, it seemed reasonable to assume that proper typographers would know of more efficient work flows. Could you please share your thoughts on text editors?\n\nI cannot justify the cost of InDesign. However, I welcome your thoughts on all software as it could save me many hours trying free approaches such as [Serif PagePlus](http://web.archive.org/web/20100203125716/http:/www.freeserifsoftware.com/software/pageplus/).\n\nThanks for your input, it is appreciated and I apologise for being a novice :)\n\n",

If you are, you're going to have to bite the bullet and get InDesign sooner or later anyway.\n\nIf you're self-employed, you may be able to get a tax deduction. (You can in the US, I don't know what the rules are in the UK.)\n\nIf, on the other hand, your principal occupation is something else, and you're simply frustrated that MS Word has a thousand features you don't want and none of the features you do want--well, join the club.\n\nYou can still differentiate your work from the careless stuff you see everywhere. Use styles rather than manual formatting, and override the default \"based on Normal.\" Specify line spacing in points instead of \"single,\" and always use \"space above/below\" in the Paragraph menu to create space around headings, lists, etc. You'd be surprised how professional you can make MS Word look.\n\n"

Then allow Word to save the changes in your normal.dot file if it asks.\n\nLater edit: You don't have to create completely new styles -- you can modify Word's built-in styles any way you want to, except they can't be renamed.\n\n"

Is the whole character scaled up or down in size, or is this perhaps the clipping that happens when the line spacing is less than the font point size?\n\n"
