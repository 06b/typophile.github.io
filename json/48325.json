  "content": "Several of us toil away with pens, brushes and other \"wet\" tools. We have varying associations with BCP's at different points in time.\n\nWhether it is slick or rough, type or titling all of us ply our trade with a firm background in having made letters by hand for many years. The computer is just another tool used in the process as opposed to the genesis.\n\nWe just thought we would put up a WIDE variety of takes on the alphabet.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211712im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Gerard_4528.jpg)\n\nThis piece is by Gerard Huerta. He will throw in on this tomorrow. What is important is that the \"script\" began as a refined pencil that was illuminated later on the computer. I think I have one of his last inked pieces of lettering.\n\nI figured since Gerard went slick I would go abstract in the first round to give contrast. A clock conceived around the letter S (very loosely based on Versals from the 12th century.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211712im_/http:/typophile.com/files/clock_4449.jpg)\n\nMore to come from others and we hope you will join in if you see fit. Hopefully we can show the diversity of the hand writ form.\n\nMichael\n\n",

This one was originally drawn many years ago in the mid 80's, with a biro on a restaurant napkin at lunch and then re-lettered with a pointed brush (Windsor & Newton series 7 # 3) on 3 ply Bristol Board. I used it for my personal logo for a few years. A group of us were looking through a new calligraphy book at the time and this piece was inspired by the work of Jean Larcher, I think (poor memory).  \nLater when I turned to the dark side (computers) I redrew it in Freehand.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308211712im_/http:/typophile.com/files/InkwellWP_3674.jpg)\n\n"
