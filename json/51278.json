  "content": "Any design students or professionals out there that would like to work on a bit of text for a hooded sweatshirt back design?\n\nWe need the phrases \"The Cure for the Common Workout\" and \"Routine is the Enemy\" printed on the back of our hooded sweatshirts and would like someone to design it.\n\nOur website receives 5k visitors per month and we would include a link to your website/portfolio. Monetary payment would be possible, but we are a new business and cannot afford much.\n\nEmail me @ [Ezekiel@CrossFitCoastal.com](mailto:Ezekiel@CrossFitCoastal.com) if you are interested in working on this project thank you!!!\n\n",
