I'd actually suggest making the left arm slightly slightly steeper and the join down slightly below the baseline I think.\n\nYou might need to thin the joins on the bowl and stick letters.\n\n"

      "content": "I'd choose the middle one, It fit better with the rounded design of you typeface. Also the left oblique of the first and the third y should be on the baseline as the w is. It seems the weight of your typeface are unregular. Take a look at your w and the x the oblique are not the same thickness. Keep going.\n\n"
