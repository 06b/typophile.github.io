      "content": "Thank you Stephen. That’s true, FF Karton is really close to the caps from the picture. In fact, I’m quite interested by the small letters, especially the ’e’ and the ’t’. The caps ’S’ and ’M’ are nice as well. I find that the non-printed parts of the stencil (I don’t know the adequate term) are placed in a quite fresh and charming way. The closest type I’ve found is [Schablone](http://web.archive.org/web/20091214040151/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?SKU=FR10103). The general structure is very similar but it doesn’t have this particular touch.\n\n"
