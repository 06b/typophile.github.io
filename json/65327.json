  "content": "hi all,\n\nI wanted share with you a project I've put quite a bit of effort into, especially lately. I've got my furniture design studio, The Office for Lost Objects™, featured on Kickstarter.com, a crowdfunding site for creatives.\n\nAs part of the Kickstarter initiative, I commissioned some artwork which resulted in a limited edition series of four posters. They're archival quality Giclee prints (20\"x30\") on heavyweight 100% cotton Somerset Velvet (images below). They're available now, along with a few other items, only through Kickstarter.\n\n[The Office for Lost Ojbects™ x Kickstarter](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116122547/http:/tiny.cc/olo)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116122547im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OLO_Candy_01_TP_6628.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116122547im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OLO_Candy_02_TP_6487.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116122547im_/http:/typophile.com/files/OLO_Candy_03_TP_4285.jpg)\n\nI hope you will take a look, and consider supporting me.\n\nthanks!  \nJarrod\n\n",
