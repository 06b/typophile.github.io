Within six months he had generated enough work to move from his job as Senior Artist into setting up Churchward International Typefaces, which became one of the largest typesetting companies in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1969 Joseph was asked to submit alphabet designs to Berthold Fototypes and saw immediate success. He later went on to sign distribution agreements with D.Stempel AG, Dr Böger Photosatz GmbH/Linotype, Mecanorma-Polyvroom B.V and Zipatone. He self-published a handful of original fonts in 1978 becoming the first and only company in New Zealand to publish original photo-lettering.\n\nChurchward International Typefaces was forced to close in June 1988 but Churchward Type lives on with a fresh set of independent releases. [David Buck](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000143/http:/typophile.com/wiki/David%20Buck) has taken on the role of digitisation.\n\nJoseph continues to draw alphabets and now has a stockpile of over 300 unique alphabets to his name.\n\n",
