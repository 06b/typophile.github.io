Goudy. ‘Friar’ was originally completed in 1937 and was a ground breaking approach to type design. Goudy designed Friar by combining various lettering styles from the fourth through seventh centuries into a type design rather than slavishly follow a single model. \n\nSteve Matteson developed Friar Pro as a tribute to Goudy and his joy of type design and typographic exploration. Steve created a complete character set with OpenType typographic enhancements to give the Friar Pro font an authentic appearance to the original. The OpenType features in Friar Pro includes alternative letterforms, ligatures and ornaments designed by Goudy for creating dignified typographic arrangements. Friar Pro is a beautiful design which imparts a scribal appearance to any document including greeting cards, certificates and official papers.\n\nFriar Pro is available for instant download in both TrueType and OpenType formats for Windows and Mac OS X from [http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/friar-pro.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103123855/http:/www.ascenderfonts.com/font/friar-pro.aspx \"http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/friar-pro.aspx\")\n\nA 10 page Type Specimen booklet in PDF format showcasing Friar Pro is also available for free download from [AscenderFonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103123855/http:/www.ascenderfonts.com/font/friar-pro.aspx).\n\nIn honor of Memorial Day, Ascender Corp. is proud to announce that it will donate 100% of all proceeds from the sale our newest font, Friar Pro, from now through June 30, 2009 to the [Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103123855/http:/www.fallenheroesfund.org/).
