I thought there had to be a month of inactivity on a General Discussion thread (which is still too little, as far as I'm concerned), but this hadn't even been three weeks. What's the deal with such draconian measures to _prevent_ discussion?...   \n   \n\\* Specifically, I was going to ask Nathan where the pitchurz were.   \n   \nhhp\n\n",
