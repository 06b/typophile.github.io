Hey, if recycling technology in your city is big pain in the ass (like it is for me), then try a site like [Freecycle](http://web.archive.org/web/20110821042531/http:/freecycle.com/). There's always someone who can use our so-called obsolete hardware. Post your stuff, leave it out for pickup once someone says \"I want that\", then it goes to a new home with almost no effort on your part. That Greendisk service is pretty darn cool, too. I'm going to check that out. But technology recycling will not catch on with the public as long as it costs them money. Easier just to junk it.\n\nHardware (and often software) companies all benefit immensely from the high-speed obsolescence of technology, and we as consumers generally clamor for it. Are Macs damaging the environment? Sure. Along with every other piece of technology we buy and dispose of. Plus, there's a layer of security concerns here that's important to note. Some people don't want to donate old tech, for fear of old data being exposed to abuse. I suppose it's not that hard to fix that, but we all know how people are with unfamiliar technical challenges.\n\n"

That might be what's keeping the majority of America from making the effort to recycle their electronics properly. A service needs to be in place that will either take it for free, offer some sort of tax deduction, or actually give you money back.\n\nMaybe an up-front fee, similar to when you purchase a new car battery. The store assumes you're replacing your old hardware with new hardware and charges you a few dollars until you bring your old hardware back in, then they refund that up-front fee. Maybe they could give you a discount on your purchase if you bring your equipment in and have the upgrades preformed by their technicians.\n\nI'd put more responsibility on the reseller as much as the producer of these products. Staples already has a battery and ink collection effort in place, maybe they should start offering a used hardware collection service.\n\n"

In the minds of most people, the other PC manufacturers are all nameless, faceless industrial plants that shoot out box after box of blah. But Apple is cool.</cite>\n\nApple's positive reputation is a result of Apple very carefully making itself seem small. If you study attacks on American business over the last two centuries, you'll see that the insults appearing most often attack the size of the corporation above all else–big tobacco, big oil, etc. It's a nearly perfect attack, because the size of corporations is incredibly elastic, so the true size at which a big company is a bad company never needs to be defined.\n\nBy carefully pitching itself as an underdog Apple has made itself the sweetheart of the American public, the Yin to the Wintel yang. Target handles itself similarly, by avoiding the over-the-top behavior of Wal-Mart and donating profits to communities, it pitches iself as a good smaller alternative to big evil Wal-Mart.\n\nThis is why Greenpeace's attacks will ultimately have little impact. Apple need only make a few small changes and mention them at press conferences to convince people that it remains a valiant underdog. And because Apple still has relatively little real competition for products other than the iPod, it is unlikely that any changes Apple makes will spread to other companies.\n\nGoing after a larger PC maker, one without and underdog reputation—perhaps Dell—, would likely result in more changes being made to satisfy consumers, and due to Dell's size, large competitors may have reciprocated to avoid being the next target.\n\n"

One large data center can consume enough juice to power a small city of 30,000 to 40,000 people.  \nServer farms require massive cooling, and should be located way north, not in the desert.\n\nEnergy rationing is the only way to deal with global warming.\n\n"

Because if I can't make a living making fonts, I will be doing something much more damaging.\n\nSo perhaps user-generated content is the solution, if everyone is spending their time being an artist, rather than a consumer. Problem is the equipment needed to do it, and its short life-span, which makes every artist a consumer.\n\nIn fact, by the time artists have got their grant and paid for their hardware and meagre living expenses, there's nothing left in the kitty, so software piracy is de rigueur. So much arts money goes to infrastructure it seems, architecture and support staff dedicated to showcasing dead guys' stuff.\n\n"
