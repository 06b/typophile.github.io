  "content": "I have recently found some Cloister Initials, designed by Fredrick Goudy, cast in lead in a print workshop here in Dublin. I have printed off a proof sheet and they are in perfect condition. The question I want to raise is that:   \nCan I scan these in and create a font for use on the computer? Considering they are so old the is the copyright expired? And if not would it have covered the electronic medium? I would undoubtly give Fredrick Goudy all the credit and do not wish to cause any offence. I have not been able to source an electronic version myself.\n\n",
