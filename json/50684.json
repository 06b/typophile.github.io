I used the Helvetica, then drawn again, apply ornament and it became like this.  \nMay i have a question that : How could contemporary designer, especial typographer use historic elements and why they must care about history?\n\nthanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [H.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419052438/http:/typophile.com/files/H.jpg) | 408.3 KB |\n\n",

Especially alot of serif faces. A large portion of them have influences that come from a certain historic typeface. Be it Jannon, Garamond, Fell, Baskerville -- to give a few examples -- or just a more generic style such as 'Dutch', 'English', 'Didone', etc. Either as a revival, or just as an influence. I think this is the main historical element that is used in modern typography/type design.  \nWhy care? I think because typography and type design are crafts that have a very significant and long history behind them, so there is alot of work that can inspire modern type designers.\n\n"
