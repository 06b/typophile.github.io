I always thought the Y was custom, but I guess it's not.\n\nI just hate that they shut down [Opryland USA](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102080546/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opryland_USA) and turned it into \" [Shopryland](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102080546/http:/www.oprymills.com/)\" but kept the [Hotel](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102080546/http:/www.gaylordhotels.com/gaylordopryland/). Oh well, I guess the mall is pretty cool. I used to shop there a lot when I worked a couple of miles from there.\n\nAt least we've still got [The Grand Ole Opry](http://web.archive.org/web/20121102080546/http:/www.opry.com/), which splits its time between the Opry House and The Ryman. (My mom was an usher there in high school, as were both of my parents in college.)\n\nViva Nashvegas!  \nAnyway, to get back on topic, Augustea does look right. Nice work, Mike.\n\n"

Apparently they own a chain of hotels. I think there's one in Orlando. Gaylord used to be an entertainment company, but I think they're in the hospitality business now.\n\n"
