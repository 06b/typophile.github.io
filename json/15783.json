  "content": "Some good things are going on here with the Typophile codebase, not the least of which is inline image uploads. Only a few more things/bugs to check off our list before we can take the beta stripe off. To use the new image upload features you will need the Flash 8 player. Once you have it installed you will see an \"Insert image\" link on the post form. It's got a progress bar, no pop-ups, and no page reloads! Trust me, that's cool. On the downside, I'm sure we'll have to hear some whining about flash. Oh well. For Uppercase members, you might try editing your blog with ecto or any number of other blogging clients. More on this later.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018081417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ChristianMakingTypophile.jpg)\n\n",

But in England you have to do a test with a 500cc manual if you want to ride a proper motorcycle. America they seem to let you ride if you take a class. But in England you have to take a class just to be allowed to ride a 125cc scooter or motorcycle and that is as high as you can go until you do your full test and written test.\n\nI'm going to rent a Multistrada 620 if I can and also test the Honda CBR 600RR or 600F. the Honda sounds nice but the Ducati is cooler and a good city bike. The Suzuki Gn125 that I'm renting is a piece of junk.. clutch is loose it needs a bit of choke to start up and then has a bit of trouble keeping an idle. The gears can be a bit clunky and it can't hit 50mph even though I have done 53mph on my Vespa and the Vespa sounds better than the Suzuki.\n\n"
