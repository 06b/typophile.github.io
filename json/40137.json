Why not just the usual method? :-  \n [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310430](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015171257/http:/support.microsoft.com/kb/310430 \"http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310430\")\n\nPersonally, I think executing Flash as part of the login process is too fiddly, would annoy the users and slow down things down too much.\n\nIf you do wish to do this anyway, you’ll need to create a batch file that somehow executes the Flash in a window (not sure off hand how you’d do this), place this and the Flash file in a location accessible to all users, then set the batch to run as a login script for all users via a Group Policy in the Active Directory snap-in.\n\nMore on logon scripts:  \n [http://www.rlmueller.net/LogonScriptFAQ.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015171257/http:/www.rlmueller.net/LogonScriptFAQ.htm \"http://www.rlmueller.net/LogonScriptFAQ.htm\")\n\nAnd yes, it is kinda the wrong forum for this :) Try a Windows Administration forum or Microsoft’s support site.\n\n"
