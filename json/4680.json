An interesting piece of graphic design around an uninterestingly derivative typeface.   \n   \nOne wonders what the tragedy is supposed to be: what Michael Jackson has done, what he has become, or both? Being not very familiar with Jackson's visual style, I also wonder if the glasses are supposed to evoke Jackson, or perhaps Lennon?   \n   \nT\n\n"

Your metamorphosis in wanting to be something divine or saint.   \nThe glasses were alone for giving a grace in the visual.   \nThanx!!!!!   \n   \nMarcio\n\n"
