  "content": "It was announced in the news last week that [Circuit City](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013171426/http:/www.circuitcity.com/), a major US electronics retailer, has filed for bankruptcy protection amid a weak economy. According to [CNN](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013171426/http:/money.cnn.com/2008/11/10/news/companies/circuit_city/index.htm), the company plans to keep its remaining stores open through bankruptcy proceedings and encourages consumers to continue shopping at its stores.\n\nTypophiles, how can you as type and/or graphic designers help Circuit City in these pressing times?\n\n// TYPE BATTLE 29\n\nDesign a new logo (or logotype) for Circuit City. Extra points for creating additional branded examples to support your design.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi  \n- Color: We usually stipulate black and white, but not this week!  \n- Format: JPG or PNG\n\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE [TYPE BATTLES](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013171426/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles)\n\nThis is your chance to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike. Smack talk is encouraged.\n\nAs with any street battle, there is no panel of judges and no prize — only the ability to call yourself the best on the block.\n\nLink directly to this battle: **[http://www.typophile.com/battle29](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013171426/http:/www.typophile.com/battle29)**  \nLink to the battle directory: [http://www.typophile.com/typebattles](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013171426/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles \"http://www.typophile.com/typebattles\")\n\n",
