      "content": "Aw. The 3D thing probably isn't good.\n\nTo give another reason for why I'd like to prevent those crashes:  \nIn German typesetting, as is commonly discussed with regard to f-ligatures, connecting ligatures are forbidden across more than one part of a compounded word. Thus, say in the word _aufleben_ (to revive) –which is composed of the prefix _auf_ and the verb _leben_ (to live)–, since it's _verboten_ to set that with an \"fl\" ligature, but the crash looks bad too, most typesetters will then track that \"fl\" combination out until nothing's touching anymore, which then (depending on the font) tends to cause large white holes.  \nAnd those CALTs up there could help with similar situations involving \"r\"-induced crashes, keeping eager mouse cursors away from InDesign's kerning/tracking palette. If people find the CALT feature, that is.\n\nI like your \"lateral\" idea too though, Craig.\n\nChris: nice! I don't assume Eben's presentation is documented anywhere? Wish I could see that.\n\n"

      "content": "Nina wrote to me (thanks!) so I am going to reply here:\n\nI have been planning on posting something but MA at Reading is keeping me very busy and has changed my ideas a bit as well.\n\nThe main idea I would like to put across is that for a text design for both technical and typographic reasons 99% of the time it is going to be a bad idea to design a font so that it completely relies on special shapes and scripting. The same can be said about kerning. A design should be acceptable without kerning. Having designed and spaced things really well you can think about kerning. Having done the kerning you may actually be done. If not you may want to look at special shapes and CALT. But these shapes need to solve problems not achievable in some other way.\n\nHowever if your design is such that some combinations still seem overly awkward or just not as good as they could be - perhaps you have a wide f for reasons of style and want to support several languages- you may want to look at special contextual shapes.\n\nLet me address some of the combinations specifically: to begin with rn should simply work. If ro looks a little loose then so be it. CALT isn't always available. A good solution for rn should be your default. Refinements could be made for a r+o r+e and maybe another for r at the end of a word and or with some punctuation (eg r+. but not r+;).\n\nAbout the r in this thread: pull it back the arm of the r rather than bending it. I don't think the change to the y is working.\n\nAnother example is f+ other letters. Combinations like fi , fl, fh are classics, but even tougher is få fà fā fä and then tougher still is fï fî and then perhaps the very worst is fì.\n\nBut the design and its purpose and then fitting of that design that should drive your choice rather than filling a list of possible features to add. Whatever you do with special shapes should not be noticeable to a reader but should instead solve things so that a clash or gap that would otherwise be problem is avoided and reading is made easier.\n\nOne of these days I will get round to making a list available but I after I have worked on them and can comment.\n\nIt is worth remembering that good letter design, spacing, and even good document design are all more important than this.\n\nThere is more to say but I need to sleep!\n\n"

In order to let the shapes be clear you need a space between r and the other letter.

      "content": "Wow, thanks for the input.\n\nRe \"relying\" on the special effects ;-), honestly I don't think the crash in my example is horrid if it happens (like for Word users or whatever). I'd rather have the crash than a much-larger gap. That said, I think it's nice to be able to avoid the crash, sort of as a bonus. Dunno if that makes it gimmicky; but to be honest I don't quite get the purism. Should it really be better to generally make the spacing \"too loose\" just so the people without OT support won't see crashes? That strikes me as a more invasive measure that would also influence the nature of the design a lot more (as well, of course, as having differently shaped v/w/y glyphs).\n\nThat said, thanks guys for pointing out the too-tight \"rt\". I'm about to sort-of finalize the lc spacing, but that one I hadn't really seen. (I know, suboptimal timing.)\n\n<cite>\"About the r in this thread: pull it back the arm of the r rather than bending it. I don’t think the change to the y is working.\"</cite>  \nOh. If you have the time, I'd of course be very interested to hear why it's not working for you.  \nFWIW, my main thought behind trying it this way round was that I don't want the \"r\" to lose any of its \"r\"-ness (which is kind of a fragile concept to begin with) by making it narrower; but on the other hand I don't think a \"y\" stops being readable as a \"y\" if it's missing a serif. So the idea is remove the clutter/noise that doesn't carry meaning, to make the bit that does carry meaning stand out more and give them more room. If that makes any sense.\n\n<cite>\"But the design and its purpose and then fitting of that design that should drive your choice rather than filling a list of possible features to add.\"</cite>  \n\\*nod\\* That's also how this came along. I've been impressed with how much \"feed-back\" there has been from spacing back to the design of individual glyphs, like realizing some glyphs were very slightly too wide or something. With the \"r\" though, as I said above, I'd like it to keep its current width but am exploring possibilities to make it fit with the others. (Although I'm now thinking that I will probably space its right side a hair more loosely overall.)  \nCheers :)\n\n"

As for the rn rm combos, it might make sense to add the right-facing serif on the bottom of the r, but also to firm up the word shape at the baseline. Otherwise in a word like \"storm\" you get three sticks in a row before the closing serif on the m.\n\nThis alludes to some of the trickiness. I'm using my gut about what is needed, and I'm not sure I can trust my gut. It seems to be taking advantage of me in non-type matters!

Almost all of the lower case letters are either narrow (i,l) or have a design that permits balancing in \"four corners\" in the x-height region. Those letters that can't be balanced in the same way are: r v w y. You can \"cheat\" the r by making it narrow, but if you go too far it also looses it's \"r'ness\".\n\nSo I think that the same ideal of even color in the word just can't apply fully to these four letters as they are going to create \"holes\" of white space toward the bottom of the x-height area whatever you do. And so we have to go to a lesser standard. That's where I think Jost Hochuli's metaphor in Detail in Typography is useful. He says that 'light from above' is more effective than below. Another way of saying this is that on the lower case we give priority to the x-height spacing over the base line spacing.\n\nSo after torturing myself over this stuff I have got to a \"don't worry, be happy\" place, where I am just looking to get the spacing to look right in the x height area, and not worrying about the lower \"holes\", other than by having the characters not too wide.\n\nIn upper case you also additionally have problems with A F L T P. --Which if you add V,W,Y means that 8 letters, a third of the UC have unsolvable \"problems!\" The Carolingian Minuscule 'solved' those design flaws in those five Imperial Caps. But my feeling is that the Imperial Caps were never used in text anyway, but were display, used on signs and stone carving, and were wide and widely spaced to give priority to elegance of letter form. But acknowledging the inherent problems is to me reassuring because it explains why everyone who is sensitive to these issues feels a need to kern caps in display.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks William. Truth be told, they're not frustrations. This is just me going down the rabbit hole – which keeps getting deeper and darker. Learning to design type has been an engaging exploration to strange and wonderful places, with rare animals along the way, and Typophiles as great travel guides. And sometimes one needs a machete to clear some serifs out of the way!  \nCome to think of it, Hrant's jungle metaphor was probably pretty good. :-)  \nSeriously, of course I've made certain steps (like trying to space that \"r\") five times instead of once. But all of that helps me to learn and to see, which really is the point of the exercise (well apart from making this font :-) ).\n\nIt's an interesting angle that the Latin alphabet actively necessitates the presence of white holes. (It would be interesting to know if / how much these are even \\*helpful\\* for readability!) Makes me think of my first typography teacher at design school, who used to remind us to \"learn to live with our God-given holes\" (that of course never failed to crack us up).  \nIt hasn't occurred to me before to connect that to Hochuli's light thing – interesting. (Another way to look at it would probably be that since the upper half of the x-height is more important in reading than the lower half, that might reinforce the importance of good spacing at the x-line, rather than the baseline.)\n\nHowever one sees the theories though, I suspect the most difficult step involved is learning to \\*see\\* the right amount of space, and I'm definitely not quite there yet. But I am beginning to think that cerulean was probably right when he said somewhere up there that I'm caring more for \"even color\" than I should.\n\nThe rabbit hole continues…\n\n"

Even color has to take into account the script and language to the extent that you are only lessening jarring to the reader without creating a homogenous blend of sameness. Think of even color as a movement in a symphony--it has life and speaks to you with variety and dynamics. Excessive even color is more like Muzak--the mayonnaise of elevator music that barely distinguishes a melody.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>\"Think of even color as a movement in a symphony\"</cite>\n\nInteresting angle!  \nSounds like this is something that is greatly helped by experience? I must say I can't really hear the music of my spacing all that well yet.  \nBut I think I've been too afraid of \"spottiness\". Think I'll try to be a bit more daring :-)\n\nPS: I see what you mean re the language – I set a lot of different languages in this font and it was impressive to see how much the color/\"pattern\" differs. In Icelandic my font looks darker, and in Greenlandic it just looks incredibly wide. That's pretty exciting stuff. Not only does my font speak languages I can't read, it also alters its voice :)\n\n"

      "content": "I would put the musical analogy of even color differently. I think even color is more like keeping a regular beat. Then the varied rhythm and melody play against that underlying regularity. I think 'spottiness' is a distraction, just as a drummer who can't keep the beat steady is, or player putting an extra beat in a measure would be.\n\nThe \"underlying beat\" in type is illustrated by those Fourier transform pictures of text.\n\nEven color and an interesting dance of shapes are in tension, but not opposed. Great typefaces have both.\n\nThis is not to say that the alphabet is ever going to have perfect evenness of color. But if you don't get \\*relatively\\* even color the \"word image\" or \"bouma\" doesn't come together properly. As Mario Feliciano said to me, \"You want beautiful words, not beautiful letters.\" Relatively even color and rhythm is a big part of that.\n\nSo, Nina, I would say your concern for even color is very healthy for producing good type, though it's only one of several dimensions of type design.\n\n"

If yes: how much is enough?\n\nHow do you \"see\" it to find the right amount? I've tried blurring, but blurring makes me see a lot of splotches that I think are needed/unavoidable (like \"e\"s being busier than \"o\"s and such). I've tried looking at stuff from far away, which might be slightly better. But how do I know it's \"good\"?\n\nOh and, if anyone has a pointer to a good/comprehensible source to learn about those Fourier transforms, that would be much appreciated. This is about the twentieth time in my life that I wish I understood them. :-\\\n\n"

      "content": "\"Now I’m confused as to what even color actually \\*means\\*\"\n\nThis is the dilemma we all face. Though some of us may be more sure than others what it means to us individually, we should all share a healthy respect for the ambiguity that really exists there for all of us collectively. There is much to be said for the line, \"neither a borrower nor a lender be\" as a way to TRY to see. What I mean is, don't take away from one glyph more than it takes to be itself and don't give to another glyph more than would secure its identity.\n\nPersonally, I can't see a use for blurring or distortion techniques. I would rather set some text then put it away for a while (perhaps long enough to not remember why) and just read it on a new day with as naive an eye as you can muster. You pass the test if you read through it without stopping to bitch at yourself for the pattern :-) Also do this same thing for other type that is not your own--even quite revered type of the admired masters of the craft. You may find a surprise or two.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
