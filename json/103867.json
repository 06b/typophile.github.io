By keeping this open to everyone, we've getting way too much of the wrong content. (Read as: Type IDs, spam, etc) Starting today, the Typophile Blog will only be written by select authors to post typography related content, both original and showcasing other great sources on the web.\n\nIf you would like to be an author on the blog, send me a PM with links to your sample content and a description of how you'd like to contribute. Please understand that we'll keep it to a small circle at first as we shift back in the right direction.\n\nThanks-\n\n//jared\n\n",
