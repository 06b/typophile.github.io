  "content": "What display fonts would pair with Verdana body text?\n\nHi everyone,\n\nHope you don't mind me asking this question, and sorry if it's been asked before. I'm developing a site and since it has a dark background I decided to use Verdana as body text since it's clean and readable and has plenty of space. My question now is what font to use to go with for titles etc. I have to say that I'm going round in circles, as I've read lots of conflicting advice; some say to contrast with a different looking font and you shouldn't have two similar ones together, others say the opposite!\n\nAt the moment I'm considering Gill Sans Std Light, Lora, Georgia, Avenir Std Light, Sabon and Scala. Do you think these would be suitable, or would you recommend something else?\n\nMany thanks!\n\n",
