So-named for the fashion for Egyptian art and artefacts in Europe when Egyptian types were designed and used. Major Egyptian examples: [Memphis](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Memphis) and [Serifa](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014224106/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Serifa). Also applied to sans serif types of the same era.\n\n",
