Does anyone know who made it / what foundry, etc. I’d like to see more of the letters in the font, because the way the flourishes interweave at bottom left is distinctive for this sort of letter, and anticipates the pattern in the flourishes in Raffia.\n\n[http://www3.sympatico.ca/penneson/ALKMAAR\\_S.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110041947/http:/www3.sympatico.ca/penneson/ALKMAAR_S.pdf)\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks Tiffany. I am familiar with Nicolette Grey’s books on lettering, but I haven’t come across this particular specimen or others in the font there. This kind of letterform originated with the practice of drawing large versal with the same broadpen as used for writing text or notes in musical scores. Typographic versions of such versals are not unusual, but the raffia-like flourishes embodied in the bottom left and top tight corner of the specimen I showed are. Mostly the flourishes are of the type shown in the top left corner.\n\n"

Lots of historical stuff there. So far I haven’t seen my “Alkmaar A” (my name for it—the sample book I saw it in was published in Alkmaar). Most of the comparable material I looked at was downloadable for free (.ttf) and pulling the files into my old fontographer software showed hundreds of control points per glyph.\n\n"

      "content": "Yeah, those Moorstation-fonts are made ‘quick and dirty’ — presumably by scanning artwork and tracing these autostyle.\n\nRe your original question, I HAVE seen this letter(style) somewhere. In my mind it’s somehow connected with Albrecht Dürer, which would place it in the 16-hundreds. And I have a feeling that it has been republished in a Dover book, somewhere in the 70’s (eg 30+ years ago).\n\nBut this is all conjecture (and proof that the mind really withers with aging, haha).\n\n"
