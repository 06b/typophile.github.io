The stencil face for The Cross Hands looks like it’s based on Bodoni, but it’s not any of the Bodoni Stencils I know. The Bodoni for The King’s Head has this little protrusion on the “G” that throws me off.\n\nThanks for the assistance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803054101im_/http:/typophile.com/files/worlds_end_typography_6594.jpg)\n\n",
