I like the 'g' a lot\n\nI'd alter the top of the 'e' as it looks as if its leaning to the right a little, and adjust the baseline/x-height overshoot of the rounded forms such as 'o' 'e' etc. At the moment they appear to float above the baseline. Similarly the alignment of certain letters to the x-height is a bit variable, see for example the 'ng' and 'wn' combinations. The terminal of the 'j' could benefit from an approach closer, but not identical, to what you've done with the 'y' as it seems a little unsure of itself at the moment\n\nhope this is of some use\n\nI think the finished article will make for very comfortable reading.\n\n"

I would counsel against over-polishing it, as digital tools tend to encourage. The one thing that caught my eye (in a negative sense) in the test setting was the y. I wonder if the counter isn't just a tad small and contributing to the sensation that the long diagonal is too long ... in detail the terminal also seems tentative; unresolved in the context of the decisive and crisply cut serifs elsewhere in the face\n\n"

Here are a few areas to take a look at:\n\nh,m,n: the right legs seem a tad to bow-legged for my taste.  \nz: bottom is slightly long  \ny: agree with Point's above comments  \ndecenders: slightly too long I think. (will help the y too)\n\nThe next thing I think you should work on is the quality of the outlines. On the whole they look wobbly. You miss this at text sizes where things look fine, but look to the terminals of the s to see what I mean. Here are a few areas to look at:\n\ns: The spine looks fine. Nice and smooth curves. It gets ugly from there. The terminals (especially the top one) are very uncertain. Pick a line and go with it :-) Maybe look at your f/j terminals or z for inspiration. The curves in the counters are bad... too square. (Perhaps you adjusted the overshoot by dragging down the top points without adjusting the beziers?) Rework them so they flow with the same grace as the spine.\n\nt: upper left is wobbly\n\nThere are many places where I expect a single curve, but find an s shape.\n\nYou have three kinds of serf endings. Why? Some of the head serifs have totally rounded tips (p), some have corners and bowed sides, while others have corners and flat sides? You don't pick this up at text sizes but these are the kinds of things that make a quality face IMHO.\n\nI wouldn't mind seeing more pen in the punctuation ie not perfect circles.\n\nAll that said, this is very well done.\n\nRandy\n\n"

I've updated the pdf in partial agreement with them.\n\ns and z have been altered. the top terminal on s was a late-night accident, but the principle of uncharacteristically sharp terminals on s is I think defensible - though I've now regularised them. You were right about z. I'm sticking with long descenders: it's a slippery slope down to ITC Garamond once you start shortening descenders. t I have grudgingly unwobbled a little.\n\nThe serifs are now a bit more regular. I think they were more continuous in their variety than perhaps you noticed - all head-serifs, for example, were rounded, though some more than others - but, as you say, they now make a better impression at display sizes. Bow-legs are staying. Punctuation and dots on i/j I'm still not decided on. Any ideas as to how it's best done?\n\nGeorge\n\n"

It seems like a sub visible design element until the type gets to a size where this\\*feature\\* becomes odd. It just seems out of character. I don't see it being a result of ductus or of function or of style.\n\nDecenders: You've set with generous leading, because you must to prevent clashing. If this truely is for extended reading, consider heading down the slippery slope about 15%. It will still be elegant I promise.\n\nr: Did you modify this since last time? Hard to tell since I deleted the pdf I downloaded before. Anyhow, I like how you've dropped the connection down (compared to an n). And I like how you've tried to introduce more white space by raking back the head serif. I think you've overdone it a tad though. Consider bringing it back touch.\n\nPunctuation: Show some ductus, ie more diamond, less circle. It should reflect the angle of the \\*pen\\* used to create the leg of the n. It seems like slightly rounding the corners (or bowing the sides) will fit nicely with your serif treatments. You might start with the comma. Instead of a dot with a hook, try an arc as created by your \\*pen\\* And keep it nice and long. One critique I've received and seen repeatedly at critiques from Matthew Carter and Akira Kobayashi is \"make the comma longer for text.\"\n\nLooking forward to caps and italic.

The following is nit picky stuff: I like the diamond period (though it seems a little squished vertically -- like it wasnt' drawn with a pen at 45degrees in one stroke, upperleft to lower right. The comma is too angular imho. Try a more vertical hook (don't worry about keeping diamond shape at the top). This will have two benefits. Better spacing with letters like g.

I like how you've reinterpreted the classic Aldine by harmonizing it with notes from the endearingly wobbly Goudy; I particularly like its subtle, angular Jenson (Centaur, really) influence. Overall, it's a rather successful design, modulo a few letter sequences: the round, slightly bowed h/m/n combined with the angular e are stylistically jarring, for example -- Bembo vs. Centaur.

Don't be afraid to make some of your verticals lighter than others; there are some \"tricks of the light\" which should be compensated for, even at the rsk of consistency of construction.

So take my crit/questions with some ( or even a lot of ) salt!\n\nSo far all the comments I have read have dealt with letterforms rather than interletter spacing. Is it the case that eveybody is happy with that aspect of the font or is that being saved for later? When I look at the word 'child' the spacing does seem to be an issue. The l seems to be clinging to the i to escape the d. The w seems a bit over strong. It takes over. The c seems to be creeping to the lower left. The spacing of 'ya' in 'yard' seems to big. Overall it has the effect for me of reminding me of metal type that was set without kerning. The i in metal Bembo seems to creep to the a on it's right and away from an n on it's left. I wonder if philisophically you may be looking to relate closely to that history & approach.\n\nSeperately, the tail of the 'y' seems to draw a little too much attention because of the weight. The 'a' does too but for the opposite reason - it's terminal is so light.\n\nThe irregularity of the face does make it lively and pleasant ( other folks said organic, wobbly, pleasant warmth etc ).\n\nI also think that the ascenders & descenders could be less tall & deep with no ill effect.\n\nIt would be nice if you posted the old PDFs so I could see the progress as you went along.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

You could change your habits now of course...\n\nAs before take all of this with the understanding that there are lots of folks here who know far more than I but with that said:\n\nI was thinking about a face like this and it's connection to metal type and thinking that it would be a good idea now to decide if you are going to make different designs for different sizes, something I think would add to the value of the project, and if so pick a size to work into first. Then you can make it behave for that size and not try to straddle to many purposes at once.\n\nI also think that it's time for you to start thinking about interletter spacing and shapes at once. Even though you have been doing a great job in general there is just as much to accomplish in the spaces where letters are not as in where they are. And I don't just mean the bowls & counters. And I don't just mean kerning, I mean that you should design the spaces that occur in between the letters. It's a different way of looking at the whole thing. Some folks would say that letter shapes should be done with those spaces in mind. I would be in that crowd.\n\nThe used to be a nice teaching flash file on Typophile from Jonathan Hoefler that dealt with this.

My sense was that you were thinking about evaluating the type at several sizes and so I started to think that you were attempting to straddle 9, 12 & 15 or something which could only lead to misery. I see now that is not your intent. Chris Lozos recently said that rather than working on multiple weights (extra thin, thin, bold, extra bold or whatever) of a font it might be better to start by making the same font but cut for several intended use sizes. I think he is right about that. Even if you are designing for just one specific size.\n\nAbout relative stem weights. No source is completely oracular. Casting about for a source that dealt with the idea of interletter spacing that site was the best I could find quickly.\n\nCertainly there is a problem of overpoliteness in lots of digital faces. Adobe faces seem to exemplify that. And certainly you are well on your way to avoiding that problem.\n\nI am not inked by your type by the way. It's pleasing to me. It just lacks a certain virtue I would love to see it have. It's a virtue that is pretty rare and one that I am still developing my eye for myself.\n\nBecause I am after a little more harmony in interletter spacing, some of what I am after could be construed as suing for that same well mannered but overly polite quality. But I don't think you have to sacrifice color & warmth ( aesthetic virtues) or readability ( a use virtue) to achive better harmony.\n\nAbout this spacing issue you said: that’s why the head-serifs are how they are.\n\nIt isn't the serifs that concern me but the actual amount & shape of the white space between glyphs. Not the black but the white. Look at the word 'was' The w is drifting away. You could say but the serif... but that isn't the issue. The issue is the design of the w ( and a), and the design of their relationship - the design of the interletter space. Theoretically the design of a given a or w could be perfect. As long as the other letters harmonize with it. But it is easier I think to design the harmony in the first place.\n\nI don't want to say make your 'a' like this or 'w' like that because that just deals with one or two specific places where something is happening. If I convince you at all ( which i might not ) I hope it will be to look at the type and judge it in an additional way.\n\nHrant has influened my thinking about this a great deal when he wrote about Legato. (Scroll way down)  \n [http://typographi.com/000969.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204032024/http:/typographi.com/000969.php \"http://typographi.com/000969.php\")\n\nHe & others have also talked about this idea and related ideas using terms like 'bouma' and 'notan'. You could seach for these terms on typophile & see what you think.\n\nHere is what the designer said about Legato  \n [http://www.evertbloemsma.nl/legato/about\\_legato/about\\_legato.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20150204032024/http:/www.evertbloemsma.nl/legato/about_legato/about_legato.asp \"http://www.evertbloemsma.nl/legato/about\\_legato/about\\_legato.asp\")\n\n\\>On the other hand, I personally feel that a “real” text face has to have a certain ugliness when viewed large.\n\nI agree.

      "content": "Hmmm I am not convinced about this yet. Rhythm which is regular in nature as in 'musical' would probably need to be constant or regular which is what I think you mean when you say 'continuous'. Continuous might just mean continuing with varied pace. But rhythm can also be irregular. Obviously this is bad in a heartbeat, and probably alot of music but other natural events have more complicated structures - like reading. But that irregularity & complexity don't preclude rhythm in my mind.\n\n\\> Now, some people will tell you that rhythm does not depend on motion.\n\nThat sounds pretty specious to me!\n\nIf somebody made a claim for visual rythym and wanted to allow for a wide variety of motions or complex motions a opposed to a single motion I would be willing to think about that.\n\n\\> reading is an aggregation of discrete fixation-events\n\nLight is considered both a particle & a wave. Reading is not light (obviously) but I am not sure that fixation events which occur between saccades preclude rhythm. Also, saccades are movement. Even if there is no motion/rhythm during a fixation event, something I am not sure is true yet\\*, there is the saccade itself.\n\nWhat makes me skeptical of the idea of rhythm isn't the objections you have brought up so far. It's the issue of 'frame'. In musical terms the 'frame' is very narrow. A moment of conciousness. In reading I wonder if the area of focus isn't too broad for the term to apply well.\n\nSo am am ultimately ambivalent about the term.\n\n\\> Quite often a stubborn/romantic apologism\n\nRomance is stubborn. It makes me laugh happily when you write stuff like this. ;-)\n\nLook, we are hijacking George's thread.\n\nGeorge, I think your term 'interractions' is decent and covers the needed idea. But Hrant's term 'Notan' seems the richest and most satisfying to me for many many reasons not least of which because it is a term which is all about looking, noticing, and making your own judgement - a responsibility that can't ever be shirked in favor of typographic dogma of any stripe.\n\n\\*Hrant, If I am going to keep argueing with you about this kind of stuff I had better start reading some primary scientific literature!\n\n"

Your habit of overwriting the old PDF makes it impossible for other folks to follow along & benefit for your process afterwards. Which is of course VERY naughty as I said before!\n\nWhat I notice is that the words seem to gel better now. They seem less restless. The eccentric qulatity of the c and e ( the wayward lower left) is not as noticable now.\n\nThe 'w' still seems like less of a team player than I would ideally like. It seems too wide, too tall, and to plunge below the base line too far.\n\nThe 'a' is in contrast, a bit to much of a shrinking violet. I keep wondering if the top needs to take a bit of the pluck of your 'r' or if the bowl might be bigger, or maybe both.\n\nWhat a is your a modeled after?\n\nWhat do you think?

I've found that Griffo and, to an almost exagerrated extent, the draughtsman of Monotype Bembo observed the same dual-axis principle. It gives sparkle despite low contrast, which is now the most notable thing about this design, and it helps, as in FF Legato, to unite the word-image.\n\nThe unterminated 'a' is found in Jenson's and Gill's types, and also in Lutetia.\n\nSorry about not posting old PDFs, I've put up one previous version along with the current update.  \nGeorge\n\n"
