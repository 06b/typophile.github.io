      "content": "Berthold's Block Condensed, designed by H. Hoffmann in 1908, has matching letter forms but is a heavier weight than the poster's heading: \\_Bekanntmachung\\_ [notice]. The Woellmer foundry produced it's own version of Hoffmann's typeface and sold it under the name of Hermes Grotesque Semi-bold. See the specimens of Block and Hermes at p255 of Jaspert's \\_Type Encyclopaedia [1970]\\_. Hermes is slightly lighter than Berthold's Block Condensed and the weight and letter widths seems to be an pretty much an exact match to \\_Bekanntmachung\\_. However, there are minor differences in the mid stroke of the letter \\_a\\_ and the arms of \\_k\\_. Hermes was digitized by by Tagir Safayev and is sold by Paratype  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/hermes/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417015552/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/hermes/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/hermes/\")  \nParatype's Hermes would be a better match for the weight of the headline and would fit the font point size used in the poster, but Block is closer for \\_a\\_ and \\_k\\_ letter forms.  \nSo you have a choice between two fonts with an equally Germanic Sans Serif character of the era. Either way, it seems you could have a very effective poster.  \nDon\n\n"
