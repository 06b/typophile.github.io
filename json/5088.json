And great modulation on the tight joins.   \n   \nUC: \"C\" might be wide; I'd raise the bar of the \"E\", and maybe make it slightly thinner; the \"F\" isn't working; killer \"K\"!; not sure about the \"Q\"; great form on the \"S\", but maybe a bit wide; \"X\" seems too strong; amazing Pilcrow; the \"N\"-tilde is too cool.   \n   \nNums etc.: I'd make the square brackets concave; the \"1\" and \"4\" seem a bit strong; \"6\", \"8\" and \"9\" need modulation.   \n   \nlc: the \"e\" needs modulation; great \"fi\"; make the eszet sharp on the inside.   \n   \nOther: great Yen; amazing \"@\"! but make the belly-button bigger; great Section.   \n   \nEduardo, you really have a knack for inventive shapes.
