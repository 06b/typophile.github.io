      "content": "What Bob said.  \nGiven the date, it could have been done using an IBM Selectric typewriter, which had its own proprietary fonts that were similar but not identical to \"real\" fonts. In the era before personal computers, low-budget alternative publications often used the IBM Selectric because it was a cheap alternative to commercial typesetting. The headline at the top of the page was clearly produced using a typewriter, which is why I suspect the Selectric for the text that is too small to identify.\n\n"

      "content": "The IBM Electronic Selectric Composer was introduced in 1975 and was able to produce very nice text for the time. It had a number of fonts and one was a nice sans, as I remember, that looked good with Transfer-Letter Helvetica heads. Some of those Composer type faces have pictures on the web somewhere.\n\n"

      "content": "Good idea Victor. We are fortunate that Luc Devroye has a page on IBM Selectric and Selectric II Type Fonts [http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725100127/http:/luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html \"http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-44934.html\") There were quite a few more, even including an excellent simplified version of Engravers Old English. But the most likely possible candidates for this image are mentioned in Luc Devroye's page, i.e.: \\_Adjutant\\_, \\_Advocate\\_, \\_Delegate\\_, \\_Bookface72\\_, \\_Delegate\\_ [no image, but a specimen I have seen looks similar to Prestige but seems to have a higher x-height and a more stylish design], \\_Elite72\\_, \\_Orator\\_, \\_Pica72\\_, \\_Prestigeelite\\_, and \\_Presigepica72\\_. Unfortunately, most are not digitized, and those digitized are likely to have been revised from the original monospace letter forms to proportional ones with a wider \\_m\\_ and \\_w\\_ etc.  \nShould try and compile a list of the digital versions.  \nFor example, Prestige is Alix by Matthew Butterick for Font Bureau. [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AlixFB/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725100127/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AlixFB/ \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/AlixFB/\") This might work for your image.  \nDon\n\n"
