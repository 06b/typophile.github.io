      "content": "Although Fournier is known to have been inspired by the RdR in making his own fonts, his stuff was much more conventional in nature. The RdR style is very distinctive: it is a \"constructed\" letter, with vertical stress, high contrast, a smallish x-height, and most notably double serifs on the ascenders. It also exhibits a short line on the lc \"el\" (which apparently Grandjean introduced because the constructivism was leading to confusable forms), but to me that's not critical to its nature.   \n   \nHere's a metal RdR-style font, the \"Types de Charles X\" of the Imprimerie Nationale:   \n   \n ![Charles](http://web.archive.org/web/20051125084307im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/33237.gif)   \n   \nBut it doesn't have the double serifs on the ascenders.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I'm not really a revivalist, but when an entire category of type design is so neglected, there's certainly good reason to at least make one digital instance. Like in Thom's Thai project it would be perfect. But I wouldn't revive the RdR itself, it was still only a formative effort (look how conventional the italics are for example) - I would revive the later, higher form, done by Tuleu (at Deberny) - a design as obscure as it is phenomenal.   \n   \nArnhem: You're not saying it's an RdR, are you?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

He took the RdR style to its pinnacle\\*, only to be undercut by a double whammy: the Arts & Crafts revival of Morris; and Gustave Peignot's obsession with display typography: the Deberny and Peignot houses merged in 1923, and Gustave's charisma and business sense caused all of the wonderful old Deberny text faces to get tossed out.   \n   \n\\* The italic is staggering in its purity.   \n   \n\\> part of the climate Arnhems roots were reacting to   \n   \nWithout re-reading that New-Series piece, I guess what you're saying then is that Arnhem is an Elzevir.
