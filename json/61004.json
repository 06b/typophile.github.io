  "content": "Hi, I'm looking for a swash italic to use as the nameplate for a newsy features opinion student mag I'm designing. The inside is all Mercury Text & Display for headlines and for the nameplate I'm vaguely drawing on inspiration from the New York Magazine's swash italic all-caps nameplate. Anyway, the attached image looked particularly nice; any ideas what it is? Thanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013232711im_/http:/typophile.com/files/swash_5678.jpg)\n\n",
