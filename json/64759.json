I don't know if it was ever digitized.\n\nBut my question is this: given the popularity - and evident merits - of Times Roman, why hasn't someone (or has someone, outside of my meagre knowledge) produced, as it were, a \"Times Book\" in which not only the descenders are lengthened, but so are the ascenders (slightly), with the lower case reduced slightly in size relative to the upper case so as to moderate the x-height to a \"normal\" value, and the stroke widths then also adjusted (made heavier in the lower case, or lighter in the upper case, or both, so that the ratio between them remains at the appropriate value)?\n\nTimes is a beautiful font, but if those characteristics of it which save on paper (the vice of Mammon perhaps becoming the virtue of wise stewardship of our forests) can fairly be recognized as a problem, why can't this problem be solved, so that the fullness of the beauty of Times may be appreciated - and the spirits of both Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent find peace?\n\n",

In other words, we say that a typeface has a small x-height if it is small in relation to cap height.

What you are saying, Hrant, is that any typeface with long extenders has a small x-height, according to which logic Minion does not have a large x-height.

First of all, a font's x-height is certainly not the only player in apparent size. But also, if two fonts have the same absolute x-height but one's ascenders are taller, you need more leading; and that puts pressure on the vertical proportions, hence the point size. All these dimensions are linked, and cap height is one of the very smallest factors. You're allowing a font's size-on-body to completely throw off any valid evaluation.

Most book designers who specify Times  \n\\> should not even be designing a toilet paper dispenser.\n\nI don't know if I can really dispute that statement. After all, a lot of books do simply use Times Roman by default, without much thought being put into their design.\n\nBut I will at least point out that Times Roman has been used in some very well-designed books. The Codebrakers by David Kahn, from Macmillan impressed me very favorably with how Times Roman looks when used well. (They did get the chapter heading for the chapter titled \"Russkaya Kriptologia\" badly mangled, even though the italic page headings were right... nobody's perfect.)\n\n\\>\\> Publishers and distributors report no adverse sales effects.  \n\\>\\> Readers don’t have a problem with the face.\n\n\\> You know no such thing - there are no reference points!  \n\\> This is pure, baseless fabrication.\n\nIt's true that he is being... anecdotal. However, I think that it can be safely said that except for the few who take an interest in such things, most people don't pay much attention to fonts.\n\nIf a book is set in Univers or Optima, people will notice that it's trying to be \"contemporary\", so that usually happens in books on art and design.\n\nIf a book is set in one of the condensed Scotch Romans from the 19th Century - or even in the vastly superior Binney & Ronaldson Oldstyle, they'll notice it's old fashioned.\n\n\"Typeset\" the book on an IBM Executive typewriter, and they'll notice there's something fishy right away.\n\nOtherwise - Bembo, Palatino, Times Roman, Caledonia, Baskerville, Century Expanded... if the responsible parties have made a reasonable effort to choose a halfway-decent serif font, and an appropriate point size given the font's x-height, a column width not stupendously long, and a little leading if necessary... and they will just go off merrily reading without noticing the effort that has been made on their behalf.\n\nWhatever may be wrong with Times Roman, I strongly doubt that it is so seriously wrong as to percolate into the consciousness of the general public. It would indeed be kind of nice if Times with long descenders were seen more often - given that 12 point Times on a computer is 10 1/2 point Times with 1 1/2 points leading or thereabouts _anyways_, it's not as if we would have broken kerns falling out of our laser printers - but I think someone could set a mass-market paperback in Corona with hardly anyone noticing anything was amiss.\n\n"

It does have design limitations - so it is unsuited to the kind of typography where one would want Centaur instead - and it has been misused, as can happen to any font. Times, optically condensed by 10%, is something that deserves the kind of obloquy you appear to be hurling at the font in general. But all of this is just my personal taste, and you therefore do not have to account for why your taste may differ from mine - nor I for why mine differs from yours.\n\n"
