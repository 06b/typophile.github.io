I’m sure previews of imminent releases fit into the latter category somehow Jackson-by all means don’t read them if you’re not interested. I always make sure to lable a preview clearly.\n\nThat saaid (and also not trying to be a ’jerk’) Lowndes is now released [here on Myfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103094219/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/gatf/lowndes/). Glad you like it Charles.\n\n"
