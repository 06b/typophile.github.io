What are some good typefaces to set this text in?  \nThe basic requirements here are that it be monospaced and readable.  \nI noticed that some popular choices are Monaco and Andale Mono. What other alternatives are there?\n\n [‹ Segmented fonts?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103050823/http:/typophile.com/node/40478 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help with Poster Design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103050823/http:/typophile.com/node/40296 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Lots of great information!\n\nI’m also considering TheSans Mono by Luc(as) de Groot. Seems a pretty nice typeface.\n\n"
