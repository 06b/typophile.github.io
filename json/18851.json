Everything works fine in Adobe, but when I try using it in word, or previewing it in character map, I get what you see below. (just square boxes where there should be characters) I am pretty sure it has to do with the unicode encoding. What am I doing wrong? Thanks for any help you may provide.\n\nI am using Fontlab 5 and windows XP.\n\n [‹ OSX: CT, Hinting?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629050521/http:/typophile.com/node/18868 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Value of fsType ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070629050521/http:/typophile.com/node/18777 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
