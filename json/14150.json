Any idea on which font they might have used as a starting point for those art cards whenever Batman would fight someone? BIFF, BOOM!!!\n\nHere's an image I found to look at in case you haven't seen the show in 40 years.\n\n[Tv Acres](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.tvacres.com/images/batman_kapow.jpg)\n\njoey\n\n",

      "content": "I thought about this topic for a little while after it went by so quickly with only one suggested response. There may have been other threads in Typophile that brought this up, and I didn't want to start a new topic, but I wanted to pay a little homage to the lettering artists of pop culture.\n\nHaving spent many, many hours early in my career hand lettering headlines, and using lettering devices (Varigraph Headwriter, Leroy Pantograph) to create ads, I've always admired lettering artists who had such a facility and love for the craft. Many never created a \"typeface\" nor had to, since their task was focused on specific context, while type designers generally look towards broader context usage.\n\nWithout getting to deep into explanation, here are several links from the ridiculous to the sublime: (note -- each link opens in it's own new window, so don't forget to close them)\n\n[Dick Sprang's Batman \"WHAM\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.supermanartists.comics.org/batman/Sprang.htm) 1944 (bottom right frame of strip)\n\n[Bud Sagendorf's Popeye \"SPLAT\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.comics.org/graphics/covers/541/400/541_4_004.jpg)\n\nOpening film title for [Flash Gordon](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/flashgordon.ws/trip_to_mars.htm) plus early posters\n\n[Wes Wilson Filmore poster 1966](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.olsenart.com/bg029.html) \"Far out, man!\"\n\n[Photo-lettering, Inc.](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.photo-lettering.com/) collage of early sample books  \n [and a few lettering artists that became legends](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/photolettering/)\n\n[Balloon Tales articles on current comic lettering field](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.balloontales.com/articles/index.html)\n\n[Jim Parkinson](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.typedesign.com/logos/esqu.html), lettering artist, logo designer and type designer extraodinaire\n\nThe sublime work of [Ricardo Rousselot](http://web.archive.org/web/20141112043517/http:/www.grupoerre-rousselot.com/)\n\n-------------------------------------------  \nYes, I'm old, but I'm back in style!\n\n"
