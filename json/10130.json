      "content": "This is pretty interesting.   \nSome of the shapes need a bit of taming (like the \"4\") but I would actually emphasise the ambiguity overall; specifically I'd increase the \"componental\" aspect, for example how the \"B\" is a bracket plus a \"3\". I think you can get an interesting texture with a line of type set in a font like that.   \n   \nThe other thing is that the numerals are slanted in an otherwise upright alphabet.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

The M and W feel a little squeezed to me in a font that is so open and airy--would you consider widening them a bit?   \nOtherwise, a great hybrid combining a very old historical script with a stereotypically modern typestyle--I look forward to seeing how it develops! Keep up the great work.   \n--Murray\n\n"
