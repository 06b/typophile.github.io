  "content": "I am a young adjunct professor at a community college, and today I was telling my class about the importance of using curly quotes or typographer's quotes. Well, one of my students said that she was told by a 'prestige designer' to always flip the quotes so the heavy sides are on top. Then another student said she was told to flip the quotes so the heavy sides are on the bottom. I have looked through my books and searched the internet for an answer because I have never heard this before. Is there any truth in what they are saying? I would appreciate any input on this because it is mind boggling. I've attached a GIF to demonstrate what they are referring to.\n\n",

It happens all the time.\n\nWhen I asked a student last year if she'd had any design tutor feedback on her (truly execrable and off-brief) work, she told me in all seriousness '...but my mum thinks it's great!'\n\nMiss Tiffany is right; the default version above is the correct way of setting true quotes.\n\nIf your students reckon they know more about setting type correctly than you do, then you could try running [Marian Bantjes type test](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214062610/http:/www.thinkingwithtype.com/) on 'em.\n\nIt includes the following question\n\n<cite>19. True quotes<br>\na. always look like little sixes and nines<br>\nb. have different looking opening and closing quotes<br>\nc. are always curly<br>\nd. are straight up and down</cite>\n\nWhich, although it doesn't provide a straight answer to your question, should reveal enough of your students ignorance to allow some clarification and correction to occur.\n\n"

On pages 86/87, Robert Bringhurst goes into detail about what quotation marks should be used when and where. I take it you are after the British/American version in which case you already have your answer. But it is interesting to know that other countries use them quite differently, SWeden for instance has them set “ “, so the same mark used twice, in Germany the first quote mark is set on the Baseline. And so on..\n\nIf you want to impress your students then digest this book. Its a good source of details to keep them quiet,\n\n"
