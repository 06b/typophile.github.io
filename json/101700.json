  "content": "Hello,  \ni`m doing research on typefaces used on railway stations across Europe. I found this two examples from beginning of 2oth century (Austro-Hungarian Empire). I wonder if these are custom made? Or does any one know for simmilar typeface from that period?  \nAll thoughts are welcome.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106094744im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile_6406.jpg)\n\n",

However as you will see, its no longer listed among their fonts, but if it's close enough, you may be able to email them.\n\nThis is the bio from myfonts, so one of the other designers may have created the font and left the company.
