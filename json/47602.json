  "content": "greetings earthlings. i'm getting started on a large publicity campaign for a science film about atoms and molecules.\n\ni'm seeking recommendations for fonts, font families, or font designers/vendors with a distinctive science/sci-fi/futuristic feeling.  \nwhen i use these keywords in myfonts.com i get surprisingly same-old, blocky, 80's looking examples.\n\nany recommendations ? i'll be choosing a few to experiment with.\n\nfully legit protocols will be followed, including obliging the distributor/client to license their own copies (after design approval) for extended packaging use.\n\n",

      "content": "It's really hard to recommend futuristic fonts, since there have been so many different perceptions of what type will look like in the future, almost all of which, in a different context, look very retro. My favorite version of the future is a movement back towards Art Deco, so something like [Mostra](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000122) or [Anna](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-anna/) could be what you're looking for. Anna is pretty prevalently used in Tomorrowland in the Disney parks.\n\n[Bank Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/) is pretty popular for conveying a futuristic feeling, but it may be too closely associated with Chipotle and sci-fi movies.\n\nYou could go for something like [Computer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?params%5Bboolean%5D=and&params%5Bsearchtype%5D=fonts&search%5Btext%5D=computer), which has kind of a 1960s perception of the future.\n\n[Handel Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.myfonts.com/search?params%5Bboolean%5D=and&params%5Bsearchtype%5D=fonts&search%5Btext%5D=handel%20gothic) is what the future looked like in the early 80s.\n\nOr you could do the ironic \"World of Tomorrow!\" look, which you can achieve with almost anything from [FontDiner](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.fontdiner.com/).\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

Shift's Beta could be used even for short texts.\n\nDr Nob by Ian Anderson (presented in FUSE 6) could be a tool to construct \"molecular\" letetrforms or patterns for your designs, although FUSE packages seem to have become difficult to buy. I have found something [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015174210/http:/www.fontshop.de/sukr.php3?ch=%2Ffontproductdetailc.php3%3Fns%3D1%26sns%3D0%26ns%3D1%26sns%3D0%26co%3D%26co2%3D%26id%3D6034160).\n\nAnd Eidetic Modern from Rodrigo Cavazos' Psy-Ops, could be a good idea for text.\n\n"
