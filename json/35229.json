Maybe [Mercury Text](http://web.archive.org/web/20150313163257/http:/typography.com/catalog/mercurytext/index.html) (or Display, depending on the size you want). [Enigma](http://web.archive.org/web/20150313163257/http:/www.typography.net/type/enigma.htm) might work, although it's a bit more out there.\n\n"

That said, since Cambria has become the default serif typeface for Microsoft Office, I am afraid it will become banal to the eyes of people who aren't as savvy about typography.\n\nI was hoping to use a font for my personal documents (résumé and such) that can act as a signature in itself, while remaining very readable and professional.\n\nI'm leaning towards ITC Slimbach at the moment.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for clearing that up - I think your original comment got lost in translation somewhat. :-) You're right that we'll be seeing a lot more of Cambria in the future, but as it's not the default text face (currently) in Office, then it won't be as over-used as say Calibri in the short-term. You might be able to stretch 12 to 18 months before feeling you need to change.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"

      "content": "I suppose this may not be the case over where you are, but here in the States, ITC Slimbach has started to appear everywhere in a lot of what I would call mid-level and novice design work. It seems to have been on the rise during the past year or so. I don't know why (since it was released back in 1987). To my eye, it's a lot more overexposed than Cambria.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
