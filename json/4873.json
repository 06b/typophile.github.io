This OS is great, has something (speed, some rough edges...) to be improved, but it is great. The problem is that all the \"big guys\" doesn't like Apple too much. The applications on X are few and you cannot use it for your everiday work. Adobe, Quark and Macromedia are slow and dubious about supporting the new OS. Fontographer probably will never be ported as I read (between lines) on the macromedia forum. I think that Type designer community should start an open project with donation to self build a new font software for OSX, wich has a lot of power and beauty to give to a software like this one. I hope to have feedbacks from all of you.   \nLuke   \n   \nPS: sorry for my bad english\n\n"

I also tried illustrator 10, a thing of a beauty but not a speed demon. Someone should shake Quark but, dunno how. Aniway InDesign (wich I prefer over XPress) is coming on X (with its version 2.0). I agree with you that it's a matter of time, but I think Apple has no lots of time. They need OSX to catch up and to do so they need apps. Running apps in Classic mode is not very nice, so my bucks goes only to ported products, I LOVE that \"new\" platform.   \nTo Christian:   \nI dunno how to start the thing, but I am ready to donate too. We should probably start a website to promote the thing and see if any developer will get on board. This website is something related to Hoefler Type Foundry, could be a good to have the masters as testimonials. I have read on Pyrus website that they are available to developers to share knowledge at reasonable fees. My question is, why aren't they doing the OSX version? Probably someone will answer.

You will need Extensis Suitcase, which will run fine on Freehand 10. I use FH10 as wellas Fh 5.5 (5.5 has less features and runs faster ) with FH 5.5 Extensis does simply not work, by that I mean it will not render screen fonts so it is hard to see what you are doing untill you convert to paths.

Also, Fonts installed under MacOS X are not automatically available to applications that are running under Classic.   \n   \nI'd advise on getting a copy of Suitcase which will help with arranging big collections. Plus it offers a bridge between font collections under X and Classic modes.   \n   \nIncidentally, I've heard of certain problems relating to kerning (lost kerning pairs) and type rendering over certain type sizes - might be worth Googling it.   \n   \nAs for the font library, I dont think you will have a problem.
