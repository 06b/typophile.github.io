The client uses VAG rounded std, but offcourse i’m not keen on using this for text, only for display.\n\nCan anyone recommend a family (serif/sans: light-regular-bold) which combines well with VAG?\n\nThank you,\n\nMarco\n\n [‹ Dino dos Santos' Glosa Typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907011236/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46993 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [24 typeface you must know ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907011236/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46723 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
