  "content": "Found this font when looking for something that would look good for a decking company. The image shows 2 different styles of the same font family.  \nOriginally came across \"Black Ops One\" font which is similar and then found this which I liked better. I was even able to download a pdf with all the different versions of this font which I can't find anymore. I seem to remember the font name had something to do with a brand name, maybe automotive related? Any help is appreciated.  \nThanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182839im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_6209.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Super Duty \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [kthomps5](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317182839/http:/typophile.com/user/175823 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",
