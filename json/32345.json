I'm interested in a [humanist](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/humanist) font that's classic, clean, and sturdy enough to be a workmark at different scales - what's your favorite?\n\nMany Thanks\n\n",

Other than PMN Caecilia, the humanist slabs off the top of my head are [TheSerif](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/index_neu.html), Chaparral, and the brand new [Soho](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.linotype.com/3273/soho.html?PHPSESSID=34e1c19945b7c8e50a9d4660378eb6fc). I also can't resist throwing in [Rayuela](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/pampatype.com/php/English/Tipografias_RR.php?secc=cara&menu=menu_T_C.html&sub1=sub1_T_RR_C.html&sub2=sub2_T_R_C.html&pag=pag_T_RR_C.html), which, though not really a slab-serif, does have a distinct humanist quality, greater than that of most non-script typefaces.\n\nHope these non-sans typefaces could be useful alternatives; I don't mean to hijack the thread. To atone, here's a thread purporting to offer a list of the best humanists sans-serifs: [http://typophile.com/node/13281](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/typophile.com/node/13281 \"http://typophile.com/node/13281\") .

The humanist model of calligraphy is what influenced the earliest [Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Roman) ( [whiteletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/whiteletter)) types, particularly those of [Nicholas Jenson](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Nicholas%2520Jenson). The [Vox-ATypI classification](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Vox-ATypI%2520classification) system uses the term humanist to refer to the [Venetian](http://web.archive.org/web/20100207003327/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Venetian) model of type.\n\n"

      "content": "Doesn't sound wrong to me, Paul. But I rarely see \"humanist\" bandied about in regard to serifs (with the exception of typefaces inspired by Italian Renaissance type), maybe because many more serifs are \"humanist\" by your ductal-logic definition than are sans- and slab-serifs. I'd guess that this comes from the early slab-serifs and sans-serifs not being too concerned with ductus as far as I know until Johnston and Gill in the early 20th c. and Frutiger in 1968. So to say \"humanist\" doesn't separate a group out as much for serifs as it does for other type genres.\n\n"
