It is just often wrongly used. For example on American letter size paper it, as a very condensed face, produces lines that are way longer than ideal. According to Bringhurst, the ideal is around 66 characters per line, and Times at 12 pt on letter paper with one inch margins is way longer than this. Courier is actually better on such a long line.   \n   \nMinion is a Garamond with large x-height and also quite condensed, which is perhaps why it is so useful and used. Is it too condensed?

Your observation that Slimbach's ambition was to be usable where Times is usable is insightful.   \n   \nI didn't mean to say that Minion was a copy of Garamond, only that Garamond seems to be its point of departure; it has calligraphic touches and opens up the a and e, etc. But there is still a noticable resemblence to Slimbach's Adobe Garamond - a more beautiful face, but not as adaptable. 'Myfonts' classifies Minion as 'Garald', which I guess is the term I should have used.   \n   \nAs you are the designer of very impressive Sabon Next, I would love to hear what you think are the strengths and weaknesses of Minion!   \n   \nHrant, of course Courier is not a text face. It is a typewriter face, but I find it telling that it is still widely used on letter sized paper. I much prefer the European A4 paper, which is narrower; but even it is wide.

It has been proven that, because we read not single letters but by jumping in saccades over the printed page, that too short lines and too long lines are obstacles for the reader. Although this depends strongly on the content (a lexicon could have shorter lines as you're not reading a longer line but scan for information, a letter could have longer lines because it is shorter than a book text and -- sometimes -- more personally involving) and proportion of the medium itself, the basic rule applies to letter-sized and A4-publications as well, which is why on a standard letter page I almost never use the full width but try to proportionally find a good place for 55 to 75 cpl :-).   \n   \nAnd yes, Courier is, if the margins are chosen correctly, pretty much exactly 55 to 65 characters per line on A4 in 12 pt. It's not a highly accurate prophecy of the printed page, though, as Courier and such are monospaced and a proportional typeface will behave a bit differently -- but I think all in all it's a solid enough guess to work practically. But of course you can achieve the very same effect these days with any other proportional font by just modifying the size margins accordingly -- it's nicer to read and you can actually use a proportional font (the text will, of course STILL flow differntly in Quark and InDesign, but at a Word-Document using the same typeface and the same characters per line should be just as accurate, if not even moreso than the Courirer-technique.   \n   \nCourier, these days, is best use ironically and, of course, it's perfect if you want to make a letter look as if written by some kind of bureaucracy -- people actually read a letter printed in such a shabby Courier-Font more intensely asthey suspect/expect that it's official :-).\n\n"

Yes, people stopped using it for a bit in the 90s, but now it is as cool as ever! It is back as the most trendy typeface. IMO, Helvetica is loaded with meaning, as the de facto Swiss modernist typeface. If you need something classic and somewhat invisible and neutral, Univers is a better choice, I think, not Helvetica. Semantically, I think, Helvetica conveys a yuppie lifestyle. We see it a lot in Vancouver, because it's a yuppie city! It's trendy!   \n   \nHelvetica is not really suitable for setting continuous text at all. The letters were designed so that they wouldn't cohere well together - they are so individual and self-contained. The forms are terribly homogenous, making word recognition rather tough. Helvetica is simply not a good everyday workhorse. There are too many jobs that it won't do well in.   \n   \nI think serif types are more invisible to the average reader.

It wasn't something to compete with Akzidens Grotesk as such, but a 'new and improved' version of it (with all the nice bits stripped out). In a way, Univers could have been as popular as Helvetica if it was only a functional universal typeface that designers were after. But IMO, it wasn't like that.   \n   \nIs Helvetica robust? Of course not. There are a lot more robust typefaces than it. The counters are not very open, therefore it's prone to confusion. Sadly, they are used a lot for directional signage (e.g. Vancouver street signs) and it's not the best choice, functionally speaking.   \n   \nA typeface with a good track record doesn't mean that it's necessarily an inherently good typeface. It just sold well and it was just one of the few that was available on most typesetting machines. Letraset also made a lot of Helveticas (I have a whole drawerful under my desk right now). It was a default font on the Mac. So it's never the sheer goodness of a typeface that makes it popular.   \n   \n\\> to compare kievit to helvetica is a bad comparison it's like comparing \\> optima to futura. one is ultra humanist while the other is ultra \\> geometric. it's like apples and oranges. you may like oranges better \\> but they don't compare well out side of your bias.   \n   \nReally? I don't think so somehow. Kievit is a much 'better' typeface for reading of any long continuous text than Helvetica, because of its humanist forms - the letters flow into each other effortlessly. So, when you have a criteria established (say, compare Kievit and Helvetica for the setting of the contiouous text for an entire book) then of course the result is obvious.\n\n"

      "content": "helvetica is much more popular then universe because it is a better typeface. i love adrian frutiger and he's a great type designer but univers falls short. it just looks awkward. it ,as well as helvetica, were reaching for the same thing and helvetica just did a better job of achieving it. like i said before i think this is apparent in it's track record and wide usage. granted i can jive with the whole \"80% of the world likes brittney spears but that doesn't mean she's good, thing\" but i just don't think that pertains here and i'm amazed that anyone would even go there. i mean for god sakes we are talking about helvetica here aren't we. it's kind of like saying the beatles suck because the never played heavy metal. but yet heavy metal owes everything to the beatles.   \n   \nis helvetica robust? yes. the counters are as open as i've seen in a long time. i'm not sure what cut or weight you're looking at, but damn it's pretty open in there.   \n   \nlike i said before comparing a lineal humanist to a lineal geometric is drastic and you'd have to be stupid in the head to think that a geometric face sets better for running copy then a humanist face but that's not my point. my point is and has been that helvetica is a great all around face it sets better then any other face we've talked about for display and does a pretty bang up job at setting moderate amounts of text in book weight.\n\n"

      "content": "If Helvetica is popular, then it hasn't disappeared into the subconscious of the populous. --- Helvetica is decent enough for annual reports and brochures, but not for books. --- Let us all dust off our copies of Stanley Morison's \"First Principles of Typography\" (I know you have a copy, admit it!) --- People were (are) often confused about what Mr. Morison was talking about. He himself had to clarify, years later, that he was indeed talking about typography for books. --- I think that it is important to qualify and clarify \"what kinds of typography\". --- I have to agree with Keith (and Hrant). Helvetica isn't good for long setting of type. Now. I also think that Jay would agree with that. I'm trying to read between the lines here. Helvetica is not a good read. I'd go bonkers. Doing research on the use of space in typography yielded some very painful reads when I started to cover the swiss time period. M\n\n"
