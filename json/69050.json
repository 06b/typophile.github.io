  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve taken to using Dwiggins’ ‘Electra’ rather extensively. For the past few months I’ve been trying to find a sans pairing for it, without much luck. I think my problem is that I’m going about it the wrong way.\n\nI’m looking for something like Futura Bold. The problem with Futura Bold/Electra is that the x-heights are really different, and next to the restrained elegance of Electra, Futura Bold looks a bit like an uncultured brute. Which isn’t necessarily bad. But it just doesn’t look good.\n\nI welcome suggestions for energetic sans-serifs, but more than that, I’m looking for a suggestion of a methodology. How do I go about finding a pairing that makes visual, historical, and ideological sense, while providing enough contrast?\n\nThank you in advance.\n\n",

It's roman also has a binocular 'g' like Electra.\n\nAs for your later questions, check out [these threads](http://web.archive.org/web/20150307193341/http:/typophile.com/node/32056) if you haven't already.\n\n"
