It works as the 21st century display substitute to tired last-century horses like Frankfurter, VAG, or the rounded Helveticas, Futuras, and DINs out there.\n\nCoconut and Coconut Shadow come in all popular font formats, with a complete character set that is loaded with alternates. Check out the character map for a real techno treat.\n\n",
