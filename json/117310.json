  "content": "Hello friendly font-specialists,\n\nI am looking for the name of this font. It is printed in a youth game-book. The topic are computers and hackers. I tried Identifont and WTF but I could not find the right one. The Stop-font was pretty close but not an exact match. The book is printed in Germany in the year 2011.\n\nPlease excuse the bad picture I can try to take another one if the quality is to bad to identify it.\n\n[![Bild hochladen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725034235im_/http:/www11.pic-upload.de/thumb/17.06.14/kgoqav1zinbp.png)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725034235/http:/www.pic-upload.de/view-23579884/fontid.png.html)\n\n[![Bild hochladen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725034235im_/http:/www11.pic-upload.de/thumb/17.06.14/tclru3y1z8qh.jpg)](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725034235/http:/www.pic-upload.de/view-23581245/10422421_812777048734728_6227998616913938149_n.jpg.html)\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBest regards  \nPalme\n\n",
