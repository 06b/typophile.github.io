Probably in ground of “F” where it is a bit too thin, even you scale it to small. So it would “breake” on small sizes on screen.\n\n"

      "content": "It’s well done, Chuck, and I agree with a few of the comments above.\n\nMy small suggestions is to watch out for the very slight downward decline of the optical baseline. In handwriting styled faces and logos a downward arch or baseline connotes depression and pessimism by handwriting analysis.\n\nYou can improve the subliminal signal by giving it a slight incline, or raise the last character “n”, or by slightly rotating the entire logo counterclockwise by just a few degrees.\n\nThis is less of a pure design critique and more about the power of creating symbols and marks.\n\n"
