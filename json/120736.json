I don't have the time to set up a proper foundry right now and may not wish to do so, but if I am to sell through MyFonts I would like to brand myself. Considering my last name is Silvertant I've decided on the name Silvertype.

      "content": "I agree, I've been treating this too much like a typeface. I suppose I got inspired by some of the simpler logotypes around, like the one from Commercial type. Storm and Canada Type are too simple for my taste. I also considering a script logo like Kostic and Suomi, but I don't trust my skills regarding script and it doesn't seem to fit with my \"rational\" approach to type design.\n\nI took your feedback into consideration but I'm running into problems. The diamond shape isn't working for me, though I'm not sure if that's my lack of skill or the style of the typeface to blame. The /r I'm unsure of. It compensates for the white space underneath the shoulder better, but I can't really get the shape right. Perhaps I should make it sharper anyway, together with the tail of /y. The /ty ligature I don't like, so I might just decrease the length of the bar in /t. I suppose I could find solutions to all these problems myself, but right now I just can't think of a way to solve the problem in /yp. The only solution I see is aligning the right side of the serif of /y with the left side of the stem of /p and just connect it straight down. It's not the most elegant solution though. I tried to connect the serifs horizontally in several ways but they all look equally horrible. The last solution I can think of is either raising the stem of /p or possibly make a swirl to connect it with /y, but I don't see that working well for this type. Extending the stem looks odd here. I would probably only dare to do that with a garalde.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213330im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Silvertype%20logotype%20p3_6418.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Perhaps I've been over-thinking things. I tried many things for the /yp combination particularly, but in the end I merely blended the serifs horizontally and I think it works. At the size the logo would be presented online you wouldn't see the ugliness of the letter combination as I had it before anyway, but I felt it required a solution anyway. I'm also more or less happy with how the other characters turned out.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317213330im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Silvertype%20logotype%20p4_5935.jpg)\n\nI tried the cube idea for the tittle; I tried several things but none of them worked. Right now I have a symmetrical diamond shape which I feel does work, though I actually might switch back to a semi-circle later. I just don't know. I'm working with two considerations regarding the shape of the tittle. The first is to emulate the ball terminal in /r, and the other is to make the tittle fit with the sharpness of the other letter forms. I'm combining sharp with rounded, so I don't know exactly which direction works best for certain details. The tail of /y could be a bit sharper as well, possibly.\n\nAs for /ty, the ligature is growing on me but I feel the bar of /t is too heavy for this letter combination. I already made it thinner and I feel it forces me to make the left side of /t thinner as well, which is not ideal as it should be a bit thicker than the top serifs of the other letter forms. Initially I tried to shorten the bar of /t but it looked ridiculous; in order to bring /y close enough I was forced to reduce the bar by way too much, so a ligature seems to be the only solution.\n\nGeneral criticism is still very welcome.\n\n"

It's like I can suddenly take a step back and see my work a bit more objectively, though I still definitely require more sets of eyes to work out all the kinks, usually.\n\n> I don't like the connected il and the sharp drop on the r.\n\nI don't like the connected /il either, but it seems necessary to bring the letters closer together. What can I do? The only solution I can think of is shortening the serifs. Perhaps that's what's required.\n\nAs for /r, the previous version is rather ugly, but I'm trying to find ways to fill more white space in that area without compromising the shape of the ball terminal. The ball terminal of the initial /r is too small I think. I feel the latest /r is close, but I will make the ball terminal more rounded. I have a slight bend on the top of the terminal to emulate the diamond shape of the tittle a bit, but I don't think it's working.\n\n> As you suggested yourself I would fiddle a bit with the stem of the p.

Just sharpening it? I'm a bit afraid of making it visually too sharp. I do want a bit of a contrast between sharp and rounded.\n\n"

I first tried to moon but couldn't make it work. The second symbol looks too much like a lady's butt with her legs moved up to me and the eye and triangles I feel are too esoteric to use as a main symbol. However, I might use the other symbols as well at some point.\n\nInitially I had the idea of using the periodic table but considering the symbol for silver is Ag from argentum, that didn't work for a logo. I'm still going to use the periodic table for branding though. Perhaps use that concept to show off OT features in PDF specimen, or something like that. Either way, I have some things to work with when I expand the branding. For now it's just a logo so I can submit it to MyFonts.\n\nFor the circles symbol what I had in mind was to have the smaller circles go outward when you hover over the logo or just have the circles rotate indefinitely. I haven't yet figured out what to do with it but it's a concern for later.\n\n"
