  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm involved in designing a logo for a research group that is going to be established soon. The research is in a field somewhere between natural sciences and their application in engineering. It's about the opposite of an art exhibition or a virtual social network internet site, so there is not much room for eccentric ideas.\n\nThere are now two basic choices, and slight changes to the design are still possible. Can anyone help me to decide between the two variants? Thank you!!\n\nA)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113741im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-block-4c_3647.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113741im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-block-sw_3627.png)\n\nB)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113741im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-right-4c_6191.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014113741im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo-right-sw_5746.png)\n\n",

Color-wise - single color.\n\nHowever I would reconsider using the lowercase as it seems a bit too (artificially) friendly and playful for something that fits your brief. Or I would try getting rid of /i/s dot, see if it works.\n\nAlso, M-O is a bit too loose.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi all!\n\nThank you all very much for the great comments and ideas!! We need to discuss all this in our group, so I'll give a somewhat more detailed response later on.\n\nWe had discussed using the font Insignia, but it appeared to much oriented towards art, not science. Especially with the \"s\" in the font of riccard0's example, the appearance is different. Block letters look somewhat too much like engineering, but that also probably depends a lot on the specific font that is being used.\n\nSorry for the m-o gap. We knew the logo would need some work once we settle for a specific design, but it's very helpful to know where this work is most urgent.\n\n\"i\" is an abbreviation for \"Instabilities\" (we are not dealing with information in the sense used in computer sciences or with regard to databases).\n\nI'm looking forward to following, and participating in, the ongoing discussion.\n\ncschroeppel\n\n"
