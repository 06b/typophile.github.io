  "content": "Hi I'm new here. This is my first attempt at useable typeface design. Tenitively named MJ, I based the font on a handwriting style I developed. I didn't want to design a handwriting font but a unique whimisical serif font. It has some charicertistics that I wanted to carry over from my handwriting, h, k, f with decenders, the initial and terminating curve I sometimes use. The font uses a grid for the structure of the letters but I wasn't hesitant to break it when I needed to. I haven't drawn the UC yet.   \nPlease let me know what you think and what can be improved! any suggustions on the z?   \nThanks!   \nJosh Scruggs   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101035im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11437.gif)\n\n<!--attachment: MJ-font-11438.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*6.4 **MJ%2dfont%2eswf --><!--attachment: MJ-font-11438.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*6.4** MJ%2dfont%2eswf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101035im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101035/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/MJ-font-11438.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>MJ-font.swf</b></a> (6.4 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment--><!--attachment: MJ-font-sample-11439.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*5.8 **MJ%2dfont%2dsample%2eswf --><!--attachment: MJ-font-sample-11439.swf*attachment_icon.gif*application/x-shockwave-flash*5.8** MJ%2dfont%2dsample%2eswf -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101035im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150417101035/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/MJ-font-sample-11439.swf\" target=\"_blank\"><b>MJ-font-sample.swf</b></a> (5.8 k)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n</center><!--/attachment--><!--/attachment-->\n",

      "content": "I'm going to begin working on this again. Any more hints... suggestions? Does this have potential? Should I keep going? I'm going to thicken the strokes on the round charicters and add some kind of serif to the angled strokes. I might also increase the overall stroke weight to add more thick-thin contrast. I think the y juts down too much before it curves so I may smooth that. Do some of the ball endings seem too big?. Thanks for any help. This is my first font and I realy hope I can make it sucessful (or at least learn somthing and start over on a new one). This is a great place and everybody is so knoledgeable about type design. I'm a senior graphic design student at the University of Kansas and I wish a type design class was offered here. Has anyone taken such a class? Any good books on type design?   \n   \nThanks!   \nJosh Scruggs   \n   \nP.S. any ideas for a name. I want sonthing more creative than MJ which is more of a personal thing.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Josh   \n   \nReally nice work!   \nI think the characters shape are very unique. You must go on in this project.   \nMy little suggestions:   \nThe \"z\" needs to be more wide and opened. Maybe, keep the top serif (witch is a drop serif) and make the low one as same as the terminal of \"c\". It seems to me that two drop serifs don't get along so well. (but this is just my opinion).   \nAlso the lc \"s\" can be more condensed, it's too wide now.   \n   \nKeep up the good work!   \nFabio\n\n"
