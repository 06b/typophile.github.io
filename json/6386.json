      "content": "There seems to be a real 'thing' going on for type with underlining swashes.   \n   \nI think usually the swashes are not part of the fonts that are used. They are drawn and added on.   \n   \nHowever, there are three fonts I know that have swashes included. You still need to use a graphics application like Illustrator to adjust the swashes, but we had a post about this recently and we [provided links](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021092837/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42935.html) for three fonts we know.\n\n"
