It’s something that Apple is in a unique position to do; if say, Microsoft or Adobe tried this, people would just start screaming “monopolists!” and “embrace and extend!”. Surely custom fonts for iPhone apps is something Apple would like to have, but the reality is that the W3C should have worked this stuff out a long time ago.\n\n"

I can see things going in a number of directions for them, they could become heroes of the new font-enabled Web, or they could find themselves unjustly blamed for the fugly – I’ll coin the phrase “Vinnification” :-( - Comic Sans is still a very popular font with the masses, even though through no fault of his own, Vinnie gets flack for it. Equally until Firefox and IE jump on the bandwagon nothing may happen. Likewise if mainstream commercial font vendors can find a way to be involved then it won’t be an issue.\n\nThe timing, with respect to the [Business of Type event](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107221542/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=6121) couldn’t be better, rather than focus purely on the issues of enforcement and risk we can explore ways for font makers to benefit from this technology.\n\nIn addition the \"PS\" comment about Ray’s fonts having their place, was an honest effort to counter any perception that I was anti-Ray in my earlier post. I know various Microsoft games groups use his fonts, and I was lucky enough to be able to license one of his fonts (through an agent) for redistribution in Halo 3.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks very much for defending me, James. I really appreciate it.\n\nFreeware fonts are more likely to be used in lowbrow design hence I'm used to being a typographical punching bag. The more widely fonts are distributed, the more likely it is that they'll be misused. Young font designers, take heed: don't release freeware fonts unless you don't mind a future career as whipping boy/girl. Even if you make great fonts, you'll be remembered for fonts misused. I guess Vincent Connare knows how that goes. Praise for Magpie will always be overshadowed by anti-Comic Sans sentiment.\n\nAbout the ugly fonts:\n\nThe first font in the example at the beginning of this thread is [Primer Apples](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107221542/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/primer-apples/) which was created for a German teacher at no charge based on drawings she had sent me. The dashed lines are supposed to look casual and have square ends. I don't know how such a font could be made much more beautiful but in the right context I think it looks fine. If Primer Apples was the only headline font in the above example and the theme was school, sewing or scrapbooking it would look alright.\n\n[Prime Minister of Canada](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107221542/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/prime-minister-of-canada/) isn't so bad. I looks a little \"autotraced\" but I think it looks inky and appropriate at about 12 points in print. In the context you've shown, it's been tracked wide and seems to have a fake bold applied to it. In proper use, it comes off as 1960s style casual pen & ink lettering.\n\n[Sexsmith](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107221542/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/sexsmith/) is just cute. The early version was pretty weak but I've seen it used in beautiful ways over the years. In a context where cuteness is required, Sexsmith does its job well. Unfortunately, many freeware font sites still carry the old version.\n\n[Vahika](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107221542/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/vahika/) was created as a by-product of a FontLab tutorial and yeah, it pretty much blows goats. You'd never guess that someone would use it for paragraph text but there it is.\n\nMany creators of web font technology have contacted me over the years. [True Font Family](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107221542/http:/www.truefontfamily.com/) is the best one I've seen. It works right now with current browser technology and anyone capable of basic HTML/CSS coding can handle it. It works right now with no plugins. I don't know if it would be suitable for text but it seems to work well in headlines. There's an iGoogle app available as well.\n\n"

The font is only delivered (from the foundry website) after an authenticated request from an external (i.e. the client's) website. So no one can just look into the soure code and download the font. But in the end, the full font file is delivered to every browser. So of course it IS possible to get the font. And this will always be the case. Whether the font will be extracted from a browser cache, from the RAM or from a EOT-file. There is no bullet-proof protection. We all know this sort of discussion from the music industry, so we can learn from their mistakes. I think we shouldn't embrace the possibilities in this new and huge market as soon as possible.

Or would that be problematic too?  \n\\<\\<\n\nwell, there could be complications, certainly. For instance, the web designer and their clients would then be dependent on the foundry's server, so if the foundry's server went down, the client's site wouldn't show the font. Also, the web client's traffic would be \"inherited\" by the foundry, who's server would use some of it's own bandwidth to provide the font (although I think that's in the noise, presumably the foundry would use some of it's profit to increase their own bandwidth.)\n\njason C\n\n"

I would have thought that would be a major problem for many freeware and open-source font designers?\n\nI'm not sure yet. When a revenue model becomes apparent to me it might be more obvious. I have some clients who I've allowed free access to Typodermic fonts for similar use in exchange for displaying the original font names to the user hopefully increasing brand recognition. When it comes to my freeware fonts, I'm more reluctant to allow them to be used that way. Brand recognition for Larabie Fonts typefaces is worth about zero dollars or less.\n\n"
