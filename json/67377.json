Some foundries have lousy metrics.\n\nIf you deal with European customers frequently and elect to purchase an OpenType font, check the effectiveness of the Context Sensitive Layout functions with a text sequence such as this:\n\n‹abc› ‹ABC›  \n«abc» «ABC»  \n¡abc! ¡ABC!  \n¿abc? ¿ABC?\n\nalso,\n\n[abc] [ABC] {abc} {ABC} (abc) (ABC)  \na-b–c—d A-B–C—D\n\nDon’t settle for a font that does not have small caps either. You might not use it this job, but it will come in handy for the next.\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"
