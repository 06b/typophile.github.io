Several years ago I lived in a region in Mexico (Oaxaca) that was about as far geographically and culturally from Tijuana as one could get; now I've never been to Tijuana, but every sign and work of graphic design in Oaxaca seemed as if it were in emulation of something in Tijuana (or the pictures I've seen anyway).

Graphic design coming from Tijuana is some of the freshest, edgiest � even smartest � coming from Mexico.   \n   \nScott, Tijuana is unlike anything else in Mexico, which is why Oaxaca (which is more like everything else in Mexico) seems like such a departure. BTW, there is NO design in Oaxaca. I'm not sure though if being from Tijuana gives you instant cred. But it is a hotspot to be in� kind of like Minneapolis or Madison, WI.   \n   \nMexico City is filled with amazing designers and some very good type designers. Most notably Gabriel Martinez Meave. And many of the people who were part of [Matiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20051125211440/http:/www.underconsideration.com/speakup/matiz/) are incredible type and graphic designers. Very different style from that of Tijuana's though.   \n   \nAs far as the US East/West coast thing, in graphic design, there is a very big difference. West Coast design is at times much more colorful than East coast. There is more illustration used in the East Coast, perhaps because of the insane amount of illustrators in NY. The styles are very blurry now, what with the internet and all. The differences are subtle and still noticeable but not as apparent as 10 years ago. We had [a similar discussion on Speak Up](http://web.archive.org/web/20051125211440/http:/www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001814.html), not long ago, if anyone's interested.   \n   \nType design differences, I don't know.

Interesting.   \n   \nForgot to address that. It's the other way around actually. Oaxaca is one of the oldest and more culturally important cities in Mexico. Some of the finest artists and craftsmen live and work there. Tijuana, having the identity crisis that it has, borrows a lot from Mexico's vernacular which is born in \"more Mexican\" cities like Oaxaca or even Mexico City.   \n   \nEqually though, Tijuana has one of the most visuallly- and linguistically-intriguing vernaculars.\n\n"
