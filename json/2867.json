If I can't do that with a digital font I guess my next best plan will be to find a source (type book or ?) that can be scanned. Ah, back to cut and paste. Any more suggestions?\n\n"

You might try Googling or using AbeBooks to search for books with those keywords, or seek out a good library with a graphic arts section. For some reason this era seems to be one that the Solotype Catalog doesn't have very much for. If someone else here has some of the newer phototype catalogs, that might help, but the maddening thing is that many of those books don't have full alphabets.   \n   \nWhy not just scan and digitize this, if this is the only thing you are replicating? You only need these letters, right?\n\n"
