(No, we hadn't had that many beers either.)\n\nApart from the fact that the kerning leaves a fair bit to be desired (and what's with those periods?), would someone else like to take a stab at this one?\n\n(And if you're in Calgary and want to come along to the next event, ask one of us for details.)\n\n",
