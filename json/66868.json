  "content": "**May it be, that there is the following bug in Quark XPress 8 (Windows)?:**\n\nIf an OT feature contains the language statement \"language DEU;\", Quark XPress ignores all the following features. The feature itself (the one, that contains the language statement \"language DEU;\") works.\n\nIn this case the font was built with FontLab and did contain one languagesystem statement only, namely \"languagesystem latn dflt;\". (More to the point, that’s the default statement of FontLab, isn’t it?)\n\n**And I think, there is another bug:**\n\nIf a feature file contains the statement \"languagesystem DFLT dflt;\" only (font built with MakeOTF [AFDKO]), but not the statement \"languagesystem latn dflt;\", none of the features work, at least not in German.\n\n**Oh, maybe another bug:**\n\nQuark XPress seems to dislike substituting spaces in features. Example: While \"sub space x space by x;\" would not work, \"sub slash x slash by x;\" works as intended.\n\nCan anyone verify one or more of these bugs?\n\n",
