Here's from the colophon;\n\n_© Rembrandt Verlag Berlin 1959  \nZweite Auflage 1962  \nKlischees: Lemke, Graphische Kunstanstalt  \nDruck: Franz Spiller  \nPrinted in Germany (West-Berlin)_\n\nSo I guess that makes it older than Arial! This edition's insides is set in Futura, don't know about the first edition.\n\nThanks for replies, though! Personally, I think it's a custom type inspired by the likes of Akzidenz Grotesk and Breite Grotesk (thanks Dag Henning).\n\n"
