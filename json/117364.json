Now I'm trying to find out where the typographic ornament came from. I traced the element in Illustrator but it is hard to tell from this low resolution image how close I am to the original. I discovered that this character is called a hedera. Learn something new everyday! If anyone can ID this, I'd appreciate it. This is my first post to this forum so I hope I've posted this request correctly!\n\nThanks!  \nTrina\n\n",
