I searched all 300 of the ClickArt Handwritten fonts that have been bouncing around with various names for the past 10 years, and this isn’t one of them, as far as my eyes can tell. I don’t think it’s any of the commercial handwritten fonts I have seen and collected. It has some stylistic similarities with Bran Willson’s [‘Pumpkinseed’](http://web.archive.org/), and he has some other hand-printing fonts that are nicely done.\n\nAnother option is to scroll a while through [Part 11 of the Script Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20060604042449/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script11Pg1.html) and see if something with enough of the same feel catches your eye. These are all samples of fonts that can be found on the web, commercial, or otherwise — just use the Reference List to see where they are from.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
