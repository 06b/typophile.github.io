  "content": "alright. I went back to the drawing board with names for my freelance design business. I settled on “ellbee”, which is my initials written phonetically.\n\nI’m working on using just the name as a logo. I haven’t really figured out what type of symbol to incorporate into the mark if any. After a few rounds of trying out different fonts I’ve narrowed it down to these two and am now playing with color. I feel like they are both still lacking but I’m stuck. The marks to the right are not meant to be incorporated into the main logo but may be used as secondary design elements in my branding.\n\nbegin critique.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019082101im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ellbee_logo3_5798.gif)\n\n [‹ Updating to existing logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019082101/http:/typophile.com/node/50634 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Luxury Brand typographic Logo / Please comment ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081019082101/http:/typophile.com/node/50492 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I agree that color isn’t there yet. it’s kind of arbitrary at the moment. i will try out your suggestions and post my work soon.\n\nto address the pound issue since it seems to be an important one. I agree, “lb” is an abbreviation for pound. and alone the symbol may be read that way. but if i can establish a strong enough brand i think i can redefine how people read “lb”. the symbols are not so be used by themselves. they would be a secondary element to the logo. if i can establish a strong presence in the name ellbee i don’t think anyone would read “lb” as pound. and if they do...well as a friend of mine pointed out...maybe it just symbolizes that my design has weight.\n\nif i seem cranky, sorry. i just thought i would get better feedback here. the lack of response is disappointing, aside from rodrigo’s.\n\n"

      "content": "Nice designs, I like the first version best, as well as it’s 2 color versions. I’m not 100% sure about the terminal of the l surprinting the black b. It’s so delicate, it may be tough to trap, and possibly do some funky things when printed. The lb does make me think of pounds but what I find more of a challenge is going from ellbee to lb. When I sound it in my head of course it makes sense. But it’s a little jarring visually - in seeing it, the natural inclination is to think the initials should be eb. That said, I keep going back and forth between the two like it’s a private joke, and getting people to spend so much time thinking about your logo isn’t a bad thing.\n\n"

If you are a designer who believes that you are in the business of solving your clients’ visual communications problems, keep the tagline. Otherwise, give it a second thought.\n\n"

      "content": "kristin- you’re probably right about the trapping issue. do you think it would be bad to use different versions of the logo? i don’t really want to give that up and can probably use it for most purposes. maybe i just use a solid colored one when printing the logo small. i guess the first step is to see what happens when i print it. i appreciate your feedback on using the lb and ellbee together. i’ll give it some thought.\n\ncuttlefish- i was actually just trying to brainstorm something to replace “design solutions”. the reason i chose solutions is because through my experiences, one thing i’ve come to realize that defines me is my passion for solving problems. any type of problem really, but especially in my field. but you are right about the marketing gobbledygook, i know since i just left a marketing firm who used “creative solutions”. i’m having trouble coming up with something else. i’m leaning away from something generic like “designs”, “graphic design”, etc. I don’t know. Any suggestions? Should I just go with “Print & Web Design”?\n\n"

The left has the tap on the “e” while the right doesn’t.\n\nKirsten, I agree about using the black over the color, luckily I also think it looks best that way anyhow.
