My first thought was [Mrs Eaves](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829164450/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/mrs-eaves-ot) (don't know too many serif /R with such a straight leg...), that could be it... or not... So, part of this risky suggestion, without providing a better sample (or the origin), I'm afraid it'd be hard to suggest more...\n\n"

Ryuk, the image with that font can be seen here:  \n [http://darrincrescenzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/287logo-1032x774.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829164450/http:/darrincrescenzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/287logo-1032x774.jpg \"http://darrincrescenzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/287logo-1032x774.jpg\")\n\nIt might be a tad larger than the one posted. Any further leads to this font is highly appreciated.\n\nThank you!\n\n"
