The German media coverage of the exhibition that I have seen has focused on how little the exhibition focused on Germans who were dispersed from Poland. It was supposed to be an exhibition on refugees in gerneral.\n\nI saw interviews with several political and cultural figures from Poland who had visited the exhibition and who seemed quite relieved about the actual focus. They thought that it was a perfectly good exhibition. But I also remember a counter point made by a woman from Prague, though. She thought that the exhibition didn't focus enough on \"why\" the Germans were forced out of Eastern Europe, referring to the level of enthusiasm for Hitler in the Sudetenland before 1938, etc.\n\nOf course, I saw these interviews on German state TV, so there is certainly the possibility of bias in the opposite direction of any BBC bias…\n\n"

This was the impression they intended to create, by reusing images, some of which were doctored.

During some periods, the Muslim rulers were more tolerant and enlightened than those in Europe. This led to a flowering of culture, both Muslim and Jewish. In other periods, fanatical Muslim rulers forced conversion of both Jews and Christians under threat of death.\n\nThe whole story, which I haven't studied, had a big impact on the history of both the Muslim and Christian worlds. The Muslim scholars of the tolerant periods revived Greek learning, which when transferred to the West contributed to the Renaissance. The fanatics I believe helped cause the decline of the Morrocan kingdoms and their eventual military defeat on the European continent by Christians in the areas of Spain and Portugal.\n\n"

Ferdinand & Isabella wrote to the Pope requesting permission to establish the Spanish Inquisition and for it to operate in a unique way that differed significantly from the inquisition that developed during the Middle Ages. The latter was remarkably strictly regulated from an early period precisely because the scholastic Churchmen understood the potential for abuse and had no illusions about the temptations of secular power. The use of an institution intended to uncover theological heresy as a tool of state repression emerges in the early modern period with the strengthening of the aparatus of secular authority. In Spain, this coincided with the defeat and expulsion of the Moors and the subsequent efforts to consolidate a Christian national identity, of which the Spanish Jews were victims.\n\n"

These cities were flourishing and Muslim scientists made tremendous progress in applied as well as theoretical Science and Technology. In Europe, however, the situation was much different. Europe was in the Dark Ages. It had no infrastructure or central government. To the Muslims, Europe was backward, unorganized, carried no strategic importance and was essentially irrelevant. This considering the time period was in fact true. Nevertheless the Catholic Church (which at the time was the strongest institution in Europe) successfully convinced Christian Europe that the Muslims were infidels. This caused Europeans to think that Muslims were culturally inferior to Europe and thus Europe was unable to benefit from the new scientific discoveries being made in the Islamic lands before the 1100's. By doing this Europe kept itself in the Dark Ages while from China to Spain Islamic Civilization prospered. During the Crusades there was limited contact between Muslims and Christians and not much was transferred. As A. Lewis explains, \"The Crusaders were men of action, not men of learning.\"\n\nWhich appears to be just as true today. Maybe America's \"left-wing\" scholars (labels, labels) will one day feel comfortable asking the rest of us in the west to look in the mirror and consider the possibility that our own prejudices - and thus, our propensity to \\*allow\\* western governments a free hand in wrong-headed foreign adventurism - have caused the kind of \"terrorism\" (response?) we see today. Instead, individuals who are able to think freely and ask the hard questions are either censured or simply ignored.\n\nThe tragedy of our century (this one and the last) is that the beast rages because it cannot (or will not) see its own face in the mirror.\n\n"

But at the same time I think it is very necessary to talk accurately about what the inquisition was, how it was organised, how it operated, what its aims were, etc. So this is why I think it is important that the distinction between the Roman inquisition and the Spanish inquisition be recognised, because the latter was distinct in several respects with regard to both its organisation, its mandate and its methods.\n\n"
