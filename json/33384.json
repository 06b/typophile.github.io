An anecdote of my father’s early struggles may illustrate this. At the death of Mr. Joseph Jackson, whom my father had served ten years as apprentice and foreman, there was in progress for the University Press of Oxford a new fount of Double Pica Greek, which had progressed under my father’s entire management. The then delegates of that Press—the Rev. Dr. Randolph and the Rev. W. Jackson—suggested that Mr. Figgins should finish the fount himself. This, with other offers of support from those who had previously known him, was the germ of his prosperity (which was always gratefully acknowledged). But when he had undertaken this work, the difficulty presented iteself that he did not know where to find the punch-cutter. No one knew his address; but he was supposed to be a tall man, who came in a mysterious way occasionally, whose name no one knew, but he went by the _sobriquet_ of _’The Black Man’_. This old gentleman, a very clever mechanic, lived to be a pensioner on my father’s bounty—gratitude is perhaps the better word. I knew him and could never understand the origin of his _sobriquet_, unless Black was meant for dark, mysterious, from the manner of his coming and going from Mr. Jackson’s foundry.”  \n—quoted in T.B.

They were only available to nobility and the church because no one else had any money whatsoever.\n\nThe development of Western printing also did two other things. Immediately, the block book was introduced, which provided access to whoever who wanted at a very low price. Which resulted in the decline of printing as represented by B42 and the Mainz Psalter. Also, it raised the price of the manuscript book (“scribal work”), which became the high end in the market for over a century. It did not in any way immediately eliminate the work of the scribe.\n\nThe dubbing of the Black Art thing, is really questionable. Printers were thrown into prison and executed, along with any others who violated the laws of the time. Very little to do with the devil, unless you were in Spain or France.
