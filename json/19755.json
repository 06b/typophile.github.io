The West used a sans serif dating back to the 30s, while the East preferred a technically-tinted sans face from the 50s. Ole Schäfer and Verena Gerlach based their designs on the street signs themselves rather than the sketches from which the signs were made. This resulted in there being two versions for the East and a single version for the West. The FontFont character set includes many characters that would never be found on a street sign so Schäfer and Gerlach designed the missing letters, punctuation and symbols. They also designed special headline fonts for both East and West available in three weights: Regular, Medium and Bold. In addition, they created lining figures and, for the expert sets, a series of arrows and other useful symbols.\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF City Street Type at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112210/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_city_street_type/)\n\n",
