  "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm currently putting together a design for an event that is going to take place in 2 weeks, and I was wondering if anyone knows the fonts that were used in this poster? It appears to be something along the lines of \"futuristic,\" \"retro,\" and \"something of 80's style.\" If anyone can find them, I would really appreciate it. Thanks! :D\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141127072207im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jwdoctnovflyerweb_3498.jpg)\n\n",
