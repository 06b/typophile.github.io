  "content": "One thing we rarely enjoy, when typesetting in french, is the opportunity to have rounded guillemets.\n\nNo one is to blame of course!  \nThis form has always been rare and can mostly only be found in fonts by Imprimerie Nationale (as the exemple here provided shows).\n\nWhats the advantage? Some typefaces have pointed guillemets which are - to my taste - too visible. Rounded ones would be softer to the eye and blend in better in text - much like the quotes (“such”).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [guillemets\\_ronds.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140127081535/http:/typophile.com/files/guillemets_ronds.gif) | 11.51 KB |\n\n",

Formal harmony is great for display setting, but during immersion you often need a little jolt.\n\nMy favorite guillemets? The ones in IN's \"Nouvelle Gravure\".  \nAs far as I'm concerned they can be used for both French and English!  \nDid I put a sample of them on Typophile recently? I'm blanking out.\n\nhhp\n\n"
