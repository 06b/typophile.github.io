I hope to start using it more as a progress in my design.\n\nI’ve really been thinking hard about a lot of things and I don’t truly want to be a designer anymore. I would love to market peoples design such as [http://www.tylorjreimer.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122072458/http:/www.tylorjreimer.com/) who is my partner and close friend. I just can’t stomach being a designer for the rest of my life, I just don’t think I have what it takes.\n\nWhats the next step?\n\nDo you have inspiration for me, should I keep going as a designer? Feel free to talk me out of it or \\*\\*\\*\\* rip me apart. All will be taken as it is.\n\nSincerely  \nChris\n\n",

      "content": "Chris,\n\nWhat kind of design do you do? Web, print, branding? Can you list a few things that excite you about design? Is it the problem solving you have issues with, or is it the task of pixel pushing? Perhaps you are feeling too many limitations with your clients?\n\nThe only thing I can recommend is maybe exploring other design related disciplines. Industrial design, architecture, cartography or maybe photography. If you an find the motivation, try out some new things in your spare time (something difficult for me to do, I find). Take a calligraphy class, or go outside and paint a landscape. It helps also, to attend local design gatherings (AIGA, GDC, Pecha Kucha, etc), get in touch with your community and see what kinds of amazing things they might be working on, be inspired by your peers. You might have to do a bit of self discovery and really try to push your own limits. You might find something really magical that can lead you to recovering your creativity.\n\n"

      "content": "Christopher,\n\nI hate to hear of someone leaving a creative field. Do you think marketing other people’s work will be satisfying for you? I scanned your other blogs and you seemed very excited about starting a new job. Maybe that company just isn’t a good fit for you. Critiques can be harsh and tough to bear at times, especially since a lot of design does fall under personal preferences. If design truly isn’t for you, then yes, look elsewhere - find your passion. But if you’re just feeling kicked around a lot lately - and most of us have gone through that - step back, Zara made some great suggestions, get re-inspired. Determine is it the work? or the job? Then decide what direction will be best for you.\n\n"
