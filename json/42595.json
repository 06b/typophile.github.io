  "content": "I run a fine-press studio, and we have several typefaces based on Paul Renner's _Futura_. Both _Twentieth Century_ and _Spartan_—where can I find studies on the histories of these faces? Just HOW much of them is directly related to _Futura_ and how much is mere well-intentioned emulation?\n\nAll this to say, I'm considering completely RE-NAMING the faces _Futura_? We have some sizes of _Futura_, some of _Spartan_, and some _Twentieth Century_. It would be nice to homogenize them, but I only want to do that if the others truly are imitations of Renner's design. Just how different are they?\n\n",

      "content": "In the case of Spartan (Linotype version), the main differences are the lowercase 'a', which had both a one-story and two-story design; the left quote marks were available either rotated 180° or mirrored from the right hand variety, and the question mark is of a more usual design, instead of the backward 'S' design in the original.\n\nThe ATF version of Spartan is the same, except it has only the one-story 'a' and only mirrored quote marks.\n\n"

It's a discussion about geometric sans like Futura, and Paul Hunt talks a little about Twentieth Century. He's the one to re-digitize it for the Lanston Type Company.\n\nThey ARE different faces, and I personally feel that you should keep the names accurately.\n\n"

      "content": "Kentlew is correct. These are lead letters I'm talking about, not the \"re-digitized\" versions or any other. Thanks for the book recommendation, I'll scour those pages for details.\n\nI want to know how different they are, and perhaps I should just print my own samples, scan them and digitally compare them. Because, depending on the foundry, there are PLENTY of variations in typefaces like _Caslon_ and _Garamond_, and it is up to us to determine which ones are most faithful and useful. Nevertheless, we're still able to call them by there common names. I'm suggesting that the names _Spartan_, and _Twentieth Century_ are more corporate safeguards than honorable names for the type, so I'd like to keep it real in my pressroom.\n\n"

      "content": "McGrew describes the differences. They are not many. He does not consider them significant. You might have to decide for yourself.\n\nIf you compared the same sizes of all three, you might notice the differences. But mixing one size of Spartan on a page with a different size of Twentieth Century, for example, would probably not show up any appreciable variances. Especially if you consider that there are sometimes subtle differences between different sizes of the same nominal typeface in metal anyway.\n\nNevertheless, if it was me, I'd probably keep the different drawers labeled according to the different fonts to retain the info about the original provenance, but perhaps arrange the drawers in the same cabinet acknowledging that the different sizes can essentially stand in for each other.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
