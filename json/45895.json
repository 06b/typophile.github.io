  "content": "Hello.\n\nFirst of all I’m new here, so hello to everyone, great forum you have here.\n\nNow back to the topic. I’m designing a logotype for a company that produces and sells medical devices. We’re gonna have a a new line now tho, and we’re needing a logo for it. This line is called “Pakline” and it’s purpose is to include several products into one pack (eg. Surgical procedure pack). The following are the logotypes we designed so far.\n\nAny critique would be appreciated, along with some ideas for new concepts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045531im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logopak_4465.png)\n\nThank you.  \nPedro Peixoto\n\n [‹ Website for German Hairdresser Chain](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045531/http:/typophile.com/node/45470 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Color suggestions for Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045531/http:/typophile.com/node/44390 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If you made the solid green rectangle a tiny bit longer on the bottom you might a pretty nice “P” concept out of both open square and rectangle.\n\n"

I’ve made some changes this morning, mostly towards the simplicity. Got two new examples to show and would appreciate further comments as always.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045531im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logopakv2_4251.png)\n\nCheers.\n\n"

Any ideas?\n\nCheers!\n\n"

Everything else feels tacked on.\n\n—  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
