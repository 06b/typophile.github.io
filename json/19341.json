  "content": "Anyone know of a font editor which can edit TrueType collections (.ttc files) directly?\n\nA lot of software can break a ttc up into a set of ttfs, but if you’ve got a ttc with a single glyf table and a single kern table but n cmap tables, and want to change a glyph shape or a kern value, it would be good to do this just once to the ttc, not n times to the ttfs.\n\nMore generally, why did TrueType collections not catch on? Are they more widely used in the Far East than in the West? Maybe there are tools to edit them in Japan or China?\n\nMany thanks.\n\n [‹ Problem With Font Activation \\>:-o](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809001211/http:/typophile.com/node/19329 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Romanian Characters not showing up ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070809001211/http:/typophile.com/node/19240 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
