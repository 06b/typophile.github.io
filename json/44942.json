Here are a few photos – [http://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/sets/72157600961533746/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905090050/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/sets/72157600961533746/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/typeoff/sets/72157600961533746/\")\n\nThe Bode Museum on the Museumsinsel has lots of letters in its basement medieval collection, and also in its large coin collection. The Bauhaus-Archiv might have lettering, but I’ve not been inside it. There are a number of Soviet and East German memorials with expressionistic stone-carved letters, too. If you go up to the top of the Reichstag, and look down into one of the courtyards, you can see a large lettered installation by Hans Haake.\n\nNear the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz there are a series of Rosa Luxemburg quotes set as inlaid metal letters into the pavement.\n\n"
