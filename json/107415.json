I looked for some time and did not quite find what I was looking for. Even the typeface on \"The Hobbit\" poster in Hebrew wasn't quite what I was looking for.\n\nSo far, ( [http://www.cjstones.com/prod\\_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102254/http:/www.cjstones.com/prod_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg \"http://www.cjstones.com/prod\\_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg\")) is the closest thing I have found. Of course, I would add some dots for embellishment to make it more like what most of us are familiar with.\n\nתודה רבה!\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317102254im_/http:/www.cjstones.com/prod_images/lettering/HebrewScript.jpg)\n\n",
