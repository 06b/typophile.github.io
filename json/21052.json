  "content": "Every year I sit down with the CA Illustration Annual to take a look at all of the amazing talent and every year I wish I'd paid more attention in my drawing classes. Page by page I see people telling stories or explaining articles in ways that I can't. I get jealous. This year was no different. There really are some--scratch that--a huge amount of amazingly talented illustrators out there.\n\nThis year after about 45 minutes of \"oooh\" and \"aaaah\" and \"woooowww\" I arrived at the end feeling, once again, stupid for not paying attention. Flipping a few more pages I came across and ad for Veer with a fellow Typophile, Armin Vit, proclaiming in 60 pt Avenir bold that he couldn't draw. I was lifted and humored all at the same time. :^) Thanks, Armin! You rock!\n\n_By the way, Edel has several illustrations in there that prove his skill is more than, what some of you thought, trite cliche. Nice work Edel._\n\n",

      "content": "Probably the same feeling I get when I look at a type book.\n\nIllustrator's always discuss if designers are still into illustration, so it's nice to hear this. There seems to be a lot of use of stock photo or straight type in design. Maybe it has to do with schools and how they separate illustrators from designers sometimes. I've always thought the two should work on more projects together in school, it would be good for everyone and sets a good foundation.\n\nDavid, have fun with the class, use what you know already with type, there can be a lot of overlap.\n\nThanks Tiffany for the public display of affection :-)\n\nER\n\n"
