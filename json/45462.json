      "content": "InDesign doesn’t support this directly, so you have to work around that.\n\nIf you want an entire paragraph boxed, cut the text and place it into a frame of its own. You can paste this frame back into its position inbetween the other text (note that it will _not_ break at the end of a page), or place it on its own with text wrap applied. You can also create a table of 1 cell and 1 row, although the same page break restriction applies — ID will not break a table row.\n\nIf you want several lines boxed inside an otherwise regular paragraph, create a character style with Underline and Strikethrough. Move the Underline position down and the Strikethrough up to good positions. This does not create vertical lines at the left and right positions; you can fake these by inserting a pipe “|” symbol, adjusting its thickness and height with the Vertical and Horizontal scaling and moving it up or down with Baseline shift. You might want to offset the following/preceding text with a hair or thin space (also with the underline/strikethru applied).\n\n[Added] It seems you may also be referring to “inverse text” :-) That’s also possible; create a very thick Underline — about the same as your leading —, and set the text color to “Paper”.\n\n"
