But on closer inspection many of the strokes fall short of baselines and caplines, perhaps to make it look a little more amateurish?\n\n"

It has a sort of blur at the corners, especially in the light weights, that feels a lot like your sample. The M is the only structurally different letter at first glance. Squooshing (TM) would make the resemblance quite close.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
