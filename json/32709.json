  "content": "I have lately been using Fontlab 5 on the PC for some time, and recently switched back to the latest publicly released Mac build. I have been very happy with it, although I save multiple versions every day or so, just in case. But in spite of the truly wonderful things about this program, there are some things about the metrics window that have irritated me so much that I must speak out in ill temper. Apologies if these issues have already been raised.\n\nWhy isn't the tab useful in the metrics window? Look how Fog does it. The tab is a useful key. It is there to be used. So USE IT!\n\nWhy do kerning and metrics have to be two completely different operations, with enormous amounts of time lost whilst switching between them? For example, you are in the metrics mode. You have adjusted sidebearings. Now you notice a kern that is required. You now have to switch to kern mode. Now focus is lost on the character you were working on. So you have to select it again. DUH. So you select it, adjust the kerning and now . . . return to metrics. But you have lost focus. You have to select the character again.\n\nLook how Fog does it.\n\nSidebearing and kerning adjustments all take place fluidly at the same time, with simple, easily remembered keystrokes. Why is there this artificial, time-consuming dichotomy between the two operations in Flab?\n\nWhy don't cursor keys work in the intuitive, expected manner they do in fog? Why do they either do something unexpected, or nothing at all?\n\nCursor keys are there to be used!!!!!!\n\nCURSOR KEYS ARE THERE TO BE USED!!!!!!\n\nLOOK AT YOUR OWN PROGRAM, now you own it!\n\nFinal example:\n\nLet us suppose you are in metrics mode, and you are directly editing the metrics values in the value boxes. Up/down cursor will let you move up and down between width, left sidebearing and right sidebearing. But what happens to cursor right/left when you want to move to the next character? NADA! What happens when you want to move one element up to the character name box, as you can in Fog, and then move focus to the next slot, or gracefully move on to the next character? NADA!!!!\n\nWhat possible reason can there be for such behaviour in a version 5 program?\n\nFinally (really), suppose you now want to get into the tempting little kerning box. You can't.\n\nYou now have to switch to kerning mode, at which point . . . you lose focus and have to select the character again. OK. You're in kerning mode now. And you \\_can\\_ move up to the width/sidebearing cells with cursor up/down. But you still can't move up to the character name box and change the character you have selected, either by typing it or by using the keystroke for previous/next character. Also, the cursor keys now only control kerning. You can no longer change width values via the cursor keys.\n\nWhy all this confusing kerfuffle?\n\nWhat is the intellectual justification for it? Is there some great philosophy of interface design here that I am missing?\n\nIs it too much to ask to get these SIMPLE things RIGHT? I am totally exasperated at the total pointlessness of it all. This is not good enough! Yet I can't return to Fog at this point . . . . at least not until the metrics window gets antialiasing. Yet . . . I believe I could do this kind of fitting much more quickly in Fog . . . .\n\nand what became of the fitting enhancements I and several others have been asking for, for . . . a decade? There's a lot of programming hours in a decade . . . . . . . . . .\n\n",

What is the problem with taking advantage of something absolutely expected in contemporary software? Or, one might ask, why is the primary key change in Fog 4/OS X that cmd-Y is no longer the undo key; instead it's shift-cmd-Z. WHAT ? ? ? ? ?\n\nWho thought these things up? Why?

In fact, in some respects, I have actually found the Mac build more stable than the some Windows builds.\n\nI don't believe in private feature request lists. My experience is that companies only respond when things get public. Here's another gripe. Can you control the idiotic automatic strings that appear when you click on an entry in the metrics table?\n\nFor example, HOH6non is not useful when you want to look at H6H or O6O or n6n etc. It is incredible to me, so many decades after H\\_H n\\_n fittings lists have been in constant use, that Fontlab can't get this basic principle across. One sees all these wonderful things happening, yet one constantly gets the feeling that neither Yuri nor Adam has ever sat down for a day or two with a really competent font designer to observe what actually needs to be done. Too many geeks, too few craftsmen.\n\n"

Bill Troop's question here I think indicates the weakness of the manual, which for me personally is the single biggest problem with FontLab at the moment. If you look under 'metrics' as I have just done, you will find that the metrics sections are scattered over three or four different places of the (huge) manual. So to find the answer you have to hunt all over the place. And you have to know what to ask in the first place.\n\nIf all the information on metrics were explained in a task-oriented way, all in the same place, it would help greatly to make the FontLab features accessible to the user.\n\nThis would mean repeating information in different places, but there is no problem with that. Currently the manual is organized as programmer's notes, rather than as a guide for users. The makes FontLab's treasures a lot less accessible.\n\n"

If you have a kern to lower case, such as 'To', then I suppose it is best to have caps to the left of T and lower case to the right: HHHTonnn or some such. But if you want to space both sides of the o, then it would be better to have nnonn, etc. But with only one metrics table, probably intended for kerning, then the way FontLab does it is the only way to go. But then you can't use the table in the same way when the 'metrics' button is pushed. You would need to change the text in the metrics.txt file when you switch between spacing and kerning, if I am understanding this rightly.\n\n"

Now go into the outline window and do 5 actions. Now you see something you want to undo in the template layer so you go there and undo it. What happens in Flab? You go into the template layer and it undoes the 5 actions you just did in the outline window (the ones you don't want to undo) because Flab's undo doesn't respect layers. Same thing with masters. This is intolerably bad design in my view. What is the rationale for it? And by the way, what is the matter with UNDO letting you know what action it is undoing -- something most programs have done for a long, long, long time ? ? ? ? We're HUMANS . . . . . . . .\n\n"

When you have classes, that \"metrics template\" can be adjusted by editing the metrics.txt file.\n\n- Shortcuts in the MW. On Windows it is designed in a way that it is not needed to use mouse at all - everything can be done by keyboard. I will check if that was not lost during the Mac port.\n\n- Mixed metrics and kerning editing. Well, technically it is very easy to implement. I always though that it is right to work on metrics separately from kerning, so in non-kerning environment font will look good. OK, I will do Fog-style mixed editing, will see how it works.\n\n- Undo. I only can agree that its implementation in FLS/TT is not good. It was improved, but unfortunately it cannot be done as I'd like it to work until next Big Rewrite (which is soon). That Rewrite will also introduce completely new UI and new workflow.\n\n- Fog 3.5 was a great tool and we still have to learn a lot from its simplicity. Unfortunately font technologies changed so we have to care about such complex things as class-kerning, non-Latin fonts etc. Typical font is not Mac Roman anymore and it makes impossible to have simple and elegant solutions that will really work only for Latin.\n\nAnyway, it gives us no excuse to lose focus in windows.

And the latter is NOT DOCUMENTED.\n\nI have suggested in an e-mail to Adam that the up and down arrow keys control the width of the sidebearing, adding one unit to both sides (up) or subtracting one unit from both sides (down). That way it is easy to vary independently the two aspects of spacing a glyph between control characters: the centering and the advance width.\n\nedit: I see I have cross posted with Yuri's latest. Let me just emphasize that the lack of documentation of the functions hurts usability, and is really annoying, at least to this user.\n\n"

He pointed out that there are two different problems in spacing: centering and advance width.\n\nCurrently the left and right arrows move the whole glyph left or right, and the up and down by themselves do nothing, at least on my windows machine. So if the up and down arrows would increase or decrease the advance width by one unit (or with shift accelerated 10 or a defined number of units) that would make for a very natural work flow, I think.\n\n"

When I said metrics panel, I should have have said 'metrics table' -- the vertically oriented, editable panel which shows the entire font's metrics. Let us call the vertical arrangement the metrics table and the horizontal arrangement the metrics panel.\n\nBecause the only way we can automatically generate context for succeeding characters is by using the metrics table, this will be the primary way we navigate through metrics.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you had made it possible to generate a fitting string and then, by having the first incidence of the control character be a kind of master character, and then, each time you change that master character (for example by next/previous character) you change ALL incidences of the master character in the fitting string, then, we would be using the metrics panel, not the metrics table, as our primary metrics editing area.\n\nBut you didn't. Honestly, you will never, never, never understand what David, me, or any of the rest of us are talking about until you spend a couple of days sitting down with us. Discussion of this kind, by post and email, is a complete waste of time. Because more than fifteen or so years after being the best programmer of font design programs, you still have absolutely no idea how a font designer actually works. It is time to find out. Start with Berlow. In the entire world, there is nobody better to start with. The problem here is not intelligence, is not intuition. It is fifteen years of bad communication.\n\nNo matter how busy you think you are, drop it and force yourself to spend some time with a few key people. And I don't mean just an hour or so gabbing. I mean several hours with each, patiently observing how a font actually gets designed. There is no substitute for this. It is now abundantly clear -- indeed it has been clear for at least the past ten years -- that this is what you need to do. Words just don't do it. You've got see it, you've got to experience it. Don't you begin to see what a complete waste of time words are? The hundred misunderstandings on this thread, so time-consuming to elucidate, illustrate that.\n\n"

I am listening to many designers and I've spent quite some time learning how some of them work. In ideal world it will be possible to adjust every tool and every UI element of the program to fit any possible type designer. In a reality we have to make a tool that will suit as many designers (professional and not) as possible. So we have to make compromises. Again, it give us no excuse to make errors and we always try to fix them.\n\nBut you are right, we really need to learn more. I will be in Frankfurt on Typotechnica in few weeks, then I will certainly come to Brighton. Maybe TypeCon too. If anyone is ready to share any FLS or Fog experience with me - I will be glad to run my camera.\n\nActually, it will be even better if anyone interested can just record some routine font-editing process (metrics editing or anything else) with good screen-capture software. It will let us analyse the workflow and isolate any UI problems that eat time.\n\nHowever, it is also necessary to just learn FLS if you want to use it at full power.\n\n"
