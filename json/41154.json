  "content": "I am in the middle of redesigning a magazine. I would like to use Lubalin as the main headline font, but can't quite decide on a suitable body text font to go with it. We are working with Lubalin & Akkurat as a combination at the moment, but Akkurat is quite limited, and ideally we'd use a body font that also has a condensed in it's family as there are a few sections that are rather text heavy (listings/reviews).\n\nIt is for a Drum & Bass magazine named K-mag (formerly known as 'Knowledge') [http://www.kmag.co.uk/kndefault.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023214916/http:/www.kmag.co.uk/kndefault.asp \"http://www.kmag.co.uk/kndefault.asp\"), based in the UK, target audience mostly males 20-30, mostly city dwellers, interested in urban art and technology/gadgets.\n\nPreviously we use Foundry as headline and Akzidenz as a body text, but we want to move away from this a bit.\n\nAnyway, suggestions are most welcome!  \nMany thanks\n\nMarije\n\n",
