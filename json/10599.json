I know people who love them, who go out specifically to visit them, who will drive all over town every Saturday looking for 'treasures', who make note of dates and times posted on lamp posts, etc. And I'm sure that their diligence means that they do, indeed, find wonderful things at little cost, perhaps often. As I say, I generally avoid them because I'm mainly interested in books and I hate digging through boxes of dross hoping to find something desirable or rare or valuable or even readable. I'd rather wait for such a book to make its way up the bibliophilic food chain -- scout \\> general bookseller \\> specialist bookseller --, partly because I'm lazy and dislike spending hours digging through charity shop bins, stacks of old _National Geographic_ magazines, etc. looking for something worth buying, and partly because having worked in the trade I know that I would be cutting in on some scout's territory.   \n   \nLast Saturday, though, the sun was bright, the weather warm, and the first weekend of the yard sale season brought out dozens of sellers along the sidewalks of Vancouver's West End. I was walking out to pick up my dry cleaning, and something about a particular yard sale -- its size, the quantity of stuff on offer, perhaps -- drew my attention, and I surprised myself by taking a detour to visit it. And look what I found:   \n   \n ![Sheila Waters print](http://web.archive.org/web/20050515203309im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/70949.jpg)   \n   \nA signed limited edition print of calligraphy by Sheila Waters. It needs reframing, but I'm quite chuffed, even if it did cost more than I would have considered a bargain.   \n   \nI'm not inspired to change my yard sale-avoiding ways, but I am left wondering what typographic, calligraphic or other lettering treasures my typophile comrades might have turned up at such events?\n\n",

But instead of the standard hillbilly corn-pone recesses, it has the alphabet made of animals and what-not. Must have cost them about 25 cents at Swap-O-Rama on South Ashland in Chicago. I don't have it in the office or I'd post a photo. Makes hella good cornbread, incidentally.\n\n"
