If no cardinal is said, there is no indefinite article (as there would be in English), since the indefinite article is the same as the cardinal number one. So ‘hundred(e) og fjorten’ is the same as ‘a hundred and fourteen’, while ‘et hundred(e) og fjorten’ is the same as ‘one hundred and fourteen’.\n\n2. Unlike in English, an ordinal followed by a noun is not always used with a definite article: ‘for otteogtredivte gang’ (‘for _the_ thirty-eighth time’), ‘jeg bor på niende sal’ (‘I live on _the_ ninth floor’), &c.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo be honest, there are few points in this list I’m not entirely sure of. For one thing, I’m not sure if ‘101st’ should properly be written out as ‘(et) hundred(e) og første’ or ‘(et)hundred(e)ogførste’. I _think_ the first is the only correct option, but I can’t find any definitive answer from Dansk Sprognævn (the Danish Language Council).\n\nAnd some of these are so extremely rare as ordinal numbers that I had to look them up to find out what their ordinal forms are. I’ve never seen or heard ‘milliardte’ used. I also don’t think most Danes are aware the ordinal form of ‘hundred(e)’ is just ‘hundrede’. My first guess at spelling it, before checking with the dictionary, was ‘hundredende’, which is how anyone would most likely say it out loud.\n\n"

I would think this could lead to some confusion. But perhaps Danes don’t abbreviate ordinals that often.</cite>\n\nActually, no, it very rarely leads to any problems or misunderstandings. The only ambiguity is when the ordinal is last in a sentence, since it is then indistinguishable from a cardinal; but even in such situations, context is usually enough to differentiate them quite easily.\n\nOrdinals of more complex numbers are usually avoided in speech, though. Instead of saying _seks hundrede og toogtres tusind fire hundrede og seksogfirsindstyvende_ (662,486th), most people would paraphrase and say _nummer seks hundrede og toogtres tusind fire hundrede og seksogfirs_ (number 662,486) instead. This also goes (even more so, actually) for numbers that end in 100, 1,000, 1,000,000, 1,000,000,000, &c., since those have such awkward ordinal forms.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<cite>Maxim — Declining ordinals? Yikes.</cite>\n\nYou should try Finnish, then. No genders, thankfully, but all numerals (cardinals and ordinals alike) are declined in all [15 or so cases](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012205308/http:/www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/finnish-cases.html \"Finnish cases\") both in the singular and the plural (yes, numerals in Finnish have both singular and plural forms! I’ll just ignore them here, though). And for complex numbers, _all_ constituents of the numeral have to be declined, so ‘three hundred and fifty-seventh’ in the allative case, for example, would literally be ‘to-third to-hundredth to-fiftieth to-seventh’. And they’re written as one big long word, too (but that goes for all numerals).\n\nA simple example, since the entire system is too complex to even hint at here, using 357th to go by:\n\nFormula (see below for abbreviations and explanation):  \n[Num]. [C nom] [C part] [C gen] [C ess] // [O nom] [O part] [O gen] [O ess]\n\n3. kolme kolmea kolmen kolmena // kolmas kolmatta kolmannen kolmantena  \n100. sata sataa sadan satana // sadas sadatta sadannen sadantena  \n5. viisi viittä viiden viitena // viides viidettä viidennen viidentenä  \n10. kymmenen kymmentä kymmenen kymmenenä // kymmenes kymmenettä kymmenennen kymmenentenä  \n7. seitsemän seitsemää seitsemän seitsemänä // seitsemäs seitsemättä seitsemännen seitsemäntenä\n\nPutting those together to form 357 is quite simple:\n\nC nom: kolmesataaviisikymmentäseitsemän  \nC part: kolmeasataaviittäkymmentäseitsemää  \nC gen: kolmensadanviidenkymmenenseitsemän  \nC ess: kolmenasatanaviitenäkymmenenäseitsemänä\n\nO nom: kolmassadasviideskymmenesseitsemäs  \nO part: kolmattasadattaviidettäkymmenettäseitsemätta  \nO gen: kolmannensadannenviidennenkymmenennenseitsemännen \\*  \nO ess: kolmantenasadantenaviidentenäkymmenentenäseitsemäntenä\n\nAbbreviations:  \nC = cardinal  \nO = ordinal  \nnom = nominative  \npart = [partitive](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012205308/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitive_case \"Partitive case\")  \ngen = genitive  \ness = [essive](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012205308/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essive_case \"Essive case\")\n\nThe singular stem (and the plural stem in many words, but thankfully not in the ordinals) is used to form all cases except the nominative and partitive, which often have stems of their own. It exists in two [grades](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012205308/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consonant_gradation#Finnish \"Gradation in Finnish\"), strong and weak. The genitive singular always gives the weak grade, while the essive singular always gives the strong grade (this isn’t true for all declensions, but it’s true for the numerals). It is thus necessary to know both the nominative and partitive for both the singular and plural, as well as the genitive and the essive singular, for any word in order to be able to decline it correctly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs numerals, the Finnish do the same as the Danes and Germans: add a simple period after the last number. To be honest, I’m not sure how they handle the cases. With cardinals, they simply add the (vowelless) case ending to the number, separated (as is common in Finnish) by a colon, so ‘in 357 houses’ would be written as _357:ssä talossa_ (or _kolmessasadassaviidessäkymmenessäseitsemässä talossa_). But it doesn’t seem likely that ‘in the 357th house’ would be written as _357.:ssä talossa_ (or _kolmannessasadannessaviidennessäkymmenennessäseitsemännessä talossa_).\n\n\\* That word took about half an hour to type. Cripes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll right, moving on to something slightly easier: Chinese.\n\nIn Chinese, to make a cardinal into an ordinal, you simply prefix it with the character 第 (dì). It’s always written out as a character, and it’s spoken where and as it’s written, whether the numeral itself is written as Chinese numeric characters or as Arabic numerals.\n\nThus:\n\n1 _or_ 一 (yī) =\\> 第1 _or_ 第一 (dì yī)  \n36 _or_ 三十六 (sānshíliù) =\\> 第36 _or_ 第三十六 (dì sānshíliù)\n\nA lot simpler. ;-)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI’d give you some info on Irish ordinals, as well, but I can barely wrap my head around half of those myself, so I should do some more research before trying my hand at it. Irish numerals are notoriously complex and tricky.\n\n"

The first ten are spelled out (cardinal ~ ordinal)\n\n1 egy ~ első 1.  \n2 kettő ~ második 2.  \n3 három ~ harmadik etc.  \nnégy ~ negyedik  \nöt ~ ötödik  \nhat ~ hatodik  \nhét ~ hetedik  \nnyolc ~ nyolcadik  \ntíz ~ tizedik\n\nBasically the rule is (except for the first three; they always seem to be special cf. one ~ first, two ~ second... uno ~ primero) to add -Vdik where V stands for a vowel harmonising with the vowels of the word (vowel harmony is a basic feature of Hungarian) [and some minor vowel length changes in the stem might take place].\n\nPurely technically, Hungarian ordinals can also take one of the 20+ cases and be in singular as well as plural (cf. Finnish), but that's really not what you are looking for\\* ;-). In most such cases, you'd write it out. (Again, technically, one would write it with number, dot, dash, ending: 1.-ben (first[inessive case])). When writing dates (which are spoken with the ordinal in possessive form (Hungarian marks linguistically what is possessed as opposed to what is possessing in most IE languages (genetive case)) they have a slightly different writing rule, as in not writing/dropping the dot, just writing \"május 1-én\" e.g. (May 1-[possessive marker][superessive case] meaning \"on the 1st of May\")\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\\* You really don't want to go into that, as there are more than just the ca. 50 combinations of cases and singular/plurar, as Hungarian marks several other things, as. e.g. possession and the person and number of possessor on the item as well, and additionally, whether the possession is in singular or plurar... so that adds up. -- However as opposed to fully inflecting languages, it's comparably easy, you can imagine it as a building kit, just adding modules (so you don't have to remember 6x2x25x2x... endings, just 6+2+25+2+... endings which you can combine then in 6x2x25x... ways... it's soo simple!\n\nThis cannot comete with the \"somewhat constructed\" Finnish riiuuyöaieuutiset (‘news about intentions for a dating night’), but one the (acutally atypical) Hungarian vowel-word is: \"fiaiéi\" which means \"his sons' somethings (that were referred to previously)\". And merely formally, you could go on saying fiaiéiéiéiéiéiéi... forever, if those somethings together again possess several somethings possessing together several somethings... but THAT's constructed (and noone could track it, right?), while the first could happen in a real conversation...\n\n"

But in addition to being a typophile, I also have a fascination with linguistics, so it's a little bit of both fueling my interest.\n\nI don't really have a grand scheme in mind, certainly nothing as ambitious as a contextual {ordn} feature. I doubt that would be of any practical benefit.\n\nBut I thought the discussion might be of general interest to the type design community. And I am interested to see if there is any use out there that is unfamiliar and eye-opening.\n\nI'm aware that, strictly speaking, the {ordn} feature really refers only to superscripted abbreviations -- which is a purely typographic convention, and really only a limited one, with seemingly no application to many languages.\n\nSo, really there are three semantic layers. There's the ordinal form itself (which is an essential semantic element); then there's the convention for abbreviation; and then there's potentially a typographic tradition of superscripting the abbreviation. I'm always interested in understanding the linguistic elements behind the typographic traditions and conventions.\n\nBut, practically speaking, I was pretty much planning to put a complete superscripted l.c. alphabet\\* in the {ordn} alignment -- different from the {sups} alignment.
