May all your resolutions (72 dpi or higher) become successes.\n\nI’m going to try to be nicer to strangers, eat healthier (i.e. less fast food!), get my debts under control, learn to select type with verve, embrace color instead of hiding from it, and just be a better person/designer in general.\n\nI’d like to hear what your resolutions are (or aren’t). Hopefully, they’ll be inspirations for all of us.\n\nMay 2008 bring us all greatness.\n\n [‹ Most Attractive Old-Style Year](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103050842/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40471 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lettering in the environment ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080103050842/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40422 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In 24 years of smoking, on average, a conservative guess of 3 cigarettes per day (handrolled for the past 10 years), I have smoked roughly 25,000 cigarettes. That’s a lot of carcinogens. So here it goes, the grand daddy of New Year’s Resolutions: I am going to quit tobacco.\n\n"
