      "content": "In my opinion, you can go two ways with Granjon, both are unconventional:\n\n1. Poliphilus, along with Blado as its accompanying italic will produce a more 'rustic' look. They don't have the best kerning table or the tidiest outline, though.\n\n2. Dante, a more contemporary reinterpretation of Bembo. Charles Malin definitely infused his spirit when he cut this type (it hasn't lost with the digital conversion, too, in my opinion), producing a face that, perhaps comparable to how Jan Tschischold reinterpreted Garamond, is contemporary yet classic.\n\nI imagine that you wouldn't want to use something common like Sabon or Adobe Garamond.\n\nOh, and the new Garamond Premier Pro might work too, if your budget permits.\n\n"

It has quite a different look to it than any other roman. It is supposedly two unmatched roman and italic designs. The only real drawbacks are the lack of italic small caps, the lack of Tall Caps (which were in the PS version), and the mismatched italic, though this last part is surpeisingly not so important. The italic is really pretty weird looking.\n\nIf I remember correctly, Plantin has some strangely short extenders.\n\nLoire appears to be a copy of a late 19th – early 20th century interpretation of Napoleonic typography,\n\n"
