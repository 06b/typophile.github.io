  "content": "Hello again!\n\nI'm doing logo and layout for my student organizations member magazine.\n\nIt's a swedish magazine and is called \"Askungen\" wich translates to either cinderella or ash kid (ask ungen). The organizations name is ASK (Arcada Studerandekår). So the name of the magazine is an amusing one.\n\nI'm pairing Daw Wide, which is their font and can't be changed, with Caecilia. I already made the calender where I used this combination and I think it works quite well ( [http://petergranfors.com/clients/ask/kalender\\_klar.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023154/http:/petergranfors.com/clients/ask/kalender_klar.pdf \"http://petergranfors.com/clients/ask/kalender\\_klar.pdf\")).\n\nNow i have started on a logo set in Dax Wide black. I'm planning on using Dax Wide light for headlines in the magazine and maybe Dax Wide black for larger articles. Caecilia will be used for body text.\n\nHere's what I got so far. I'd like to soften the Dax Wide and the two second versions are an attempt at that. The small text is Dax Wide bold in one version and Caecilia heavy in the other.\n\nCastigate away...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021023154im_/http:/typophile.com/files/askungen_logo_v1_5470.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I think the \"corporate\" direction is coming through as a result of the font choice. Not that it's necessarily bad, but I think something with a little more drastic style to it — especially since this is for a magazine — will serve your purpose better. Try experimenting with more extreme weight differentials between \"ask\" and \"ungen\". Or even extreme weights across the board (by that I mean ultra thin or ultra bold).\n\nAll in all I think this is much better than you had before, but I do agree with Ratbaggy, that it may be too corporate for your intended audience.\n\npenn\n\n"
