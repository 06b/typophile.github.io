  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am looking to know more about THAI fonts.  \nI have been doing some research and I have found some resources, but I am unsure of their quality.  \nBasically what I am looking is to see variations of the \"ch\" low-consonant, and also to see different designs of quality thai fonts.\n\nI know that my computer uses Thonburi, (as a system font for thai?)  \nbut are they other thai system fonts on a Mac?  \nAre there any big OT fonts that include THAI characters?  \nDoes anyone know of good THAI font or thai foundries?\n\nThanks for any comments or thoughts you ay have.  \nBest,\n\nGio.\n\n",

      "content": "Gio,\n\nLinotype offers two Thai typefaces, both in OpenType format, and each with a Regular and Bold weight. These typefaces were only recently upgraded to OpenType format and re-released. In the digital photocomposition days of about two decades past, these fonts were used by all sorts of Thai publications. I suspect that Thai readers are still quite familiar with them.\n\n[http://www.linotype.com/256569/sukothai-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014554/http:/www.linotype.com/256569/sukothai-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/256569/sukothai-family.html\")  \n [http://www.linotype.com/256576/sirichana-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014554/http:/www.linotype.com/256576/sirichana-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/256576/sirichana-family.html\")\n\nBy clicking on one of the fonts, you can surf along to a glyph map, and examine each letter in some degree of detail (like [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014554/http:/www.linotype.com/256572/sukothairegular-charactermap.html). If you know the Unicode value for the ch, it shouldn't be too difficult to spot.\n\nIt is my understanding that Adobe InDesign CS3 supports Thai OT fonts now, although I don't know if the software can offer correct hyphenation or spell check. Linotype's Thai OT fonts probably work as well as any others in basic Microsoft apps, too.\n\n"

We had no idea about thai type so I ended up spending a few days with my head in various thai design books which was interesting. Ive attached the design that was intended to go on the inside of the wine box that you open up for you\n\n[http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/lazcook/Insideofboxartwork\\_webread...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315014554/http:/img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/lazcook/Insideofboxartwork_webready.jpg \"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/lazcook/Insideofboxartwork\\_webready.jpg\")\n\n"
