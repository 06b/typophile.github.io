  "content": "I'm looking for an alternative to Sackers, ideally something a little more elegant or feminine but with a similarly classy authority - think Marc Jacobs logo. It'll be used in a logotype with no curved letters, in fact only V,Y,L,E, I and N and all caps. Trade Gothic Extended is one but just wondering if anybody knew of any others to try out.\n\n",
