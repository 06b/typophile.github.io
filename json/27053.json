  "content": "80's Audio manufacturer Nackamichi also used a font on a couple of their product models which looked like this:   \n ![Nakamichi's Dragon-CT logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419203812im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/43012.jpg)   \n   \nIgnoring the fact that there's an outline variety present too; the \"A\" is obviously very distinctive as is the overall character squareness. The curved upwards-tapers on the the end strokes of the \"G\" and \"T\" are also noteworthy.   \n   \nAnyone reconise this one? or do you think that it might be a custom-face??   \n   \ncheers, and thank you for reading.\n\n",
