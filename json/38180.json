Is book optimized for a particular size? It appears a bit heavier...\n\nI'm looking specifically at Didot Elder as an example.\n\n",

      "content": "Using 'roman' to refer to a specific font within a family, e.g. synonymous with regular, seems really dumb to me, since as an adjective it could be legitimately applied to any weight of upright type in the roman style (as distinct from blackletter, civilité, etc.). A 'book' font in this style is just as much roman as any other weight.\n\n"

      "content": "I think some of the confusion in the naming of fonts within a family is because some of the terms refer to weight (e.g. light, regular, bold), whereas others I regard more as optical size descriptors (e.g. book, text). When I see a font described as book or text, I expect that it's meant to be used at around 10-12 points in body text. So you could have book (or text) light, book regular, book bold. John Hudson is right: \"roman\" is simply a style descriptor--i.e. bold roman, bold italic. If there is no style descriptor, it's assumed to be roman.\n\n"
