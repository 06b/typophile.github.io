I am using Crypt but this does not fit perfectly on the grid and i am going to have to create outlines and individually tweek it all which will take a long time. it needs to look perfect as this is about the pattern designs aesthetics rather the functionality of the piece.\n\nPlease please help. my deadline is looming and I would be eternally grateful!!\n\niz\n\n [‹ resume fun](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010907/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44512 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Need a font to go with this ident ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010907/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44486 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
