The hook on the J could be custom, but the whole logo/type is handled so generically that i didn't believe that.\n\nName: \"Jiffi Stop\"\n\n-hook on the uppercase J (maybe custom)  \n-short tops on the lowercase f  \n-inside of uppercase O not perfectly circular  \n-uppercase T elements totally vertical (before skew/ital)\n\nany ideas?

It is likely, however, that the letters got a few tweaks along the logo design path.\n\nBeton is very close. [Geometric Slabserif 712 from Bitstream](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202111215/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/geometric_slabserif_712_extra_bold/) is another close one, but I have yet to find an oblique.\n\nIf you'll indulge the diversion, here are a few products that didn't pass up the chance to class up their act by sneaking in a 3-letter ligature.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202111215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/jiffylube_5466.gif)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202111215im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Jiffy_Pop_3577.jpg)\n\n"
