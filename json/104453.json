      "content": "The base font is could be any of many Gothic sans serif designs. Here is one by Filmotype that was used in movies: [Glenlake](http://web.archive.org/web/20140102145326/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/glenlake/) as digitized by Mark Simonson.  \nLife of Brian was made in 1979. IIRC the cracked monumental lettering dates from then. If so, almost certainly made by a graphic artist working without computer programs. As for the 3d effect this can be done direct on a font using a program such as Fontlab. To find out how to get the desired cracking effect using a computer, I suggest you consult any good book on Photoshop techniques or a few web searches for tutorials on textures etc.  \nGood luck.  \nDon\n\n"
