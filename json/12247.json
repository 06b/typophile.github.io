The formation of the Club is to encourage quality and innovation among practitioners. There are many people and businesses involved with type, the aim is to give all these different sources a voice and a meeting point. The Club holds regular meeting/events in Toronto and is a forum for discussion.\n\nMembers include typeface designers, teachers, graphic designers, art directors, printers, etc. Typography can be specialized, that is the problem; we all have particular interests. The Club aims to bring us all together.\n\nMembership is available to anyone interested in typography.\n\n[www.typeclub.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010202702/http:/www.typeclub.com/ \"www.typeclub.com\")\n\n",
