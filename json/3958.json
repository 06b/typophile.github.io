      "content": "I haven't heard of any problems with Photoshop in   \nparticular, however using a given font in both Classic   \nand OS X is not always intuitive--but it's easy enough   \nto figure out.   \n   \nIn short, it is possible to activate a font in OS   \nX and have it NOT be active in Classic. You have to   \nthink of these as two separate operating systems   \n(because they are).   \n   \nMake sure your customers are activating the font   \nin both operating systems if they're using the font in   \nboth Classic and OS X apps.   \n   \nHope this helps.\n\n"
