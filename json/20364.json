Cassiopeia is available as two bold fonts, one a basic non-joining font, the other a complex OpenType font using advanced feature programming for natural letter-to-letter joins.\n\nJust turn on the OpenType Contextual Alternates feature and type; there are 11 versions of each lowercase letter and 5 versions of each uppercase letter. The “calt” feature will select the correct version of the letter for its context. The code was written by the OpenType pioneer Tal Leming, responsible for the “randomisation” feature in Orange Italic’s “Local Gothic”. (Unfortunately, the feature can’t be displayed by the mudTyper; you can see only the Basic version.)\n\nAn early beta version of the font was used for the Village logotype.\n\nGalaxie Cassiopeia ships as cross-platform OpenType format for both fonts along with the Basic version of the font in legacy PostScript Type 1 format. The type supports dozens of languages, and a license sells for US$59.\n\n[http://vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCassiopeia/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813141826/http:/vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCassiopeia/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCassiopeia/mudTyper+Weights/\")\n\n/ / / / /\n\nFlama Version 2 from Feliciano Type Foundry\n\nMario Feliciano presents an update to his popular Flama family, adding Thin and Ultralight weights at the skinny end of the gamut, and Extrabold filling a gap at the heavy end.\n\nThe family is now 9 weights in roman and italic, ratcheting the usability up a notch. You can see the family put through its paces in “Black Book” magazine.\n\nFlama V2 ships as cross-platform OpenType format along with legacy PostScript Type 1 format fonts. The type supports the Latin 1 encoding, and a single user license sells for US$380.\n\n[http://vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813141826/http:/vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights/ \"http://vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights/\")\n\n/ / / / /\n\nAn offer you can’t refuse!\n\nIt feels like Summer, but is still technically Spring, and we’re offering a specially-priced springtime selection of recent display fonts: 5 type families from 5 foundries.\n\nSpring 2006 Display set:  \n/ Bello Pro from Underware (Connecting script with OpenType ligatures and small caps)  \n/ Garda from Feliciano Type Foundry (3 variants of classic capitals)  \n/ Kaas by Hugo d’Alte for Thirstype (Silver prize in Finland’s Grafia competition!)  \n/ Local Gothic from Orange Italic (with revolutionary OpenType randomization)  \n/ Mavis from Village (2 variants with subtle alternate-replacement)\n\nGet these five families for only $229, one-third off the combined price of $353.
