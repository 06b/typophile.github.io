The fonts will be free for download for regular commercial and personal use but not free for repackaging, redistribution, renaming etc. Any help would be great.

      "content": "I have seen more than a few places (not so much fonts, but other sorts of software) that promote a \"Free Download\" of software that is useless in one way or another until you pay them. That they don't charge for initial downloading is enough in their minds to call it \"free\". I do not agree with this and consider it a shady business practice.\n\nBut anyway, as you were saying, many free fonts do carry the license you speak of, using nearly the same words you do in your question. No thick legal mumbo-jumbo. It doesn't offer much protection, but will at least make courteous repackagers ask first. Be sure to include contact information, including an email address you can be contacted at for years to come.\n\n"
