It says [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503172025/http:/www.gdusa.com/issue_2008/01_jan/feature/p32.php) Ken Schwartz currently leads the graphic design department at the The Luxury Brands Group, consisting of — amongst others — St. Regis Hotels and Resorts. Not sure if he did the logo, though. You might wanna drop him an e-mail.\n\n"
