Those photos came from fake old style newspaper pages.\n\nI choose serif in the classification, but I am also searching for the sans-serif font, use to highlight some words.  \nFor the serif I think this is very close to the baskerville font, but some details are different.\n\nAnd sorry for the photographies quality, it's an old digital device... :s  \nSorry if my english is too bad.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054739im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC06305_6185.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054739im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC06304_4377.JPG)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054739im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC06167_5380.JPG)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Century Schoolbook, Benton Sans Bold \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [osamu](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054739/http:/typophile.com/user/215937 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

The Monotype version (linked) is probably the best match from what I can tell, though other foundries (Adobe, Bitstream, ITC) have renditions also worth checking.\n\n"
