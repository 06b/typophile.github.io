      "content": "@ Yves Peters: thanks so much. :-) Indeed Chalet Paris looks as it may be the one, the original text (by the way from '97) actually includes a few other letters (which unfortunately I wasn't able to include in my sample as I lack a scanner for making additional scans to these I have) and they all appear to match, the \"G\", yes, with that of Chalet Paris 1970's set, and the rest of the letters with those of Chalet Paris 1960's one I'd dare to say (taking a closer look at the \"R\" ;-))... (Only the \"J\" seems as having a tightened hook, but then again, perhaps it's just my impression...) So, and again, thank you for the tip! :-)\n\n"
