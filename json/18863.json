This can manifest itself in analogue processing of a digital aesthetic, more radically still in the inclusion of solids and material in the making of the poster or in duplicating one by hand. Here handmade is never seen as doing without something, but as a creative necessity. These works are a long way away from retro-romanticism, representing a productive relationship between the designers and their activity. The exhibition brings together Swiss and international works ranging from the vital charm of the imperfect to the most precise and careful work by the artist’s own hands.\n\nand then there’s the annual publication about posters by HGKZ zurich (art-school and museum in zurich), its the second book on [this page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907165443/http:/www.museum-gestaltung.ch/Htmls/Verkauf/PosterCollection.html).\n\n"

These areas happen to be closely related, but they are quite different things.\n\nLettering is a robust and interesting field of its own, without mixing it with typography. It’s certainly a wonderful topic for your flickr gallery.\n\nThere is a major definitive difference between Lettering, which is necessarily handmade, individual or one-off, Typography, which is the general use and setting of typefaces (and sometimes lettering) in layouts, and fonts or Typefaces, which are mechanical, repeatable systems, used for typography. Typefaces can be based on hand-lettering, but by definition, they repeat shapes in infinite combinations. Typefaces can come close, but they can’t yet offer the true individual freedom and expressiveness of hand lettering.\n\nPeople with skills at hand-lettering will appreciate the distinction; their skills are rare and their work adds much expressiveness to the graphic scene, which typefaces cannot provide. I think this is what you celebrate in your image collection!\n\n"
