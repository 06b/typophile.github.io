Slightly different sizes with same leading, no baseline shifts. I export as RTF file but in Word 2008 and 2011 for mac, the baselines of the fonts are different. I am trying to export this complex \"branded\" style resume and keep the styling. All works fine except I can't figure out why the fonts have different baselines. Driving me nuts. Both fonts are Opentype and using Font Book as I had problems using my Fontagent program.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Client will want file any day now..\n\n",
