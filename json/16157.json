Also, I’m using OSX Tiger (English) and the user machine is Windows (French).\n\nSince I’m new to all of this, what should I be looking for to tackle this problem?\n\nThanks…\n\n",

I output them as Open Type and all went well.\n\nNow, I need to figure out why this works and ttf doesn’t. I guess I should just start reading the manual.\n\nThanks Mike…\n\n"
