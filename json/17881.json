One of the black defaults in Illustrator is a \"rich black\" composed of different levels of C, M, Y, and K. The other is C0 M0 Y0 K100, and shows up as a very dark grey. In the most recent version of Illustrator, you can change how it handles black as far as displaying, printing, and exporting to other applications.\n\nAlternately, you can always just save the image from Illustrator using the \"Save for Web\" feature; it is extremely handy. Just set your crop marks in advance.\n\n- Josh\n\n—æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ——æ—  \n**\"Wishers and woulders be small householders.\"**  \n_—Wynkyn de Worde_\n\n"

I suppose the thin/thick patterns of the E-13B helps differentiate each figure in order to increase the speed and accuracy of the face. The page I linked above seems to provide a technical explaination for the varying widths of the characters.\n\nAlso, it is interesting to see how different the other MICR typefaces are, especially the CMC-7 below. It even has an accompanying alphabet !\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233313im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cmc7.jpg)\n  \nImage from [www.morovia.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021233313/http:/www.morovia.com/ \"www.morovia.com\")\n"
