  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm creating a logo for an imaginary gallery/exhibition dealing with all aspects of typography, that I have named Display/Type.\n\nI can't seem to get the logo quite right - there are some issues with letterspacing, particularly TYP and LA. Any solutions to the letterspacing, or comments on the logo in general are much appreciated.\n\nThe logo is set in Akzidenz Grotesk, but I'm sure most of you would identify it easily enough =)\n\nCheers,\n\nGary\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [picture3.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204141506/http:/typophile.com/files/picture3.png) | 20.9 KB |\n| [Picture 8.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204141506/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%208_10.png) | 10.55 KB |\n\n",

Try aligning letters more, you can modify the letters to fit what you want. I agree with both gerald and chris, space out the letters a little.\n\nJonE.\n\n"

After a bit of tinkering, I think I'm getting there...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100204141506im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pic2_5056.png)\n\nI much prefer it reversed out, looks more interesting.\n\nGerald - L has been extended - you confirmed my concerns about it. Was trying to reduce the negative space between L and A, but I think it's alright now. I've also extended the stem of the T a little.\n\nChris - I've spaced them out a bit more, do you think it looks more balanced now? I had tried some condensed faces, but didn't like the results. I'm a huge fan of condensed faces, but on this occasion they didn't suit the sloping lines, and it looked rather squashed.\n\nJeo - You're right about the bolder typeface working better. I didn't have a bold enough version of Akkurat, so I've fattened it up a bit. The angled lines are taken from the angle of the Y.\n\n"

      "content": "Way better. The kerning with 'TYPE' is as good as it can get by itself. The only thing now would be to align the edges of the letters to each other...for instance, aligning the bottom left edge of the L with the right, inside part of the Y, this will 'lock' everything in place.  \nAlso the line to the most right is kind of far away from the 'Y' creating a more visible part of the word. Since there are two lines in the beginning, that 'cuts' up the word more in the front then in the back. Don't be afraid to take away more of the E. I like the spacing of the last line as it is in picture 3.\n\nJonE.\n\n"

Looks a lot better now, cheers.\n\nI see your point regarding the cropping, although I feel 'E' looks strange when cropped too much, and when the diagonal line is too close to the Y, it creates an awkward trapped space between them. Plus, with there being so much empty space at the bottom left, a little space between Y and the line provides a bit of balance (I think!).\n\n"
