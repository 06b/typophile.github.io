Enschedé en Zonen (Netherlands)... </cite>\n\nAbove is an example from something I am working on.  \nThough both sizes are more than one, and hence plural, it would seem grammatically correct to say **points**.  \nI prefer **point** as it seems more modern and can exist with out the superfluous s on the end.\n\n**but** why does it feel natural to use both in the same sentence. I could have just gone with one of the two options above but I thought I would see if anyone had an opinion on this.\n\nSo, I am proposing a style where in the **first instance the singular** is used and for the **last instance in a sentence plural**  \nBTW when I refer to points as a size of a type the number is a figure.\n\nhere is another example:\n\n<cite>A ‘9 on 12 point body’ describes a type usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points larger.</cite>\n\nAny thoughts or known facts...\n\n",

      "content": "I'd say it's a matter of nominal vs. adjectival forms. In adjectival forms with units of measure, you use the singular (e.g., \"20-dollar bill\"). When used as a noun, the unit of measure takes the plural with numbers other than one (e.g., \"it costs 20 dollars\"). So _A series of seventeen Didot fonts sized between 4.5 point and 21 points_ is not correct, because both instances are functioning as nouns rather than adjectives, whereas _A ‘9 on 12 point body’ describes a type usual to a 9 point body which is cast onto a body three points larger_ is correct, because it uses singular where the number plus unit function as an adjective modifying a noun, and plural where the unit is used as a noun.\n\nIt might be different sometimes in a language that has plural adjectives, assuming it allowed such constructions.\n\n"

      "content": "Almost there. The shift to singular happens when the measure is part of a compound adjective that modifies a noun. Compound adjectives should also be hyphenated: a 3-inch nail, an 80-year-old man, 12-point type.\n\nThe measure stays plural if it's in a phrase on the other side of a verb. Then it's modifying an adjective. The actual adjective of the phrase is sometimes missing but implied: \"The race is ten miles\" really means \"The race is ten miles _long._\"\n\nNow, some fudging occurs when people start to think of a compound adjective as one that can be used where any other adjective can. Arguably, you can say \"The type is 12-point\" as easily as the \"The type is black.\" But it's an unusual way to say things in most situations; we don't say \"The race is ten-mile.\"\n\nSo let's look at your example.\n\n\"A series of fonts sized between 4.5 points and 21 points was founded.\"  \n(\"was\", not \"were\", because the subject is \"A series\".) I would argue that the word \"sized\" demands this form. \"This font is sized to 21 points\" is like \"This building was built 21 floors tall.\"\n\nI think that use of \"sized\" is awkward anyway. I would say:  \n\"A series of fonts between 4.5 points and 21 points in size was founded.\"\n\nYou could also say:  \n\"A series of fonts from 4.5-point to 21-point was founded.\"  \nThis treatment of adjectives is similar to that in such phrases as \"all creatures great and small\".\n\nAbove all, measurements listed together as the same part of speech should be in a consistent form, no matter how much more \"specific\" you think one number is than the other!\n\n"
