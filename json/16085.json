  "content": "Hello,\n\ni´m looking for an alternative of old Akzidenz Grotesk. I`ve desigend an fashion identity with it and i miss thin and ultralight cuts now. After that the capitals are bigger than rest letters, that isn`t beautiful. Of course, i can use Helvetica, but \"s,c,e\" of extended Akzidenz Grotesk give main charakter to my creation and Helvetica Extended isn`t so wide than extended AG. Question: does it exist \"New Akzizend Grotesk\" or somethink similar, even with my specifications? (thin, ultralight, wide extended, clean). Thanks a lot.\n\n",

Lightline Gothic, News Gothic and Franklin Gothic were also ATF's grotesk typefaces inspired by Akz. (ITC Franklin Gothic is the bastard child of this ATF family).\n\n"

It's just that it has neither thin nor ultralight weight. Otherwise, it is very close in style to Akzidenz-Grotesk.\n\n"

You can see that AG Wide unclean face even at bigger sizes. And for fashion purposes it needs to be ultralight to affect as \"normal\" at big sizes on banner, poster or website. Light cut isn`t enough. I`m surprised that nobody tryed \"contemporary clean up\" of this typeface till this day.\n\n"
