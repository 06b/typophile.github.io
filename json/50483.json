For the “strenght” i would prefer an extended, dark weight here.\n\nOr a “woodtype” Sans like Maple, bold or black weight.

I like your keywords but I am not sure if the western style fonts is the type of ’tradition’ I am going for. when i think craft beer, I think Samual Adams, which is one of the biggest ’craft’ breweries (sold on the NYSE even).\n\nThey use a stately serif type. But it shouldn’t be too grandiose since craft beer is about variety, taste and comfort.\n\ni like your suggestions, but could use some more.\n\n"
