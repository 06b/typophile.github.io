  "content": "Hi,\n\nI’m having problems linking data from various worksheets to one master worksheet, all in the same workbook. The workbook contains swimmers PB’s (personal best times)for each stroke and after each gala the swimmers new time is entered onto the worksheet. The worksheet data is then sorted so that the fastest swimmer is at the top.  \nThe master worksheet contains all swimmers by name (alphabetically) and their best times for each stroke, what I am trying to do is have the master worksheet update automatically when I enter the swimmers new PB’s in the individual stroke worksheets, this works when I use ’Paste Special’, but when I go to sort the data with the fastest swimmer at the top, the data in the master worksheet does not reflect the correct times.  \nDoes anyone have a possible solution please.\n\n [‹ meta usage](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828003322/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42959 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Serif Paired with Avant Garde ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828003322/http:/www.typophile.com/node/42945 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
