You can change the order (in FontLab) by dragging the features up and down in the list on the left side of the OpenType Panel.\n\nBTW, when you add a new feature, it gets placed just before (above) the currently selected feature. If you know where you want it to go in the list, you can use this to save the step of moving it. Note: You need to hit the \"compile\" button to get it to stay in this initial spot, otherwise it will get moved to the end when you save. I have no idea why, but that's how it works.\n\n"

Adding all the different figure styles to the frac feature would add some unnecessary complexity to the feature code (unless maybe you have fractions with old style figures or something, which I don't think is the case, right?).\n\n"
