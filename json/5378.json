Here's a quickie attempt to simulate the sign with Folio Bold Condensed.   \n   \n ![esplanade](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110021142im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39387.jpg)   \n   \nI think the perspective and a little \"squooshing\" might account for the differences in weight, but the S and R are little rounder in your sample. And the middle stroke of the N is too light in Folio.   \n   \nThe S looks like it was borrowed from Franklin Gothic, Knockout or some other 19th-Century sans.\n\n"
