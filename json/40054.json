Icelandic) written in the Latin script. In this case, the definition of Western is political rather than geographic and dates from the Cold War period, i.e. Austrian is Western, but Czech is not. Minority languages are not well supported by the set, e.g. it lacks diacritics for Welsh, Saami, etc.\n\n"

Your default encoding is likely one of these. English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Swedish, Norwegian, Dutch, Danish, and Icelandic are generally covered in these encodings, though I think there are a few special accents and digraphs (notably the Dutch IJ and ij digraphs) that are missing for full and complete coverage of these languages.\n\n"
