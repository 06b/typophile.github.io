I am looking for more original printed samples, preferably the full set of glyphs, and the only way I will be able to do this is to know the original typface name. Knowing the designer/foundry will also help me to track down the copyright holder and to understand if that is still current.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n ITC Uptight Regular \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [donshottype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422054731/http:/typophile.com/user/205259 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

Most modern sources such as Rookledge's Classic International Typefinder list only ITC Uptight Neon, not Uptight Regular. But at least now I have what I need. Thanks all!\n\n"
