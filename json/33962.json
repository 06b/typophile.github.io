  "content": "Extensis has released an update to Suitcase 11 for Windows (v11.0.1), which includes auto-activation plug-ins for InDesign CS 3 as well as Illustrator CS 3. The update page is [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135422/http:/www.extensis.com/en/support/updates/suitcasewindows11.0.1.jsp).\n\nOn the Mac side, Suitcase Fusion currently provides a plug-in for Illustrator CS 3, but not InDesign CS 3. So, for the first time I can recall, Windows font management users are a bit ahead of the Mac side. InDesign CS 3 plug-ins are in development for the Mac though. Extensis' CS 3 compatibility page is [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018135422/http:/www.extensis.com/en/support/cs3_compatibility.jsp).\n\n",
