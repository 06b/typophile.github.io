I don't have much time for hunting right now, but [T-26](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141917/http:/www.t26.com/) has about the largest 'Techno\" collection of any regular foundry, and it might be worth a look through that selection. 'Luggage' and 'Phuture' are two fonts I seem to recall might resemble this better than Eurostile.\n\n"
