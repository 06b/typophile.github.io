  "content": "Does anyone know of a software/shareware program that will print font spec sheets, especially with key commands for Mac O/S?\n\nIn the old days of System 9 for Mac users, I had a type utility called \"TypeBook 4.0\" that allowed me to create sample pages (specimen sheets) for all of my type fonts. There were several options in TypeBook to do this, and the one that was the best was printing out (for example, a picture font) with the associated keyboard commands to get each character. This was great to have if you used picture fonts a lot, or special characters.\n\nUnfortunately, TypeBook, at least as far as I can tell, did not make the transition to O/S X for Apple Macintosh computers.\n\nI have tried demo versions recently of:  \n1. Veenix software's \"Font Tools\"  \n2. Extensis software's \"Suitcase-Fusion\"\n\nVeenix did not work with O/S x.4 and Suitcase Fusion, besides seemingly taking over your desktop, does not print a \"keyboard command\" style specimen sheet.\n\nThanks.\n\n",
