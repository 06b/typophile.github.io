I wanted to create an aesthetic that reflected a sordid, but confidently structured attitude. The second line uses the \"snap-on\" dots I'm working on; depending on the form of the word it may be desirable to have dots on a character. Also, I may employ snap-on ascenders/descenders that face the opposite direction. Any suggestions?   \n   \nP.S. I'll try to check out Industria.   \n Thanks.\n\n"
