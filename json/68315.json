  "content": "A friend of mine is decorating her apartment and asked if I could suggest any nice posters with a typographic and/or design theme. Nothing too pricey as she's on a tight budget (just out of college).\n\nI did a quick check of some online poster shops and found some vintage advertising art, some travel and movie posters with nice typography, etc., but most of them looked like posters you'd see for sale at stores everywhere; I think she's looking for something a little different or more sophisticated.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",
