Try how good you are at recongnizing fonts!  \n [Get it on Google Play.](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011084843/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Fplay.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.filippomariapanelli.typefacesfree)\n\nThe first typography game for Android is here!\n\nTest your ability to identify common fonts with three levels of difficulty.  \nYou are shown a small piece of text formatted using one of many common fonts and you have to guess the right name of the font within 4 choices.\n\nAt the end of the game you can see your correct and incorrect answers. If you answered one question incorrectly you can compare how the text looks like in the font you chose with the original text and learn the differences.\n\n",
