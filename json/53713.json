Why are the serifs curved on these letters and not on any others?\n\nBut, remember I'm just a beginner in this, so this might well be some sort of smart principle I'm just not getting.\n\nEDIT: I just realized you may have changed the curvy serifs in your newest version, in which case I take that back.  \nIt'd probably help to have a PDF; the lettershapes are kind of hard to make out in this size.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you, Altaira: you don't need to apologize by no means. I use to read your comments and I think they are very shrewd.  \nI completely redesigned the 9 and the 6 in this new version, and I guess they look much better than before.  \nActually, all serifs are curvy, but in the A, K, M, N, U, V, W, X and Y I tried a variation (dismissed now in uppercases, still in progress for lowercases) by pushing the inner vertex up or down accordingly. As you say, it doesn't work well.  \nSo, take a look at this rearranged model (in addition, I'll put a PDF for inspection [in my Typophile blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417112449/http:/typophile.com/blog/32203)).  \nThanks again, sharp buddy.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417112449im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Novena_Typophile_6118.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Marcelo,  \nI looked at your latest pdf. I'm certainly a beginner as well so feel free to ignore everything I write :)  \nThe overall effect is very nice, with the shapes and colour pretty consistent and harmonious.  \nThere are a few things that don't quite look right to my eye. The c looks a bit as if it were modelled on the e, and I think the bottom half could curve in more, as it looks a bit flat. I like e. I'd make the ear of the g heavier (longer and fatter), and perhaps lose some weight off the inside of the upper curve to balance the colour. j looks a little incomplete somehow. I think the diagonal leg of the k could be lighter. r,s and t are especially good. Maybe try stronger serifs on the z?  \nAs for capitals, the stem of D looks a bit thin compared with the bowl. E and F and nice, but I think the lower bar of E could be too far out. The tail of the J is very heavy and will look weird if next to a C for example. M could be a bit too narrow. Tail on Q is too light I think. S and T look to be different weights.  \nI like your numerals. I suspect 1 will need much heavier serifs and its head may need to be wider. 3 and 5 need to harmonise a bit more. 4 looks light. 6 and 9 may be a bit too wide. 9 needs more space. It also still looks rotated!  \nYour punctuation is pleasant. I think £ may be out of place and need a base like your E. € could be narrower.  \nI hope that's useful, I'm only making suggestions so see what you think and try them out if you like.\n\n"

      "content": "New version of Novena text, all glyphs adjusted and “equalized”.  \nFinally, I guess my 9 stands on itself and all serifs fit.  \nAs **speter** suggested, dots on i and j are lighter.  \nLet's follow with **Bendy** ;-) :\n\n- Actually, the e is modelled on the c; both are modelled on the o. I like them so.\n- The g is reshaped. I agree it needed a bolder ear it lost along the development.\n- My will on the j is to keep it simple. Anyway, it has changed a bit.\n- The leg of the k is now thinner and variates up to down.\n- I adjusted the z based on its capital.\n- The bowl of the D is perceptually lightened.\n- The E and the F have their bars resized in order to appear proportionally weighted.\n- I always thought the tail of the J was heavy. I don't know why I never changed it before.\n- May be the M looks a bit narrow yet. Let me think about it.\n- The Q has a new tail.\n- The S and the s are refined to fit in shape, angles and weight.\n- Look at the new 1. I guess it appears more healthy.\n- I put hands on 3 and 5. It was a hard task, but I think they're improved.\n- My 4 remains (up to your point of view) light, but I don't wanna touch it by now.\n- I redesigned 6 and 9.\n- You were right: the £ was absolutely wrong in “ductus”.\n- I don't like narrow versions of €. Even I consider it a character (not a logo), one must preserve something of the original logo's guidelines.\n\nWell, here it is Novena revamped (Notice: [the new PDF is in **my blog**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417112449/http:/typophile.com/blog/32203), as usual, or clicking [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417112449/http:/typophile.com/files/Novena_Typophile_0.pdf)):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417112449im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Novena_Typophile_5174.jpg)\n\n"

If I were to criticise anything, I'd say the arm serifs of E and F are a little light. I'd also consider doing something to tame the ascender serifs a little, but I guess that's a question of taste.

Without that, your serifs (which are rather long) on the left sides of those letters look bent outwards.\n\n- K's leg doesn't look as stable as it should.\n\n- take another look at the humps of m, n, and u. Something's off on the drawing there - I think they thicken too fast coming out of the stem? I think that contributes to the topheavy sense of m and n that I was addressing before by suggesting heavier bottom serifs.\n\n- your cedilla has an italic slant to it - I'd make it more upright.\n\nSeek opinions from others on these ideas, too - I'm not an expert.\n\n"
