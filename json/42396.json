  "content": "Hi all!\n\nI'm starting to develop a new logo for a new (small) company for training in psychology. In English \"perfil d'alma\" its \"soul profile\".  \nI dont like very much the result, but...its the owner idea (she likes it!).  \nMy post here is more a typhographic question. The letters are not a typeface but draw from a typeface found on a old book see [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023232838/http:/typophile.com/node/42228).  \nWhat do you think about it? Good shapes, kerning/spacing?  \nAny comments apreaciated.  \nThanks in advanced.\n\nAntónio\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023232838im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_4805.png)\n\n",
