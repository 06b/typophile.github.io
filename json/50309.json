  "content": "Hello - I’m trying to identify the owner/licensor of the font EEurostile Normal. My research stemming from the original font file has yielded the following: The original copyright owner/licensor was The FONT Company, which merged with Precision Type Foundry in 1993. Precision Type ceased operations in 2004 and is currently a defunct subsidiary of Protocall Technologies. I haven’t rec’d any response from Protocall and I’m hoping someone out there can tell me who is the definitive licensor. I’ve narrowed it down to Protocall Technologies or Adobe, both of whom have not responded to my inquiries.\n\nPlease help!!! :)\n\nThanks.
