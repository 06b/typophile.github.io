      "content": "Oh. Andrea, are you in Vancouver?   \n   \nI'm not a good person to judge whether this is a good logo idea overall: I'm not a graphic designer, and my approach to a design problem is simply to work at a single solution until it is perfect, usually ignoring any question of whether a different solution might be better.   \n   \nI think A and C are working much better than B, in both colour and arrangement. Some suggestions for improvement:   \n   \nShorten the ascender on the lowercase b in the vertical lettering. It sticks out way too far. See how short you can get it and still have a legible b.   \n   \nAdjust the alignment of the three words so that the left side of the O A and B are optically aligned. In your current versions the O is too far right and the B too far left, creating a visual slant.   \n   \nIn the A and C arrangment, there is more optical white space below the word 'Art' than above it. See if you can balance this.   \n   \nI think the words look much better closer to the 'spine lettering' as in C.   \n   \nHere is a modified version with these suggestions applied:   \n ![OAB (JH)](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822160721im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/8700.gif)   \nFinally, I recommend providing two versions, one with 'Vancouver's Art Book Stores' incorporated as in C, and one without this line. Both will be useful.\n\n"

      "content": "thanks john, i appreciate your feedback and i agree with your suggestions. especially shortening the descender. now when i look at the \"oab\" of logo b all i see is an excited flourescent snowman.   \n   \nyes i am in vancouver! in case you know anyone else that would be interested (maybe keith would be as well) oscar's is having a logo contest with $500 books as payment for the designer. oscar's is one of my favourite bookstores so that's why i'm doing this in the first place... thanks again for your help: )\n\n"

      "content": "Andrea, i think that the speech of the logo is a little redundant or ambiguous, is this a store or a chain of stores, is (or are) the stores from vancouver or from oscar. (well maybe i perceve redundance because i almost never speak english).   \n   \nRedundace comes too when you repeat Art Store Twice, and the capitals OAB twice too. Take a look:   \n   \n [http://www.identityworks.com/Issues/issues1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130822160721/http:/www.identityworks.com/Issues/issues1.html)   \n   \n   \n   \nHope i could help you, i\n\n"
