Some letters are very similar but others are way off, plus your sample is probably thinner than the thin weight.\n\nIt also looks like a simple, geometric alphabet I have in a traditional British signpainting manual from the '80s that was meant to be drawn with large-size compass and set square. I'll find the name of that which might help if you need to draw something like this yourself.\n\n"
