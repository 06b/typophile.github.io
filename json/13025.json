I work as a newspaper page designer and our writers recently switched from Word to InCopy, and as a result I can give them spaces on the page, paragraph- and character styles to work with, and all the terrors of importing microsoft rtf:s with all their attached problems are gone. We all love it, and the typo is great (because they can work with the headline on the page while I work with other stuff – we save time). The whole editorial system is now built around InDesign and it’s pretty smooth, even if Quark as a layout program was a lot faster, even on old G4’s. However, I’d like to hear comments on InCopy. It seems like it’s only used by bigger newspapers in their editorial systems ... why?\n\n [‹ Glyphs, glyphs, glyphs...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905054446/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13030 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New 'Legend of Zorro' type treatment ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905054446/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12871 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
