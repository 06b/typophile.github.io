The 'e' is too open for the usual suspects (Helvetica/Univers/Akzidenz), and the G is wrong for Arial and Myriad. If there was a Letter Gothic Black it would be closer.

The closure on the Kievit G doesn't even make it a candidate with an added 'beard', so I think Lex's suggestion wins my vote.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
