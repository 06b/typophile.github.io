  "content": "So a week or two ago I posted a logo for critique. I hadn’t yet registered the domain name and put up a business card design that contained the proposed domain.\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/60849](http://web.archive.org/web/20090923121811/http:/typophile.com/node/60849 \"http://typophile.com/node/60849\")\n\nMy client was supposed to register the domain last week and didn’t. This morning I ran across this:\n\n[http://stoneandwoodconcepts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090923121811/http:/stoneandwoodconcepts.com/ \"http://stoneandwoodconcepts.com/\")\n\nI’ve contacted the company, who does actually operate doing countertops in another geographic area, and they’re willing to sell the domain “as a reasonable price that covers their costs”. I also informed him they’re in violation of copyright law and he seemed to think it was something that their designer came up with (dates on this are easily provable).\n\nIf you do a google search for “granite countertop logo” my original thread comes up as the last result on the first page. You can put the pieces together to see what happened.\n\nMoral of the story: watch your backs guys, and apparently trust no one.\n\n",

This is from the Lanham Act, and is in reference to the factors that can be considered to determine whether a defendant acted in bad faith, § 1125(d) [43(d)](1)(b)(VI):\n\n<cite>(VI) the person’s offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial gain without having used, or having an intent to use, the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services, or the person’s prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct;</cite>\n\nBut it all comes back to registration, use, and distinctiveness.\\*\n\n\\*I’m not a lawyer.\n\n"

If a trademark was held on the name this would be a pretty clearcut matter, but that unfortunately isn’t the case.

I’m actively discussing the legal options with my attorney so I’ll refrain from any more comment on this for the moment. Thanks for the support, I’ll let you guys know what happens.\n\nAnd again, be careful what you post. I’ve certainly learned my lesson.\n\n"
