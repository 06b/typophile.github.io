  "content": "I read today that Hackney council are going to remove all of Banksy’s Graffiti in the borough. Considering that his ’work’ goes for up to a million nowadays, (the price that Brangelina supposedly paid for one of his pieces), it would be a shame. The council should be encouraging people to go on a ’Banksy trail’ walking tour, not obliterating these works of art. It adds interest to an otherwise not very interesting area.\n\nHere’s a witty bit of vandalism I spotted last time I was in The Smoke.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224220525im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Vandalism_4637.jpg)\n\n [‹ Drawing letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224220525/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38408 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Rockies Logo vs Red Sox Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071224220525/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38511 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
