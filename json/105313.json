  "content": "Hello there, anyone can help me with this?\n\nI've been working on the wordmark for an apparel shop. Their consumers are mostly men. However they also sell women clothing. I presented some sketches and they liked them but they thought they were manly, so I was asked to make it more womanly. I can't figure out what they meant typographically thinking.\n\nWhat would you consider makes a typography in this vein more feminine?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419152422im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PUERTO33-3_4550.jpg)\n\n",

A thick/thin contrast would be hard to realize —I think— why not making the wordmark a lil bit thinner at all?\n\nRegards,  \nFlorian\n\n"

I kind of like the results, though there are some thing I'm not quite happy with.\n\nI feel the “T” is not wide enough. Although I like the feel of the “U” and “O”, I'm not sure about the “O” shape. Finally, I haven't figured out the look of the \"33\" but I'll keep working.\n\nI'm very happy with the feedback provided by this community, I don't know why I hadn't signed in before. You're great guys.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419152422im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Evernote%20Camera%20Roll%2020130808%20090221%20p_6196.m..jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Hey moramedia,\n\nthat’s looking good so far, much better than your initial sketch. There is a certain feel of the ‘Prada’ logo, very elegant but not to fancy.\n\nIn my opinion the serifs a wee bit too tiny. What about making them bigger, especially the serifs of the ‘T’ stem to small —I think.\n\nApart from that, keep up the good work!\n\n"
