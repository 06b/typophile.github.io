      "content": "1) Is the flower thing supposed do dot the i? Why is it moving to the right? If not where is the dot? \"DESIGNS\" doesn't seem to be the right type for that, it feels too letterspaced and too light if reduced. This one looks the strongest of the three.\n\n2) This one looks like an after thought. The placement of \"designs\" leaves me wondering why its there.\n\n3) Need distinction between lisa and redden.\n\n\\*Logos for design companies always seem the hardest to me. On top of that designing a logo for yourself is always the hardest. What is the theme for these logos? How much sketching did you do before going to the computer?\n\n"
