It _does_ look vaguely familiar. Oh, and it is a font — identical characters look identical; they’ve just been scaled.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090505173731im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Ikea-poster_6028.jpg)\n\n",

I searched Part 12 and 14 of the Script Guide, and didn’t find a match, but some of the [FF Child’s Play](http://web.archive.org/web/20090505173731/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-childs-play/) fonts were similar. Stuart’s Spaghetti Western (FontDiner)had similar shapes, but with serifs.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
