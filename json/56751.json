And once you do figure it out, the quirkiness of the initial impression makes the logo that much more memorable. I'm pretty sure the next time you see it, you will realize you saw it before.\n\nJust try to view it not as a text, but rather as a wordmark. Obviously if a novel were set in such a peculiar way, it would've been a disaster :-)\n\nBTW as some of you may remember we had [similar discussion before](http://web.archive.org/web/20141006194122/http:/typophile.com/node/52195) in the context of the \"precisionetworking\" logo.

Even when seeing it again, the broken word means I have to think deliberately (as Nina said in the other thread 'decipher') to read it. It also places emphasis on TWARE.\n\nAlso the broken word might make me wonder about the actual product. Is there a reason you wanted to fit the words on two lines?\n\n\\* I think the logo should fit with the premise of the user experience (e.g. wonderfully easy to read).

It could've not been THAT hard :)\n\n@sharon - it typically depends on the logo. There's plenty of logos that are effectively puzzles, especially those that make a heavy use of a neg space. They look nice at the first glance, but you can see something's off and there's something else going on. So you stare at them and then there's that AHA moment after which you remember the logo for a long time. So, yeah, they don't _need_ to be puzzles, but they certainly _can_ be.\n\n@joe324, @bobbybobo - these are certainly the options, but this effectively kills the core idea of my version - the quirkiness. The \"software\" is cut up in a strange way on purpose. If it's just \"soft-ware\" or \"software\", then the logo is just a collection of three words. They can be made look nice, but that's secondary.\n\n@litera - that's pretty much the exact effect I was going for. May be a bit milder and more accepting, but conceptually that's it :-) You will remember this logo now, right ?  \nAlso, regarding what it should be saying - if you step back and consider basic color clues, it should be obvious how the words are split. Additionally, the logo will almost always be used in the context that would suggest it's a computer-related business, so that would give yet another parsing clue.\n\n@ratbaggy - simple and great idea, thanks. I will use it.\n\n"

You can loose clients (or your client will) over this and they will not come back. Not easily at least.\n\nI do have to add that the target audience is important.  \nBut generaly, this would be the case.\n\nYou are trying to create an effect like an upside down ad in a newspaper or magazine.  \nI don't turn the magazine or paper upside down to read. I don't even sigh or shake my head. I just move on. Don't pay attention.\n\nBut I am sure there is a middle ground.\n\nIn my opinion a logo/brand/identity must give away a few things of the company.  \nI find it important that you will have a general clue about what kind of business it is.  \nBeside that a few core values will help.\n\nI don't see a software company immediately. But it could be.  \nHowever, you have shown a core value: we are not like others. But, is that true?  \nThe other value you show: we are difficult. Are they?\n\nAt the end of this all:  \nAfter a while every logo will find its way (not saying it is not important) and has its own reason to exist. But that is not how I do things.  \nThere are tons of logo's out there that are common ground but could be a bit better.  \nYou have to get this logo out quit a lot for people to understand.  \nYou have to communicate it over and over.\n\nThen it could work, I think.  \nEspecially on displaying certain values.\n\n"

      "content": "@bobbybobo - I hear you on skipping over stuff that's hard to digest. It's a good point regarding the \"we are not like others\" message, which is incidentally true and I should've mentioned that at the beginning. It is also an excellent point that it says \"we are difficult\", I haven't considered this angle. Thanks for that. Any thoughts on how to alleviate this impression ? I realize your version does that, but somewhat at the expense of the \"different\" part.\n\nAll in all, just to explain a situation a bit more. It is a small company, and the main focus is on the branding of the product rather than the company itself. The product is positioned as \"unique, not like others\" and (you are going to like this) \"simple\". So in a sense the company logo is secondary, and it just needs to be bold, unique and not to compete or contradict the product branding.\n\n@jakes - my take is that in the context of the _logo_ design the readability should of course be considered, but it's just one of many factors. Some of these do not apply in other cases (e.g. a book design), and the readability floats to the top.\n\n"
