And while Nick Shinn's [approach](http://web.archive.org/web/20110824010559/http:/typophile.com/node/9373) works for umlaut, it is not usable for other accents.\n\n[I posted this as a new topic, because I could not find a way to include photos in comments to other people's posts... sorry for that, but the new Typophile, while very nice, is not as intuitive as the old one].\n\nMarius Ursache  \nChief Creative Officer  \nGrapefruit ( [www.grapefruit.ro](http://web.archive.org/web/20110824010559/http:/www.grapefruit.ro/ \"www.grapefruit.ro\"))\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [stiintasitehnica.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20110824010559/http:/typophile.com/files/stiintasitehnica.gif) | 6.3 KB |\n\n",
