  "content": "OK, so I building some new pieces for a client. I request a hi-rez version of their logo for the pieces and they email me a 1200dpi jpg of a logo that has obviously been photocopied and faxed repeatedly for several decades. I would like to rebuild it but can't seem to come up with font. I pulled the letters out of the logo and rebuilt parts that were beat up.\n\nAny one recognize this? All else fails I will just rebuild the whole thing from scratch but just laying in a font is much easier if I can find it.\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021215616im_/http:/typophile.com/files/text_6162.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [text.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021215616/http:/typophile.com/files/text_40.jpg) | 44.46 KB |\n\n",
