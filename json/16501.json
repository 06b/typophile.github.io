  "content": "Hello everybody\n\nThere are 5 posters for a competition I took part in.  \nIt was organised for the 2nd Panhellenic Conference  \non Sexual Abuse. The theme was:  \n\"No Longer a Secret: Dealing with Sexual Abuse  \nand the Way towards Healthy Sexuality\".\n\nThe competition is over (no, I didn't win)  \nand so now I can show my proposals.\n\nAny comments? (I already know that I overused the heart symbol...)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [POSTER\\_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110154/http:/typophile.com/files/POSTER_1.jpg) | 47.86 KB |\n| [POSTER\\_2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110154/http:/typophile.com/files/POSTER_2.jpg) | 39.58 KB |\n| [POSTER\\_3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110154/http:/typophile.com/files/POSTER_3.jpg) | 37.3 KB |\n| [POSTER\\_4.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110154/http:/typophile.com/files/POSTER_4.jpg) | 64.03 KB |\n| [POSTER\\_5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621110154/http:/typophile.com/files/POSTER_5.jpg) | 43.75 KB |\n\n",

I messed with love...\n\nActually I wanted to say:  \n\"Love is a beutifull thing which can be a hell when we abuse it.\".\n\nWe may start from pure love, but then we lose the way  \n(we don't have a way to express it or we express it violently)  \nit can become monsterous.\n\nAs demons are fallen angels.\n\n―christos\n\n"

      "content": "Tim, David, don't take this the wrong way, but I think you're being too Anglo. I think it's wonderful to counter sexual abuse with a positive option instead of with melodrama or a large stick. In fact note that the title of the competition included \"the Way towards Healthy Sexuality\" - that got my attention most. And you would never see that in the US. I think this is nicely Greek, and the approach that could actually work.\n\nhhp\n\n"
