  "content": "Thank you all for the helpful info re. the 'Mysterious Pixel Font - Supermonomarket or Stansharp' post.   \n [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41476.html?1091054886](http://web.archive.org/web/20110125184022/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41476.html?1091054886)   \n   \nAlas the font was not one of the Sven St√ºber 'Superlooper' pixel fonts (every other 'super' but no Supermonomarket), and as Yves mentioned 'Stansharp' is a no go on google?   \n   \nI have tried contacting Group 94 ( [http://www.group94.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20110125184022/http:/www.group94.com/)) but have heard nothing back (can you blame them really), so my guess is it is a custom design by them.   \n   \nSo after all that I have come to the conclusion Verdana is not such a bad screen font after all!   \n   \nCheers.\n\n",
