  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am designing a book that contains interviews.  \nI have decided to use indents, both as a relief but also to make the questions (italics)  \nstand out, in order to make it easier for the reader to distinguish questions from answers in the text.\n\nI feel I am doing the right thing, but nevertheless, I am not quite sure if I am violating some clear typographic  \nrule or making nonsense by doing this.\n\nNB: My intention is to avoid 'empty lines'.\n\nSo my question is; am I doing the right thing or not, with these indents for firslt lines of questions and answers?  \nIf not, what would be the most appropriate way?\n\nThanks  \nJ\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Billede 8.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725161049/http:/typophile.com/files/Billede%208_0.png) | 63.03 KB |\n\n",
