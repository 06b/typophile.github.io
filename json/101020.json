  "content": "Hi!\n\nI'm trying to create a standard encoding for my fonts, but there are some glyphs that FontLab doesn't recognice, or even defines with incorrect unicode. Theese are the ones i've been having problems:\n\nGermandbls (should be U+1E9E)  \nTcedilla (should be U+0162)  \nTcommaaccent (should be U+021A)  \ntcedilla (should be U+0163)  \ntcommaaccent (should be U+021B)\n\nIs there any way to creating a encoding (.enc) that gives name+unicode to each glyph?\n\n",

So you set up the name-to-Unicode mappings in a .nam file, and then use those names in a .enc file. In FontLab, you then need to use the 'Generate Unicode' dialogue in the Glyph/Glyph Names menu to select a default .nam to use. [Note that every once in a while, FontLab will revert to its Standard .nam and you will need to reset the default.]\n\nPS. I recommend creating your own .nam files, even if based on those provided by FontLab, rather than editing the Standard .nam.\n\n"
