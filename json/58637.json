Mittwoch conveys a graceful air with its high-contrast letterforms and its ball terminals, but also includes some unique touches that are unexpected for modern faces. Mittwoch includes four different weights and 50 alternate characters, including swashes, more traditional modern letterforms and simplified characters for titling or when a more unique look is needed. For complementary companions, be sure to check out Montag and Dienstag, also available from insigne.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Mittwoch-Poster-2_4303.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Mittwoch-Poster-3_5890.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023144im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Mittwoch-Promo-Page_6421.png)\n\n[www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023144/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")  \n [www.twitter.com/insignedesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015023144/http:/www.twitter.com/insignedesign \"www.twitter.com/insignedesign\")\n\n",
