      "content": "Hi there:\n\nThe snake/caduceus has a mohawk hair-do. The type used for Torrington is too severe- harsh. I would suggest a more 'graceful' font. Also I think the type should be a titling face as that was Eidict Neo- am I correct?- is more for text work. Also the sans (Gotham?) is blacker in appearance that Torrington which I'm not sure how that will play out in print.\n\nAs for which logo right now... the bottom one. As a person unfamiliar with the Torrington name/brand I would not grasp that the caduceus is representing the letter 'i' and not just a dividing element.\n\nWhat are your colors for the design? Make sure the colors convey the feelings medical/science, natural, healing. I think you know I mean. Don't do everything in medical 'blue'.\n\nAll my best to you...\n\nMikey :-)\n\n"

      "content": "Shouldn’t the caduceus snake be curled round a winged staff?  \nAgreeing with Mikey on the type choice but, if you stay with the present style, kerning needs to be sorted, especially the Os and G. In the second version, which I prefer, the forename doesn’t have a relationship with the surname and the letterspacing is too great, I would also look at removing the stop after A.\n\nTim\n\n"

      "content": "The fonts used were Eidetic and Clearview. Both slightly modified.  \nClearview was a custom weight (by hand) with a slightly lowered crossbar on the \"H\", and the serif Eidetic was modified by adding a larger shoulders on the \"R\"'s.  \nA lot of custom type design, as well as icons were created on previous versions that were  \nnot picked by client, but these were the final two and at this stage these are the only two  \nI will be showing, so we can get the project finished and implemented. To give proper credit, the icon and the positioning of the type was created by my business partner Bradley Bishop.  \nI picked the type faces and did the final modifications and re-traced the icon.\n\n"
