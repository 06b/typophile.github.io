Interestingly, nobody else with access to the shop knows how to use it, and it hasn’t been used in years.\n\nI know something about letterpress printing from reading books about printing, but I still think it’d be a really, really good idea to read in more detail about how to use the machines. I’m looking for recommendations of books about how to use a letterpress.\n\n [‹ Garamond...the original](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091425/http:/typophile.com/node/48942 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Amsterdam for the weekend, any advice? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091425/http:/typophile.com/node/48914 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
