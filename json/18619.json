In 10 pt text, printed photopolymer, it could even be pleasant to read.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Jillican.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019002111/http:/typophile.com/files/Jillican.png) | 20.74 KB |\n\n",

However, mine is optically constructed rather than strictly geometrically. I am assuming that at 'text' sizes that it will lose the sharpness. Here are a couple of working screenshots, since you asked so nicely!\n\n—K\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019002111im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Victor.png)\n\n"

The whole concept is still gestating in my swede, I'm waiting for it to turn up in a design one day!\n\nGeorge: Cheers! The italic was originally totally upright, but had to leave that as the caps wouldn't play nicely. Perhaps for display…\n\nI'll keep y'all updated, still have a few bits 'n' bobs to sort out still!\n\n"
