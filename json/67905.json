It may be a customised version.\n\nIf I am not mistaken, ‘Strasse’ (instead of ‘Straße’) is a Helvetian spelling variant. The company with a ‘Kältezentrale’ may reside in Switzerland. This makes the use of a Swiss typeface for their signage even more likely. Can you say where these photographs have been taken, breckon?\n\n"
