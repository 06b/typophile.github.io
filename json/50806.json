  "content": "Oops... I did it again.\n\nI've given my pop hit [Cooter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/font/cooter) the star treatment. Give it up for [Cooter Deuce](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/font/cooterdeuce).\n\nWhere the original [Cooter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/font/cooter) offers a grab-bag of solid and counterpunched letterforms, [Cooter Deuce](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/font/cooterdeuce) has been split in two. The Regular style is endowed with a full set of counterpunched forms while the Plugged has its bowls and most of its counters filled or reduced for a heavier impression.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, [Cooter Deuce](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/font/cooterdeuce) has been drawn with more consistently square proportions, and a handful of glyphs have been entirely redesigned. Taking advantage of the Opentype format, it has even been fleshed out with a bevy of alternate glyphs, dingbats, and nifty decorative ligatures.\n\n[Here's a Cooter Deuce PDF.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/www.typetrust.com/fonts/specimen_pdfs/TypeTrust-CooterDeuce.pdf)\n\nIf you've purchased the original [Cooter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/font/cooter) at [TypeTrust.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typetrust.com/), there's a free upgrade available for download via the Order History pages of your TypeTrust Account. Some linework and kern pairs have been adjusted.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CooterDeuce01_4412.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405im_/http:/typophile.com/files/CooterDeuce02_6267.png)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [CooterDeuce01.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typophile.com/files/CooterDeuce01.png) | 42.57 KB |\n| [CooterDeuce02.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013071405/http:/typophile.com/files/CooterDeuce02.png) | 38.91 KB |\n\n",
