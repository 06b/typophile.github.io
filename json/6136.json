Surveyor (which must be the italics on this cover) is based on old map fonts. See [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20061203002747/http:/www.commarts.com/CA/featype/hoefler/) article.   \n   \nI couldn't find font showings for either, though. Maybe now that Martha's a bit hard up she'll sell these fonts to us peons to raise some cash.\n\n"
