      "content": "One trick we use at work, where multiple designers work on multiple publications: put an identifying code at the beginning of all the style sheets that belong to a particular publication, e.g., AA Body Text, AA Head, etc. That way, when text inevitably gets copied from another pub and brings the style sheet along for the ride, it's easy to weed out the intruder. We use the same naming convention for colors, too (AA 100c20m). Keeps our palettes pure.\n\n"

I find it works well and helps   \npush through the ultimately time-saving, but initially   \nirritating practice of creating the sheets.\n\n"
