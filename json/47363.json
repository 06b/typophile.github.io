The REAL name of this font is Ricky Nelson which was offered exclusively by Andreson Typesetting on the west coast of America . . .\n\nAt their heyday they had over 14 shops on the west coast and as part of their offerings, they released an exclusive line of typefaces . . . Among these was Bel Air originally designed by Clive Piercy and digitized by Robbie De ViIlliers later from Wilton Type . . .\n\nThere is a digital version of Ricky Nelson currently in the works (not by me) that will be released in the coming months and finally put an end to this obscure font ID . . .\n\nBTW, it HAS already once been digitized and offered under the name Designers, no credit is visible in that version . . .\n\nStuart\n\n"
