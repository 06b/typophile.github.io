The user is then free to do as he wishes with the fixed, rendered form; just like printing.\n\nIn the \"Cufón\" example (I'm using this as representative, not to pick on Cufón specifically), the font data itself is being materially modified to perform differently. Such a modification of the software data itself is a derivation under copyright and one needs permission from the intellectual property owner to do so.\n\nCurrently, the general license of most foundries does not grant this permission off-the-shelf. So, developers need to ask first. Some foundries may grant that permission, some may not. That's their right. Some may want additional fees, some may not. That's also their right.\n\nIf you can't come to terms, then you'll take your business elsewhere. I realize you hate having to jump through that hoop. The technologies and markets are still emerging. It will take a while to sort out.\n\nThere may come a day when the permission to make these modifications becomes incorporated as a de facto part of a standard license. I get that that's what you'd like to see happen. But we aren't there yet.\n\n"

That's perfectly fine. But there's always going to be someone who does it anyway, and the \"EULA allows this\" checkbox is pretty much all we can do about it. In cases like this, would you rather not have your copyright embedded to the font files at all?\n\nWhat do you count as modification anyway? Even Abode Flash slightly modifies the curves of embedded fonts by converting them to quadratic ones (see \"Converting TrueType fonts to SWF glyphs\", page 172 of [http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/pdf/swf\\_file\\_format\\_spec\\_v10.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209195915/http:/www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/pdf/swf_file_format_spec_v10.pdf \"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/pdf/swf\\_file\\_format\\_spec\\_v10.pdf\")). Now, Cufón obviously takes things a bit further by allowing the user to scale the font down and optimize the path after that for the purpose of decreasing file size, but this functionality can be turned off. After that it's not much different from what Flash does. The curves are just converted to cubic beziers and stored in VML format.\n\nFrom the SWF spec:\n\n\"The complete procedure for converting TrueType glyphs to SWF glyphs is as follows:\n\n1. Negate the y-coordinate. (In TrueType glyphs, the y-axis points up; in SWF glyphs, the y- axis points down.)\n2. Scale the x and y co-ordinates from the EM square of the TrueType font, to the EM square of the SWF glyph (always 1024).\n3. Insert an on-curve (anchor) point at the midpoint of each pair of off-curve points.\"\n\nSo actually Flash scales things too. Both Cufón and Flash do 1. They both also do 2, although this can be turned off in Cufón. The 3rd point is different but the purpose is the same. So, they're not that much different after all.\n\nIt would be interesting to find out whether PDFs also do something like this.\n\nSimo\n\n"

The user is then free to do as he wishes with the fixed, rendered form; just like printing.\"_\n\nOooh, let's not travel too far down \"Copyright Road\" but what the heck, let's fence a little.  \nPlease answer me these questions:\n\n1) What fair use rights do I have with regards to font files? By law I have to have **some** regardless of what any EULA might say and I was just wondering what you thought those might be.\n\n2) Do you consider a contractual obligation - with regards to a work protected by copyright - to not create derivative works to include sub-setting that work into parts?\n\n3) Lastly - and this is a real world scenario I recently ran into:\n\nA font is obtained under a totally free and open license. (No doubt about this. Unequivocal EULA included and the source verified.) But in order to use it as a web font, you need to convert it into an EOT. However the EOT converter software won't convert a file that has the embedding bit set to restricted. And, it seems, the embedding bit on said font has been set to Restricted by mistake.  \nIs it then OK to just change the embedding bit, and think no more about it?\n\nBTW - As I've noted elsewhere on Typophile, Cufón does not make use of or rely on hinting data. A font like Whitman, used decoratively or for headings, would probably look outstanding. But the Cufón converter will have to \"utilize\" the font so that it can appear, in the browser, in it's ultimate \"fixed, rendered form\".\n\nRegards,\n\nrich\n\n"

By law I have to have some regardless of what any EULA might say and I was just wondering what you thought those might be._\n\nIn US law, as I understand it, fair use rights are determined by a balancing test, which is a judicial process. So rather than the usual disclaimer that I'm not a lawyer, in this case I should point out that I'm not a jurist.\n\nWith explicit judicial ruling regarding fair use of font files, you have to look at fair use for similar copyright material. Since fonts are copyrighted as software, the most obvious place to start looking is fair use of copyrighted and commercially licensed software. Now, a lot of software licenses explicitly forbid decompiling the software, which applied to fonts would prevent font format conversions or any tinkering inside the font as a font; even opening such a font in FontLab to take a look at it would constitute license infringement. Frankly, I would be surprised if you could make a case that decompiling software is fair use if the license disallows it, even if you do not do anything more with the software, but I'm not aware of case law relating to this.\n\nIf we presume a font license does not explicitly disallow decompiling the font binary, what fair use rights might exist? Given that distributing a derivative work is contrary to the whole purpose of copyright, I doubt if any balancing test would permit that. So the question is probably whether you have a fair use right to modify the font for your own purposes, and to use the resulting derivative work but not to distribute it or use it beyond the scope of the original license. There are, of course, plenty of font licenses that explicitly _permit_ such modification of fonts; but there are others that explicitly disallow it, that require you to go back to the font maker if you want a custom version even for your own use. So I read your question as 'Are such license prohibitions enforceable, or is that a fair use right to modify fonts?' Again, you'd have to look at the general state of software copyright first, and then more specific case law and, for a final decision, get a judicial balancing test decision on fonts per se.\n\n"

Also, I am not offering any official interpretation of licenses for any foundries that I might work with. I am just giving my personal opinions.\n\nI will assume, as John has, that for the sake of this discussion we are talking about the U.S. Copyright Law, which is contained in Title 17 of the United States Code.\n\nAnyone is welcome to read it for themselves. The full text of the law can be found here: [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209195915/http:/www.copyright.gov/title17/index.html \"http://www.copyright.gov/title17/index.html\") and can be downloaded as Circular 92.\n\nThe doctrine of \"fair use\" is outlined in §107 -- Limitations on Exclusive Rights: Fair Use. It gives the principles for possible exceptions to the rights stated in §106.\n\nSo, before we delve into fair use let's just review that §106 of the Copyright Code secures to the owner of copyright the exclusive right to do (and to authorize others to do) a couple different things: [I'm paraphrasing here]\n\n(1) Reproduce the work in copies;  \n(2) Prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;  \n(3) Distribute copies of the work by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending;  \n(plus a few others that pertain only to other media, primarily visual and performing arts, so I'm not going to enumerate them here).\n\n§107 then outlines a \"fair use exception\" to the exclusivity of those rights \"for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.\"\n\nJohn is right that the Fair Use Exception is usually an affirmative defense against claims of infringement. It would be up case law to determine what uses would actually constitute fair use. Since the statutes were written primarily from the perspective of visual art, written works, and musical works, it's a little hard to say where things would come down in relation to font software.\n\nI will go out on a limb and give my opinion -- contrary to the opinion John expressed above -- that despite most EULAs' prohibition against \"decompiling, reverse engineering, and disassembling\" you could probably make a case under Fair Use for a right to open up a font and examine the outlines purely for the purposes of learning and research.\n\nI'm not sure what application the doctrine of fair use might have in the specific case of Cufón here. But if you see an argument, feel free to posit it.\n\nKeep in mind, the statute gives four factors to be used in the consideration of whether a particular case is fair use or not: [I'm quoting in full this time]\n\n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;  \n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;  \n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and  \n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nThis is the balancing test that John referred to.\n\n"

The common prohibition against decompiling software is that you will be able to see how it is made and this will give you an unfair advantage in producing a competing product (in that you will not have invested in the original creative development).\n\n"

And discussions about property rights, in general, tend to descend into back-biting and eye-gouging rather quickly.  \nBut hey, this is Typophile where \"don't punch, pun\" is the order of the day.\n\nThe reason I asked was because I really wanted to know how font designers see the situation.  \n(I should add that there are font designers who's views are not as traditional as the one's you've expressed. It runs the gamut. Also, we're moving a bit away from Simo and Cufón but, as you can see, he's pretty sensitive to IP concerns, ethically-minded, and wants Cufón to have as broad a reach as possible, so I think he'll see some relevance.)\n\nFlash, Cufón, SVG, @font-face - all these things are going to bring yet another revolution to the world of typefaces. And as far as licensing, if there isn't clarity, consistency, and up-frontness, there's going to be grief for all concerned.\n\nThe ironic thing is, I think font designers are going to end up getting a fairer shake from web devs/designers than they do from the print industry, an industry filled with people who also rely on copyright and therefore know quite well when they're ignoring the terms of a license.\n\nMy desire is this: if I am not redistributing your work in a form that makes it easy for others to make use of it without paying, then I'm OK. I don't have to worry about DMCA notices or any other hassles. This is - and please correct me if you see it differently, John - the compromise that was reached in regard to the use of @font-face. Meaning that a \"garden fence\" is the test. With @font-face it consists of a \"wrapped\" font file unsuitable for installation in the OS as in the WOFF and EOT specs.  \nBut it can take other forms, as it does with Cufón. IMHO.\n\nI await your thoughts about the other dilemmas listed.\n\nRegards,\n\nRich\n\n"
