  "content": "hey everyone,\n\nthis board has been incredibly helpful to so many past requests, so I’m really looking forward to your replies!\n\nI’m currently working for a client and I am looking for a squarish typeface with rounded edges. So far I am rather pleased with typesupply's »Torque« [http://vllg.com/typesupply/torque](http://web.archive.org/web/20140918080146/http:/vllg.com/typesupply/torque \"http://vllg.com/typesupply/torque\") –&nbsp;however it’s lacking a semibold between medium and bold – the bold face is a little to heavy for this design that we're aiming for.\n\nI’m having a hard time finding proper alternatives to torque, because it is very specific, so I was hoping maybe one of you folks knows a similar typeface?\n\nthank you in advance!\n\n",

This is for a whole corporate design, so it has to work as a logo font as well as headlines. :)\n\nI like Brooklyn and Blender a lot, but both have sharp corners. My aim was to find that squared-sans feeling with rounded corners, similar to Torque.\n\nIf you look closely, all those sharp little edges have been rounded off, which gives it a less aggressive feel.\n\n"

I've down that before and found foundries are usually quite helpful.\n\n"
