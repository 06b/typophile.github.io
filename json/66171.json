The rest is an uneven sans with what I call a type 2 R (where the straight leg comes from the bowl). The closest sans I could find was Unifonts Ziano.

The font I picked does actually have small serifs, so it's not too far off, even with the added detail, but now we might find a better match. I think it's probably a custom font, if it's not lettering, but Arrow might be close and there may be some tiny serif fonts worth looking at.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
