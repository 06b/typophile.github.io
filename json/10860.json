I think in the later use the confusion   \nor double signing dagger/cross is of course there, as today, and in the   \nfollowing the use as a cross and sign of death or religious things.   \n   \nBut the early term \"obelisk\" doesn't seem to reference to the   \ncross as a religious symbol. \"asterisks and obelisks\" has been   \na term for pro and contra in theological scientific dicussions   \nin the 16th century (Martin Luther vs. Johannes Eck). And it results   \nfrom the signs used in the (biblical) text for marking marginals. In this   \ncontext it doesn't make sense if dagger/obelisk=cross   \nbecause asterisk and obelisk should be on the same level.   \n   \nSo my question is about the early development, the form, use and understanding   \nof the sign. Maybe there is any evidence for clarifying its first meaning   \n - or even its double meaning from the beginning.   \n   \nMichael\n\n"

The idea seems to have been that such dubious matter was thrust through, as with a spit; the word is the same as that for a tapering pillar, another object with a pointed end. Confusingly, the word obelus was later used for the printer\n\n"

But most of them come   \nfrom a later view (especially those connections to paganism).   \nTo me it seems that the pointer root (or roasting spit - nice!)   \nis the most early. It makes the most sense, for with a pointer you can   \noptically point out best those spurious or interesting passages within a text.   \nThis would imply that first there was no reference to religious symbols   \nmay it be the cross or any other.   \n   \nAnd as far as I know those theologians (I myself studied protestant theology),   \nthey were much more rational and functional in their work.   \nMaybe they didn't have a cross or something like that in mind.   \nOtherwise - I think - there should have been some reflection on this use of a symbol.   \nVery interesting for me: Those mathematics-use.   \n   \nBut I'd like to trace it to the ground: Does any of you know early manuscripts   \nor prints with the dagger where its form and meaning can be seen?   \n   \nMichael\n\n"

Thank you for leading me there.   \n   \nMaybe I'm wrong, but I like to dig out a natural understanding and use of that symbol.   \nI think it's much more nice, humanistic and feeding visual competence   \nto use asterisk, dagger, double-dagger and pilcrow for marking marginals and similar things in some cases,   \nthan those always boring numbers, who always remind of scientific essays.   \n   \nBut with (mis-)understanding the dagger as a cross, its use is reduced to a few things.   \n   \nMichael\n\n"
