All the other Chancery-ish styles I have found have a looped ’k’. (Corsiva, Poetica, Lucida Calligraphy and Le Griffe, to mention four.)\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

It’s not a perfect match, but it’s alot closer than where I started. If the client has a problem with it, I guess we’ll find something new together.\n\nThanks again for your time and effort.\n\n"
