Legibility is a key concern. Was thinking of something like Excelsior or Garamond, but perhaps too traditional (needs to be forward thinking, “innovative” brand).\n\n"

A sans serif text face that has it’s roots in the renaissance but with a minimum of contrast. Maybe this could be a healthy contrast to the more geometric Crank8.\n\nMartin\n\n"
