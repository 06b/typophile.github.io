You did well posting in the Type ID forum and including a well sized image. Your topic title should reflect this.\n\nWe’re a humble and mostly quite community, so try and keep it to a dull roar in the future.\n\nEnjoy your stay, hopefully you’ll continue to contribute.\n\n"

For example “1960’s newspaper headline face” or “Lost in Translation movie logo” or “retro script” will do nicely. Whereas “Please help me identify this font” is pretty pointless as that’s the only thing we do on the Type Identification Board. Compare it to a newspaper where every single headline would say “Stuff happened!”</cite>\n\nAccurate descriptions do help, both in identifying and finding things later. Exclamation marks don’t.\n\n<cite>And we didn’t even ID the font!</cite>  \nHuh?\n\n"
