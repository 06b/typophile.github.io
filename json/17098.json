Often, when I see a site targetted at children (or even youth), the first gut reaction always seems to be “hey, let’s use comic sans because it’s ’friendly’ and ’kid’s will like it’”\n\nBut do they? Does using a cheesy face like that actually target that demographic better? Or is it just pandering? Baby talk? Insulting? Is there any scrap of data out there that would indicate one or the other?\n\n [‹ Chalet](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052030/http:/typophile.com/node/17266 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Barnhart Brothers ampersand problem ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052030/http:/typophile.com/node/17299 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I guess what I’m asking if there has been anything that could be considered ’data obtained from research’ that would indicate whether or not children actually benefit and/or prefer bad hand scrawling. ;o)\n\nAction:\n\nI’ve read a bit about the dyslexia issue, but it seems that there’s a wide variety of faces that can work and that the main issue is having a closed ’a’ and an open ’g’. I’ll have to check...perhaps Comic Sans is the only web-friendly face that has that attribute.\n\nOf course, then there’s the issue as to whether or not the benefit to those with dyslexia outweighs any other potential drawbacks to using Comic Sans.\n\nPaul:\n\nThat thread then links to this thread:\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/14206](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052030/http:/typophile.com/node/14206 \"http://typophile.com/node/14206\")\n\nwhich I actually participated in. ’doh. Gotta work on my memory skills. ;o)\n\nThe comments I tended to agree with in that thread were ’kids don’t like to be treated like kids’ and the use of comic sans seems to do just that. It’s almost ’hey, you’re a kid, here’ some rainbows and unicorns and comic sans!’\n\nBut that’s just my opinion. Certainly not any sort of research.\n\nThe only research that seems compelling is that the youngest children, who are still sounding out their words, depend on simple, recognizable letterforms. And as ugly as Comic Sans is, I guess that’s where it has some appeal, as the letterforms are quite simple.\n\nThis site was mentioned:\n\n[http://www.kidstype.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052030/http:/www.kidstype.org/ \"http://www.kidstype.org/\")\n\nBut when it got to kids opinions, it seemed to leave us hanging:\n\n_Discussions with children about these further confirmed that typefaces can have an important effect on how children perceive a text, and hence their motivation to read. Associations can be strong, and there seems to be some comfort for young children in reading things that look familiar or ’normal’. Many of the children we spoke with were able to talk about the differences between the typefaces._\n\n...and!? ;o)\n\n"

The children’s books I grew up with used classic fonts, primer fonts I guess, both serif and sans serif that were very easy to read. Such as Century, Futura, etc.\n\nThat said, there are some kid-oriented fonts that I find less in your face than Comic Sans, such as Felt Tip and Providence.\n\nThere used to be a show called Wonderama when I was a kid and I remember recoiling at the whole “COME ON KIDS LET’S HAVE FUN!” idea. They gave out Banana bikes as prizes and all I wanted, as a kid, was a big-kids bike.\n\n"

My 4 year old, when he talks of color, talks about all colors. Browns, blacks, greys. He just doesn’t talk about bright red, bright blue and bright yellow. Yet a lot of products aimed at kids assume that’s the only 3 colors in their universe.\n\nI have a hunch that comic sans falls into the same logic that is used to pick colors for kids.\n\nHigh contrast black, white and red have been studied as good colors for the very young (infants) but I haven’t seen any research beyond that.\n\nIn the end, it sounds like there hasn’t been any real research into the pros/cons of comic sans, and, as such, we need to fall back on our own training and point out that it’s an ugly face and no sense using an ugly face when we don’t have to. ;o)\n\n_I bet the children don’t even recognize that type is different_\n\nDan...read the last line of the quoted bit I posted above: “Many of the children we spoke with were able to talk about the differences between the typefaces.”\n\nThat was interesting.

I really don’t buy the patronizing, oversimplifying twaddle that is presumed to enable children to comprehend, to see, to sense. Simon actually has a point; though children aren’t born with high visual acuity, nor the ability to read, they are tremendously perceptive, curious, and absorbent of their visual surroundings. Their brains process and develop incredibly fast, and they move from one thing to another like ravenous caterpillars. Assuming that subtle colors and 2-storied a’s are wasted on them really sells them short. A lack of imagination on an adult’s part should not hinder a child’s experience. Children have no trouble learning 2 or 3 languages simultaneously. That’s not whistling Dixie!\n\nI find I’m also reverting to the adult pattern of lumping all children of every age together. I bet developmental psychologists perceive dozens of brief distinct stages in development between birth and adolescence.\n\nI think the concern with “infant forms” such as the a in Comic Sans is relevant for a VERY BRIEF PERIOD when children are learning the alphabet, and how to read. I suspect that once that skill has been mastered, suddenly, large print, infant forms and other silliness are completely irrelevant. But don’t tell mom and dad!\n\ngigGle!\n\n"

I wish I remembered the reference but I can’t so I hope this is right. Children only need larger type at the early years of reading when they are learning character recognition, The part I am guessing about is the age. I remember it as about 9 years old (earlier for quick learners). At this point they have developed full visual acuity. Thereafter, size does not matter (type size that is). By middle school, their eyes are as developed as they will ever be. That is why when I am trying to read very small type (serial numbers from a DIMM) I show it to a 12 year old who can see it clear as day unaided. I need more than my trifocals and a magnifying glass to have a prayer.  \nThe problem is I have clients who insist on at least 14pt type for anyone below college age! Even when I try to explain how they are limiting saccadic jumps with such large type and slowing down reading, they don’t care. They say “but this is for kids.”  \nI wish researchers would come up with something like the “Type Pyramid” where they would definitively establish thresholds of type size for each age group in increments of 5 years.  \nChrisL\n\n"

But children should also have reproducible models for handwriting, perhaps offered at a stage between those two, or simultaneously with the second. ’Confusion’, in practice, doesn’t apparently come about: as Noordzij says, children can even tell the difference between lunch and dinner; and it will create some awareness that different styles for letters are possible, and that there can be reasons for preferring one to another.\n\n"

Yes, it’s more intense than key-  \nboarding (to most people) but I suspect we’ve overblown this  \nintensity.

I don’t think ductus or any of the other accidentals of calligraphy are crucial to text type design though - calligraphy is just something a good designer can pretend to be doing (and allow his users to pretend to be doing), like pretending to be Zarathustra when making or, back in the day, using Futura.
