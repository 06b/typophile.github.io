Yet as Caslon was using models from the previous century, and giving his personal interpretation, they retain quite a bit of the feeling of the earlier types.\n\nIn 2011 the Folger Shakespeare Library did an exhibition on Shakespeare's First Folio, and did a book, _Folio Mania! Stories Behind Shakespeare's Most Important Book_. Bruce Kennett designed the book to the same proportions and some of the same layout as the First Folio, and used Williams Caslon Text (Font Bureau) for the text and running heads, which like the First Folio were in italic with swash caps. The book also used fine Vellum paper. I was delighted see my typeface used so beautifully—Thanks Bruce! I thought it succeeded pretty well in getting the feel of the old book, without being fake antiquarian.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417071225im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FoliomaniaCataloguePagespread_5395.jpg)\n\n"
