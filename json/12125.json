Strongly [Christian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Christian) (and Lutheran Protestant) as well as an exponent of [German nationalism](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/German%20nationalism) in the arts, Koch had an affinity for the [Arts & Crafts](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Arts%20%2526amp%3B%20Crafts) movement spearheaded by [William Morris](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/William%20Morris). Some of his art, as well as his typefaces, have a strongly [Art Nouveau](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Art%20Nouveau) flavor. Koch's great passion was infusing the stately opulence of [Baroque](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Baroque) forms with the raw energy of the [Romantic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Romantic), and his most well-known typefaces, The [Deutsche Schrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Deutsche%20Schrift) family (also kown as [Koch Schrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Koch%20Schrift)), [Maximillian](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Maximillian), [Wilhelm Klingspor Schrift](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Wilhelm%20Klingspor%20Schrift), [Neuland](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neuland), [Jessen](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jessen), [Wallau](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Wallau), [Koch Antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Koch%20Antiqua), [Frühling](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fr%C3%BChling), [Holla](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Holla), [Zepelin](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Zepelin), [Prisma](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Prisma), [Offenbach](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Offenbach), [Marathon](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Marathon), [Koch Kursiv](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Koch%20Kursiv) and [Kabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Kabel) all have this balance between elegance and raw energy.\n\nKoch was an in-house designer at the Gebr. [Klingspor](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor) foundry from 1906 until his death in 1934 (with a short gap for service in the first World War). All of his typefaces were released by Klingspor. After the Klingspor foundry closed in the late 1950s, the foundry [D. Stempel AG](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/D.%20Stempel%20AG) in Frankfurt, who had owned the Klingspor foundry for over a decade, assumed the rights to the designs and continued the distribution of the commercial successful ones.\n\nKoch was also concerned that with the development of industrial typography in the form of [hot metal typesetting](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/hot%20metal%20typesetting) much of typefounding's history might be lost. He was a gifted historian, and many of the most well-known illustrations of traditional [punchcutting](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/punchcutting) were drawn by him. He also produced a large volume of elaborately detailed, traditional German [calligraphy](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/calligraphy), some of it exceedingly beautiful. His book on calligraphic instruction _[Das Schreiben als Kunstfertigkeit](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Das%20Schreiben%20als%20Kunstfertigkeit)_ is still one of the best works on the subject ever printed in the German language, and is worth a look for non-German readers as well, even though it is almost entirely focused on [Blackletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Blackletter) hands. The book was one of the catalysts that began the career of [Hermann Zapf](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hermann%20Zapf), as well as that of his wife, [Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gudrun%20Zapf-von%20Hesse).\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to peg Koch as a strict traditionalist. He was a relentless experimenter, seeking in particular to reconcile the traditionally popular German [fraktur](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/fraktur) / broken-letter types with the [antiqua](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/antiqua) or [roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/roman) types used in the Western parts of Europe and the United Kingdom. Some of these experiments were unsuccessful, like the intriguing but ungainly [Offenbach](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Offenbach), but others, such as [Wallau](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Wallau), were both in keeping with the spirit of the times and successful in their own right. Probably his most significant achievement during this time, and the most widely-known of his experiments, is the rough-hewn [Neuland](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neuland), a deceptively sophisticated, very black lino-cut [sans serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/sans%20serif) that pointed to some of the more expressionistic types coming from further east, such as [Vojtech Preissig](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Vojtech%20Preissig) in [Czechoslovakia](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Czechoslovakia), while still being very much his own work.\n\nLate in life, he followed developments in the [Bauhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bauhaus) scene, developing his own groundbreaking [Kabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Kabel) typeface alongside [Jakob Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jakob%20Erbar)'s [Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erbar) and [Paul Renner](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Renner)'s [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura), as well as designing the lesser-known but equally significant [calligraphic sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/calligraphic%20sans) [Stahl](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stahl), which was finished after his death by [Hans Kühne](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hans%20K%C3%BChne).\n\nKoch was also a prolific teacher. In 1908, he began teaching calligraphy at the _Technische Lehranstalten der Stadt Offenbach a.M_, which became the [HfG Offenbach](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/HfG%20Offenbach) in 1970 . His courses developed into a type of special studio, called the Offenbach Workshop. In addition to calligraphy, students at the workshop produced everything that could conceivably have lettering on it, including tapestries, metal work, and church bells. Like the [Bauhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bauhaus), the workshop developed an international reputation during the 1920s, attracting students from foreign countries. [Warren Chappel](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Warren%20Chappel) studied under Koch during the 1930s there.\n\nA word should be said to Koch's nationalism (one should remember that nationalist feelings were common throughout the western world in the pre-WWII-era). Koch fought as an infantryman on both the western and the eastern fronts during the first World War. Reading his recollections, one might get the feeling that he loved every minute of it. It was also during these war years that Koch became increasingly devout. Rudolf Koch died in 1934. This for him was fortunate. Many of his students emphatically embraced Nazism, lending their calligraphic skills to the movement.\n\nIt is possible that Koch would have avoided this. He had strong ties to the Jewish community in Offenbach, and on at least one occasion (in 1927), produced a complete Haggadah ( [Offenbacher Haggadah](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Offenbacher%20Haggadah)). The book is part of the [Klingspor Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20140703213948/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klingspor%20Museum)'s collection today.\n\n",
