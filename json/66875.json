I don't if the little finishing stroke at the ends of the words is included in the digital version, but it doesn't look like it. Never noticed that before.\n\n"

That was not included in the set of glyphs for the font.\n\nThe metal type was designed in 1934 by Robert H. Middleton. So it could have been used in early Monopoly sets.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "The Mandate look was pretty long running, apparently from 1937 to 2008. In 2008, Hasbro standardized the game internationally, using a computer graphic image of Mr. Monopoly (formerly Rich Uncle Pennybags) on the cards - and using the _same_ image on several similar cards, instead of a different image on each card.\n\nI had not formerly known of this, and am now deeply shocked and distressed. Yes, even a long-running classic must be modernized, but it ought to be an improvement when it is done.\n\n"
