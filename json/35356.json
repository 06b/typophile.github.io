  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am really unsure about what symbols to use for apostrophes and quotation marks. Look at:\n\n‘This is a quote.’ and Don’t.\n\nHowever it soon becomes confusing:\n\n‘She said “Don’t use the same marks for quotation and elisions!” three times.’\n\nThis can be solved by using the Unicode specified apostrophe mark ('). However I read on every webpage on the subject that it looks really unprofessional to use don't instead of don’t. I have been suggested to use bold quotation marks. But I mean that looks goofy.\n\nWhat symbols to use?\n\n",

Your example appears to fall in line with UK Engilsh usage, which is the opposite of the USA usage. I'm not sure what you do in Norway.\n\nAre you asking about the straight typewriter style marks as opposed to the curly quote and apostrophe marks one sees in typeset text?\n\nThe only time to use bold marks is when the whole of the enclosed text is also set bold.\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether to add extra spacing around quotation marks, particularly the singles so as to distinguish them from apostrophes.\n\nI'd go into more detail, but others can speak on this with more authority and I'm too tired, it being near 2 AM here.\n\n"

      "content": "I’m not sure why there’s any confusion about this, or why this is a Typophile thread.\n\nBritish usage is not “the opposite of USA usage.” Setting aside for a moment the fact that there is more than one usage in the U.K. (e.g., <cite>Monocle</cite> uses British English but double quotation marks at first instance), the differences are wider than that. British orthography places periods and commas inside quotation marks only for direct utterances and outside in other cases. U.S. (also Canadian) usage puts them inside quotation marks always.\n\nThere is no distinction in Unicode between an apostrophe and a closing single quotation mark. This is a serious defect, but it will never change. There is also no way to distinguish the usages of neutral opening quote, neutral closing quote, and neutral apostrophe; they’re all one character.\n\nThe example in your fifth paragraph isn’t realistic, because the whole sentence would probably not be quoted.\n\nIn any event, it is invariant that you alternate double-single or single-double when nesting quotes. The only variable is which one you start off with. British tends to use single; U.S. and Canadian always uses double.\n\nAll this is easily Googled or, better, looked up in Fowler’s or Strunk and White or any English-usage book.\n\n--  \nJoe Clark  \n [http://joeclark.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406143730/http:/joeclark.org/ \"http://joeclark.org/\")\n\n"

I hope what ‘she’ said is not what someone actually has been telling you.</cite>\n\nTalking about Unicode, there are quite a few codepoints whose ‘phenotypes’ can look identical. The one bearing the name APOSTROPHE ( [U+0027](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406143730/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/u+0027)) isn’t one of those. And it isn’t a real apostrophe either.\n\nWe got the RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK ( [U+2019](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406143730/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/u+2019)), which is commonly used for\n\n- guess what—a right single quotation mark in some languages, English among them\n- an elision like don **’** t or **’** 07\n\nOn [U+02BC](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406143730/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/u+02BC) we have the MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE. I wonder if that would be the one Joe is missing—and the one that would be appropriate for elisions. Even if it was, the keyboard accessibility of U+02BC doesn’t go well with the frequency of the apostrophe in English language.\n\nFurthermore, there is the COMBINING COMMA ABOVE ( [U+0313](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406143730/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+0313)) and the COMBINING GREEK KORONIS ( [U+0343](http://web.archive.org/web/20150406143730/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+0343)), both for combining diacritical marks. They aren’t used in English, however they (can) look like the others and shouldn’t be confused.\n\n"
