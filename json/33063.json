  "content": "I'm typesetting a friend's writing sample in philosophy, and I can't decide how to arrange and format the footnotes. (They must be footnotes, not endnotes.) I've attached an 8-page PDF. Each page is actually the same page of text but with the footnotes designed in a slightly different style. Here are the three main styles:\n\n1. Note number outdented; footnote text flush left with main text.\n\n2. Note number slightly indented, so that note text begins where indented paragraphs in main text begin.\n\n3. Note number indented, so that number appears where indented paragraphs in main text begin.\n\nEach style comes in two versions: one with a 2-inch rule separating the text from the notes and one without. The first style also has two more variations: one with a period after the note number and one without. In all of them, the main text is Aldus 12/15 and the footnotes are Aldus 10/13.\n\nI can't decide which of the three main styles I prefer. (An obvious fourth style would be to have the note numbers flush left with the main text.) The first is recommended by Bringhurst, but I don't think he has academic papers (with their sometimes long footnotes) in mind. I'm worried that the numbers standing outside of the margins draw too much attention to themselves.\n\nDoes anyone have any comments about or favorites among these different styles? Any suggestions for doing something different? (I know that the hyphenation needs work.)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nMatty\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Footnotes.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150411010712/http:/typophile.com/files/Footnotes.pdf) | 79.17 KB |\n\n",

I checked a bunch of books for style, and ended up doing what you call the obvious fourth style, where the numbers were flush left with the main text (at least the longest number, as the numbers themselves were right aligned, and the text hung at the indent. It's a little less space-efficient but I also didn't put spaces between the notes themselves.\n\n"

No line, as I used different font sizes with an obvious difference. Depending on the length of the average note, one space saving yet visually pleasant way is to have the footnote set in two columns (top aligned).\n\n"

      "content": "The usual style in the academic world is to use a paragraph indent for the note numbers, unless those numbers are also a superior. Outdenting the note numbers looks OK with loose leaves, but in a bound book, they are apt to get lost in the gutter on a right-hand (recto) page. If you want the note numbers flush to the text page & then block indent the notes proper (flush & hang), that's fine, though not as common. Cambridge University Press did this for a while, maybe still does.\n\nWith paragraph style, the numbers \"decimal align\" only per-page. In other words, if you have notes 1-7 one page, you do not \"clear for two digits.\" That happens only on the page where you go from one digit to two, and from two digits to three.\n\nUse of a rule may confuse some people. People reading this will be academics, who are use to footnotes. Usually, a rule is used when a footnote carries over from one page to the next. You always have to start a note on the page where it is called, but sometimes the footnotes are so long, there is no way to page the document without carrying part of the note over to the next page. In such cases, you use a rule to indicate the carried-over note. Three picas long is usually sufficient for the rule, but it can be full measure. If for some reason you must use a rule on all pages, make the normal rule a different measure than the rule you use to signal a carried-over note.\n\nOne of the oddest situations I've ever encountered was a journal article, where the first line of text called three footnotes. The third footnote took over three full pages to set, even in 8-point type. The forth note was called on the second line of text. After taking it over with the publisher, it was decided to set the article opening, the first line of text, then the notes on the rest of that page & the next two full pages (with rule, of course), before picking the text up again on the 4th page.\n\nObviously, a poorly written/edited piece. The author would have been better served to either incorporate the note in the text or make an appendix of it, and the editor surely should have pointed this out before accepting the article. But it happens.\n\n<cite>Edit:</cite>\n\nIt is also unnerving for a reader to discover some designer feels that he/she needs \"help\" deciphering a normal situation. So, for example, you do not need extra spaces between footnotes, just like you do not need extra spaces between paragraphs in the text.\n\nFor example, some designers both block indent an extract, and set it in smaller type, so the reader \"won't get confused.\" What reader? Most people who read this sort of thing are use to block quotes, they aren't going to get confused. You might as well put a printer's fist beside the extract. You wouldn't believe the number of things I've seen by both designers and editors \"to keep the reader from getting confused\" when it is obvious that anybody reading the text is going to have a college education or more. What usually happens is the designer/editor adds to the reader's confusion. There are ways to graphically help the reader, but they are usually not by highlighting elements he/she expects to see anyway.\n\n"

      "content": "Since you've got your answer, I'll add another way to think about such things generally. Essentially, your question was \"how should one handle the element 'footnotes'?\"\n\nThere is another way of thinking about the topic, which is, basically, \"how should the element 'footnotes' be blended into the text page?\"\n\nThis is probably old-school thinking. I saw <cite>Helvetica</cite> last night, and was struck not so much by those who did and did not like the typeface Helvetica, but the two schools of thought, modernism and postmodernism. One of the older modernists remarked that you cannot spend your whole life looking at things a certain way and just change. But postmodernism has been around long enough for one of those devotees to walk slowly & have white hair as well; they too have spent a lifetime looking at things a certain way.\n\nOK, back to the page. This is not a simple modernist versus postmodernist point of view; the notion of the type page is far older. I do suspect a postmodernist would disagree with what I'm about to say, but so too could a modernist.\n\nThe reason I don't like flush & hang footnotes is that it weakens the page. The page now has two distinct elements, the body text and the notes. Should these have a different graphic interpretation? I suppose it depends on your point of view. Mine is no, the page is one of the things (aside form the content) that unites these elements. Just like a widow weakens the page, so too do flush & hang footnotes. So would a full-measure rule, which, unlike a rule below the running head block, will not appear at the same place on the page.\n\nThe situation is rather different with endnotes, either end-of-chapter or end-of-book. Here, the problem is to let the reader quickly find the appropriate note & reference it to the text. Running heads giving the page number help (Notes to pages 000-00). So to can flush & hang note numbers/notes.\n\nBut this is just one analysis, and nothing new. The real question a designer has to ask is whether the design problem is to work to display differing elements, or to work to integrate them.\n\nFWIW\n\nCharles Ellertson\n\n"

If you had already been published (rare, at least in those days), you might include one of your offprints. But if the point is to set yourself off from others, I'd suggest Palatino is not the best choice. I can't really tell the field (epistomology or aesthetics or ethics?) from the snippet, but I think I'd use Cycles, with Arepo display, which would work for any of these. I wouldn't use Cycles for for math logic, and for something in the history of philosophy, font choice would depend on the period & topic.\n\n"
