  "content": "This Belgian company, Alt-Soft, has a new software for font edition and conversion, called FTM (Font Type Master). It's a simple app, not really good for drawing or creating new fonts, there's not even a good metrics tool.   \n   \nBut this app has a _very, very_ interesting feature. Maybe I shouldn't post this here, but... it opens fonts from PDFs! Using the demo, I was able to open a font from a PDF file. Quick and easy. No kerning though. I just wasn't able to save the font because it is a demo (no saving allowed).   \n   \nI will not post a link to this, but I think interested people will find it.   \n   \nPersonally, I think this feature should be removed from this app. But, what do others think about it?\n\n",

      "content": "It looks like a nice engine for an font editor, but due to its feature set, its more a deluxe ripper.   \n   \nIt can't open protected pdfs, but experts will know how to do it.   \n   \nSo for pdf specimens, you should embed only a subset of your fonts and essential pages can be rendered as bitmaps only.\n\n"
