  "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm going to start a book with lots of photos. It will have some text (Bi-language) but mainly photos of several sources (digital, film, digitalization of old photos, etc. And photos with people, buildind, labels, machines, etc.).  \nI don't want that someone else do the job for me, but I would like to see examples of photographic books. I already made my search, but the reason for my post is to add some more ideias.  \nSo, please tell me what books have you saw with more or less my references that you enjoyed. Size A4 or bigger...\n\nThanks in advance!  \nAntónio\n\n",
