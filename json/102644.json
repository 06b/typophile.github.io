  "content": " **Hello** ,  \nlong time no see.\n\nI am assembling a list of currently released books on typography. It is meant to be a shopping list as I intend to review them for a magazine on a quarterly basis.\n\nTypography is meant in a rather broad term here, it could be the basics (as [Inside paragraphs](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033650/http:/insideparagraphs.com/) by Cyrus Highsmith) or slightly more advanced ( [Size-specific Adjustments to Type Designs: An Investigation of the Principles Guiding the Design of Optical Sizes](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033650/http:/markbattypublisher.com/books/typography-monographs-volume-2-size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs-an-investigation-of-the-principles-guiding-the-design-of-optical-sizes/) by Tim Ahrens) or biographies (Patricia Costs book about the [Bentons](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033650/http:/ritpress.rit.edu/publications/books/bentons.html) springs to mind, or the books about Excoffon and José Mendoza y Almeida from [Ypsilon éditeur](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033650/http:/www.ypsilonediteur.com/typo.php)).  \nAlso Stephen Coles [The Anatomy(/geometry) of Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033650/http:/typeanatomy.com/) obviously, and maybe I can squeeze in the second edition of Fred Smeijers [Counterpunch](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033650/http:/www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-42-8) ?\n\nI would like to ask you for more suggestions. It needs to be at least partly in English and preferably released in the last two or three years. Anything you consider should be in the home of a proper typographer.\n\nok, a happy Walpurgis Night to you all.\n\nƒ.\n\n",
