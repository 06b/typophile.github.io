  "content": "I've been developing a new sans serif/display typeface for a concert poster design, a super geometric typeface design to complement Avenir or Avant Garde in uppercase, that I would like to call Britannica. I was just looking for some suggestions for ways I could give it more of a personality to the letterforms. This is my first formal typeface, and I haven't done lowercase yet, but I was looking for some creative imput. Thanks...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Britannica.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123150200/http:/typophile.com/files/Britannica.jpg) | 29.55 KB |\n| [poster.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123150200/http:/typophile.com/files/poster.pdf) | 267.65 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "First look I'd say, this typeface seems to have potential. At my point of view, I'suggested to raise the middle bar of th E, F, H, B, The K looks like it's an arrow hurting a vertical line and this arrow is too in the middle. The Z is too wide and the G too narrow compare to the C and the O. The diagonale line of the S seems to low.\n\nThe Q is right on.\n\n"
