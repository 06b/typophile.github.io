The overall shapes looks like more balanced to me. And I find the angular version quite interresting.  \nBirdseeding your link doesn't work :/\n\n"

      "content": "I think it's strange how it didn't occur to me to design a \"better\" Comic Sans to at least partially fix the whole Comic Sans hysteria. I like the result. If people feel the need to use a wacky font for obituaries I would rather see Comic Neue than Comic Sans.\n\nIf Comic Neue is to replace Comic Sans though, I suspect Comic Neue will quickly be hated for the same reasons people started hating Comic Sans, which is primarily not the design itself but the context in which it's (ab)used. I think we would hardly have given Comic Sans any attention if it were only seen in the context it was designed for. My main irritation has always been the unlucky choice of using Comic Sans in various dubious contexts; the fact that it's not a beautiful font is a secondary issue. So, while Comic Neue is more formal than Comic Sans, the main issue actually hasn't been solved.\n\n“It’s casual. It’s free. And nobody will reflexively make fun of you for using it.” – Time.com\n\nOh Time, how naive you are...\n\n"
