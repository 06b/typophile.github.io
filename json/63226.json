I don’t even use a font activating utility.  \nSeveral of these fonts are old type one PostScript from back in the day when the bigger font vendors doctored names so that their corporate name did not affect the order—Adobe Garamond fell under “G” instead of “A”. How “ITC” sneaks in in the “B” area makes no sense even with that. My guess is that the old way meets the new way and got fritzed in the process—that or it is a clue from the Knights of the Templar :-)\n\nChrisL\n\n"
