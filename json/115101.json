I really like the way Verdana Pro Black looks for my headings (example: [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/MqUNFb1.png[/IMG]), and I'm looking for something which is: preferably open-source; slightly less clichéd than Verdana; and very heavy.\n\nI'd love to hear any suggestions, thanks.\n\n",

Either use full caps for OED, or old-style (aka \"lowercase\") figures, or small-cap height lining figures, which you'd probably have to make up.\n\nTo be perfectly accurate, Heuristica is the old Adobe Utopia, which Adobe essentially made Open Source when Slimbach redrew it. It (Heuristica) is a bit different from the current for-sale Utopia...\n\n"
