  "content": "Hello folks!\n\nI cam across this rather tasty grotesque in the most recent issue of Little White Lies (UK film magazine). Instantly my brain went for Berthold's Akzidenz Grotesk Condensed Italic, then Trade Gothic Condensed 20 Oblique, then E+F's TV Nord Condensed Bold Oblique, but no cigar. Though they're all relatively similar, the squared shoulders of the R and S (amongst others) set this one apart. Other weights in regular and italic appear in the mag, so it would appear to be part of a larger family.\n\nAppreciate the help!\n\nCheers,  \nNick\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021221559im_/http:/typophile.com/files/littlewhitelies_4454.jpg)\n\n",
