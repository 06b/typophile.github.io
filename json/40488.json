  "content": "Happy new year and Hi everybody!\n\nI'm working on my personal type foundry Logo. My foundry is called typesuisse, but I'll keep the .ch in the logo, because the whole thing is based as a website. I did a few sketches and I came up with this Idea.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014131318im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Typophile_3942.jpg)\n\nI started with the Letter T and combined it with a (swiss) cross. The cross T monogram will be used as Icon. Then I continued with the rest of the letters, trying to keep the thickness of the Monogram. As you can see, I got two different version. A has the simple shape of the grid I used and in B I tried to change the letter E and S, so it looks not like a laying capitol M and N.\n\nI would appreciate if you could give me feedback.\n\nCheers!\n\n",

I don't know if the T feels totally integrated yet, just because I don't see the relationship of that curve to anything else in the word.\n\n"

Whereas the second, specifically the S shapes and the serifs, will become too small a detail and too thin at small sizes. The SS pair seems too loose to me. I'd be curious about BJ's comments, but wonder if, again, to get them to be square the S becomes too thin?\n\n"

I was also thinking of the swiss cross to use instead of a full T, but I was thinking of it to lift it up to line it up as if it was a T (just as if you would remove the bottom curve from the T and leave the cross lifted).\n\nOtherwise I'm leaning more toward C version compared to A nd D. You could also give some stem slant on letter \"c\" in CH. And maybe even on the right side of U but with backward slant to close it a bit and make it a bit less squarish and rigid.\n\n"
