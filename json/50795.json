There are, in fact, many wonderful free fonts available, created and shared by many type designers, both professional and amateurs.\n\nHowever, with free fonts you do have to watch for a several things:\n\n1) There are many rip-offs (inferior and otherwise) of professional typefaces. These should be avoided, and the original fonts purchased instead.\n\n2) Many free fonts have been designed by amateurs, so you must look closely at every character in the font to make sure the fonts meets your needs (and to ensure that the font has all the characters you need).\n\n3) Kerning and other finishing touches are often missing, so you should be aware that many free fonts will not work well as text fonts, and may require a lot of special \"hand-work\" with spacing in display sizes.
