      "content": "Serious artifacts in low-def? Really? That shouldn't be a problem on an HD set, unless your TV isn't the greatest.\n\nFor HD quality, if you're watching HD television rather than Blu-Ray discs, there are noticeable artifacts from compression that can be more or less awful. They bug me as well, although our particular cable provider seems to have improved noticeably over time. I remember when I first saw it a couple of years ago it was pretty awful.\n\nAs I understand it, cable providers are up against some serious overall bandwidth limitations, so they have to make quality vs channel count tradeoffs, unless fiber optic becomes more widespread.\n\nRe-reading your note, I wonder if there is some sort of \"sharpness\" setting you need to turn off on the TV. It may indeed be doing some kind of unsharp masking....\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

My wife and daughter barely notice them even when I point them out.\n\nThe splotchiness of standard definition broadcasts is the most noticeable. I assume that it's because that type of video was not meant to be seen on a flat screen HD set, that when viewed on a CRT at the intended resolution, the artifacts are there, but they are not visible. CRT TVs are not only lower resolution, but less sharp and brighter. I chalk it up to fundamentally different and not fully compatible display technologies.\n\n(Type looked very different on CRT TVs, too.)\n\n"

      "content": "\"Satellite doesn’t have the severe bandwidth limitations that (coaxial) cable has\"\n\nYes, it does.\n\nIf you're getting your signal from Cable or Satellite, you're not really getting the best possible picture. Both will use various levels of compression on the channels. Some 'lesser' channels will be compressed to the point of looking like unusable JPGs. Sports and first-run movies tend to get the 'bigger pipes'.\n\nTo fully test if it's your signal or your TV settings, hook up the rabbit ears and tune in your local HD PBS station. OTA HD isn't compressed so would be the 'purest' signal.\n\nOtherwise, it sounds like you maybe have a bad TV and/or bad settings and/or bad cables. My parents had a Samsung for a year before they discovered that the LCD panel had been 'sandwiched' wrong in manufacturing adding this odd distortion to the picture. (To samsung's credit, they fixed it).\n\nWhat bothers me the most is people that get the new big wide-screen TVs and then don't notice that they're still watching their old fuzzy standard def analog cable in stretch-o-vision. Watching Football with my FIL is agonizing. ;)\n\n"

      "content": "For the exact same reasons, I don't like the look of 95% of the LCD TVs - HD or otherwise. I generally prefer my old, clear Sony CRT. The problem I find is that I spend hours and hours in a day staring at a high-quality, sharp but not too sharp, high-res display with reasonable color fidelity, just-right contrast, and more brightness that I need most of the time. It's connected to my computer, and cost a bundle.\n\nI'm not prepared to spend that much dough on a high-end HD TV (and the bandwidth to support it), so all the options look poor in comparison to what I'm used to - too much contrast, bad viewing angle, awful color, image outlining, grainy movement. If I really, really want to watch something in HD resolution, I'd prefer to buy it, download it in advance, and watch it on my computer. Most of the time, though, normal old school CRT and low-res display is fine, and much more pleasant to watch.\n\nThen again, I happened to be staying with friends in Dallas while the Beijing olympics were on. They had an excellent screen the size of a moose, and an HD satellite feed. It was spectacular - and probably very expensive.\n\n"
