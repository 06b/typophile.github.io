I'm having trouble at the moment in getting my basic template together exactly how i would like, and where my knowledge is limited in DW becomes quite frustrating!\n\n@wormwood Many of the debates in the forums regarding this are on the subject of wether the best solution for this is HTML, Java or CSS and what works best.\n\nI kinda got this supersize thing working. In firefox you can download a hole site with the files and thats what i did with a site that had it. i deleted all there content and just left the supersize script in place. thats about as far as i got baring in mind i been working on it couple hours at a time.\n\n@frode its funny the link you posted is very much the layout i am trying to achieve! but where your menu scrolls with the content i was trying to make mine static menu when content is scrolled. a demo would be great!?.\n\nhere's a rough PS mock up of where i'm trying to get  \nby the way the sites for me as well as free lance work i by and sell cars too.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020192902im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KARMONTEMPLATE_5180.jpg)\n\n"
