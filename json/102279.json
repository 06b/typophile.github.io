  "content": "Hello, all. Is there a way to break up the kerning table into smaller ones in plain TrueType? As far as I can tell, the issue is simply that this table is too large in my font(s). I flattened my kerning classes to pairs, removed OT data, but while TypeTool, FontForge, and InDesign all see the pairs, Word doesn't. (Yes, I do have kerning enabled in Word.) However, when I remove glyphs (I have a lot of diacritics), Word can see them just fine. So, I'm pretty sure I need to break up the table or something; how do I do this?\n\nIt's probably worth mentioning that I didn't need to insert subtable statements in the OT code for the CFF version.\n\nTIA!\n\n",
