Well, I just searched for faces similar to [ITC Bauhaus on MyFonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20110205041141/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-bauhaus/) and found [Bayer Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20110205041141/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/victory/bayer-sans/) -- it's a lot closer to the face used for the logo!\n\n"
