This is not the same font as that earlier thread, as Patty noted, but the odd W is similar. The oblong G and high-crotch M are not so common, so it ought to be a simple enough thing to find, but it must be from an obscure source.\n\nI’m getting tired of getting stumped.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

If I were trying to match this and running out of time, maybe this is the font I’d use: [tdBastard Mono](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906114047/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typewerk/td-bastard/) from Typewerk. Maybe add a little bit of squooshing(tm) and I think it might fool you if you weren’t examining them side by side.\n\nI think I’ve had enough of this ’fun’ after going more than 1/3 of the way through the 2400 sans serif fonts in the MyFonts collection.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

However, I found one that would have been close enough (for me) if I was trying to reproduce this (with some tweaking), so I stopped.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
