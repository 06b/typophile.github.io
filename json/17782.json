  "content": "I have a question about saving logos for use by “non-design types” in my office. I create alot of program oriented logos that later are used in paper proposals and power point presentations. I’ve never been quite sure I’m saving my logos in the best possible way to retain the quality no matter what size they end up using it at.\n\nIn practice I save 2 versions (outside of the AI and EPS versions I use.)  \nUnder the Save for Web feature I save a JPEG version (usually very large like 8” X 10”) and a GIF (also very large, but with Transparency turned on to eliminate the white box)\n\nI’m sure there’s a better way, that I can save it to retain the vector quality of size doesn’t matter along with the transparent border and then allowing it to be “non-designer” friendly for programs such as Microsoft Word or Power point.\n\nI’d be very interested in hearing your thoughts on how wrong/right this process is.\n\n",

As far as the logos I create, they’re usually 4 color process. We don’t have the software to create fonts available, but I have seen the technique used and it does seem very user-friendly.\n\nI’m sure the way I create my logos for use aren’t wrong, but I’m also sure there’s a way to do it where I save time by creating one user-friendly file that’s universally accepted by all programs.\n\nWhat is that unversally accepted standard to create that file?\n\n"

Whenever my mom wants custom artwork, I draw it out in Illy, export a WMF, place it in a file for her (a Word Document ususally) and then send her that file to use as a template. She should be able to cut/paste into other Office documents, &c.\n\n"

      "content": "Asvetic, I see a few choices based on specifics in the design. If you have one color, consider saving as a high res (600ppi) bitmap TIFF. As a bitmap (black and white) and not grayscale, the file will print razor sharp and, since its only 2 bit, will be very small file size wise (use lzw compression). Any user could specify a spot color for the image if needed. If you have more colors or gradients, consider PNG-24. It’s lossless, supports high resolution, has an 8 bit alpha channel, and most applications these days are loving it. Even PowerPoint and Word. Be careful using a “Save for Web” option to create it though- tyically the res gets changed to 72-96ppi- which, if placed in Word” would look huge.\n\n"

      "content": "I do9 a lot of this kind of work and think you are probably already going the best way about it. We have a vast library of logos, and in each case save down large RGB GIFs with transparent backgrounds and JPEGs for MS Office alongside the CMYK EPS for Quark use. Making your GIFs very large minimises the appearance of the rough edge caused by GIF’s on/off transparency.\n\nNote though that print dimensions in inches are irrelevant in both JPG and GIF.\n\nYou could use quite a few other formats on the MSO side but they all have pitfalls.\n\nAs Nick says, WMF, which is the internal PC metaformat, can hold vector data but I find it unreliable at preserving anything more than simple line art, gradients and dashed lines for example can cause problems. This is the format usually used for vector clip art however.\n\nYou can import and print EPS files into MSO apps, but I don’t think you can see a preview of their content on screen, at least not on PC?\n\n24 bit PNG has proper transparency support, but not in MSO apps.\n\n"

I know this is a type oriented community, but there’s enough design brains that when topics that are less type driven come up, there’s always an answer. It’s like the most powerful organized design braintrust around!\n\n"
