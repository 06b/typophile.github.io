When it closed its doors, its collection passed to [Neufville](http://web.archive.org/web/20120612021624/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neufville).\n\nSome of its many typefaces included [Elegance](http://web.archive.org/web/20120612021624/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Elegance) (by [Karlgeorg Hoefer](http://web.archive.org/web/20120612021624/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Karlgeorg%20Hoefer)), all the fonts of [Jakob Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20120612021624/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jakob%20Erbar) (including, obviously enough, [Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20120612021624/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erbar)), and Rhapsodie.\n\n",
