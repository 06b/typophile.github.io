      "content": "I ran into an interesting usage in the German magazine Value. The middle pages were printed digitally. The Photofont is made to look like the old mirror-image lead letters used prior to phototypesetting. I include an image of it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Photofont%20example_5351.png)\n  \nThe nifty aspect of it was the ability to use it for personalization within digital print, each copy was different, regardless of the number of copies. The personalization was realized using the Adobe Scripting interface of Indesign and Photoshop.  \nWith marketing become ever more personalized, this new tool is sure to be used often, especially in targeted personalized marketing. Presently it presses the border of realizability within the printing industry. It can only be done in digital printing. The author wrote the script for the automation himself, but customers will be interested in such personalizations. The main body of the magazine was still printed in offset, the cover was printed separately and the middle pages with the personalization were printed digitally.\n\nBest regards,  \nSteven Calkins\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Miss Tiffany,\n\nfor me it sounds like a great idea!\n\nYears ago (more than 10 ;-) I played with the idea to have some kind of typeface that workes digitally but would use in fact analogic designed letters like in old photographic reproduction. So we could keep a hand designed form and not using Bezier curves that changed our world and the way we see forms totally. And I am still not quite sure wether this change was a good thing for I am convinced Bezier curves influence on form. It is no longer natural like a tree, a human hand or what ever. Curved forms had become different from what we see in nature. Thats my opinion.  \nOk I see this is another theme, but...  \nthanks anyhow for this interesting news!\n\nStefan\n\n"

      "content": "\\> so, it’s a bitmap file stored in a font file?  \n\\> is it machine readable?\n\nI’m not sure I understand the question. What do you mean by \"machine readable\"?\n\nA [**photofont**](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/www.photofont.com/) is one or more PNG images stored as separate files or packaged together, along with an XML file that defines the glyph coordinates (i.e. bounding boxes), metrics, kerning, encoding and other font-relevant data.\n\nCurrently, [**BitFonter 3**](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/) by Fontlab Ltd. is the only commercial application that allows people to create photofonts. However, the format of a photofont is simple (since it relies on public standards like XML and PNG) and [documented](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/www.photofont.com/) and some people have successfully created photofonts using PHP or Python scripts.\n\nAt this time, one application that allows people to use photofonts is the [**Photofont Start**](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/www.fontlab.com/photofont/start/) plugin for Adobe Photoshop and other applications. It is free and within the next few days, we will release version 2 of the plugin that will support Photoshop CS3 on Intel Macs, and which will be about _10x faster_.\n\nAlso, em2 Solution’s [XcgfK](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/xcgfk.em2-solutions.com/info/demos.htm) font rendering engine supports photofonts natively, making them usable on mobile devices.\n\nAt TypoTechnica 2007, we have previewed our next product, which will be a converter that turns photofonts into Flash files, allowing users to embed dynamic text headlines on their websites using [sIFR](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/) and similar techniques — something that Typophile uses to render its custom headings as well. The converter is under development and should be available fairly soon.\n\nFontlab Ltd. is also working on plugins for InDesign and QuarkXPress, allowing users to use photofonts directly in those applications.\n\nFurther links:\n\n- some [photofont examples](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/community.livejournal.com/ru_typography/331017.html) developed by two Russian designers\n- the previous [Typophile thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516020809/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18963) on photofonts\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"
