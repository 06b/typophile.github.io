I am looking for some kind of font that would look good for the 10th Anniversary section of the label that goes with the OYP logo. I have attached the logo in PDF format.

Another thought is use the Roman Numeral X for 10 and Something in all caps for Anniversary in a Chunky Serif to contrast with the logo, ala Super Bowl look. Along the same line look at the X as in OSX from Apple its very stylizied and might be a direction for you to look into.\n\n"
