Just spent 4 hours plodding around the site as air con has broke and its just tooo hot to be creative today!\n\nAnyway. thoughts on the attached please. Pro Bono job. New Estate agents setting up in Manchester. 3 experienced guys. They wanted to move away from the cliche big friendly colourful brands and go for a more classy/established feel. The sting in the tail is they have a marketing/copywriter who used to work for the Economist so he's hopefully gonna bring the money making to the party.\n\nThis is obviously not just banging out a logo. A lot of my time has been put into the overall brand feel. I have sent a sketch over to them which they were very happy with. Below is the digital version. I obviously can't ask my fellow designers about this being freelance. Awkward name but thoughts please...\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 6.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20130721022838/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%206_3.jpg) | 73.59 KB |\n\n",

So to me, that is a good concept.\n\nI enjoyed finding the key, and I think overall it definitely has a classy feel. Perhaps you can play with the proportions of the logo and the horizontal rule / company name in relation to each other.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n [www.coroflot.com/kate\\_dawson](http://web.archive.org/web/20130721022838/http:/www.coroflot.com/kate_dawson \"www.coroflot.com/kate\\_dawson\")\n\n"

At first, I didn't get why the G had a notch in it, but finding the key made me feel like I learned a secret.\n\nMy suggestion would be to increase the weight (just slightly) of the horizontal part of the key (the body of the key?). As is, it might get lost at smaller sizes. Along those lines, have you tried making it smaller to see how the notch in the key holds up?\n\n"

It's too close to but doesn't match the GF. I'd like to see it match the Didot(?) or go with something that will contrast more like a sans.\n\n"

But then again, the fact that I already knew it was an estate agent before I saw the picture means I was impartial from the start.\n\nI know you've left a gap between the shaft of the key and the top half of the F to imply the key going into a lock (or at least that's how I see it), but maybe try losing the gap, widening the shaft of the key and making the handle look like a key handle (don't worry about it not being consistent with the rest of the F), then you'd definitely lose the trumpet that people seem to be seeing.\n\nThen again, all those things I've suggested might not look good if implemented. Just trying to give some ideas.\n\n"

      "content": "I think it does look like a key, i would suggest a few improvements though; The key does look good but it needs some kind of end that should be added to the F that makes it look like a trumpet. I would suggest a circle or a oval. The typeface is a tad heavy and the ampersands is very nasty, i suggest Trajan pro. Both elements the type and image need to be moved closer the line separater by a lil tiny bit. The top type is very nice but text underneath really needs to look cleaner and crisper. The top font needs to reflect the bottom. You should try and find fonts that match or are the same.\n\nIn conclusion you have a fantastic idea and the final product will look great.\n\n-Oliver\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130721022838im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_6322.png)\n\n"
