  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nThis is my first post and I am wondering if anyone who has a little bit more knowledge than myself can help me out. I am working on a packaging project just now which the brand is using Browns as it's main typeface. On the package we have designed it to support multiple different typeface on the front and the back of the package.\n\nI need a typeface that is similar to Browns but can be used in the following languages: German, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Slovenian and Turkish.\n\nThanks,  \nKyle.\n\n",
