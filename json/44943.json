  "content": "There was recent mention of the Bringhurst \"bible\" and its focus on book typography.  \nI looked at the book I'm presently reading. A somewhat anecdotal approach for generalization, but a pretty typical example of what's out there.  \nThe book is a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prizes, and made the New York Times Bestseller list, so there is absolutely no excuse for the cheap and shoddy typographic design, which, according to Mr Bringhurst, dishonors the text.\n\nIt severely pains me to read the damn godless thing, which is frustrating, as it's quite interesting, and I would like to finish it.\n\nHere are a few of the issues.  \n.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127060029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cover_5986.jpg)\n  \n1. The cover. A bit dreary, but nothing terribly wrong, apart from a bit of sheep shagging. The question that must be asked though, is why this bears absolutely no relationship to the design of either the title page or the main text. Isn't there something horribly wrong with this institutionalized norm?  \n.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127060029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/first_6031.jpg)\n  \n2. The very first page. Right off the bat, faux small caps!  \n.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127060029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/title_5830.jpg)\n  \n3. The title page.  \n.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127060029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/spread_4293.jpg)\n  \n4. Main text. Where are the margins? There's nowhere to put my thumbs! It's incredibly dysfunctional to be holding the book at the top as one reads the bottom of the page, causing shadows, and making one's arms ache.  \n.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131127060029im_/http:/typophile.com/files/closeup2_6203.jpg)\n  \n5. Tabular lining figures. This is a book with a lot of numbers in the text, so wouldn't that be a tip-off to the publisher that it might end up looking like a technical manual? Didn't they notice? There's nothing inherently wrong with the Century style of face for text--except that surely, in this day and age of InDesign and all the marvellously-featured fonts that Adobe bundles with it, a book publisher would use a typeface that has old-style figures, or at the very least, proportional figures? Finally, a small thing; it would have been better to not break lines between the numbers and \"Hz\". And wouldn't ff ligatures be nice?! \n",

It's one reason I like to design illustrated books - I control every aspect of the book's design from typography to head and tail bands.\n\nHere's an illuminating story - I was hired to design the interior only of a trade cookbook. I asked to see the cover so I could try to match the type. They told me it wasn't necessary for them to match, so I did a sample design on my own. Then they came back to me and said yes, why not try to match the cover. They sent me the cover design. It was hideous, but I was able to patch together something passable using the fonts they'd used (fonts I would never have chosen on my own). When I got the final book, they had changed the cover completely. The new cover was equally awful and I had done an interior I didn't like to match an ugly cover that never got used.\n\nAs Claas said, the cover is considered (in trade publishing) a marketing tool, and subject to much more scrutiny than the interior of the book. It is often done way in advance and can change a lot. Trade book interiors are basically churned out. That said, there is no excuse for bad typography. I just read a book set entirely in Rotis. It was pretty painful.\n\nI prefer the UK version as well - at least it's trying to say something.\n\n"

      "content": "The New York Times Bestseller List is a horrible litmus test for literary merit. Simply because a lot of people buy a particular book bears little indication of it's quality. Once in a while, truly good literature ends up on the list, but usually it's Dan Brown or James Patterson. That being said, it's little wonder why the typography is lackluster, if not terrible.\n\nThe books on the NY Times list are always from major corporate publishers—Harper-Collins, Houghton-Mifflin, etc. Conversely from Britain, i.e., where for a long while, publishers were regarded the standard-bearers of a literary tradition steeped in timeless mastery of the written language, US publishers seem to consider themselves not unlike any other manufacturer of consumer products. The care and artistry once put into producing books (ironically enough, at a time when the process was far more labour-intensive, and required far greater skill) are now but vestiges, on occasion loosely mimicked in contemporary design, ultimately mocking the technological advances which, by all accounts, should in turn have advanced the craft.\n\nThis has become the norm because the people in decision-making capacities at these publishing houses are MBAs, not literati (to say nothing of designers or typographers). Of concern to these people are movie-rights and marketing—the literary value (much less the design quality) of the books is almost negligible. i'm certain i'm not the only one here who's had the awkward experience of trying to convince a client to spend an extra hundred bucks or so on a typeface, or a few more hours to lay out a book correctly. i'm convinced that desktop-publishing has caused people to consider speed an ample substitute for quality (or that the two are equally interchangeable). Furthermore, nobody in design school ever seemed to care about traditional typography...everyone was attracted to the edgy, David Carson stuff. Don't get me wrong...i delight in breaking the rules as much as anyone—particularly when the project is gagging for it—but anymore, i notice that when people pick up a book that doesn't look like it was printed straight from Microsoft Word, they definitely take notice—usually, they say, \"It looks old!\" The problem with corporate, MBA types is that—in my experience—they can't tell the difference, even if it was in fact printed directly from Word. Though i'm tempted to digress—into what large-scale failures in education, or the modern propensity to study only the discipline in which one intends to make a living, willfully neglecting all other aspects of culture and knowledge, and how these relate to the current hideousness of printed —i'll spare you my further waxing philosophical.\n\n"

With many paperbacks produced by simply photo-reducing the hardcover design and printing it on rougher paper, the result is often actually unreadable. At least in Nick's example the book can be read; certainly that is not always the case. People complain that the young don't read enough: we should try to make books that _can_ be read.

The business model of publishing is a bit of a wreck and the books themselves are not even a tertiary priority in many cases.\n\nSo many editors and designers now have no office, and the imprints are bought and sold multiple times during the development of any given book. It is often the case that managers don't keep up with who is on the payroll and what they are doing. People are taken on and off projects to manipulate the quarterly stock results in anticipation of another buy out. It is considered that simply having \"product\" in the ”pipeline\" is enough on paper to make the company appear legit.\n\nMaybe it is like cars in the '70s—quality will hit a low point and then slowly return to some smarter, faster more efficient model that doesn't match what was but is better than what is.

The connection between a badly designed book and poor sales hasn't been clearly demonstrated... Or, maybe it has but not in a way that an MBA or marketing professional can understand.\n\nI think it was in the 30's when designers like Raymond Lowry convincingly demonstrated that well designed, attractive products sold better than poorly designed, ugly ones. Big news in tough economic times, I guess. One would think that this is self-evident and having been proven over and over again in the market place, that that would be the end of it: (Very easy and self evident) lesson learned; \"Hey! Let's not make ugly crap.\"... But, it's not been learned. People don't receive much, if any training in design appreciation, aesthetics or what ever you want to call it. They don't have the understanding or confidence to comment one way or the other about a design. Design is still dismissed as styling and an unnecessary frill - which tended to be what industrial design amounted to before designers like Lowry.\n\nSo, here we are in tough economic times. Tougher than most for the book publishing industry. Like in the movies, when the going get's tough, you can count on folks to do all the wrong things much more vigorously than they they would otherwise.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

If I want author X's take on event Y, this is the only way I'm going to get it (in printed form).\n\nBut Nick's questions are good ones, and colleagues in the book racket have addressed most of the causes of this design dis-connect above; so I need not belabor them. But, as a staff design & production manager, I have to admit some complicity in this. At times I have to get a book jacket designed for publicity use before the author is even finished writing. I may end up sending the jacket design to a designer who is not suited to design the text, but I don't know that on that date. & then design for the jacket may not have many \"adaptable\" elements a text designer can pick up on.\n\nThis is not an ideal situation, I agree.

Right now I'm reading the Penguin paper edition of Coetzee's \"Waiting for the Barbarians.\" Mediocre design, terrible printing, but I'm still reading.\n\nAs to Nick's other comment about \"ordinary books\": evidence is that designers of \"ordinary books\" do not read Bringhurst, nor Rich Hendel's \"On Book Design.\" Missing ligatures, false smalls, lining figs, bad margins: they all attest to this.\n\nDo not look to any publication's list of best books for any hope of finding well-designed books. Only rarely do reviewers have any awareness of book design. Even for those who may feel we are living in an era when more attention is paid to design, I think it is too much to expect book reviewers to chat about design.\n\nThat's the view from here, today. From a guy who has spent 40 years trying to make books look good—and at times succeeding, I think.\n\npowers\n\n"

They accomplished the first goal of a book jacket: to get someone to pick up the book. The second goal may be to actually convey some meaningful info about the book, by both visuals and text. Those you read accomplished the third goal: to get someone to read the book. Actually, maybe the third goal is to get someone to buy the book. Getting someone to read the thing may be immaterial.\n\nOne other thing about book jackets and covers, apart from the design of the billboard (I mean the front of the jacket). The type for flaps and for the descriptive copy and blurbs on the back is often atrocious. These parts of the jackets should be put together by typographers, working in cohort with the graphic designers who did the fronts. Type on jacket and cover backs is full of false italics, poorly placed blurb attributions, and generally poor, unimaginative typography. & there seems no attention paid to flap copy. Drop it in, set it FL/RR with no attention to the rag, and punch out for the day. The narrow measure of the flap seems to be too much of a challenge for many designers.\n\npowers\n\n"

I guess you're lucky, then. :)\n\nI wish I could design the cover after the interior as well. I designed the cover for the book I'm doing the interior for right now something like 5 weeks ago.

      "content": "When I was creative director at a small publisher, it was not unusual to need the cover as much as six months before the interior was set to go to design. Hell, sometimes the title wasn't even finalized before we needed tight comps for sales conference. (Catalog date was the deadline for finalizing titles, and it was not uncommon to have to rework a cover or two the night before.) Manuscript wasn't often available, so any brief came from an outline or a marketing blurb. I usually had the luxury of sitting down with the editorial director and the acquiring editor for an in-depth conversation about the book -- much better than talking to marketing alone.\n\nCovers are always caught in a tug-of-war between Editorial and Marketing. It has to be accurate enough to adequately reflect the editorial tone and content; it has to be sexy enough to satisfy marketing. These are often two competing concerns. Left entirely to Editorial, a book cover would reflect and describe the content completely accurately, and be totally boring. Left entirely to Marketing, a book cover would be flashy, look like the best-selling competition (only different), consist primarily of the current colour-du-jour, be full of buzz words, and have very little to do with the topic.\n\nFor most of our titles, it was neither practical nor always the best course to have the same designer do both the interior and cover. Different skills and strengths are needed. Navigating the ins and outs of feedback from marketing and understanding the marketplace and trends for covers is a different skill set from managing complex hierarchies of textual structure, illustrations, charts, tables, etc., and responding to editorial needs and input. Not a lot of designers can do both equally well.\n\nI felt it was my job to try to keep the outside and inside harmonious through my direction, to the extent that I could under the other inevitable constraints and challenges. The title page was one place I often stepped in directly to design a transition from outside to inside. Also, back cover and flaps were another area where a little coordination could help bridge the gap.\n\n-- K.\n\n"

Once the title and jacket design or the name of the author get you to pick up the book, then you look inside. If this is visually inviting and easily readable, you are more likely to sample it extensively. And then, if you like the content, buy the book.\n\nI think it is something like wearing flattering, suitable clothes. It isn't going to make an ugly person beautiful, but it will help soften the blow, and will make the beautiful person glorious.\n\nHere analogy to 'beauty' is what the writer wrote. Good interior design won't make a bad book good, but it will make a good book more inviting to read.\n\nIf the book is a non-fiction one where structuring information is important to usability of the book, like a cook book or text book, or--for different reasons--art book, then visual presentation actually becomes part of content quality.\n\n"
