  "content": "Hi guys. Do you know any (successful) examples of typefaces that mix historical models within the same design? I’m thinking of something like the attached image. Albeit, there’s a lot of strange stuff going on here, but the part I’m interested in discussing is the how the branch grow out of the stem in r/a vs. n-based shapes. The ‘r’ would need to be treated different from ‘n’ in any typeface, so I’m thinking: why not find its echo somewhere else than in ‘n’ altogether?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419025111im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mixing_4928.png)\n\nApologies for the poor English. (And the poor design too. I’m in the process of learning how to draw serifs.)\n\n",

I certainly think there's nothing wrong with it, it is principally a matter of getting the contrast right and keeping consistency afloat. Getting the contrast right is more difficult when working on semi serifs (a successful example is [Alcuin](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419025111/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/alcuin/)). As far as the mixing of styles goes, the task really boils down to mixing them consistently _enough_. Mixing styles will get in the way of achieving consistency, that's for sure.\n\nI stumbled upon the same problem when working on my last typeface [Meleo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419025111/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/alexis-luengas/meleo/). What I learned from it is that if you're going to bring two different terminal styles together, you better make those styles _clearly different_.\n\n"

      "content": "I think you'll have trouble finding _successful_ such designs because it's a very PoMo approach, and PoMo type has yet to mature. But there is zero reason this sort of thing can't work; historical faithfulness can be a crutch as much as it can be a shortcut to specific shape-solutions (and it's rarely much more than the latter). But of course breaking from precedent is more work, not least in terms of ensuring readability.\n\nSo even if something hasn't been done successfully in the past, it's still true that all you need is a reason to make it now. And lacking any evidence that it's actually functionally harmful, this reason could actually be as simple as: \"I like the way it looks.\" And remember, unlike display fonts, text fonts work \"under the radar\", so much stranger stuff can make sense.\n\n--\n\nThe visual discord between the arches and the \"r\" in your first example could actually work; but I think it's better if the \"r\" isn't all alone (which BTW is the main reason I prefer the open-bottom binocular \"g\" - it can accompany the \"s\"). Your second \"n\" is very nice, and promising. End of story. :-) However if you do want a precedent of how \"wild\" things can get, look at Fleischmann, especially his #65 (which people have yet to develop the cojones to properly revive).\n\nRelated:  \n [http://www.typographer.org/2005\\_06\\_01\\_digests.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419025111/http:/www.typographer.org/2005_06_01_digests.html \"http://www.typographer.org/2005\\_06\\_01\\_digests.html\") (see my comment, about halfway down)  \n [http://typophile.com/node/13307](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419025111/http:/typophile.com/node/13307 \"http://typophile.com/node/13307\") (with repeated apologies, but not for not covering it up)\n\nhhp\n\n"
