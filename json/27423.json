I have a dear friend who just bought a Dodge Charger Daytona R/T, and you know how \"muscle car\" fans get with their vehicles, he wants to personalize it with a cutted vinyl phrase on the windshield, I'm a Typo Freak, so if I'm doing this, I'm gonna do it the right way, and that means with the right typeface...\n\nHere's the logo:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423013652im_/http:/typophile.com/files/DodgeCharger_3695.jpg)\n\nI hope that this font even exist, or some similar font will do the job...\n\n",
