More significantly -especially  \nwith the religious angle here- it's an unethical copy.\n\nBut anyway you shouldn't be using Papyrus - it's cheese central.\n\nAbout the other ones you mention, I'd be curious to find out if you  \nown them (maybe from before?) or if you casually \"acquired\" them.\n\nYou might only be 17 or so, but it's not too early to learn  \nabout copyrights etc., and I would suggest your school might  \nbe OK with spending a little bit of money on fonts, and might  \neven be impressed if you told them it's the right thing to do.\n\nhhp\n\n"
