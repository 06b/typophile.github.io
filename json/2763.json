  "content": "As part of my dissertation hand-in, I want to include a picture of some Mrs Eaves Italic Ligatures. fi, gi and gy.   \n   \nI don't own the font so I'm asking if it's possible for somebody to send me a high-res image of these to include in my document. I know maybe it's not allowed, but it's all non-profit educational purposes, and it would save me buying it for three ligatures.   \n   \nWhile looking for an image to include, i came across this, [The Erotics of Type](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015184229/http:/www.xs4all.nl/~maxb/erotype.html) which is quite interesting.. and [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015184229/http:/www.fontfabrik.com/Porno_Q.html) is very funny.\n\n",
