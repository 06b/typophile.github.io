His advice to draw the damned thing again and again...\n\nand again...\n\nis right on. I must have drawn 20 esses before i got to one i was ready to settle on... at least until i get back to balancing weights and such. The following samples each have 10 bezier pts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071113181959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/s_5367.jpg)\n\nIf they don’t look much different to you, again, M. Briem has the right advice. sit. look at them. and then look at them some more. I take a printed page of chars with me when i ride to the beach every day. and look at them.\n\nOnce i got to where i like the basic shape, I removed the points from the top and bottom of the bowls and from the mid stroke and added points to the outsides of the bowl strokes, resulting in 8 points which gave me better control of the weight and curvature.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071113181959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/s2_3412.jpg)\n\nof course, this is a pretty simple shape.\n\ngeo.\n\n"
