  "content": "I'm a newbie here, and I would like to get your advice for an exhibit my local watercolor society is putting together. The exhibit will will have about 50 watercolors in a wide range of styles from very realistic to the abstract. The museum that is hosting the exhibit will take care of hanging and labeling the paintings; that's not my problem. What I do have to do, however, is to come up with a way to fill up about 22 linear feet of display cases with something to go with the exhibit. We are still trying to figure out the exact content. We will almost certainly have something about the history of the medium, and we may include some information about materials and techniques as well.\n\nI would like to find a typeface that would work well for headlines and short paragraphs of text. It needs to be readable from at least arm's length. I would like to have italics and old style figures. I want something that is elegant and yet friendly and approachable.\n\nHere is everything else I know that might be relevant:\n\n\\* The exhibit is being held in a museum that houses a lot of material from the American Civil War. Although I have not visited the museum, I understand that a civil war era locomotive is housed in an adjacent building. The exhibit, however, is not a civil war exhibit. We don't have to do anything from the period, but I do want to be sensitive to other exhibits in the museum.\n\n\\* I will be printing to a 1200 dpi laser printer---nothing fancy. I may dry mount some of the text on matboard after it is printed.\n\n\\* The watercolor society doesn't have any requirements about how the display should look. They would probably be perfectly happy with Comic Sans (just kidding).\n\n\\* My current collection of fonts is relatively small. I have whatever is bundled with my Mac or other software, the Adobe Type Basics, and a handful of other typefaces. I am using this project as a good excuse to add to my collection, but my budget is limited. I would like to spend around $100; $200 is my absolute maximum on this round. I am not getting paid for this project, so anything I spend comes out of my pocket.\n\n\\* At present, I am intererested in some of the Goudy fonts at P22/Lanston -- maybe Californian or Deepdene -- but I'm not sure how they would work in a display. I am open to the idea of limited use of swashes or ornaments as well. Actually, I am open to just about any ideas.\n\nI would be very grateful for any recommendations or advice.\n\n",

In fact, I used Cezanne (regular version) for the main headline on their website, and they are very happy with it. I would be willing to upgrade to the Pro version.\n\nI'm a little concerned about readability with the all caps Durer font for headlines. Some of the headlines will may have five or six words. It might be very interesting to use it as a drop cap, but I'm not sure that's where I'm headed.\n\nWhat would you suggest as a contemporary face to pair with Cezanne? My sans serif collection is a little skimpy. I could probably spring for a small subset of another face.\n\n"

I see Sabon used a lot in museum displays, and it's always perfectly clear and stylish. But old style figures are \\*essential\\* to the elegance of everything!\n\nIf you need something more mid-19th-century, ITC Bodoni Twelve OSF fonts work perfectly for that look.\n\nLinotype Sabon OSF fonts:  \n [http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328232253/http:/www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html\")\n\n"

It's simple and elegant, and I can read 12pt text easily at arm's length.\n\nI tried to get Cezanne to work for the headlines, but I couldn't get the long descenders in the Cezanne headlines to play nicely with the body text. When I set Cezanne relatively close to the body text, the descenders divided the space between the headline and the body into lots of annoying white rectangles. When I increased the space enough to make the rectangles go away, it became difficult to tell that the headline and the body text were related to each other. I still like the idea of using Cezanne for large, standalone headlines, and I might use it for a title card in each display case.\n\nThanks for all the responses. This has been a good learning experience.\n\n"
