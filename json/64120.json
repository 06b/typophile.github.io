  "content": "Hi all, Id be really grateful for input on this one. It looks to me to be similar to Granby and is certainly of that era in terms of when the lettering was applied to the sign but its baffling me abit. The ’Stores’ word looks to have slightly different proportions to the ’Lina’ word so they are maybe from different fonts. Perhaps it was just an old school signwriter/maker who didnt want to play by the rules, though hopefully someone here can enlighten me! Any help/thoughts on this much appreciated.  \nThanks  \nArran\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [LINAtype.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20091114124908/http:/typophile.com/files/LINAtype.jpg) | 74.31 KB |\n\n",

Go back there and have a look as they sometimes wrote their names very small in the corner of the sign somewhere in the olden days.\n\nAnd buy some fresh pasta while you’re at it! I love that shop. (or I did when I lived in London).\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the response Nick. I took that snap so have been fairly close up, but havent actually checked for a signature in the corner – will definitely look out for that. Do you have any thoughts on fonts that might come close to either of the words ’Lina’ or ’Stores’? Its actually the ’Lina’ word Im more intrigued by as the Stores word looks to at least reference Granby or Johnston.\n\nps I bought some pasta from there – very tasty indeed!\n\n"
