      "content": "Megi Zumstein from Switzerland did something in the same context, but took it even farther. The Project was calles something along the lines of <cite>Visualisierung von Sprache [Visualization of Language]</cite> and was covered in detail in <cite>Typografische Monatsbl√§tter 2/2002</cite>. The project transformed acoustic signals of spoken language into visual signals that directly affected type: Filters were applied directly to type based on spoken language.\n\n"
