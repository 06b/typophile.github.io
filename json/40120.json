  "content": "Hi,\n\nDoes anybody know the name of the swash font used by Phoenix Home & Garden magazine? It kind of looks like Adobe’s Poetica. I have tried Whatthefont and looked through a few catalogues but cant find it. Probably will kick myself once someone tells me as I am sure I have seen it used somewhere else.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Swash1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219120728/http:/typophile.com/files/Swash1.jpg) | 46.24 KB |\n| [Swash2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219120728/http:/typophile.com/files/Swash2.jpg) | 51.47 KB |\n| [Swash3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219120728/http:/typophile.com/files/Swash3.jpg) | 45.67 KB |\n\n [‹ Sears Holiday \"Wish\" typeface](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219120728/http:/typophile.com/node/39680 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Free Software Directory rounded condensed sans serif - Kaffeesatz {Stephen} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071219120728/http:/typophile.com/node/40101 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
