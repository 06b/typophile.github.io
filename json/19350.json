I find this very strange, since I’ve seen examples of Trinité in use with the fi- and fl-ligatures. The other fonts from Enschedé seems to have several f-ligatures.\n\nDoes anyone have a point of view on this? Thank you!\n\n [‹ Does anyone not much like reading letterpress Bembo?](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808131217/http:/typophile.com/node/19299 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [\"Schoolbook\" Alternates ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070808131217/http:/typophile.com/node/19354 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
