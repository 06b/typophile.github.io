I have come up with some ideas but i am not sure if anyting is working at all, opinions and advise would be great.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101209155410im_/http:/typophile.com/files/versions1_5596.jpg)\n\n",

Being that #4 just shows a box, I don't think that's really going anywhere. Version 8 is a little hard to see, and it kinda looks like you've used the ol' 3D button filter on it. I like the \"pixel in the yard\" idea, but the execution could use some work.\n\n"

As far as the pixels building up the logo, it's not a bad direction, but it seems like something that has been used pretty often. think Xerox, or something similar. We had a motion graphics studio near my college back in the day, and their logo was a similar execution.\n\nAnd, the blue would be better suited emphasizing \"Pixel\" rather than \"Yard,\" (like v.4) since pixel is more relative to what you all actually do.\n\n"

If not then i would actually say that you should think about your more extensive branding and marketing to carry that point across and keep your logo clean and simple. Also don't focus too heavily on the tool - focus on the idea. In the same way you don't need to show a wrench for a plumber you don't need to overemphasize 3D which is a tool to creating immersive and intuitive learning experiences. Go for the result. Leave your methodology to your materials.\n\nHaving said that I like 1,2,6 and 8\n\n"
