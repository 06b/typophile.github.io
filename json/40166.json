  "content": " **Recently, I went on a complete shopping spree for type.**\n\nThe two online destinations that I kept coming back to were [Village](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122201742/http:/www.vllg.com/) and [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/web/20150122201742/http:/www.fountain.nu/), due to their pricing, tight selection, usability and general value. H&FJ is, of course, great, but I feel like I have memorized their entire catalog already and they're a little pricey.\n\nDoes anyone know of anything new and comparable that I am unaware of? The huge sources (FontShop, Veer, Linotype, etc.) tend to overwhelm and are difficult to shop.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nThanks,\n\nSam\n\nPS Some other close runner ups included: Dalton Maag, Emigre, House Industries, Typotheque, Underware, and OurType.\n\n\\* I ended up buying Omnes, Apex Sans and Pill Gothic, if anyone was interested.\n\n",
