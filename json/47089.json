Shakespeare and Company had it printed by Maurice Darantiere in Dijon, if that bit of information helps.\n\n[Ulysses title page](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828053526/http:/www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/amlit/paris/utitle.jpg)\n\nHunting around I came across this [thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828053526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33033), but the later American editions are set in something else.\n\nThanks,  \nJames\n\n [‹ Type ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828053526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47120 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help ID'ing this font, please ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828053526/http:/www.typophile.com/node/47106 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Unfortunately the alphabet is incomplete, but the book says Elzevir’s upper case is based on this design by Louis Perrin about 1846.\n\nIf 1922 is indeed the date of publication of this edition, this typeface would have been available.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

After a little more digging it looks like the Lyons Titling / Elzevir upper case might be right. That is, I found a webpage that mentioned that Darantiere used Elsevir type.\n\nI also came across a citation for a John Ryder paper entitled “Editing Ulysses Typographically” but I had to ILL it and it hasn’t arrived.\n\nI’ll let you know what I find,  \nThanks again,  \nJames\n\n"
