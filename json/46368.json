  "content": "I’d love some help from you guys.\n\nI’m doing a letterpressed wedding invitation. The event itself is casual with a pig roast immediately afterward, so I’m thinking that the tone of the invite should be relaxed and entertaining, too.\n\nI’m creating an oversized (8Wx12H) “poster” for the invite that I want to be typography only. I’m thinking that I’d like to use classic typefaces that will vary from large to small, much like old letterpress posters/announcements or type specimen from old metal and wood type.\n\nIt will be letterpressed on cotton paper, some thick stuff that has some tooth.\n\nIt’ll probably be black type (maybe a spot color, too) on white paper.\n\nThe style will be anti-formal wedding letterpress, and more in the throw-me-together-a-quick-poster-on-your-letterpress-in-1945 zone.\n\nI’d love to get some suggestions on typefaces to use for this style.\n\nThink BIG small BIG small BIG NUMBERS small, mostly centered.\n\nI’d like to include an old gothic or grotesque of some sort- Franklin seems too mean looking. Trade and News don’t have quite enough character.\n\nI’d like to find three typefaces that really feel nice together- and one that has a nice set of numbers for the date/time, etc.\n\nI have included some samples of a couple of cheap letterpress posters from 50+ years ago- both use Cheltenham, but are a bit different with the headline faces.\n\nAny suggestions or pointers toward other examples of this type of style is greatly appreciated...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103304im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/img002_5660.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103304im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/img003_3606.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103304im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/img009_6221.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103304im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/img010_6411.jpg)\n\n [‹ Questions about Grotesk and companion fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103304/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46397 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type and Grammar ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081013103304/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46367 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
