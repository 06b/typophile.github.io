  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm looking for a simple, honest and approachable san serif for use in body text. My idea is to have a journal feel but without being too themey. Something with the characteristics above that come together looking elegant. I loved the feeling of Frutiger on my page ( one of my faves) and although quite neutral it's the complete opposite of what I want, its cold and distant and not really in line with the honest feel i'd like to convey.\n\nI like Myriad Pro but wanted to see if there are others you can recommend, perhaps something I am simply not finding. Any recommendations would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

It's incredibly versatile with all the different weights and corresponding feel, each one has its own distint look however I'm not looking to purchase anything new ( sorry should have mentioned that before). I think I'm warming up to Myriad Pro, is that a bad thing? I wanted to try something new but similar but can't seem to find anything suitable in my library. Argh!\n\n"

Going through my library again and like the idea of mixing myriad pro ( headers) and minion pro ( bodytext)\n\nI like the classical elegance of minion pro and think it works well for the length body text but like the idea of juxtaposing it with sans serif like myriad pro, still has that humanist feel, humble and quietly confident.\n\nThoughts of other pairings with a similar feel are welcome :)\n\n"

      "content": "Given the fact Minion was born as a sister to Myriad, the two typefaces work very well together. I believe they share the same x-height and roughly the same width, although that can be modified with Multiple Master. I think Myriad and Minion were the first Multiple Master fonts released by Adobe in the mid nineties.\n\nMyriad has a great level of legibility, but it is used in Apple’s advertising and therefore I think a lot of people associate it with the Apple brand.\n\n"

I also tried Gill Sans with Optima. I may use pairs or a single typeface, I shall see what works best. I am kind of restricted as I have to find complimentary arabic typefaces and given the lack of variety I can't be too experimental with the english.\n\n"
