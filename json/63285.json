Carl Gustav Jung's \"Red Book\" - a sort of personal diary kept by the master during his life - has just been published, in a kind of \"facsimile\" edition which reproduces his calligraphy and drawings (the text is also typeset for easier reading). Apart from the content itself, onirical and visionary, it is the design and production choice which is interesting: Jung's notebook is treated like a Medieval manuscript, somehow. There's some previews here:\n\n[https://philemonfoundation.org/projects/red\\_book/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100116122238/https:/philemonfoundation.org/projects/red_book/ \"https://philemonfoundation.org/projects/red\\_book/\")\n\n",
