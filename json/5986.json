I need to direct a client to where they can buy it, but I am starting to think that the font in question maybe named wrong as I cannot seem to find it anywhere.   \n   \nAny help?   \n   \nThanks ![enschede.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052521im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42396.jpg)\n\n",

A window will appear that gives information on the font, and, if the font is well made, you will probably find where its from there.   \n   \nSee below for an example.
