  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nI am trying some fonts for a Literary Magazine. Do you know of any Indesign Template or Website that i could a get a template then copy/paste a specific font and take to the laser printer to check how the font works? A fast test drive for fonts which include its family' variations for text.\n\nI guess is something like that  \n [http://www.levien.com/type/atf\\_1912/p0739\\_sm.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20110116184846/http:/www.levien.com/type/atf_1912/p0739_sm.jpg \"http://www.levien.com/type/atf\\_1912/p0739\\_sm.jpg\")\n\nor that  \n [http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TitilliumText14L](http://web.archive.org/web/20110116184846/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TitilliumText14L \"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/TitilliumText14L\")  \n [http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ChunkFive](http://web.archive.org/web/20110116184846/http:/www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ChunkFive \"http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/ChunkFive\")\n\nI guess i could do it by hand with each font but it will take me quite a while.\n\nAny help or ideas?\n\nThanks  \nSebastian\n\n",
