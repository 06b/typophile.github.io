It is slightly more extended, though. This is the result of different approaches of how to deal with the 45 degrees diagonals in the M and N: They naturally lead to a rather wide M and N, so I adjusted the overall width to match, whereas in the above example, the M and N have a rather quirky solution, and W and V had to be \"chopped off\" but that allows the whole font to have a more conventinal overall width.\n\n"
