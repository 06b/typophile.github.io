  "content": "Wondering if anyone has any suggestions for typefaces similar to Whitney? I've 'accidentally' used it and already use it in another publication. Client has ok'd so am looking for something similar. Thought Freight Sans would work, but the 'e' is not the greatest. Benton Sans is also close, but ridiculously expensive. Neither offer a semibold. Am using it in front of book, back of book and 2 areas for display (this is where the e is noticably yucky). Anyone?\n\nA\n\n",

Unfortunately the client for my magazine has already seen & approved the layouts with Whitney. Basically I'm trying to do a swap for something just as beautiful with only the internal team really noticing.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nA\n\n"

Font Bureau gives discounts as you add weights and [FontShop offers packages](http://web.archive.org/web/20150308033525/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Benton+Sans).\n\nOther good suggestions from Mikey (SUF).
