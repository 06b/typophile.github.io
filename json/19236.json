So if you can't use a substitution font, whoever used this must have used something else, right? Man, who'd a thought this would be so difficult. I appreciate all the help, hopefully we can all fugure this thing out.\n\nHere's the deal...\n\nWe have been contracted to do a rebrand for these guys:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021042638im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AZDC.gif)\n\nThey want to use the same font, but change the logo, colors, etc... so I am trying to figure out what the font is so we can use it in the rebrand. Of course they have no idea what was used or who even did it so I figured I'd try posting on here. As usual, any and all help is appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nBeau\n\n"

Open the file into acrobat. If it looks right, and you have Acrobat Pro, Go to pull-down: TOOLS\\>PRINT PRODUCTION\\>PDF OPTIMIZER. Under TRANSPARENCY, \"turn all type to outlines.\" It will then ask you to save the file again.\n\nIf this works or doesn't work could you report back? I'd be curious/surpised.\n\nAlthough, this doesn't look spindly enough to be the Adobe fonts.\n\n"

Anyone up for a good recommendation of a new face for their brand? I will do all I can to pull them away from the current face. Maybe we can find something that will be close but better.\n\nHere's what I would like you to take into consideration, the font will be used for logos, text, web & video - basically everything.\n\nI think Times Europa is a bit \"fat\" with some of it's characters. Plus I think we would want to have more of a friendly feel to the font. Times tends to be a bit stuck up (in my opinion). Maybe there would be a good semi-serif?\n\nThoughts?\n\n"
