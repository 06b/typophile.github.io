  "content": "A while ago I have finished yet another typographic world map. The project is heavily inspired by [TypoMaps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184451/http:/www.typomaps.net/), the difference being that I set the country names in their official languages and scripts, and was being more accurate with all the small islands and independent territories (also I think I followed the actual borders more carefully). I will appreciate any comments, especially about how well non-latin/cyrillic/greek part (Arabic, in particular) matches the main font (Helvetica).\n\nThe JPG render of the map is attached, or you can download the EPS from [my homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184451/http:/publicfields.net/textmap/get.html) ( [direct download link](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184451/http:/backend.publicfields.net/textmap/eps?aspect=robinson&ocean=0.901961,0.643137,0.184314,0.407843&main1=0.576471,0.0784314,0.545098,0.0627451&main2=0.0980392,0.827451,0.513725,0.0901961&main3=0.552941,0.215686,0.341176,0.203922&main4=0.0823529,0.470588,0.509804,0.0509804&main5=0.282353,0.152941,0.631373,0.0823529&ice2=0.0431373,0.180392,0.0823529,0.00392157&ice5=0.105882,0.0705882,0.141176,0.0117647&ice1=0.160784,0.0431373,0.137255,0.00784314&ice3=0.160784,0.0509804,0.0941176,0.00784314&iceneutral=0,0,0,0.0588235&) for the version with default size and colors).\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [map\\_small.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317184451/http:/typophile.com/files/map_small.jpg) | 271.89 KB |\n\n",

It was not exact science, I admit, but most of the times the choice was quite clear.\n\n"
