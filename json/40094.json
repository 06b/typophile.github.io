I have no idea if the fonts were \"real\" in so much as a DR release (possible, knowing them and I do vaguely remember an interview with DR/Tomato - Creative Review I think - saying they were going to release them) or just a fan-boy creation.\n\nDafont.com might be the place to look for the A-Z only copies.\n\ns\n\n"
