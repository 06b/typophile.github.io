  "content": "I am currently writing a short dissertation about if / how Blackletter and especially Fraktur gains back importance to current design and typography, and whether or not Fraktur can leave its poor national-socialistic associations behind. Now I am looking for contemporary sources whether Blackletter has been used in advertising, branding, fashion, music or modern typefaces [http://www.typetype.com/cat/neutrum.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317075050/http:/www.typetype.com/cat/neutrum.html \"http://www.typetype.com/cat/neutrum.html\") ; basically in anything that has been created in the last 10 years.  \nGenerally I am looking for some more 'mainstream' examples and I remember that for example Nike did some ads using Fraktur a few years ago.  \nDoes anybody know of further examples?\n\nJo.\n\n",
