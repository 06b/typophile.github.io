      "content": "I don't find much call for originality or creativity in typography these days. That's probably the norm, and the new typography of the digital era, pre-Millennium, the exception.\n\nMy more innovative faces don't sell as well as the conservative ones. The\"new alphabet\" typeface Panoptica is a case in point. This is an original and creative design-- a monowidth unicase alphabet, drawn from scratch, in seven typeface genres -- that enables typographers to do new kinds of typographic layout.\n\nBut as Eben says, is it useful? Apparently not, people seem to be more interested in smooth retro styling. Fonts is a fashion business, as Phil Martin says.\n\nWe call those who rework other people's typefaces \"designers\". But there's nothing creative or original in that, so surely it can't be design?\n\nNorbert's use of the term \"thief\" is, sadly, typical of the post-modern era, and the way that \"recontextualizing\" has so much more cred than starting from scratch, with the assumption that all art is theft, but that's OK, because originality isn't possible, or is irrelevant.\n\nParker's description of the dynamic model of creativity is the classic explanation by Arthur Koestler, in Act of Creation.\n\n"

I think you just \"do\" whatever it is you do (physics, type design, whatever) and if you become immersed in the problem you are attempting to solve in a naive way passing no judgment on your thoughts, that you allow the opportunity for creativity or originality. That does not mean you will succeed, it just means you made success a possibility rather than an impossibility. The worst thing a person can do is set creativity or originality as a goal, even as a priority. It is better to free yourself from the burden of judgment and allow your thoughts to interact. While you are working, just work. Allow others to pass judgment later after you are done. There are plenty around who would rather pass judgment on your work that do work of their own. If you design something and get value out of the experience of doing it then it does not matter what others may say about it. This is not the same as sales or business. You can do mundane stuff that sells well but is not fulfilling to you. You do have to pay the bills after all. Push the envelope to fuel yourself when you can though. Even though Nick's Panoptica is not a big money maker for him, I will bet he is still glad he designed it.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Surely one can have a practical strategy for originality:  \nWork from scratch and don't use \"off-the-shelf\" raw materials like stock images and bundled fonts. Mess with your software defaults (eg H&J settings) and avoid filter pre-sets. To be really original, comission a custom typeface, or like Erik von Blokland, make your own design software tools.\n\n"

      "content": "I like the new direction this thread is taking - now there is talk about what is important to us instead of the sheer reductionism of the initial post.\n\nThe only reason I gave Norbert any shit before about his witty remarks ( they were witty ) is that I felt that there was a hint of what Nick is talking about in his remarks about “recontextualizing”. I felt like there was a sense in his quotes that all effort towards originality were folly. I see now that that wasn't quite what he meant but that was what I was reacting to. Sure, there is plenty of folly in what we do, but we have to get used to that & keep going anyway.\n\nRe-reading Nick's post, (Thanks Nick! Sweet post again ) Despite enjoying his ideas in gerenral, I found myself I feeling ambivalent about his complaint re: the current fashion in typeface design. As soon as Nick's Panoptica fonts become fashionable he'll have no reason to lament. And if his ideas, in the form of that font family, are going to gain cultural currency it seems like it would happen as a result of the whim of fashion first & then maybe general acceptance later.\n\nThis is a process that is a wonderful if quite fickle mistress. Sorry about the gender inapproprate anology... Still, this process widens our culture.\n\nAnd it is here because of a capitalistic, and often ignorant or naive urge towards novelty. I don't really think it could work any other way. Not if a broad range of type is something you value. Emigre's original early 90's fonts might well not rate too highly if they released their stuff now. Our jaded eyes would move on - fair or no. And I do think it wouyld be unfair. I think we were lucky to have them show up when they did. But fashion/timing/luck has alot to do with their now iconic status.\n\nOn the other hand having a grounding in the art, science & craft of an artistic discipline is what gives art it's depth. I don't think this part is not responsive to capitalism - it requires a comitment from the artist which makes no capitalistic sense whatsoever.\n\nAnd I think we need both.\n\nAs far as the debate between Nick & Chris about how Creativity & Originality are to be realized I think it's different for different people. Also, IF it happens to a person at all, the personal experience - and therefore they way they describe it - will be diffrent for diffrerent people too. And it will be much more likeley to happen to somebody who is steeped in the discipline for some time. Then if they choose to say 'the education got in my way' or ' I am buiding on the achievements of my forebearers' or ' I am original' or 'look what I made- neat huh?' will not matter. The work will speak for itself .\n\nAbout Parker's commets about the 2 minute design: It puts me in mind of a story I read in Eye magazine years ago about a desiner who was musing about what to do with a client who they had advised to keep the logo they had. After all, he had saved them alot of money,time and kept brand continuity!\n\n"

The story claimed that the natives couldn't see Columbus' ships; the ships were so far outside the life-experience of the natives they were simply unable to accept them, therefore their brains refused to process the visual input.\n\nWhether this story is true or not, we've all seen pictures of people in Indonesia staring at the tsunami in disbelief, unable to react because they didn't have a reference for a 10-meter wave hitting the beach without warning on a beautiful day.\n\nI think a more mild version of this phenomenon happens all the time: if something is too different, a vast majority of people will simply block it out and move on, without consious thought (Douglas Adams made fun of this phenomenon with his \"SEP\"-invisibility field: make something look impossible, then surround it with a \"Someone Else's Problem\" field, and people will completely ignore it.)\n\nAs designers, we are constrained by this tendency in people. If we design something too radically different from what has gone before, our clients will reject the design (and rightly so, because the target audience won't accept it, either). So the design has to be mostly ... used, I guess is a good term ... but just a little original so people will notice it.\n\n(Yes, I am talking about design for commission. Design for the sake of design is art, and a totally different issue.)\n\nThe good news about used design is that people know what it means. If we move from visual to verbal, imagine what would happen if we all started creating \"original\" words.\n\nHave a Phlendal Day!\n\nJay\n\n(now I have to go google \"phlendal\" and make sure it doesn't exist.)\n\n(Come to think of it, \"google\" is an interesting example. It was a corruption of \"googol\", but now means something completly different. Was that originality? Or creative?)\n\n"

Aren't we, as artistic humans, merely making new combinations of the things we are exposed to with our limited senses? Was the first airplane original, or was it just a creation of things which already existed (a bird image, wood, an engine.)\n\nFor that matter, do we create, or do we combine? Isn't every new \"creation\" just a new way of combining things that already exist? Isn't glass just silica combined in a different way? How about a true creation... a child? Is a child an original creation, or just a copy of existing DNA, combined in a new way?\n\nIs life in an original concept, or was it just stolen from somewhere else?\n\n"

Like love - something that is never completely realized due to the frailty of our constitutions but a dream to send us into the good night. There are concepts that are never achieved on a pure level that are still important to humans as guideposts. I believe that these two words fit into that category.  \npeace\n\n"
