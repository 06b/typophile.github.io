I really like the Chalet series from House Industries and was wondering  \nif anybody could recommend a similar or cheaper alternative to the one I have posted.\n\nCheers\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [gemini capture.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20061126102456/http:/typophile.com/files/gemini%20capture.jpg) | 21.71 KB |\n\n",

In which case it would serve you well to purchase more than one weight and perhaps italics. The price per font is often much lower when you buy a package.\n\n"
