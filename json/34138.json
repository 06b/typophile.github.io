Are there some glyphs you've really wanted in a symbol font but couldn't find (which I'm sure you quite capably designed yourself, but let me know anyway)? or perhaps is there a whole set that, though they exist in an available symbol font, they don't complement the text fonts of your choice well enough to be useful? What other problems might your current range of symbols present that can be solved with a redesign?\n\n",
