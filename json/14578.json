  "content": "Hi,  \nI have an old font which says it's Postscript Type 1 but when opened in FontLab, no glyph is showing. It does show its characthers in FontBook though (Macintosh) and if I install it, it will be placed in font folder of Classic OS.  \nIs it possible to convert it to TTF font and view its glyphs in FontLab? How?  \nThanks,  \nBehnam\n\n",
