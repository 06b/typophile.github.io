Due to the business of the customer having changed in recent times toward the elegant, I am looking for something with mild swashes, that isn't too far departed from Garamond in an attempt to save my project turning into a design nightmare...\n\nMaybe the most important question I am asking is - what arguments do you guys employ when you are trying to win over a marketing person from the dark side?\n\nThanks, and be gentle, it's my first post (having enjoyed reading the forums here for a few weeks)...\n\nSteve\n\n",

The K swash is just right, as it's the first character in the logotype.\n\nSo there's the easy bit... now I have to win them over with some convincing designerbabble to avoid publishing something that will be spoiled by a bad typeface choice!\n\nI guess a designer's opinion doesn't count for much until he/she hits the big time... moan, gripe, winge...\n\n"
