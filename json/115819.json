  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm designing a handwriten font wich contain many alternate sets of characters and I programmed a calt feature to randomize it. The feature contains a lot of lines mixing and conditioning the substition of each character. I thing the sintaxis is fine and the replacement works fine too, but when I increase the number of characters in each of the classes used in the code the output panel shows the following warning:\n\n[FATAL] GSUB feature 'ÿÿÿÿ' causes overflow of offset to a subtable (0x1140a)\n\n(I don't know why the name of the feature is swhown without the correct name).  \nI guess it means the code becomes too heavy but searching and reading a lot of posts of similar bugs I concluded that the responsible of this issue was the program. So I decided to try compiling the font in an older version (FL 5.0) and there aren't any problem and the compiled font works fine.  \nPlease tell me what can I do to improve my version of FL to avoid this issue. Any comment will be appreciated.\n\n",
