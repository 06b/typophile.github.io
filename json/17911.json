On chips? Salt and Vinagar used to be represented by a Yellow-green, but it has recientlly changed to Cyan Blue, I think they needed Green for the Dill Pickle chip bag.

I guess these days that’s getting to be about the same._\n\nWe have had a rash of the same kind of non-sensical generic food packaging makeovers here in Australia, particularly potato chip brands and quickie-snack products found in supermarket freezer aisles. So I guess this dubious style isn’t uniquely American.\n\nFor about the last 2 years there has been a lot of twaddle from brand managers I work with about brand positioning and re-positioning, niche consumer appeal and “leveraging” consumer products. It translates into lots of pointless and stoopid packaging redesigns.\n\nQuite possibly the font used on the new Walkers package is an attempt to differentiate the brand from other potato chip brands that use a flair serif (as the previous Walkers pack did). Flair serifs are common on chip packets.\n\nThat, however, doesn’t excuse the awful new font they’ve used. It isn’t organic enuff for a food product. Nuts!\n\n_Maybe they needed to stress the ready salted over the actual brand name. :^/_\n\n:^) That is exactly the kind of thing I’m on about—-brand sub-positioning and niche appeal.
