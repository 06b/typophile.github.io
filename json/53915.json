  "content": "For an event poster, I'd like to replace the original text, attached, (from a 17th-century engraving that is the centerpiece of the poster) with information about the current event (title, date, location). And I'd like this information to appear in a font that emulates the original typeface as much as possible.\n\nWhat font would be the best match here to convey a feel for the period?\n\nSuggestions much appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141228194151im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ANewSystem-type_4366.jpg)\n\n",
