  "content": "This summer another student and myself will participate in a Students Partnering with Faculty Summer Research Program along with a faculty member/design professional. The program will involve researching typography, studying typefaces, typographic classification, and meeting with design professionals. Then, in late summer/early fall we will each begin work to design and create our own typeface.   \n   \nI was wondering if those of you who have experience designing and creating typefaces can recommend the best computer program for it. Work will be done, of course, on Macs. Macromedia's Fontographer seems to be the first choice, but does FontLab seem a more appropriate choice?   \n   \nPlease discuss which programs you prefer and the reasons why. Any information you can provide would be extremely helpful.\n\n",

It has to be at the zero-point in the Ill. document and it gets to be such an absurd size that if you draw a string of characters they soon run of the page, even if you draw on a large 'page'. In fontographer you just take care the letters you draw are between two lines, and these lines will be cap height and deschender depth, no matter how big or small the drawing in Ill.

The reason that I believe FOG 3.5's EPS import is superior is that it assumes that what you import in 1000 points high (more about this later); FOG 4.1 assumes that what you import is equal to the ascent of the font; I cannot, for the life of me, figure out WHAT FL assumes -- all that I know is that, in my experience, the manual instructions don't work, and a couple of workarounds I've seen posted elsewhere don't work either.   \n   \nWhen I export EPS for FOG 3.5, I place tick marks at ascent and descent on all my characters (a simple process that takes less than five minutes). Then, when I import the EPS characters into FOG 3.5, they fall exactly where they ought to, and they are correctly proportioned to one another. The only way to accomplish this in FOG 4.1 is to set the ascent at 1000, with no descent, import all your characters, reset the ascent and descent, then move all of the characters down so they sit on the new baseline.   \n   \nI took your advice about tweaking the OPTIMIZE options and the results were mixed. I could eliminate the \"stick figure\" results, but the downside was that some redundant points were NOT cleaned up. The various combination I tried of the ten available choices seemed to yield either too much or too little, and none were \"just right.\"   \n   \nOne the other hand, in my humble opinion, the outline cleanup features in DTL's ContourMaster Light are superior to ANYTHING else out there, BUT...their 15000-units-to-the-em measurement system causes some \"point shift\" once you convert the outlines back to a 1000-unit em, so you still have to check every character to correct the instances where dividing by fifteen produced unsatisfactory results.\n\n"

      "content": "In FOG 4.1.3 (Mac) art pasted in from Illustrator is scaled up to the full em square height. Holding down the command and option keys while choosing Paste from the menu scales it to the ascent. Holding just the option key causes the art to scale the same as FontLab (1 point (in Illustrator) equal to 1 em unit) with the bottom of the art resting on the baseline. These optional paste commands seem to work if you do it completely from the keyboard, you have to choose the Paste command from the menu with the mouse. This could be some peculiarity due to running FOG in Classic on OS X. I seem to recall that you used to be able to just use the keyboard.   \n   \nI used to draw in Illustrator and move art to FOG, and that workflow kept me from switching to FontLab for quite a while, even after I owned a copy. But copying and pasting from Illustrator to FL is not that hard once you realize how it works.   \n   \nScale your Illustrator art so that 1 point corresponds to 1 em unit (i.e., if your target cap height is 700 em units, make your caps in Illustrator 700 points tall). Move the Illustrator ruler zero point to the origin point of the character art you want to copy. Copy from Illustrator, paste in FL. Simple.   \n   \nThe biggest problems are getting the clipboard preferences set correctly in Illustrator (should be AICB/Preserve Paths) and dealing with rounding-down errors (no fractional em units in fonts, despite what FOG may lead you to believe).   \n   \nPersonally, I have completely switched to drawing directly in FontLab. It's much more efficient and I wish I'd starting doing it sooner. I blame FOG's (in my opinion) clumsy drawing tools for my previous reliance on Illustrator. I think I would have been better off drawing in FOG, too, in hindsight.\n\n"

If in Preferences / General / Do not rescale... is deactivated, then 1 point in EPS = 1 FontLab unit. When the option is enabled, then FontLab assumes that what you import is 700 units high.   \n   \nAlso, you don't need to place any tick marks whatsoever. Just place the characters in Illustrator of Freehand so that the 0,0 point of the EPS document is on the font's origin point. In other words: you can always work in Illustrator taking points EXACTLY as if they were font units in FL.

I will give them a try, and see if I can't conquer this EPS import problem and eventually retire trusty old FOG 3.5.   \n   \nWhile I have your attention, there are a few other FL \"problems\" I would like to bring to the fore...   \n   \nFirst, it would be REALLY nice to be able to set more defaults in the FONT INFO dialogue. I am the only designer using FL on my computer, so it would be convenient if the program would remember my personal URL, website URL and licensing info...no biggy, but it would be convenient.   \n   \nSecond, while FL's zoom capabilities FAR exceed those of FOG, they still stop a little shy of where I'd like. Being able to zoom into, say, a 3x3 point grid would come in handy when trying to edit the curves at the end of a tiny round serif. CorelDraw can zoom to 400,000%, which is probably excessive, but a LITTLE more magnification in FL would be helpful.   \n   \nFinally, from time to time, I get reports back of Mac PS fonts on OS 9 displaying not a preview of the font in question, but of a sans-serif system font. The cause, I believe, is a FOND ID # conflict (TypeTool/FL default is 128), so the problem is easy enough to fix. However, it would also be quite convenient if there were a way (like, just pressing a button) to tie the FOND ID # to the unique PSID number (hash/add 6000 to the last 4 digits/whatever) to lessen the chance that this problem would occur.

Practically everybody will want the \"hashing\" to work differently. So that's really something for a tiny little Python script. In fact, you can put any Python commands e.g. into the save.py file within your FontLab folder, and then the commands will be executed whenever a FontLab file is saved.

The reason that this BE file has the same em as the IK version, is that this made it possible to enclose only one UFM for both formats. This underlines how versatile a separate naming and metrics file is, but I must honestly admit that it never occurred to me that this would result in the idea that everything in FM is based on 15000 units. Although very occasionally FM will convert internally the format to an em of 15000, all functions very well with whatever em. For instance DTL ContourMaster works perfectly with an em of 1000 and there is no need to do any conversion beforehand. All of the DTL glyph databases in BE format have an em of 1000. For Ikarus the default is however 15000 units and in case analog data is manually digitized (which we still often do), 100 units correspond to 1 centimeter.   \n   \nFor version 2.1.3 of FM, the BE glyph database for the FM Demo Font has been set to 1000.

One would think, by this point, that Adobe's various products would have learned to play nice with each other.\n\n"

My point is that your default behavior would only work for MacRoman encoding, and would generate defective fonts for other encodings.   \n   \nAdditionally, UniqueIDs should not be arbitrary, except for limited private use. Adobe maintains a registry of UniqueIDs; people can and should get UniqueIDs assigned by Adobe if they are going to use them in retail fonts. Otherwise you're just playing Russian roulette on a larger scale.   \n   \nUsing a UniqueID as the basis for a SKU does not make technical sense, unless you are never going to revise your fonts, or you'd change SKUs every time you do a bug fix or revision.   \n   \nI don't know about your Acrobat/Illustrator problem, but I can say from the description that I suspect the problem is on Illustrator's side. So I doubt that Acrobat 7 will have fixed anything.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

My suggestion was predicated on what I suspect are the vast majority of cases where Mac Roman encoding is desired. A default setting or procedure that generates a FOND ID number that is less likely to conflict with system fonts could, and would, be overridden if circumstances so require. I am not suggesting that one size fits all, but it would be more convenient if one size fit most.\n\nAnd, yes, I do obtain Unique PSIDs from Adobe, and I do use them. And using PSIDs as SKU numbers may not work for everybody in all instances (I don't believe I suggested that they would), but they do work for me.\n\n"

It took some getting used to, but now I prefer my new method. It's much faster (mainly due to fewer steps) and more controllable. I actually find it more difficult to draw in Illustrator now.\n\nYou should be aware, however, that there are big differences between drawing in Illustrator and drawing in FontLab. The biggest one is that Illustrator allows practically infinite precision in point placement, whereas FontLab constrains you to whole em-units. This can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. Being able to work in unconstrained units avoids rounding errors that can occour when scaling outlines, but it also gives you a false sense of how precisely you can place points in glyph space (which is always constrained to whole em-units).\n\nConsequently, if you work in Illustrator, you must check for rounding errors when importing the artwork into FontLab. If you draw directly in FontLab, it's essentially WYSIWYG and there's no need for that step.\n\n"

The coordinates in digital fonts (PostScript Type 1, OpenType PS, OpenType TT) must be integer units. FontLab imposes this limitation onto the designer during the entire process, so you're always WYSIWYG. Fontographer goes a different path: it allows you to draw in fractional coordinates but when you generate the font, the coordinates get rounded to the next integer coordinates. So there is no final control over what will end up where (although it is possible to \"snap\" the points manually before generating the font). Both methods have their supporters and opponents.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

There's nothing like seeing all your careful work messed up when you generate a font (from FOG) and all the points are rounded to the nearest whole coordinate. It's better to work with the limitations of the coordinate system from the start than to pretent it doesn't exist. If you need finer coordinates, you can always use a larger em-square.\n\n"
