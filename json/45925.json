  "content": "Sorry for the unoriginal title. :( I’m looking for the name of this one font - it’s frustrating because I actually used to have it, until my computer’s hard drive went kaput (note to self: BACKUPS) and now I can’t remember what on earth it was called. I want to say it started with a “B”, but after browsing myfonts.com in the “B” category I didn’t see it. I might be thinking of another font though.\n\nAnyways, it was used as the price font (that indicated question dollar amounts) on “Who Wants to be a Millionaire” (it’s not Copperplate Gothic, trust me) and it’s used in the screenshot below of a sign on James Cameron’s Titanic set.\n\nThanks in advance, and sorry for the poor quality / small screenshots. You can see the lettering, mostly the distinctive “E”, in the Titanic set shot, as well as where it says “LIFELINES” in the Millionaire screenie.\n\nThank you! :D\n\nTitanic: [http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3981/fontgrabij0.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603021508/http:/img299.imageshack.us/img299/3981/fontgrabij0.jpg \"http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/3981/fontgrabij0.jpg\")  \nMillionaire: [http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1993/whowantstobeamillionairpu7.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603021508/http:/img138.imageshack.us/img138/1993/whowantstobeamillionairpu7.jpg \"http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1993/whowantstobeamillionairpu7.jpg\")\n\n [‹ House of 1000 Corpses / The Devil's Rejects](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603021508/http:/typophile.com/node/45926 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tech slab \"MADLIB: TIGHTLIPPED\" ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603021508/http:/typophile.com/node/45918 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
