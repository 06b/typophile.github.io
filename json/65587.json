The folders or files say read only in info and me and my boss are the only ones that use these files and we can't delete them from our shared folder. Neither my boss nor I can delete the folders. I think the clients that we got the files from locked them and now they are locked into the shared folder saying neither of us have privalages to delete them. Some say read only. What? How do I get them outta there? Any advice would be great.\n\n",
