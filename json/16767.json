As a major upgrade of its predecessor FontLab 4.6, FontLab Studio 5 is a comprehensive solution for font foundries, professional type designers, typographers and graphic design studios, allowing them to design type, create, manipulate and modify fonts. FontLab Studio 5 supports all major outline font formats, including Type 1, TrueType, Multiple Master and OpenType.\n\n“The major focus of this release has been put on in-context type design,” said Yuri Yarmola, Vice President R&D at Fontlab Ltd. and the application’s principal engineer. “Our new metrics and kerning editing environment adds a second dimension to the process of letterspacing by allowing the type designer to see the glyphs not only in a horizontal string but on a true two-dimensional page. The new neighbor and shape groups layers add another dimension to the process of glyph design by dynamically previewing related characters right in the glyph editing window.”\n\nAccording to Yarmola, practically every aspect of the application has been revised. “It was the users who shaped the development of the application. More than 90% of the changes in FontLab Studio 5 are based directly on customer feedback,” says Yarmola. The highlights of FontLab Studio 5 also include:\n\n-\\> new improved proofing and printing,  \n-\\> improved Bézier drawing tools,  \n-\\> integrated autotracing (formerly only available in ScanFont, a separate product),  \n-\\> improved font merging and blending,  \n-\\> better OpenType and Unicode support,  \n-\\> better autohinting,  \n-\\> improved Python scripting support\n\nAs well as hundreds of other improvements. FontLab Studio 5 retails at US$649.00 with attractive upgrade pricing available to users of previous versions as well as of Fontographer and TypeTool, the company’s other font editors.

My cat was having the biggest fun of his life.  \nThe VW Passat is the best buy for a family guy. Expensive buy but in the long run it is the best. Now, I sold out the Nissan 2 years ago and got myself on a VW New Beattle, it is ... lead color (silver) and it is a biggest fun on the highway, quick, smart and if you want to make a party, its got the best monsoon sound system, which I use very loud, mostly Opera!  \nAs for Fontlab, I waited and waited and waited until I got a second hand copy of Fog ( Macromedia Studio : 30 bucks ).\n\nLovin it !\n\nCheers\n\nAndré\n\nps.: [http://www.vw.com/newbeetle/en/us](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011045450/http:/www.vw.com/newbeetle/en/us \"http://www.vw.com/newbeetle/en/us\")\n\n"
