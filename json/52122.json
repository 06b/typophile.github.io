  "content": "Hi\n\nroundingUFO is available !!!\n\nRoundingUFO is a mac only application that converts the corners of the glyphs in your fonts according to user-defined parameters.\n\nIt automates the process yet lets you keep complete control as a designer. You determine the parameters: the black and the white corners. RoundingUFO doesn't mess around with your contours; the necessary points are added.\n\nWith RoundingUFO considerably speeds up the production process, without loss of quality. All UFO's generated with roundingUFO can be interpolated.\n\nAdditional features include: adding ink traps or simply cutting off the corners instead of adding rounding them.\n\ngo check it out [http://roundingufo.typemytype.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001545/http:/roundingufo.typemytype.com/)\n\nyours sincerely [Frederik](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001545/http:/www.typemytype.com/)\n\n",

      "content": "After playing around with it a bit, I really like what's going on. I'm afraid it might be a little oversimplified, but it does what it says it will do, and where I've found unexpected results it seems the fault lies in my design.\n\nIf I could suggest improvements:\n\nSliders are nice and simple, but it would be useful to be able to input numerical values too. Plus, it would be interesting (though probably not terribly useful) to see what happens when negative values are entered.\n\nExcept for the slider for the \"Ignore Short Segment\" feature. Unless I'm mistaken it seems to do nothing but turn the feature on and off, and the slider is not marked for which end is which, so it's hard to tell if it's on unless there is an affected corner in the design. That would be better served with a check box, unless the slider is doing something I'm not seeing.\n\nI would like to be able to apply different settings to specific corners, rather than the same ones to the whole font or glyph. Global settings have their place to make the effect consistent and quick, but massaging glyph by glyph, corner by corner is necessary after that.\n\nThere could be more ink trap shapes. As it is they come to a box end, but they could come to a point, a wedge, a rounded end, or a bulb, or possibly other options I haven't thought of.\n\nBut even as it stands, this is a great and useful accessory that I and I'm sure many others have been waiting for for a long time, and I am grateful it's being offered for free.\n\nThank you Frederik!\n\n"

Seems pretty incomplete now), but shouldn't that info be up in front for people like me with poor reading comprehension? Only on the \"order\" page of the site is the price or that the save feature is disabled mentioned.\n\nOn the front page is a big shiny \"download\" button, while the order and license links are discretely off to the side, with no mention that the download is a crippled demo, nor of the price for the full version.\n\n"

      "content": "hi\n\n\"I would like to be able to apply different settings to specific corners, ......\"  \nThat's not really possible, but you set different parameters for each glyph just by double clicking a glyph. Then you are able to store local parameters for that glyph instead of using the local ones. see the [documentation](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001545/http:/roundingufo.typemytype.com/documentation.html) :)\n\n\"Except for the slider for the “Ignore Short Segment” feature......\"  \nThis is \"deleting\" short segments which are shorter then the slider value. It only apply on really small segments otherwise your contour would be distorted too much.\n\non the [downloadpage](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001545/http:/roundingufo.typemytype.com/download.html) the second line links to the [order](http://web.archive.org/web/20130216001545/http:/roundingufo.typemytype.com/order.html)\n\n\"....But feature-disabled demonstrations must be clearly marked as such.\"  \nYou are right, I'm adding this now\n\nenjoy Frederik\n\n"
