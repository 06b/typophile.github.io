It can be used on its own, or as a compliment to Bromwich. Great Bromwich uses specially re-designed large and small capitals, to enable that bold headline statement to be made with impressive Edwardian flair. In the spirit of railway travel posters and illustrated news journals, its a wonderful font for poster design, or for book covers and other work with a period theme.\n\nThere are some examples of ‘Great Bromwich’ in action on its own and alongside the Bromwich family on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20120423184337/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\n",

The name 'Clementhorpe' is actually a roundabout hint of what chocolate was being advertised.\n\n"
