  "content": "No clue if this is absolute rubbish or not. I found an old Caslon specimen and thought about doing a monospace version of it. It seems like most monospace fonts out there are very boring, so I wanted to do one that has a much more pleasant feel. Did some sketches and I've digitized a few letters so far. I think Kris Sowersby's Pitch has inspired me, you can see some of it in the bracketing.  \nThoughts?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424141624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hello_6602.png)\n\nI wanted it to be very legible on-screen so it has a really tall x-height.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424141624im_/http:/typophile.com/files/helloz_4776.png)\n\nSome characters are pretty tricky. Anyone think this has potential or just isn't worth it?\n\n",

While you do on the |f| and |t|, I think it's lacking in the |r|. On some letters you may want to drop serifs entirely in parts. The |m| and |w| could really do without the serifs, I would venture to say. They are already crowded without them.\n\nThe |z| seems a little off to me with the angle of the serifs. But the feature is nice, if you use similar angle for some of the other serifs, that may be cool.\n\nLooks interesting, love to see where you go with it.\n\n"
