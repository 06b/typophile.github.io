      "content": "buenos. here's my two cents:   \n   \n-the uc & lc \"c\" seem top heavy. same problem is there with the lc \"e\" as well. if you were to extend the bottom line this could be avoided.   \n   \n-one thing i don't understand is why does the stem in lc \"u\" and \"y\" slope, and it doesn't exist on any other stems. i suggest that you put a slant on the top of the leg on the lc \"k\" and add a slant to the end of the hairline in the lc \"x.\"   \n   \n-the uc \"W\" just doesn't do it for me, same thing with the lc \"w.\" the lc \"w\" looks like it's 2 v's put together. try to integrate them more. the uc \"W\" looks funny with the extended line in the middle.   \n   \n-the stroke of the uc \"M\" and \"N\" seems too thick compared to the rest of your uc.   \n   \nI love your letter forms. They're all very light and airy. It's going to look great with just a little bit of tweaking. I hope that my terminology was correct ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414194652im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nt1mmy\n\n"

I think structurally you're almost finished, but there are still some issues of curve smoothness, alignment (like probably make the curved leg of the \"n\" go lower), the spacing (seems a bit irregular) and I think it should have a little bit more stroke contrast. Maybe. :-/   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
