Trying to license fonts on some sort of per-use basis makes business much more complicated, and then means less time drawing letters, which is not something that interests a lot of type designers. But with the web it suddenly becomes much easier to work with a service that charges per-use in some way and cuts users off if they don’t pay. Catching infringers is infinitely easier because someone can just create a spider that looks for your fonts and automatically alerts a lawyer to send out a cease-and-desist-or-pay-me order.\n\nAnd font designers deserve the money. Users are buying this stuff because it allows them to make more money. Designers don’t usually go out of their way to sell their services at the lowest possible cost just because the clients would like that. Likewise, we should be looking for every angle to make a buck. I’m not in this because I want to be Saint James who helped spread literacy to the downtrodden with cheap type. I do it because I want my passion to pay for vacations in Provence.\n\n"

In my mind, given that, the license should be URL specific . . .\n\nTaking that further, getting back to the technology piece, yes, a font could be rented (Typekit) and yes, a font (all webfont assets) could be purchased or given away (Font Squirrel) for a one time fee . . .\n\nI personally agree with James that URL binding is an important piece of this puzzle because we don't want to DRM fonts, but we want to do what we can to assure they're being used in accordance with the license that is being sold for this use . . .\n\nAnd to Ethan's point, his preference is that the fonts are owned by the designer and they, like all current desktop users should be on the honesty system and can use them on any site under their control . . .\n\nThe designer is an agent of the client and even if they license fonts on the clients behalf to do design work, even for web work, ultimately I don't feel you can license a font to a designer who can use the font for other projects and implement the same @ font-face kit for each client's site they work on which is why I think URL binding means the font is purchased PER project and PER client as it's needed . . .\n\nBeyond that, I don't think there is really much more to it . . .\n\n"

      "content": "(I'm going to risk making Richard scream. Sorry, Richard. I can't think of a better word for it.)\n\nTo me, the \"rental\" model (e.g., Typekit), is a desirable alternative to the \"purchase\" model we've had up until now. Whether it's viable remains to be seen, but I'm hopeful.\n\nWhen I tell non-type people that I make fonts, they always say something like, \"So, does that mean you get paid whenever your font is used in an ad or a book or whatever?\" When I tell them it doesn't work that way, that I get paid the same royalty whether my font is used in an ad seen by millions of people or a birthday party invitation seen by a dozen, they are surprised. I think a lot of people who \"steal\" fonts do so because they want to use them for personal projects and don't think it's fair that should they have to pay the same price for fonts as professional users.\n\nThe reason the \"purchase\" model has been used is partly historical, going back to when fonts were only bought by typesetting shops. But it's also because there's been no practical way to measure how much a font is used. Can you imagine keeping track of your font usage and sending reports to foundries and paying licensing fees based on that?\n\nHowever, when you serve fonts on the web, you can put a meter on usage. This could (and should) lead to fairer pricing for font users. Plus, I think this is a model that is easier for users to understand because it's based on how much they use a font, not simply whether they have it on their computer or not. It puts font licenses on a sliding scale, instead of the current all or nothing situation. Musicians often make more from live performances than from CDs or MP3 sales. The \"rental\" model would, in effect, be like live performances for fonts.\n\nI don't think the \"rental\" model will replace the \"purchase\" model (it doesn't work at all for desktop fonts), but I think that, like markets for other goods and services, there is room for both. Not everyone chooses to buy movies on DVD. Most people are happy to rent. The \"rental\" model simply hasn't been an option for fonts.\n\n"

      "content": "And not to sidetrack this discussion, but I think that this is another part of some other discussions that are going on about rights-managed type sales. I’ve been advocating rights managed type since I realized how hard it can be for design students to afford to buy contemporary type for their projects. In the last six months web font services have eliminated that problem for at one area of design. The same can be said for freelancers, small design firms, and their small business clients who want great type but are better off amortizing type costs across subscription fees. In the next year PLINC will be able to do something similar for display type used on physical mediums.\n\nThe benefits of this seem pretty huge to me. Small design businesses are going to have access to oodles of fonts other than what they get with their copy of Type Odyssey. As font designers we get ripped off less and make more money by spreading lots of small transactions across people who would otherwise have just used another classic face on projects with tight budgets. I think that will translate to more cool new ideas because we don’t have to worry so much about people not buying really risky fonts that push the boundaries of form and technology but have to cost an arm and a leg with the existing, mostly royalty-free licenses.\n\n"

Tiny bottles of perfume sell for hundreds of dollars. Someone sees a value in it and are willing to pay.  \nThe question is - does the customer see the font as adding to the bottom line or is it just a nicety and another font - perhaps free - will do just as well. To me, how much I use a font means nothing. But that's me. Plus, extra visitors does not necessarily translate into commercial success. Just more visitors. Figuring out how to make money on the net is hard enough as it is without allowing yet another entity to get at my checkbook. Fonts are not just out there competing with other fonts, they are out there competing with other things that sites must have.  \nSo there's the inevitable comparisons - my Apache web server software is a hell of a lot more complicated than a font, and it's free. Wordpress, free. PHP, free. And I can always stick with system fonts and continue to spruce up my pages with text as images as I've always done. I don't know who would see the value in renting a font on a sliding scale. I just don't know. But it's a big world. I suppose Typekit, if they share the info, will help the type industry find this out.\n\nI'm not even going to try to predict.\n\n@diner  \nI sent you a message on your contact form.\n\n@James Puckett\n\nWhat do you mean by rights-managed type sales?\n\n"

Royalty-free stock means that once you’ve paid for the stock photos you can use them for just about anything short of pornography, in any quantity, without paying more. Rights-managed images are priced based on nature of use, quantity of reproduction, and how many years you plan to keep reproducing an image. If you just want to use a rights-managed photo on ten coffee cups you pay relatively little. For an annual report with a print run of 25,000 you pay more. And for a book cover with an initial print run of 250,000 that might be reprinted five times you pay through the nose.\n\nTo me a rights-managed approach makes much more sense for type designers and users.\n\n"

I doubt that they will. I think that this is probably because designers, and even moreso their clients, have a really hard time wrapping their head around the difference between a font licensed for static content creating and a font licensed for dynamic content rasterization on multiple computers. They don’t even like buying more than one license for the entire business, even if they have 10,000 employees. So getting them to pay $30 per font for one web site that uses six fonts and will get completely redesigned in two years doesn’t seem likely to me.\n\nTo me licensing each font for $5 or $10 a year, per-font, per-site seems like a better option. Or to do what Typotheque does; charging more for no limit on the number of sites/server a font can be used on but requiring clients to own their own licenses and charging for excessive bandwidth consumption.\n\n"

It's not like one is inherently better than the other, it just depends on what works best for your needs and how much you're willing or able to deal with the technical details.\n\nI think we'll see the same sort of thing with web fonts.\n\nAnother thing to think about: Are you prepared to do technical support for users who can't figure out how to get your fonts working on their websites in different browsers?\n\n"

He keeps saying, \"I'm just a simple man asking simple questions.\" And through asking his series of \"simple\" questions he saves his son's life by finding an effective treatment for a debilitating and ultimately fatal disease. A disease that, beyond a diagnosis, has the top medical people completely stumped.  \nIt's a good model to follow. (Argh! I said it again!)  \nI'm actually a little stunned. What you're suggesting is an approach that the retail font folks have treated like the plague.\n\nBut why don't you try it and see? If the fonts on diner are all under your control you could do a split run and see what happens. Start a new site that, on the same site, offers a choice between a web friendly presentation and the typical print oriented presentation.\n\nExcuse me for waxing philosophical but...  \nFor awhile, right out of college, I sold a line of big ticket, luxury items. High-pressure sales that demanded you to be a hard closer. During orientation by the regional sales manager he told us something that I never forgot: You can say anything to a prospective customer as long as you say it with a smile. It's true. Whatever happened to asking nicely? And saying \"Thanks for your order\"?  \nAre these things considered old fashioned or unnecessary?  \nRecently I bought a font from a major font design studio and did not even receive a thank you email. Nothing. That's never happened before. Quite the opposite actually.  \nI bought a font from TypeCulture and not only got a thank you email but actually got a little something in the mail, too. I will very much remember where I was treated as a welcome customer and where I wasn't.  \nWhenever I get the feeling that a company feels like they're doing me a favor by selling me something, if it's not too late, I walk. And then, as long as I can help it, I won't be back. The reverse is true, too.\n\nIf you were to organize your site the right way - font squirrel is certainly a good model but you'll probably want to make some changes to protect your fonts from casual download. And then create a friendly atmosphere and ask nicely and follow up appreciatively.

Unfortunately, if I spend a lot of time on free fonts discussions, I'll be raising my prices. Nevertheless, I think this much is worth every penny.\n\nOne primary concern of mine at the beginning of mass market DTP was to ensure that the bottom of the price market was well covered by free and very high quality fonts in the form of OS and application bundles. I think this was accomplished with the help of OS and app developers, and that same effort leaped to web fonts where some of the same bundled defaults have served the web for the last 15 years.\n\nOne of my primary concerns _now_, at 'the beginning' of web fonts, is to establish the position of the bottom of the price market. So, I'd like to introduce you to the [EPAR](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310203941/http:/www.eeulaa.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49:recommendations-data-fields&catid=27:personalization&Itemid=59), where the field is being leveled for all font developers by an openly published and developable table that will make it possible for non-commercial font folk to have an effective database of font information without developing the kinds of proprietary databases most commercial font developers have.\n\nI hope the \"free font\" and \"f\\*\\*k the foundries\" activists take this new table very seriously, get involved in the final definition of this table, and then take full advantage of this table by working diligently to turn those heaps of unknown typographic quality into a much more useful heap, perhaps... putting FontSquirrel out of business, but I hope not.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

It’s not like font designers are the music or movie industries trying to get teenagers to pay for one license to subscribe to some music, another license to get the same music as a ringtone, another for their music games, etc. Fonts are serious tools for serious businesses. The cost of url-bound font license should be paid by the client just as the cost of server hosting, CMS systems, etc. For businesses shifting their ad budgets from print to digital the cost of font rentals is probably going to be irrelevant to executives who are patting themselves on the back for all the paper they aren’t buying anymore.

We've had a very good feedback, but it will be interesting to see how the sales will be on a longer term (and not just the short term affected by the hype). From the webfonts sales that we had, the most interesting thing is that it was people who never bought fonts before. We offer a possibility of webfonts also for a clients who licensed desktop fonts earlier, but that was little used so far.\n\nWe've worked on the webfonts solution since March, so had plenty of time to think about the licensing terms. We decided to go with a model, that I as a customer would feel most comfortable - that is as close to possible to one time costs. There is a one time licence fee, but because bandwidth costs money, we had to introduce a monthly limit (500MB per used font, per month, for free). So if you buy a package of 6 fonts, you get 3GB for free, which is a bandwidth of a serious site. Another possibility that we considered, was to give fonts for free, but user paying for bandwidth from the first hit. We decided against it, because it was a lot more unpredictable.\n\nI think there is plenty of room for other alternatives, so I am very curious to see other developments.\n\nPeter  \n [http://www.typotheque.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310203941/http:/www.typotheque.com/ \"http://www.typotheque.com\")\n\n"

One response was that Linux system support would happen. If/when OS support emerges, then we are that much closer to WOFF being the equivalent of any other desktop font -- and avoiding that is one of the main reasons for the web font format debate in the first place.\n\n"

It just happens that Typekit chose a rental model and they have the most traction right now. There _will_ be other mechanisms and license models. The smart foundries won't settle for just one model. They'll cater to the broad range of customers with different needs.\n\nMark Simonson said perfectly everything else I was going to say about the topic. The market for fonts is expanding to users who would never have licensed fonts before. Foundries need to be open to new ways of reaching these new customers. It's an exciting time to be in the business.\n\n"

It's fair, easy, scalable, and has endured for twenty years because it serves everyone equally well. News organizations license fonts for thousands of computers, small businesses license them for a couple, individuals for just one. The market has been very effective in determining prices (despite Ethan's cryptic comment above.)\n\nWhat hosted solutions offer is this same promise for the web, where \"traffic\" is the standard unit of measure. Hosting offers a reliable way to meet different levels of use, far more effectively and reliably than any kind of single-price (or tiered-price) solution. Surely we want to make it possible for everyone to use our fonts, not only major corporations but small businesses, non-profits, and individuals as well?\n\n"

And I'm not sure there is a whole lot more I could add, especially considering Mark Simonson's excellent note about the rental business. Mark was one of the first designers we worked with at Typekit, and I always appreciate his openness and clarity.\n\nI guess my ultimate reaction is this: It's early. Very early. Browsers supporting font linking have only been in circulation for a matter of months. The most successful brands on the web have been around only a handful of years. Even the most seasoned web designer has a bit more than a decade of professional experience. How will this all come together? How will individual web site owners and giant corporations make use of webfonts? I can't begin to guess.\n\nOne of the reasons we started working on the Typekit idea was to try a bunch of stuff and look for answers. Some of our customers like the idea of subscribing to a library of fonts and trying lots of alternatives in their designs. Other customers have commissioned fonts and are eager to finally use them online. And there's a whole group of our customers aren't even interested in choosing fonts -- they just want cooler looking blog templates.\n\nWhich one of these methods will win? Probably no single one, or perhaps something we haven't even thought of yet. But it seems like now is the time to experiment and iterate, so that's what we're trying to do.\n\n"

The reason it's a question for foundries is that today, users do not in fact have the option of buying for web font usage. They may very well want to, but foundries have generally been unwilling to go there (with the notable exception of Ascender).\n\n<cite>Also, what constitutes the “volume” of the site?</cite>\n\nThere are many different ways one could measure it, and the folks renting or selling the font licenses can pick whichever suits them. TypeKit uses the bandwidth of font downloads.\n\n<cite>\"And why should site owners see a connection between what it costs them to use a font and the “volume” of the site?\"</cite>\n\nWhy shouldn't they? If they're large they are paying for their bandwidth usage in other ways. Cloud computing services charge based on volume in various ways. And, what James said. :)\n\nOf course the question of what will happen ultimately depends on \\*both\\* the buyer and the seller. I expect that we'll find that some users are willing to \"rent\" and that some are not. I expect that we will see both service and sales models that are successful. It's a big world out there, and I believe there's room for several vendors to make a go of it.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Make fonts part of the hosting bill and the fear is gone. Seems like it would make sense to offer embedded fonts right from the control panel, and bundle the billing in the hosting package. How big would the audience be if a typekit/typotheque style solution was offered Fantastico style? As a web designer I'm used to a fee-for-traffic solution. I expect it in that context. My clients all expect to pay $xxx monthly for web hosting, and if we go over our bandwidth, we pay. Just like a cell phone. Just like Peter's font hosting model.

If your site is pulling enough traffic that it could bring down one of these services, that's not going to make you, nor the service very happy.\n\nHowever, a good counterpoint was brought up in that if you are running a site of that size, you already are likely outsourcing a lot of your file hosting...your jQuery is on Google, your images on are on CDN, your DBs are on a farm. Etc. So that perhaps isn't as critical of an issue as one may thing at first.
