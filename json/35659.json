Goodhue to design the prototype in 1896 for Ingalls Kimball at the Cheltenham Press. Six years later Morris Fuller Benton at ATF developed it into the design and then the series that we know today.“Owing to certain eccentricities of form,” writes Updike, <strong>“it cannot be read comfortably for any length of time.” </strong>But he concludes: “It is, however, an exceedingly handsome letter for ephemeral printing.” Mergenthaler bought composing machine rights to the original design c.1896, but bought the Benton design in 1904.</cite>\n\njust wondering are you sure about Cheltenham. It looks good to me but, I am not an expert on such matters.\n\n<cite>Here is another case where Frutiger would work. Also, consider Myriad Pro, which has multiple options. Both are easy to read and are soft to the eye.</cite>\n\ni thought that two sans were not to be used together. Is this not correct?\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nI know I am in my own little world, but its ok.
