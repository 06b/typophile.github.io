We never showed him to do this, but he does it every time. I think it’s cool that he has chosen to do this and am very thankful that his teacher hasn’t decided to “correct” it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192440im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/connor_6171.jpg)\n\n [‹ Pairing Lubalin Graph with…](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192440/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39292 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Letterpress Workshops? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203192440/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39156 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
