      "content": "I really like it, though it all seems just a bit too wide for my taste...  \nSome letters remind me of Jeremy Tankard's Aspect, and maybe that's why I can't help feeling like there's something missing on the lowercase D, especially on the regular version. Recently I visited Hubert Jocham's site and this lowercase G – which I love – reminds me of his lowercase Gs, which are always refreshing (though I also don't like them all).\n\nI agree with Christian on the 1, N and L, and would probably add the M to that, since those things hanging on the top left of the letters seem too long (I don't know what to call those \"things\"... help me out, here!). This is especially noticeable on the regular version, too.\n\nAnd about the I... are the top serifs pulled to the left on purpose?\n\nrubenD\n\nedit: well, maybe not the M... I guess the slant of its legs compensates for the length of that thing which I don't know what to call because I really need to pay more attention to the vocabulary!\n\n"

      "content": "It's growing on me! I should stop looking at it! :P Those things are kind of blending in...\n\nBeing picky, but maybe the stroke on the S should be just a little bit thicker on the middle... the bottom part of the curve seems like it's almost going upwards for a moment, there.\n\n"
