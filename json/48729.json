  "content": "Hello lads. New to the forum, although I've been reading for a little while.\n\nAnyway. I'm working on a logo for the little graphic & web design business I have.\n\nThe name of the business comes from Norway, as it was originally ment to only have clients locally, but as I've started with my studies I'm going to apply to jobs and hopefully have clients internationally. \"Piraja\" means \"Piranha\".\n\nI'm satisified with the mark and the typography, but the reason I'm asking for feedback is because this whole process has taken me many months, and the mark and the typography came in my mind last night. So I want some objective feedback from someone who has never seen it.\n\nI'm most happy with the mark and the colors in 3 and 5, they are the same expect I've added a line of text with my name in 3.\n\nPlease help me out with this, any feedback is appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010215056im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ps_3500.png)\n\n",

Shouldn't it be round, or clearer that its the fish's head - like 1 and 4?\n\nI love the colours, and i'd seriously consider using different combinations of the three colours in your comms rather than settling on just one.\n\nI like the type too - i think it works well in combination with the mark. Don't put your name there too as in 3, whats the point? What does it add? Seems to make the Piraja Studio name redundant and adds complexity to a lovely and simple logo.\n\n"

      "content": "David: You've seen right, the right hand side for the mark is flat, and although it might seem like a mistake – it's not. It's part of the fish bones, a new one that is sticking up and I thought it added a little personality to it, because it's not a perfect circle, and I've worked hours on the fish bone illustration as well, adding it alot of detail when you really zoom in. The feedback you are giving is great though, because I was also afraid that it would look like a mistake. Perhaps I should either make it more clear that it's a detail, or make the cirle perfectly round.\n\n"

It has a nice simple feel to it.\n\nPerhaps you may want to zoom out a tad so that the shape of the fish is a bit more apparent. Not a whole lot, but just enough so that the mark won't be confused with a coffee bean, as I'm seeing in 2, 3, 5 & 6. (especially 6 with the coloring)\n\nGood work so far, can't wait to see how it turns out.\n\npenn\n\n"

I think I'd rather go safe with 1, then \"add\" another one, with it being easily misunderstood.\n\nDavM: I've experimented a little with this idea, which is great btw. It's a problem though as the piranha has eyes very close to the mouth, which makes the eye not even visible when the head is being cut off like it is in the logo.\n\nAlthough this is a logo I'll continue to work on, I might not even need it at the moment. In not many months I'll be applying for several internships and showing off my portfolio, making it useless to apply as a company called \"Piraja Studio\", it seems alot better to apply as a person, using my full name. I might consider using the mark though, as I'm really happy with the way it's going.\n\nI'll give you a version with my name in it instead, so you can come with feedback on the new typography!\n\nAgain, thanks alot - you're all great!\n\n"
