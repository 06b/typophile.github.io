A German punchcutter, Johann Christian Bauer, designed it in 1850. Digital versions are available from various foundries. Your image differs from the usual version of Fette Fraktur\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017135810im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FetteFrakturInUse1_4733.jpg)\n  \nmainly in the substitution of a Latinized S, clipping the tails on I and Y, clipping the back-flip on O, and rounding the comb-over effect on the bowl of R.  \nI would be interested to learn if anyone knows whether this edit has been released as a font.  \nDon \n"
