  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nIn the absence of the typographic knowledge to edit a font, what should a designer look for in a great typeface? How do you evaluate if it sets well? Are there specific combinations of characters or words you set it in to evaluate its wordspacing, spaces around punctuation marks, etc? Can you give examples of faces that set well (ie. need little or no adjustment) and ones that don't?   \n   \nThanks in advance, everyone.\n\n",
