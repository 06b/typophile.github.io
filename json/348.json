The Aristos Academy.   \n   \nWas hoping to get some suggestions for typefaces from that particluar era (384-322 BC)   \n   \nAny and all feedback would be much appreciated.   \n   \nThanks!\n\n",

(And actually, Trajan is Roman-inspired. Just saying.)   \n   \nThe centaur image is strong -- I think it should dominate. The Greek-looking type really takes away from the potential power of the centaur. I think, looking at the Trajan variation, the type should be about 60% of its current size. I would suggest using a classic-inspired family -- [Centaur](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211321/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/centaur/), perhaps? Just a little joke, but it is a nice typeface. Bears a couple of similarities to Trajan but is actually a full family and can provide you with a lot of flexibility for the myriad applications a school logo will engender.\n\n"

The masculinity implied by Sophia (even with that name) overpowers the conservative Trajan. Trajan seems to obvious. If the Sophia is too liberal, perhaps Centaur might be nice. And Mr. Dave's comment concerning flexibility is correct.   \n   \nAlthough, Centaur is no more Greek than is Trajan.   \n   \n ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010211321im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
