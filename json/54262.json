  "content": "hello\n\ngood morning or good afternoon.. :)\n\nThis is an advertisement I did for our company.. It is the first I ever did.\n\nIt will be a series of ADs that uses the SB to take shapes of the company properties.\n\nSo, what do you think? I would like to make a portfolio so I can apply for some companies and i would like to show the best.\n\nlooking forward to your suggestions...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sbholdingAD.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030701/http:/typophile.com/files/sbholdingAD_0.pdf) | 534.1 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "hmmm  \nnot sure if people will get the property shapes.  \nFor me it just looks odd...  \nI've had a look at swiss bahrain's website.  \nIt seems the colours and fonts are different  \nto your ad and the icon is stretched.  \nMight be a good idea to check their brand guidelines.\n\nPersonally I think your ad needs some more work.  \nWhat do you want to communicate? And what elements  \nare supporting your message? In your case your saying  \n\"apartments for rent\", so for me it would be important  \nto see more about those apartments rather than  \nthe shape of the building.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi, Agostini\n\nthe SB Holding has 5 departments, every department has a different colour  \nthe SB properties colour is the one i used, while the holding colour is what you saw on the website.  \nAnd i dont know how it appeard to you.. it should be closed!! :)\n\nthe icon is streched because my illustrator doesnt support arabic, and there should be an arabic line above the english.\n\nAha.. So you want to see something more related to apartments... like a picture of an apartment?\n\nI'll try... thnx\n\n"
