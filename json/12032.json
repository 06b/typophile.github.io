The [foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000537/http:/typophile.com/wiki/foundry) operates as an independent studio, collaborating with its partners in various disciplines whenever necessary.\n\nMRF has accelerated its type design efforts since 2004. This will continue, along with advertising and graphic design work. In most cases, their typefaces are available from a variety of quality vendors: [Fountain Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000537/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fountain%20Type%20Foundry), [PsyOps Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000537/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PsyOps%20Type%20Foundry), and [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20150205000537/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer). In the future, a unique collection of typefaces will be available exclusively through MRF.\n\nMRF also specializes in custom type design. They can customize existing designs or create original typefaces for a variety of uses, such as corporate branding.\n\n",
