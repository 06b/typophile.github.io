Until I saw this, I didn't think there was a digital version. As you can see, I am only 5 letters shy of a complete uppercase. (Missing J, Q, V, X, Z.)\n\nI found this, but the rough edges don't work for me.  \n [http://www.archivetype.com/Latest/Archive-Thermo-Announcement.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804042255/http:/www.archivetype.com/Latest/Archive-Thermo-Announcement.html \"http://www.archivetype.com/Latest/Archive-Thermo-Announcement.html\")\n\nThe attached letters come from a piece of art, so there is a possibility that the artist custom-created them. (The artist is unavailable to ask directly.) I'm hoping htere is a commercial font out there.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!\n\n~Sean\n\n",

If this is an 'interpretation' then they took a lot of liberties with the original.\n\nA similar font that does exist in digital form is [Hollywood Deco](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804042255/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/hollywood-deco-sg/) (also an ATF typeface, from 1932, a year after Thermotype).\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The designer working with the file that has these letters outlined says Illustrator asks for \"Thermo 300\" every time she opens it.\n\nThanks for the Hollywood Deco link, it is close but not quite it.\n\n"
