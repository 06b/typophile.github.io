Well, I did just that, and would very much like to read your comments.\n\nI still have to design the cover and check the whole thing from beginning to end for messed up bits of text etc, but other than that the book is finished -- I think...\n\nI would especially welcome comments on:\n\n- page and text block format, size and proportions (page is A5, a convenient format in Europe and many other parts of the world);\n- appropriateness of typefaces (Quadraat for text, Quadraat Sans for chapter titles, Poetica for poem on p. 106);\n- size and placement of chapter titles and chapter numbers;\n- optical alignment of left margins;\n- ragged right margins;\n- size and placement of illustrations (I resized most illustrations so they would fit my design);\n- kerning problems (I edited the kerning tables of both Quadraat and Quadraat Sans to improve the fit of comma + single-quote, comma + double-quote, single-quote + several letters [indicating elision], and a few more pairs).\n- running footers (of which I'm not very fond -- they kind of mess up the text block to page proportions);\n\nAny other comments are also very welcome, of course.\n\nI'm making two press-quality PDFs available: [one with single pages](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025659/http:/erikf.net/portfolio/aaiw/aaiw_pages.pdf), [the other with spreads](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025659/http:/erikf.net/portfolio/aaiw/aaiw_spreads.pdf) (better to examine design).\n\n----------\n\n**Important update**\n\nIf you are new to this thread, please read about the latest revision [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025659/http:/typophile.com/node/27817/155399) before posting comments.\n\nQuick links to latest revision:\n\n- [Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025659/http:/erikf.net/portfolio/aaiw/aaiw_spreads_r2.pdf)\n- [Covers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025659/http:/erikf.net/portfolio/aaiw/aaiw_covers.pdf)\n\n",

      "content": "You asked, so here goes...\n\nPost-modern design (and type) has its place, but I'm not sure it's appropriate for a Victorian novel -- even if the novel is a little \"off.\" Your layout is good, but it makes it look like a textbook rather than familiar fiction.\n\nRunning headers, or in this case footers, are little more than dressing. Most people know what book they are reading. They are a tradition in American book typography, much less so in British. It's not an offensive practice, I'm just philosophically opposed to it. Page numbers are sufficient.\n\nIf you are going with running footers, it's ok to use them on the first pages of chapers. Headers usually interfere with the title of a chaper, which is why they are omitted. If your page numbers are at the foot of a page, it's fine to number your chapter openings (it's also useful).\n\nJustified type is easier to read in long stretches, which is why all prose books are formatted in this way. There was a movement to set books RR in the early 20th century -- Eric Gill's book was one of the first to push for this \"innovation.\" It never caught on, and for good reason: it's tiring to read. Even though setting justified type poses it's own set of problems for the typesetter, it is nearly always preferable to RR or RL.\n\nYour bastard title is leaded too wide. It's ONE title, and should appear as such.\n\nOn the title page, the Illustrator should appear closer to the author's name, and the publisher should appear at the bottom.\n\nChapters do NOT have to always be on the right. It is an absurd waste of good paper.\n\nYou have generally integrated the illustrations with the text quite well. I will point out the the illustration on page 53 is not well-handled. I know how it was originally placed on the page, top to bottom. You should probably at least flow the text down the left side of it, and perhaps bring it to the top of the page.\n\nPlacing the illustration for chaper 7 at the bottom of the page of chaper 6 is akward. You should bring it over to page 58.\n\nI don't like the way the insets for \"Father William\" dance all over the pages. Also, the poem should begin right after \"Alice folded her hands, and began:\" Instead you've placed an illustration in that spot.\n\nYou should use kerned lining figures for the chaper openings instead of oldstyle figures. OS figures SHOULD be used within text, but by themselves it makes your chapter numbers look like they are set in two different sizes. It looks like a mistake.\n\nYour chapters begin with a drop cap, which is fine, but when they are accompained by an open quote you should reduce the size of the quote mark.\n\nAll those swashes in the last poem? What possessed you? They are distracting. And where did the page numbers go on this spread?\n\nLine length/type size/leading are good and balanced.\n\nI have not checked your line breaks, spacing, etc. This critique was just for the layout. Hope this was helpful.\n\n"

I've never been a fan but in particular think you could choose either a very simple and elegant period font or something with more whimsy. I don't think the sans is suited to the material. Particularly don't like it for the chapter number.\n\nAgree the text should be justified. I think the drop cap is a little dull. I'd either give it more presence or eliminate it. Have you considered running an opening line or phrase in small caps? That might give it an old fashioned feel.\n\nThink you give too much space around the running foot. I'd lower it and add a line or two of text or else put more margin at top. I see no reason for the left running foot to be the book title (have NEVER understood that convention). I'd put the chapter title on both, or perhaps the folio only on one and the title on the other?\n\nAgree you don't need to start chapters only on the recto.\n\nPage 12 - why not rag the type around the image as in other places?\n\nAgree re page 53 - move pic to top of page.\n\nHate the Poetica.\n\n"

You cannot allow a computer to break your lines for you.\n\nA book for very young children should not be hypenated, of course, but AAIW is not for little kids, it's approrpiate for children 11-12 (and adults!). Judiciously hypenated texts will not pose a problem for children this age.\n\nI read extensively, and I have to say that reading RR text is very taxing in long stretches. Probably just as taxing as reading text set in Linotype Didot. If you are publishing, say, an art book compristed mainly of photos or illustrations flanked by commentary, RR would not be a problem. It's fine in cookbooks too. Long prose, chapters, short stories, or novels should really be set justified.\n\nGo to a book store or library. Find a novel set RR. Good luck.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you all so very much for your feedback. And I still hope to read more comments from other people.\n\nFor now, I'd like to explain why I did certain things. My intention is not to say \"I know what I'm doing\", but to explain my reasoning so that you can see where I'm coming from and tell me why you think I'm wrong.\n\n(a) I chose Quadraat because I think it's a pretty good text face, and it's also quite quirky, which I felt matched the mood of the text. Also, I don't own a large number of typefaces, and wanted to try and make do with what I already had (considering this is primarily an exercise).\n\nMy other choice was Esprit, which I quite like and which would probably suit the text even better, but the version I have (Adobe's) doesn't have text figures and that pretty much killed the esprit.\n\n(b) I agree that Quadraat Sans doesn't look quite right, but I was trying to put little touches here and there to make the book look a little less 18th century for modern audiences. I'll probably ditch it.\n\n(c) I don't like the running footers (see my original post), but felt I'd go with convention. The vast majority of the books I own (including some on book design!) have running headers or footers. But in light of your feedback, I'll be more than happy to do away with the footers.\n\n(d) I went with ragged right because from everything I've read (including His Eminence Robert Bringhurst) RR is a good choice for anything that's not too formal. I personally also find it kind of strange, but I decided to stick with it, maybe learn a new trick. Was not aware of any scientific research about readability of justified v. RR.\n\n(d) I'm all for saving paper, but wanted to give the book an airier feel, which is why I started every chapter on a recto. Guess that was a bad idea...\n\n(e) The use of Poetica with all those extravagant swashes was completely deliberate. I've known this poem by heart ever since I saw a Dutch film (I think) called Malpertuis ages ago, and to me its dreamy and romantic mood called for something over the top. My main concern is if it's too dissonant in relation to the rest of the book.\n\n(f) All illustrations are aligned either within the margins of the text block or to a \"blind margin\" (just made up this term) near the fore-edge and/or the tail. That's why illustrations on versos are placed to the left of the text and so the text running around them is aligned (not ragged left, which would be absurd). Placing illustrations towards the spine would break the balance of the page, especially because the wider margins are fore-edge and tail.\n\n(g) There's little space at the top because I chose to fit a golden mean (proportions between text block height and width) inside an A5; top and spine margins are the same, as are fore-edge and tail.\n\nAgain, I'm not defending myself; if anyone disagrees with anything I said, please show me the error of my ways. And if I didn't comment on a specific suggestion someone made, it's probably because I completely agree with it and cannot think of a reason not to implement it.\n\n"

If you were designing the book for a US publisher you'd be using em dashes.\n\nAesthetics aside, I don't think they should be used interchangeably since the type of info they convey is different.

I do also, but nobody is going to listen to me.\n\nBringhurst is not 'out of his depth'. He understands the issue very well, but he is not going to change American practice. But the Matthew Carter practice of 3/4 em dash with built-in spaces to the em is exactly a compromise between the Brit & US methods. I think it will take over gradually in the US, subversively.\n\nPatty, in British style the n dash is used without spaces for 9-5 --but with spaces for asides. So the difference is preserved.\n\nThough I like the Carter solution, in my view the whole thing doesn't matter that much so long as you are consistent.\n\n"

As communicators -- and I'm using that term in the broadest sense -- it is also incumbent upon us to make things as clear as possible, and frequently, that means adhering to styles that we may find run counter to accepted norms. Most of my working life has been spent in Canada, and I can tell you that \"Canadian Style\" is a terrible mish-mash. Mostly British spellings (except for here in Alberta) with American rules (except in parts of Ontario and Atlantic Canada), at least for English. We won't even consider Quebec!\n\nNick: Since I'm frequently both, it's an internal dialogue I have all the time. I rarely fiddle with kerning unless it's something blatantly awful. Horizontal scaling I might tweak, but only if I'm working with justified text that just \\*has\\* to fit on the page.\n\nBut 9 times out of 10, I'd probably find an editorial solution and keep the aesthetics.\n\nBut that's me....\n\nLinda\n\n"

I think Esprit matches Quadraat pretty well in terms of general architecture and colour. Let me know if you think I'm crazy.\n- Tried breaking title as Greg suggested but both alternatives looked bad. Saw that a large number of the books I own, including several on design and typography, don't have titles broken logically, so at least I'll have plenty of company in book design hell.\n- Chapters now start on a new page, not necessarily a recto.\n- Text now wraps around illustrations on versos, something I decided to try but am not entirely happy with.\n- Chapter numbers are not actual lining figures, but small cap figures, because the version of Quadraat I have doesn't come with lining figures.\n- Mouse tale/tail is now in Quadraat (not Sans), but I'd already spent hours on end trying to produce something easier to read without any success. Let people turn the book around -- it'll be fun...\n- Added a foreword.\n- Now that chapters start on rectos or versos, book is 110 pages long, six pages short of the ideal 116, which would be seven signatures of sixteen pages. Could try and reduce it to 108 pages so it would add up to nine signatures of twelve pages, though this doesn't seem to be a common signature size.\n\nLink to revised version: [http://erikf.net/portfolio/aaiw/aaiw\\_spreads\\_r1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014025659/http:/erikf.net/portfolio/aaiw/aaiw_spreads_r1.pdf)\n\n"

If some of my comments sound a bit ironic or sarcastic, it's just my sense of humour, not an attempt at \"fighting back\".\n\nConsidering that the book supposedly starts with the introductory poem, which tells the story of how Dodgson went on a boat ride with three girls and told them a story etc etc etc, would you have me start that poem on a recto, or skip the verso that follows it and start the first chapter on the following recto? (If you make me start the first chapter on a recto, I'll wring your virtual neck, because all the pages will move from recto to verso and vice-versa, and I'll have to spend a few more hours re-positioning illustrations.)\n\n`It is possible to fit All in a Golden Afternoon on one page?
