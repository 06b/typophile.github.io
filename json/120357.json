  "content": "Homeowners need to replace the roof on a house once it reaches a certain age, has sustained significant storm damage, or is becoming too costly to repair. Since 30 percent of a home's visual appeal comes from the type of roof it has, it's important to make the right selection and hire a professional roofing company or contractor. [whitepages louisville ky](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403140238/http:/roofingcontractorslouisville.kinja.com/researching-roofers-for-roofing-services-1643780020?rev=1412775771126) are familiar with the damage that heavy storms and extensive wear and tear can take on a roof's shingles. The roof's function is to give a home an extra layer of protection from the elements, so it's crucial to address any problems immediately.\n\nA problem doesn't necessarily have to exist to warrant a full roof replacement. Roofs wear out after so many years. A typical lifespan for a residential roof is between fifteen and seventeen years. Look for roofers in Louisville KY who can recommend whether it's time to replace a home's roof. They can quickly spot whether the roof has a few more years of life in it or if it's past its prime. When a buyer purchases a home, information about the age of the existing roof is disclosed. This gives the buyer an idea of how many years are left before the roof will need to be replaced.\n\nDuring the buying process, an inspector will also examine the condition of a home's roof to determine whether the current owner needs to make repairs or replace the entire roof. Sometimes roofing contractors in Louisville KY will help home inspectors since they may have a business relationship with the inspector. The inspector will recommend roofing contractors in Louisville KY to prospective buyers and existing owners if roof repairs and replacements will hold up the sale. It's best to get an estimate on the cost of repairs or a full replacement and negotiate the cost into the sale contract if the existing owner would rather not take the time to fix the problem(s).\n\nSince several different types of roofing options exist, contractors are often the first leg in the process of making repairs or scheduling a replacement. Contractors have to abide by certain regulations, which vary between states and geographical regions. When roofers are finished with the job, a licensed inspector must look over the work and make sure that it is up to code requirements. The decision to make roof repairs or replace the entire roof needs to be made in haste since small problems can lead to larger ones. A home's roof is fundamental to protecting the interior of the home and its contents.\n\n",
