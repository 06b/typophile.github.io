Portions of  \nthe letters are melting off and dripping down the mountainside. Fans have  \nalways tolerated the crooked baseline (due in part to seismic activity) but  \nthe dripping letters have caused widespread alarm among tourists, actors,  \nscientists and local officials. Font experts at the Ascender Typographic  \nPreservation Institute (ATyPI) were on the scene analyzing the Hollywood  \nsign to determine the cause of the dramatic changes.\n\n\"We use proprietary algorithms in our hinting software to accommodate  \nincreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These algorithms  \nenhance the legibility by optimizing the placement of letters on the  \nphysical grids used to hold billboard fonts\" said Thomas Rickner,  \nworld-renowned font software specialist best known for his work on the  \nVerdana, Tahoma and Georgia fonts for Microsoft. \"But the velocity of  \npixelation modification in the Hollywood sign is both perplexing and  \nalarming. I've never seen anything like this before.\" he added.\n\nThe National Commission on Historic Typefaces has engaged Charles Bigelow,  \nthe distinguished Melbert B. Cary Professor at Rochester Institute of  \nTechnology, to conduct a study on the impact of global warming on fonts  \nexposed to the environment. \"We will be analyzing everything from gas pumps  \nto ancient Greek inscriptions chiseled onto buildings that aren't there  \nanymore, to see how fonts will change over time,\" said professor Bigelow.  \n\"As Le Corbusier once said, 'Fonts of the future are usually fonts of the  \npast.' The only thing we won't be studying is outdoor signage on bank  \nbuildings, since most financial institutions are now adopting Comic Sans as  \ntheir corporate font, to better celebrate their recent achievements. We need  \nto wait until the paint dries before doing further analysis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, as the famous Hollywood sign continues its decay, the Institute  \nwill attempt to collect portions of letters which have melted and fallen to  \nprevent them from being sold on EBay.\n\nThe enclosed photo was supplied by Dr. Matt Stevenson of the Ascender  \nTypographic Preservation Institute.
