  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nWorking on a this proposal for new EeePC logotype.\n\nThe typeface is Microsofts Consolas.\n\nIt has been cut - subtle..\n\nAttached is the original logotype and my designs.\n\nI am liking 3.1 and 4 most. I've added perspective to 3.3 and 3.4\n\nI would like feedback on:\n\n• the cut directions (3.1 has variations - 4s cuts are all in the same direction),\n\n• if you think adding perspective looks good, and\n\n• anything else you want to add\n\nI appreciate your help, thank you in advance.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nVictor\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019064431im_/http:/typophile.com/files/EeePC_logotype_1_3964.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019064431im_/http:/typophile.com/files/EeePC_logotype_2_3600.jpg)\n\n",
