However, I think it’s more likely that it is a custom font, or even a freebie techno design. I always hunt through Dafont using a text sample that is from your ’mystery font’. I often find these styles that way, since Techno designs seem to be a favorite of amateur font designers.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I just searched MyFonts’ 419 Techno fonts (no joy), and I am starting on the Dafonts ’Techno’ category. I’ll report back with my results. The other place that might bear fruit is Veer, but I have some trouble with browser obsolescence there.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Both of you.  \nbowfinpw, I was also going to search on the 3 Indie Font books, but as you said that already did that search, I’m gonna search elswere.  \nMy first tough was that this might be a freebie font, but also think that it have a very good design to be a freeware font.  \nIt’s a gorgeous techno design, don’t you agree?\n\n"

      "content": "I’m probably the wrong person to ask, since it is well known around here that I am not a fan of ’techno’ (I think they are too similar too often, and have become a cliché for ’modern = hi-tech’). However, this one IS different, and reminds me more of Bauhaus-styles, which I think were the origin of simpler typography as a philosophical approach, not as a branding tool, and in that way were truly different and modern. The fact that we still see them so often today in that context, over 70 years later, means they apparently convinced us to see it that way too.\n\nAs far as Dafont goes, I searched the Techno Sci-Fi and Techno Various categories and didn’t find this one (as Yves predicted). Has someone searched Veer for Techno styles? A lot of their foundries may already have been partially covered by the Indie Books, so the case that this might be a custom design is getting much stronger.\n\nDid you write to them to ask about the font? Sometimes you can get an answer, so it’s worth a try.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
