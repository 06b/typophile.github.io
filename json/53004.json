  "content": "Hello to you all!  \nI don't post here that often, but i keep visiting these forums because i realy think typophile is of the most interest. :) i have to thank you for all i've learned here!  \nso, i'd like to share with you an idea:  \nI have recently started teaching tipography history to adult students in a professional school, and i felt an enormous difficulty in transmiting to them the importance of tipography (some of them, before these classes, had never thought about letters...)  \nwell, to make it simple, i made an experiment with friends and i wanted to know what do you think about this before i try it with my students:  \nstep one: close your eyes and think of a random set of numbers (ex. 123) - imagine their graphic apearence in you head.  \nstep two: draw them on a piece of paper, with all the graphic characteristics you imagined (with serifs or without them, thin or bold, condensed or stretched...)  \nstep three: try to find out, in your everyday lives, something that might have influenced you in those graphic images.  \n.  \ni don't know if this sounds strange to you... i got answers that surprised me. We got to the conclusion that the numbers we drew were influenced by, for exemple, the lettering of the numbers in our mobile phones, the lettering of the house numbers in our street, or the tipography of the last book we read.  \n.  \nthis means (i think) that we assimilate the graphic images around us, and that they change in the course of time, in our unconscient.  \n.  \ni think it would be interesting to try it also with the \"image\" of our name :)  \n.  \nthank you in advance for your thoughts on this!\n\n",
