  "content": "In my ongoing search for interesting type related art for home, does anyone know of a nice poster design, showing the evolutionary milestones in the development of type, at least in the latin alphabet, from blackletter, through humanist, oldstyle, transitional, modern etc, along with important names and dates?\n\nIf none exists I think this would be a great project, and would produce something worthy of hanging on the office wall.\n\n",

Sorry if it sounds garbled – my brain's like 99% full of my font right now :-)\n\n_An educational poster for real connoisseurs of the Black Art. For the first time, this overview shows all German type foundries, as well as more than 200 takeovers and transfers, as a logical, genealogical tree. Connecting lines highlight individual developments. The resulting view clearly outlines the rise and bloom of the Black Art, as well as its abrupt termination by the rise of phototype.  \nGutenberg was the first European to print with movable type. His idea quickly found enthusiastic followers, who continued to spread type casting throughout Germany and Europe. This new technology brought forth numerous new typefaces, the most important of which are displayed on the poster._\n\nI can recommend Christian's posters, though I haven't seen this one; I have his 2009 calendar poster and it's beautifully laid out and printed. I'm pretty sure he speaks English, so you could also email him directly with any further questions (there's an email link on the \"Impressum\" page).\n\n"

I love what Erik Spiekermann et al have done with Meta Serif... I am convinced it's the way things will go, certainly in corporate usage (anyone think it will catch on in other areas?)\n\nPart of my research turned up an amazing fact, when I discovered I live barely 2 miles from Baskerville's birthplace... I meantioned this to a friend recently who laughed at my wanting to visit the place and wondered if I might be wanting to become a great typographer through osmosis. I know it's not so easy!\n\nSteve\n\n"
