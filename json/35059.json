So my stuff is devoid of centered type, ornament, swooshes, swirls, concentric circles, random unrelated photos and/or illustrations, texture, damage, and wear. As a result, nobody ever gets to accuse me of following trends. At least contemporary trends, anyway.\n\nI do, however, appropriate ideas from movies. And I absorb a great deal about layout methodology from books and magazines, but that’s much more picking up the why than borrowing the what.\n\nThe exception is those designers at Experimental Jetset. They’re just so cool that I get their stuff stuck in my head for weeks, but they’re on the same modernist vibe that I want to be.\n\n"

While it has convinced countless desktop publishers to think they’re a designer because they have some Adobe products (or Microsoft Word, for that matter) it is more of a good thing because lots of people can experiment on their own without ungodly production costs.\n\nCreativity wise, I agree that as long as you’re OK with what you’re doing then it shouldn’t matter. I don’t pay too much attention to what’s going on with other designers but I should... visual stimulation is good whether it comes from the 1800s or 2007.\n\nI also agree that there has to come a point in an artists life where you say “to hell with it” and focus less on technique and more on expression. Musically, I think your technique can constantly be developed, if you want to. It’s a process of reaching a plateau and then resting there then climbing to the next one. The more skilled you are the longer it takes to reach the next one. I think that transfers to the design world as well... you can still improve your technique even if all you’re doing is experimenting and expressing.\n\n"

I was originally seeing it in a Type/Graphic design perspective, and more specifically, in a client/creative worker relationship.\n\nIt is no more dangerous to look at contemporaries for inspiration, than to look at a specific moment in the past. In the now, there are rough diamonds that others bring to the surface, in the past are buried polished gems. Inspiration always comes from somewhere. A broad historical study is smart. Researching a specific moment has a novelty quality that is marketable, but otherwise is roughly equivalent to emulating contemporaries (which is not the same thing as being aware of them).\n\nIf you only compete with yourself, you are guaranteed to succeed. And, to come in second every time. Not that that matters; I recommend exploring and challenging yourself, and just assume you are continually getting better if the new challenges are still interesting.\n\nIf you work is to affect anyone, they they are your client. In entertainment, people claim are looking for risks and surprises, so you have a leeway that other jobs don’t afford you. Even if there is no one else you want to reach or impact, then you are still your own audience. So, aside from habit or competence, what makes you listen to yourself?\n\nEvery now and then, do something you totally shouldn’t, aren’t prepared for, people wouldn’t know was you if they heard it, something that is possibly even just plain silly (or totally serious if you are generally lighthearted).

My experience in the music scene made it pretty clear that most will look to their “peers” for inspiration, leading to a lot of bands that sound the same. Nirvana makes it big and suddenly there are 1,000 grunge bands. Motley Crue breaks through and suddenly everyone is playing arena rock.\n\nAt least the history of design (or music) has a certain filter on it - that which is memorable as opposed to the ephemera of any given time.
