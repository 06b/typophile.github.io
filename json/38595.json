In the past, I have spent a lot of time on [designiskinky](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203113253/http:/www.designiskinky.com/) and that’s good, and also the fwis [book-cover design blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203113253/http:/covers.fwis.com/) is great, but I want to widen the net, I’m feeling a bit creatively dry and I’m thinking there must be heaps more stuff out there.  \nthanks\n\n—N\n\n [‹ Custom made typefaces for well-known brands?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203113253/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38639 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Brute Force Testing ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203113253/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30960 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
