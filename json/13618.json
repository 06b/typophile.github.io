  "content": "Mrs. Eaves is a great font. However I have a client who doesn’t see it that way. I am looking for an alternative with a taller x-height and possibly a bit more condensed. Mrs. Eaves has some very nice and sensitively designed letter forms like the lowercase u, m, etc. The criteria is an easy-to-read, approachable, friendly, warm, smart but non-intimidating atypical font.\n\nFonts I have eliminated:  \nAtma  \nBaskerville (all versions)  \nDeepdene  \nDolly  \nFairplex  \nGoudy Old Style  \nPerpetua  \nSherwood  \nTribute\n\nThanks.\n\nps. This is technically reposted from the design forum. Sorry, but I'm desparate.\n\n",

Let me think...\n\nI think [Andulka](http://web.archive.org/web/20110210221720/http:/www.stormtype.com/andulka.html) has some of the features you're looking for, maybe a bit too sophisticated for what you're looking for (if i'm reading you right).  \nHave you looked at [Paperback](http://web.archive.org/web/20110210221720/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171)? I think that has all the qualities you've said you're looking for. I'll try to come up with some others...\n\n"
