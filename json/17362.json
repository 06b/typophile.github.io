  "content": "PRESS RELEASE\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  \nJanuary 17, 2006\n\nFSI Fonts und Software GmbH, (FontShop International) announced today that it had reached a settlement with an internationally recognized strategic brand development firm related to a dispute involving the design, creation and licensing of a typefont developed as part of that firm’s work for one of its clients.\n\nThe firm has denied and vigorously defended the allegation that the typeface infringed FSI’s copyrights or that the typeface was an otherwise unauthorized derivative version of FSI’s FF DAX and FF META typefonts. FSI first raised its claims in the beginning of February, 2005.\n\nWithout any admission of liability, the parties have agreed to resolve this matter pursuant to the terms of a confidential settlement agreement in order to eliminate the uncertainties, burden and expense of potential, protracted litigation. As part of that settlement, the firm has agreed to pay FSI $17,500.\n\n_About FSI Font Shop International  \nFSI FontShop International is a German-based international developer and licensor of electronic type fonts under its FontFont Library brand ( [www.fontfont.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227021823/http:/www.fontfont.com/ \"www.fontfont.com\")). Comprising more than 3,500 electronic type fonts created by more than 150 font designers, FSI distributes the FontFont Library around the world through direct Internet sales. As well as its FontFont Library, FSI also distributes fonts from more than 30 other font foundries at www.fontshop.com._\n\n",

I have contacted FutureBrand for more information, but they are playing possum.\n\n_\\> Type dorks are really good detectives._\n\nAs you can see when you follow my link, several people on the Type Identification Board came to the same conclusion independently of each other, and some additional investigations confirmed our suspicions. That's why I love this outfit -- thanks to the number of people involved and the unique combination of specific areas of interest, we must be the most efficient type identification tool in the known universe.\n\nI was taught by my parents that if I did something wrong I should always confess, apologise and try to make things right, NOT make it any worse by lying even more. I'm particularly offended by FutureBrand's stuborness as they _\"[have] denied and vigorously defended the allegation that the typeface infringed FSI’s copyrights or that the typeface was an otherwise unauthorized derivative version of FSI’s FF DAX and FF META typefonts.\"_\n\nYou don't want to tick off the dorks...\n\n"
