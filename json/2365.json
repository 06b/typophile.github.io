On the other hand, those -the few- who really bag on it have got it all backwards.   \n   \nIt's really a goldmine of type knowledge, and brings together many historic specimens, with usually expert analysis from an actual user of type - and a proficient one. However it's also a very personal book - not a \"scholarly\" one deep down. Like when Updike makes Dutch type sound like trash and Spanish type like the best thing since sliced bread. But if you take his particular opinions in stride and realize it has some historical gaps, then it's really uniquely useful - there's nothing like it. However, it's also a specialist's book. It's all about type, not much more. You really have to love type to enjoy it.   \n   \nBTW, there have been three \"historic\" editions: 1922, 1937, 1967. The first one is supposed to have the best reproduction, the second one has new material, the third neither - which is I guess how I managed to buy a copy of that one (both volumes) for only $75. The Dover (?) reprints are not considered very good, but the textual content of course is there (as opposed to the fidelity of the specimens), and that's most of its value as far as I'm concerned.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Book printers (such as he?) looked down their noses at jobbing printers who did commercial (ie advertising) work, did they not? So, in that sense, it is incorrect to describe him as a commercial printer.   \n   \nWasn't there a \"class\" system, with private presses at the top, the Updikes and De Vinnes in the middle, and jobbing printers at the bottom?   \n   \nTo revise my point: the idea we have now of the importance of popular culture didn't emerge until the 1960s. So Updike, in writing a serious history of his discipline, ignored popular (commercial) culture.   \n   \n(Mind you, things haven't really changed, it's still only a small \"arty\" part of the graphics industry that gets the trade press coverage and the critical analysis in books.)   \n   \nAll the marvellous typographic inventions and virtuosity (you consider these \"travesties\"?) of the mainstream 19th century, Updike regarded as degradation. So, there are no showings in his book of fat faces, Clarendons, Sans Serifs, etc.   \n   \nThe founder's specimen books of the 19th century give a far broader idea of what was happening than Updike's narrowly focused exposition.   \n   \nSo, Updike: big ommissions, if you're expecting a broad coverage of type history. But at the time, innovative, and substantial in those areas he did cover. And very relevant to the graphic historicism of the early 20th century.\n\n"

      "content": "Nick   \n   \nI don't consider the typographic explosion that occurred in the nineteenth century a travesity, but certainly those who had hopes to revitalize and improve typography in the early twentieth century did. Even good ole bad boy Marinetti hated the typography of the nineteenth century. At the time, I suspect most folks in the industry were quite pleased to get beyond it, or there simply would not have been the intense interest in the revival and, as well, in the modernist approach.   \n   \nThere is unfortunately no study yet compiled that provides a good prospective on nineteenth century printing and typographic innovations and developments. Certainly, the great strides that occurred in the twentieth all were put into place the century before. I'm much more interested in the nineteenth century than I am the twentieth, but NOT a nineteenth century based on twenty-first century cliches.   \n   \nI'm certain you are right that Updike considered many nineteenth century faces as degradation, even ahistorical, but he was hardly alone at the time. But yes, he was a working printer, in the guts of it, not just books. I have a nice little book of his called, I think, A Day in the Work, something like that. Pretty much the routine of the printshop.   \n   \nDon't know that one could strategize the various kinds of work of that time into anything like a \"class\" system. Many of the typographic high-rollers in the commercial realm, Gill, Goudy, etc., were also involved with the Private Press Movement. I doubt the output of the private press was considered high class as much as it may have been considered archaic, and perhaps of interest because of that, since therein lay the roots of the revival. But the mixing only occurred because of the players involved, who straddled many fences.   \n   \nPopular culture is derived pretty much from the sloganisms of any period isn't it? As much as it can be defined at that time, I assume through advertising, etc, yes, Updike would certainly have been part of it. I assume you are talking typographically. If anything, he wasn't purposely ignoring it, but unaware of it since as you point out, it wasn't a defined concept. But, as far as the commercial printing industry's influence on distributing the slogans of commerce, yeah, certainly Updike was instrumental in evolving that.\n\n"

Anthropologists built the bridge.   \n   \nNonetheless, it's still hard to fathom how Updike, a hands-on, working stiff, could print \"a really lovely corporate book for a wicker funiture manufacturer\", and not consider similar works by his forbears for discussion in his history.\n\n"

I'm sure one could find all kinds of examples that go way, way back. (???)   \n   \nI think Updike's history was actually a map for the future. He probably thought what he considered deadends were not worth inclusion. He dismissed letterforms that had no defining historical lineage or linkage. I think that's pretty much it.   \n   \nI don't know that one can make the case that there was some kind of opposition or counter-action going on at the time. I'm wondering if you think there might have been? Diehard nineteenth centuryists or something like that. I kind of doubt it. The future was a big deal. Even the Arts & Crafts Movement was an attempt at salvation rather than a looking backward. The attendant typefaces of the Industrial Revolution that evolved out of nowhere for the sole purpose of selling the commodities that came out of industrialization were considered dehumanizing, no matter how funky or attractive they may seem today. Without previous investigations to lead the way, I suspect neither Updike or anyone else at the time could really make head or tail out of the nineteenth century's typographic cornucopia and so it was pretty much sidestepped.\n\n"

To this day, the standard conception of modernity is that there were political and industrial revolutions c.1800, but that modern art didn't ramp up till impressionism, and take off till the 1900s, a century later. This viewpoint has been challenged recently by post-structuralists (eg \"Techniques of the Observer, by Jonathan Crary) but there is still a huge amount of work to be done unearthing the modernity of the 19th century. Of course, type designers were right there early on, with the unicase bold sans serif!   \n   \nAs a counterforce to Revivalism, I would say that Cheltenham bridged the gap between 19th and 20th century modernism. It had a big, systematic family, printed well on coated and uncoated, in text and display, hot and cold. It's definitely not a Didone Modern, but in true Victorian fashion combined pseudo-historical forms with precisely engineered serifs. It was massive exactly concurrent with revivalism, until the 1930s. The Century typeface can also be seen as an evolution of the 19th Century modern. I have a 1921 edition of De Vinne's \"Correct Composition\", still set in -- De Vinne.   \n   \nFor editorial text type, revivalism never supplanted the \"numbered romans\" (Victorian didone) in mass market magazines, books and newspapers.

Some reflection is more than deserved pondering master/slave working conditions non-conducive to fine typography. The results are generally best appreciated if you consider yourself viewing a typographical freak show.   \n   \nNot to mention such things as cylinder presses that were built for one thing in mind, production. Quantity had clearly surplanted quality. The same could be applied to the inventions of both the Linotype, and Monotype machines. The mother of their inventions was _Mrs. Get The Lead Out._   \n   \nLater, Monotypes machines were tinkered with by the _why can't you crowd_ such as the great Bruce Rogers. Cylinder presses were adapted for fine printing by John Henry Nash and Fount le Roy. The latter pioneered fine press work aboard semi automatic cylinder presses. A very novel idea at that time. I remember in my days this had been reversed and I was told that cylinder presses were superior to platens for fine printing. Both opinions are non sense if applied generally. Compare the problems of rule work on a cylinder press, vs. rule work on a platen press. Simplified, the purchase of a press was not a mechanical decision, it was a marketing decision.   \n   \nAlso the nineteen century was plagued by insidious optometry experiments regarding spacing techniques causing our great grand daddies to either become blind, or wishing they were blind. Pages with mutton spaces after a periods. (A frightful eyesore that lingered on even into my own day.)   \n   \nThis period of typography I hope does not inspire typographical nostalgia.
