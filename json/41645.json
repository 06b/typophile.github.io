Do you need it more condensed than that?  \nscroll down to see it here:  \n [http://www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203222035/http:/www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html \"http://www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html\")\n\nYou could use 59 (ultra condensed), but at that narrow width, there’s not enough room for a bold weight.\n\nJason C\n\n"

Anyway just give it a go, it is a very interresting process. :-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203222035im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00046_3790.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203222035im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00047_3760.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203222035im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/DSC00087_3505.jpg)\n\n"
