  "content": "In September 2006, the new FontBook 2006 edited by Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert and others was published replacing the old FontBook 1998. After comparing FontBook 2006 with FontBook 1998, I doubt whether the new FontBook 2006 is a non-partisan, objective reference work. It seems to me that the new FontBook 2006 is a non-impartial sales catalog selecting fonts by party-political criteria.\n\nLet's start by having a look at the list of font manufacturers. In the old FontBook 1998, the list of manufacturers (see page 17) started with\n\n- Adobe  \n- Berthold\n\nwhereas in new FontBook 2006, the list of font manufacturers (see page 54) does no longer contain Adobe and Berthold. This means that the editors Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert make the FontBook users believe that e.g. Adobe does not longer exist as a font manufacturer.\n\nThe newer Adobe fonts Warnock (2000), Bickham Script (2000), Chaparral (2000), Montara (2001), Brioso (2002), Kepler (2003) and Garamond Premier Pro (2005) etc. have been excluded entirely from the FontBook 2006, whereas some older Adobe fonts, e.g. Minion, Myriad, Utopia, Tekton, are still included in the new FontBook 2006, but are now described as fonts made by Monotype as font manufacturer and not as fonts made by Adobe as font manufacturer, because Adobe was deleted by the editors Eric Spiekermann et al. from the list of font manufacturers and replaced by Monotype.\n\nIn the old FontBook 1998, on looking up Minion, Myriad, Utopia, Tekton etc., you will see in the yellow bar by the letter \"A\" (= manufacturer Adobe) that these fonts are manufactured by Adobe. In the new FontBook 2006, on looking up Minion, Myriad, Utopia, Tekton etc., you will see that the letter \"A\" for Adobe in the yellow bar was deleted, and on consulting the new \"Contents\" section at the beginning of the book, you will see that these Adobe fonts are now labeled \"C\" denoting \"Monotype Imaging\", e.g.\n\nMinion = C = Monotype (see page 31 of FontBook 2006),  \nUtopia = C = Monotype (see page 49),  \nTekton = C = Monotype (see page 46).\n\nA few Adobe fonts are also ascribed to Linotype, e.g. Myriad = LH = Linotype (see page 32), but none of the Adobe fonts is ascribed to Adobe by the editors Eric Spiekermann et al.\n\nA final example: The old FontBook 1998 contained both Cronos by Adobe and Today by Scangraphic. Now in the new FontBook 2006, Eric Spiekermann et al. removed Adobe's Cronos, but kept Today of the defunct Scangraphic outfit.\n\nAlthough nobody can call me a friend of Adobe's (see my critical documentations about Adobe at [http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#ADOBE9](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709001855/http:/www.forgers.de/forgers/#ADOBE9 \"http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#ADOBE9\")), I consider it necessary to say in favour of Adobe that it is non-objective and even ridiculous by Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert, who edited the FontBook 2006, that they removed Adobe as a font manufacturer, and I also think that it is non-scholarly and non-impartial that Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert excluded most of the newer fonts manufactured by Adobe, e.g. Brioso, Chaparral, Garamond Premier Pro, Kepler, Warnock, etc., which are important enough for the history of typefaces to justify their inclusion into a FontBook containing 35,000 fonts.\n\nWhereas the old FontBook 1998 contained all Berthold fonts, the new FontBook 2006 contains none of them at all. Here again, from the scholarly point of view, a non-partisan reference work would include these fonts, although it is understandable that Eric Spiekermann, who once was an employee of the defunct Berlin stock-holding company H. Berthold AG, is not longer willing to include the Berthold fonts into the new FontBook on account of the fact that he was harassed and sued by well-known Chicago conmen (who no longer live in Chicago).\n\nFor typeface researchers, the FontBook 2006 is not only made incomplete by the exclusion of the historically important Berthold collection, but there now also arise other problems for researchers. For example, in the old FontBook 1998, the font FF Dax was provided with the reference to the font Barmen, while in the new FontBook 2006, this reference was dropped with the consequence that readers are intentionally withheld the information that FF Dax distributed by FontShop is a reworking of the old Berthold font Barmen made by the same designer (see [http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#BARMEN](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709001855/http:/www.forgers.de/forgers/#BARMEN \"http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#BARMEN\")).\n\nWhile the new FontBook 2006 annoys by the exclusion of Adobe, Berthold and other large font manufacturers, this new FontBook surprises by the inclusion of small font forgering outfits that had been excluded from the old FontBook 1998. An example is the Brendel font forging company. In 1997, FontShop initiated a multi-year lawsuit against the Brendel font forging outfit in Cologne (Germany) with the favorable result for FontShop that the Brendel outfit went broke. However the defunct Brendel outfit was founded again as the Quick Brown Fox outfit in Cologne (see [http://www.qbf.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709001855/http:/www.qbf.de/ \"http://www.qbf.de\")) selling again the Brendel forgeries which are also sold by Greenstreet, Softmaker and other font forging outfits (see [http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#GREEN](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709001855/http:/www.forgers.de/forgers/#GREEN \"http://www.forgers.de/forgers/#GREEN\")).\n\nMuch to my surprise, these Brendel font forgeries (e.g. Diamante, Dragon, Lingwood, Nashville, Pasadena, etc.) which are sold by QBF, Greenstreet and Softmaker at 0.01 Euro per font and which had been excluded from the old FontBook 1998 for the reasons stated above, have now been included into the FontBook 2006, because the Elsner + Flake outfit in Hamburg recently grabbed these Brendel font forgeries (presumably by exploiting the Greenstreet font forgery CD) and is now selling these font forgeries at 35.00 Euro per font through FontShop. This explains why Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert decided to include these Brendel font forgeries into the new FontBook 2006.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it cannot be denied that the new Fontbook 2006 is a non-impartial sales catalog and not an objective reference work. Here a final example: In the old FontBook 1998, in section Slab Serif, page 9, two Candida typeface versions are shown, the first one labeled \"A\" = Adobe, and the second one labeled \"B\" = Berthold. In the new FontBook 2006, on account of the fact that Eric Spiekermann and Jürgen Siebert no longer like Adobe and Berthold, two other Candida typeface versions are shown in the section Slab, page 11. The first one is the version by Neufville, and the second one is the version by Elsner + Flake which is selling the Brendel font forgeries through FontShop.\n\nUli  \n( [http://www.forgers.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20110709001855/http:/www.forgers.de/ \"http://www.forgers.de\"))\n\n",

I have never been an employee of Berthold or any of its affiliates. I have no idea where you get that information from.\n\nIn your own biography at the FontShop website, you write yourself: \"arbeitete vornehmlich für die graphische Branche - darunter Berthold\", i.e. \"worked for Berthold\". So you yourself confessed that you worked for Berthold, didn't you?\n\n\\> 3. That book is called a “compendium” of digital fonts. Look up what that word means.\n\nIn your own preface to the FontBook 2006, you declare that this compendium \"is a truly unique type encyclopedia\" (see page 6). So you yourself explained what the word \"compendium\" means for you, didn't you?\n\n\\> Shoddy work like this disqualifies anybody from commenting on other peoples’ work.\n\nDo you mean by \"shoody work\" your own FontBook 2006?\n\n\\> And as has been said by others, there are many reasons why not every typeface under the sun is in the FontBook. It always takes two sides to make a bargain.\n\nI did not say that a one-volume book can contain \"every typeface under the sun\".\n\nThe crucial point is that you write in your own preface: \"The editors emphasise their desire to present a work of reference rather than a sales catalogue\" (see page 7). But your FontBook 2006 is not a work of reference, it is a sales catalogue:\n\n- In a \"work of reference\", in a \"truly unique type encyclopedia\", a font manufacturer (e.g. Adobe) and his fonts (e.g. Adobe Garamond Premier Pro) are included by objective criteria.\n\n- In a \"sales catalogue\", a font manufacturer and his fonts are included, if you can \"make a bargain\" (your own words) with the font manufacturer.\n\nSince the font manufacturer Adobe did not \"make a bargain\" with you, this font manufacturer was excluded from the FontBook, and since you could \"make a bargain\" concerning the Brendel font forgeries , they were included by you. \"Bargain\" may be okay for a \"sales catalogue\", but \"bargain\" is definitely not okay for \"a work of reference\", for \"a truly unique type encyclopedia\".\n\n"

If someone who pretends to be diligent and detail-oriented alters my biography with one keystroke, i feel obliged to correct it. That has nothing to do with other issues.\n\n3. There are many mistakes in the FontBook, which is inevitable with that amount of data. Some of them are human errors: we didn’t catch them or we left something out inadvertently. Some have to do with false data, late data or no data. There will be Errata pages as our readers help us collate omissions and other mistakes.

      "content": "Erik Spiekermann:\n\n\\> 1. Adobe fonts are distributed by many companies, e.g. Monotype, Linotype, Agfa. Data is always identical. Like you can buy a Mercedes from the plant in Stuttgart, from your local dealer, a dealer in another city.\n\nI think there is a fundamental misunderstanding here. The header on page 54 of FontBook 2006 is\n\n\"Manufacturers (Hersteller)\",\n\nand this page 54 lists these \"manufacturers\" with respective abbreviations, e.g.\n\n\"FB = Font Bureau\".\n\nNow let's assume, a FontBook user interested in the font \"Agency\" by David Berlow on page 5 of the \"Sans\" section wants to know the \"manufacturer\" (= foundry) of this font. For this purpose, the user looks up the font \"Agency\" in the \"Contents\" section, where he - in this case, luckily - finds the equation\n\n\"Agency = FB\".\n\nbecause here the \"manufacturer\" of the font is correctly given. But this is often not the case, as has been exemplified in my first posting to this thread, so that the reader may read the equation\n\n\"Agency = M\".\n\nThis is bewildering, because \"M = Monotype\" is not the \"manufacturer\" of the font Agency, but only one of many dealers, sellers or distributors of this font Agency, or - worst case - a foundry which is neither the manufacturer nor the distributor of the font Agency.\n\nExactly this happens in the \"Contents\" section with the Adobe fonts and also with many fonts by numerous other foundries, i.e. the \"Contents\" section often does not state the true \"manufacturer\", but instead a distributor or another company, which is not the true \"manufacturer\" (= true foundry).\n\nThe confusion of the FontBook readers could be remedied by renaming the header on page 54 from \"Manufacturer\" to \"Dealer\", but many users want to know the \"manufacturer\". And the true \"manufacturer\", e.g. Font Bureau, certainly also prefers to see the true manufacturer equation \"Agency = FB\" instead of the wrong manufacturer equation \"Agency = M\".\n\n"

      "content": "Uli,\n\nYou are discussing errors in the FontBook. This kind of thing is normal in publishing and it is expected that users will assist the publisher in correcting errors for future versions (as Erik has stated above). Can you simply note mistakes without concocting a conspiracy?\n\nIn the final analysis, nobody but you expects FontBook to be an objective reference work. It doesn't change the fact that it is a monumental work of information design and that very few foundries, much less independent parties, have undertaken to present so much information in such a compact and intelligent format.\n\nAgain I suggest: Since you seem deeply concerned with authenticity, objectivity, factual accuracy and full disclosure, why don't you produce your own objective, complete reference to all available digital fonts? The answer to this question is vital....\n\n"

Monotype is the FontBook source of these \"standard\" fonts. They could have been supplied by Adobe, they could have been supplied by Linotype...\n\nNote that most of the fonts available through Adobe are originally made by Monotype, Linotype and ITC, usually crosslicenced - for distribution purposes - between them.\n\nSo e.g. Frutiger - originally from Linotype - is often referred to as an \"Adobe\" font - even when it is distributed through Monotype.  \nNot too difficult, is it?  \n;-)\n\nJacob\n\n"
