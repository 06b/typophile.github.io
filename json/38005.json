U.S.-style numbers use the comma to separate thousands, so \"4,000\" is appropriate, but European-style (except Great Britain) is \"4 000\" using a half-space instead of a comma (the comma is used instead of a decimal point, so \"4 000,098\" would be correct).\n\n"

I changed it to **4,000 sq ft** and it gave the text block an even color ... but then there were arguments against omitting the punctuation.\n\n@ oldnick\n\nYour point makes perfect sense. So, I've decided to typeset based on what it _looks like_ in the body text. If it's used as an adjective I'm wrong to set the type this way, two hypens are correct? Can you indicate where I can find that previous thread?\n\n"
