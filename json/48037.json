Thomas is right that there are a few in _Anatomy…_, but they’re cropped and cleaned-up b&w images of production drawings so they aren’t really good examples. Also, check with Jos Buivenga who might have hi-res versions of the images of his drawings that were used in a recent online profile. It would also be worth sifting through old images of ID, Baseline, etc. for drawings in their profiles of type designers.\n\n"
