  "content": "Iv been designing a new website portfolio for myself, and i was using the 'paper' symbol on many printers for icons for each project. I am a print based designer usually. I wasnt trying to make a logo but i turned the symbol upside down and it looked like a P, so i made this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108211000im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logos_6213.jpg)\n\nThe thing is im never really in favour of personal logo's especially for students (like me), comes accross slightly pretentious to me. However im using the paper icon on my site anyway so i though this might be acceptable.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Does it say 'print designer', i have a bad feeling this is such an obvious logo it will have been done a thousand times. I wasnt really looking to make a personal logo but this just came to me...\n\n",

      "content": "Well, I like logos in general... so I also like personal logos. Although I'm sure there's logos that use the paper icon (and I'm sure countless with CMYK color schemes) I've never seen one upside down. The fact that your first initial is hidden in there is a nice accident. I'd suggest to try adding a counter to the \"P\" but I think that would destroy the subtly... and probably ugly it up a bit.\n\nSometimes the most obvious solution is the best one.\n\n"

I when you grow tired of it you can always change it. Another thing to keep in mind is that you'll probably never be 100%happy with you're own logo design (design is both a gift and a curse for us). :)\n\n"
