  "content": "I wonder how it is possible for a bitmap font to have underscore appear as negative when it is crossing descenders. An example of this would be [Group 94](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011023231/http:/www.group94.com/) website (click on other news items to see ones that have links with descenders).  \nLinks in the right column text appear with negative underscore, which makes descenders more visible. Can this be achieved within a TTF file itself or takes some trickery, like custom underscored font replacing the regular one after text is loaded?\n\n",

(needless to say that i'm impressed of their flash development all these years).\n\nWhen / if i get an answer from them, i'll post it here...\n\nNick\n\n"

      "content": "It's not an \"underline\" font. Watch carefully as the animation finishes - the text as animated and finished has no underline. When the text has finished moving, the Flash animation just goes back and draws a line underneath the text they want, probably in XOR transfer mode so that white pixels turn black and black pixels turn white.\n\nIt only looks this way because none of the descenders (\"y\", \"g\") ever curve back up from their lowest point. If they did, you'd see those little curls above the line, which is why real glyph-rendering systems don't draw undelines that way.\n\n"

      "content": "I think drawing underlines would be a hell of a task. XOR pixel-toggle overlay over type.. I doubt it's even doable in Flash. My guess is they load the html text with one css style and after it's there they change the css into one that uses underlined version of the font on the **a** tag. But I'm curious if this is really the way they do it..\n\n"
