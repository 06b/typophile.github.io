  "content": "Hi All,\n\nI recently whipped up a logo for my personal design business after I realized I never had a card to give anyone. I am going to change this when I put together my final portfolio together next year. What I am looking for is a general critique or suggestions for me to emphasize my concept. Color suggestions would be nice too. Thanks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080606040055im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo_3576.jpg)\n\n [‹ Real Estate appraiser logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080606040055/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45816 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [brushscript logo - where to from here? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080606040055/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46041 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
