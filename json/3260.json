I like it in theory, but am not sure how it works with pixel fonts.   \n   \nAlso, are the 1/3 banners too small to really pull off the attempt?   \n   \n  ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013163726im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/27055.gif)\n\n",

Perhaps, the larger size should have larger counters and apertures.\n\n"
