  "content": "_CJKV Information Processing_ Second Edition goes to press on the 10th. Given that I am also typesetting it, using Adobe InDesign CS3-J, it is in my hands right up until then. The current page count is 900 pages. That includes 34 pages of front matter and 26 pages of index. I submitted the book to O'Reilly for QC2 (Quality Check 2) this morning. I spent the four-day Thanksgiving Day break entering QC1 edits and applying page-breaking to the book. It is in very good shape.\n\nThe proverbial \"light at the end of the tunnel\" is getting pretty darn bright now. :-)\n\n",
