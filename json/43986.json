      "content": "The ST should connect at the top.\n\nLose the double-wide bowl of the last R and the extra curve at the far right connecting the YEAR and ROOSTER. Decrease the angle of the yellow enough so that you can see a little white inside the A and R at the end -- the 3-dimensional nature is getting lost over there.\n\nOther than that, it's very cool. Very 1970s disco, good choice of colors and good letterforms.\n\n"
