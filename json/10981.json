I'm assuming there is a similar reason for the idea of the \"bubble dots.\" Instead of the crown though (reminds me of hotel signage or a soda pop logo) you might consider stressing the horizontal treatment you've already established and use them (the bubbles) as an interline rule between the two text lines. Perhaps going from small to large and then from large to small to provide a bit of a break in the tension between the lines. Keep the largest solid sphere the same size as the stem weight of the YESYES letterform, yes?\n\n"

Maybe add a little more cmy to the grey. Or tone down the orange. However, if you are trying to be a friendly and service-oriented agency, and saying that with your logo, you might want to kick the saturation up a bit.   \n   \nAre you asking about the smile in your logo and why it might not be such a good thing? I'm glad you changed your colors. It did look a bit like an airline. But, I wasn't entirely opposed to the concept behind the usage.   \n   \nHere are a couple places to visit.   \n   \n [http://www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/986150.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417175550/http:/www.thestreet.com/tech/internet/986150.html)   \n [http://www.splorp.com/critique/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417175550/http:/www.splorp.com/critique/)   \n   \nBut, on the otherhand...in my opion...while some logos don't need concept...well, I think a concept is highly important. A good concept, even hinted at in your logo, can set the stage for a strong identity for the company. I'm sure I'll get shot down for saying this, but take for instance the Amazon logo. The smile that they incorporated in their logo reflects what they do for their clients (me). When I get home and see that box on my doorstep, I do smile.\n\n"
