  "content": "Hopeless Diamond is a contemporary display type inspired by the dimensionality of 19th Century carved lettering and signage. Our initial designs were reminiscent of the radical forms of the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber and the F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Strike Aircraft which provided an additional arena for inspiration. The name itself is taken from an earlier model of the F-117 that was called the ‘Hopeless Diamond’ due to its unusual structure and departure from aerodynamic doctrine.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905001612im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hopelessdiamond_ty_4820.png)\n\nHopeless Diamond is available in 3 varieties, each composed of 4 styles; Regular, Alternate, and accompanying Italics.  \nAvailable in OpenType, PostScript and TrueType formats from virusfonts.com\n\nYou can explore the design further by visiting  \n [http://www.virusfonts.com/fonts/hopeless-diamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905001612/http:/www.virusfonts.com/fonts/hopeless-diamond \"http://www.virusfonts.com/fonts/hopeless-diamond\")\n\nA pdf can be downloaded from:  \n [http://www.virusfonts.com/images/pdf-samples/Hopeless%20Diamond.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905001612/http:/www.virusfonts.com/images/pdf-samples/Hopeless%20Diamond.pdf \"http://www.virusfonts.com/images/pdf-samples/Hopeless%20Diamond.pdf\")\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nDesign: Marcus Leis Allion and Jonathan Barnbrook  \n [http://www.virusfonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905001612/http:/www.virusfonts.com/ \"http://www.virusfonts.com\")\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-117\\_Nighthawk](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905001612/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-117_Nighthawk \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-117\\_Nighthawk\")  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-2\\_Spirit](http://web.archive.org/web/20090905001612/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-2_Spirit \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-2\\_Spirit\")\n\n",
