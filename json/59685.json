  "content": "Hi All\n\nI am designing a logo for a event planner. I am leaning toward designing a wordmark rather than a pictoral logo. That being said, I am trying to find a clean, art-deco inspired typeface with some interesting ligatures, particularly an L with an inset E.  \nSo far, I have found [Cordial](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023204555/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000422#characters) and [Estilo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023204555/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=TTT0000021#characters) (which I love - have already used it for my wedding stationery), but I would welcome a few more suggestions.\n\nThanks!\n\nNatalie\n\n",
