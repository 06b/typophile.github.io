House industries, Carson.... yada yada...\n\nApparently when I activate them in font book it pulls them from that folder. Does anyone know a way to recollect them from font book and put them back into the folders they were pulled from?\n\n",

      "content": "Font Book's a stinker, activating fonts by moving files to the fonts directory. I'm surprised it's still doing it that way as there used to be many tales of woe. I can't suggest how to restore the sets, but you might like to look into better font management software for future happiness. I use [Linotype's free FontExplorer X](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014223227/http:/www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX). Which is fantastic at everything bar printing specimines. The built-in iTunes like shop is brilliant too -- you can quickly search for most things and get good (though usually brief) historical information really quickly.\n\nThinking about it, on first run I think you can have it organise everything, so it might solve your Font Book mess if you point FontExplorer to the directories Font Book moved things into.\n\n"
