I really like the face’s personality which is much warmer than VAG rounded or Gotham. Plus It has a <cite>ton</cite> of great features including a really great use of one I have advocated for here on Typophile - Contextual Alternatives - made not to connect letters in a way that better simulates writting ( Nick has done that too in Handsome Pro ) but instead to do something even more essential, to get a better fit - or dare I say it? ...A more ideal ’Notan’\\*!

I would expect JvR to have done that (which of course is not to say it’s not possible to disagree with his particular decisions). The interesting thing about Softmachine is that it makes this basic design principle contextual (which does require OT). This is something Eben has been talking about, although it’s always nicer to see it actually hit the ground.\n\n\\> it’s OK to be single\n\nFonts without italics, I actually admire - but a gradation of weights is quite useful in my mind - although to some extent Softmachine has that “built-in” (even though I worry about the effects of “blind” tracking to compensate for any weight gain via outlining). BTW, a really nice font with weights only is Stone’s Silica:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/silica/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080603021339/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/silica/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/silica/\")\n\nhhp\n\n"
