This relates to my post about my portfolio website that's under development here: [http://typophile.com/node/21014](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023204318/http:/typophile.com/node/21014 \"http://typophile.com/node/21014\") I need feedback/ideas please and possible typeface suggestions for a sans. Do I even need 'Design' as part of the mark? (The swoops are probably lame but I kept them in there for some reason...)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [xdb.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023204318/http:/typophile.com/files/xdb.pdf) | 44.69 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Having looked at your proposed website I wonder if you need to have a logo at all. Having said that you have started one so I'll ask what the x actually means, I prefer the second of the three you posted on your thread about the content of your website although the x seems a bit laboured as though it hasn't come from the same hand. On the first impression of the logo on its own, I think people will read graffiti-style graphics which might/or not be suitable or complementary to your work, which kind of takes me back to my first point. Of those that you have posted here I like middle row lefthand though it does look a bit like a signoff on a note to a girlfriend, I would definitely avoid the swooshes they look like a mark on a test paper.  \nI hope I'm not being too negative here, but I would re-consider the need for a logo.  \nTim\n\n"

You're not being too negative...this is just basically a way to preview some of my better work online, I'm not starting up my own design company or anything.\n\nThe \\_x\\_ just originated from a concept I had a long time ago about a signature line and a hand drawn script I had of my name ie. sign here X\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n"
