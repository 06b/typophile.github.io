      "content": "Can't agree more with Jodie. Definitely Lubalin Graph to me and dramatically squooshed. If the /e is the only letter that really bothers you, I suggest you to borrow it from [Avant-Garde](http://web.archive.org/web/20131016012928/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/std-demi-bold/glyphs.html#glyphs/541078/308) (available as stylistic alternate though OpenType features). Avant-Garde has been designed by amost all the same persons (Lubalin, Carnase, Benguiat...) and is likely the sans version of Lubalin Graph (or Lubalin Graph is the slab serif version of Avant-Garde).\n\n"
