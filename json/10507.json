      "content": "\\0020 will only work if the space glyph is correctly encoded. If you have a glyph in the font called 'space', try running the Assign Unicode command from the Glyph menu. This will assign Unicode values to glyphs based on their names, following a mapping list (the default will be the STANDARD.NAM file that comes with FontLab).   \n   \nAlso note that in preview and metrics strings etc. you can also enter a glyph by name, using this convention: /space\n\n"
