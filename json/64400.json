      "content": "This is quite nice! The overall polish is very good, and the display cut is original but understated. However the text cut is of course way too light for [much] text. If you're not going to have darker weights I would suggest changing the naming and targeting the system for intermixed usage - that would allow for some very cool \"emphasis\" via the [current] display cut in a body of the [current] text, or vice versa! Of course in that case every glyph in the display cut would need some swell.\n\nLooking at the \"text\" cut:\n\nBoth \"g\"s have problems. The binocular one is quite unhappy; maybe make the bottom bowl larger and more to the right, simplify the join between the two bowls, and try making the ear a simple straight line. The monocular one just needs a less curly terminal I think.\n\nThe tittles (dots on \"i\" and \"j\") are too big. Although that would work great in the display cut (where I'd make them even bigger).\n\nNumerals: 4 and 8 too narrow.\n\nSpacing: considering this will almost always be used large, the spacing I'd make quite a bit tighter. If you decide to keep this loose spacing, the wordspace needs to be bigger.\n\nhhp\n\n"
