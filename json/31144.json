This is a grim and horrible reality we see every day on the news.\n\nSecondly, let me give you the flavor of the ads we see. Here is one from the Superbowl yesterday.\n\nThe premise of this series of beer ads is that their beer is so good that people will do anything to get it. In this particular ad there is one bottle left in the cooler as two young guys come up to it. Guy one says “shall we do ‘rock, paper, scissors” for it?” “Ok,” says guy two. Then guy one counts one two three, and guy two flashes out a flat hand, while guy one simultaneously makes a throwing motion and guy two falls straight to the ground, knocked out.\n\nHe says to the others at the party, who look at him, “he threw paper, I threw a rock”, and walks off with the bottle of beer. We see guy two waking up and moaning as guy one walks off.\n\nThis one is extreme—it was even mentioned in today’s Washington Post , but the tone and style are often seen.\n\n"

I’m glad to see for a second day in a row that the Washington Post has slammed the Superbowl ads, though. Today they refer to them as having ‘sophomoric violence’. So maybe there’s hope that this stuff will go out of fashion. I do think, as Linda wrote, that the bullying attitude of Bush has something to do with the fashion, and maybe the country turning massively against him will help change the mood.\n\n"
