  "content": "Hello I was happy to see a Christmas card where the letters were made by Japanese school children out of folded origami paper.  \nA photo of the card (heavily photoshopped) was the basis for my own Christmas card.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821024112im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VladimirXmas2009_5666.jpg)\n\nThere are online instructions on how to construct such letters, although the card I saw followed other patterns. Origami paper is square, colored on one side and usually white on the other. Have fun!  \n [http://www.origami-club.com/en/abc/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821024112/http:/www.origami-club.com/en/abc/index.html \"http://www.origami-club.com/en/abc/index.html\")\n\n",
