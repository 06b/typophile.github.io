I am a bit ashamed to say that I had no real plan except for the fact that I love sans-serif and grotesque typefaces. Personally I love it so far and the project has given me an excuse to learn Fontlab as well.\n\nI am currently looking up kerning tutorials before I start with that, but I would love some critique on my glyphs. I want to make them as good as I possibly can. I am also appreciative for any tips, tutorial links, or recommended literature that I can read up on!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414033641im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typeface_4879.png)\n\nA PDF is attached for closer inspection!\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [typeface.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414033641/http:/typophile.com/files/typeface_0.pdf) | 306.38 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Good job!\n\nYou kept the overall feel intact throughout the whole font. My only issue is the lowercase g, it seems it isn't quite as refined in thin/thick stroke contrast as the rest of the typeface. I would give that another go.  \nAlso, the diagonal stroke in your lowercase z seems a little too thin, it makes the z feel too light in comparison with the rest of the typeface.\n\nI also recommend leaving it alone for a week, and when you return you'll notice alot of things on your own. Awesome job otherwise.\n\n"
