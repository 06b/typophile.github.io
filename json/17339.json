      "content": "A few months ago I spent some time looking into John Day's work. Amongst other things, he, rather than Caslon, was the first English punch-cutter of serious ability, producing work which would seem to most of us now Garamondian, but which was really in the broad, light though low-contrast, serenely even manner of Jean de Tournes of Lyon - a kind of Renaissance Baskerville, though with better proportions.\n\nDay put up the great Francois Guyot in his house for a while, and used a double pica roman and italic typeface of his; Day Roman and Heine's Tribute, issued by Emigre, are both modelled on this same type. Tribute was [approved](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101140/http:/www.emigre.com/EFoITrbF.php) by John Downer but [demolished](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123101140/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/troop-on-tribute.txt) by Bill Troop. In the same commentary, the Apostrophic Labs sketch of the roman, only a few hours' work, is held up as far more sensitive, though it could hardly have been other than 'inadequately conceptualised'. Having looked hard at the original, I agree, and the contrast is fine, but the descenders have been brutally truncated. I also like Tribute: it's hardly a revival, but very attractive, perhaps best thought of as 'Mrs Guyot'.\n\nI don't actually know whether the DTL italic would synthesize at all with the Apostrophic roman, but each is good. I think you'd just have to play around if you really wanted to find a matching italic - Granjon italics might work.\n\n"

It is as if I'm reading one of the very early (modern) editions of Tacitus. The italics seem to have just the right amount of ink \"spill\" or thickening in certain areas, such as the italic lower case \"n\" in the De Walpergen Pica (at 10.5pt.)

You can talk about balance, variety, color across very different kinds of typeface. Just as Picasso's women are often ugly, but well drawn by a lot of graphic design standards. Then there is also the element of personal taste, of course.

Yes, it's not like the \"ol' days\" when typesetting service cost money and type shops bought fonts as part of business.\n\nI think the agencies and graphic designers today are forgetting (or ignoring) the typesetting aspect of what they do. Somehow, even if the client provides the text file, the use of the type itself should have value. For instance, when estimating or billing a newsletter why can't you assign a typesetting fee for characters set? New typefaces are premium priced.\n\n- 1500 characters using FF Absara Sans (new design) @ $.005 per character = $7.50\n- 800 characters using Adobe Jenson Pro (bundled InDesign) @ $.001 per character = $.80\n- 1700 characters using Helvetica (bundled with equipment) @ $.00 per character = $.00\n\nEven if you (the designers out there who want fonts for free) don't actually put this fee on the invoice, you should calculate it into the final price to the client.\n\nYou should be thinking in terms of the value of type on paper or screen. Your grandpa made money setting type, so why are you giving it away.\n\n"

I am probably responsible for a good proportion of them myself.\n\nWell crafted fonts should be the priority in any commercial endeavour, but a lot (not all) of people after free fonts, as the original question in this thread was, are not after them for commercial use, therefore they should have the ability to use any font, good or bad, as long as it suits the effect and appeal they want. Advise is always acceptable of course.\n\nAlso, thanx for the casual backhand slap across the face. Unfortunately I am not priveliged like some to have skill, training and the access to a company who is prepared to supply all the goodies and assistance required to make better fonts, So I will plug away at the rubbish I seem to be making, teaching myself by my own mistakes and enjoying it. I have never deluded myself, or others, that I am anything but average. I do it in the spare time I have, and as a family man, do not let it become the do all and be all of my existence.\n\nAll best.  \nG\n\n"

Not disagreeing, just wondering. Am I a 'noticable percentage' to you ?\n\n"

      "content": "Graham, you have no need to apologize for what you are doing. A simple fact which seems to have eluded most of the participants in this particular forum is that free fonts constitute a first line of defense against font theft. You may notice that our clueless little friend who began this thread didn't ask where she could find \"a few good free fonts\"; rather, she was interested in acquiring LOADS of free fonts.\n\nIn our acquisitive society, those among us who sell our fontwares benefit from the phenomenon by which fonts have acquired the cachet of **bling** , which—as everyone knows—one cannot have too much of (remember: whoever dies with the most fonts, wins). If there were not LOADS of free fonts to be had, our greedy little friends would most likely turn to acquiring pirated commercial fonts, much like they turn to acquiring pirated commercial music (maybe someone with the RIAA ought to be paying attention here).\n\nSo, rather than slamming the creators of freeware fonts, more people engaged in the selling of fonts ought to be thanking them: they do what they do because they love doing it and, in the process, they perform an invaluable service for those of us who do it for love AND money...or just money.\n\nThank you, Graham, and everyone else who satisfies the gluttons...\n\n"
