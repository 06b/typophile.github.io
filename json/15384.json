  "content": "I've got a design job to do, and I'm looking for a very high quality script font, perhaps in the same spirit as Zapfino (if that qualifies as a script font, forgive my misuse of the lingo.) Something that would be appropriate for a diploma or academic certificate of sorts, but the more elegant and elaborate, the better.\n\nPerhaps some of you would be kind enough to throw out a few names. Cost is not an issue at this point.\n\nThank you.\n\n",
