  "content": "Looking for folks using Master Juggler. I bought it and was using it happily for a few weeks. Then I tried to install a Mac TrueType file and funkiness ensued. As I'm importing, it checks for errors (which is nice). But for every TrueType font, I get \"The PostScript outline file is missing.\" And subsequently, can't install these fonts. Anyone else run across this?   \n   \nSecondly, life is fairly SLOW as you scroll through the 'Samples'. I get mad about this.   \n   \nThese are my issues. If I can move beyond these, I can still be happy about buying Master Juggler. Something tells me the slowness in the 'Samples' is something I need to get over, and just live with.\n\n [‹ Icons in web addresses](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121162532/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5679 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Chunky Chili, a revival ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121162532/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5670 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Jon, you have hit on the two major knocks on MasterJuggler.   \n   \nMJs error checking can and should be disabled in prefs. It is so out of date, and really gives false 'problem' answers that majority of the time (as do most font checkers of this sort). While many of the reported 'errors' are possible in a certain set of circumstances, very few of these occur anymore. Including this 'feature' is an error that Alsoft has not rectified (by simply getting rid of).   \n   \nThe sample scrolling is simply too slow to be useful as you have discovered, and can be easily accomplished through other shareware programs. The good news is that MJ happily works at the same time as other font apps are activated (and this is as true in OS 9 as in OS X).   \n   \nThose two items are the major downside, the upside is that it is a great and rock solid font activation/deactivation tool that doesn't mess around with the OS or your programs - and consequently does not need updated all the time as many others do.\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for the feedback. yesterday, i dove in and realized that while reporting errors, TrueType fonts do indeed work just fine in MJ. And I found the option in the preferences where you can turn that stuff off. they should definitely change that though... that could REALLY confuse folks that have purchased TrueType fonts.   \n   \ni'm hoping they improve the speed. it's annoying. not only that, it will sometimes taken a million years to open the application. it stalls here and there.   \n   \nlike i said, i really like Master Juggler. It's just these bumps that get me all frazzled...   \n   \nmichael, what shareware programs are you using for type samples?\n\n"
