The only reference to Livorno that wasn't the city or its soccer team talks about a 'Livorno font' from an Israeli company called FontBit, whose fonts appear to be Hebrew. I couldn't get an English version of their page to open, so I am stuck there.\n\nWhat else do you know about it Nick?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I think it may have been custom designed especially for Asprey and Garrard (Royal warrant jewellers). On my key map print out the copyright notice reads '1995 dtp Types Ltd', which I happen to know is run by Malcolm Wooden. I can find no mention of Livorno on their website.\n\nIt's a pretty classy font with tall ascenders (or smallish x-height, depending on how you look at it) and a very long tail on both the cap and lower case y. It may be based upon an old typeface but I have no idea what it could be. It's a shame it isn't generally available.\n\nNick Cooke\n\n"

I have always been attracted to the antique typefaces with the low x-heights, so it was bugging me that I couldn't find a match for it. Now I know why.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
