      "content": "The contrast on this N, for example, is backwards from all the contrasted sans I have been finding. However, it's just like the narrow serif fonts, like [Keyboard](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015063735/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/keyboard-rr/). It's not exact (the G chin is too high, and the S spine is not the same), but it would be a better approximation of what appears to be a custom font, if you removed the serifs from such a font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
