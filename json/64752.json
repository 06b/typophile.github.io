  "content": "This is a book from the Central Saint Martins Archive. As i say in the title it is a book by Jonas Kortens. Titled Incunabula and Old books and was printed in 1743.\n\nThe current archive lecturer didn't know much about this book other then the details i have given here. Despite its poor condition its really beautiful and really worth a look. If anybody can translate any of the content that would be much appreciated or any information at all about the blackletter type would also be helpful.\n\nIf not just enjoy these images of a beautiful old book.
