Both of his kidneys are in bad shape. His eyesight is very weak, but I am sure he would love to hear happy thoughts and prayers from you when he feels good enough to read. His email is [kral [at] testpilotcollective.com](mailto:kral%40testpilotcollective.com)._\n\n_Also, if you have a printing press and want to donate printing... I know there is talk about maybe putting together a \"show\" about designers without health insurance (he does not have health insurance) and other subject matter to help raise awareness of situations that happen to artists more often than you would like to know about. So if you don't have insurance, it would be a good time to think about that._\n\n_Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you are well & that Joe gets better ASAP._\n\nDreadful news! Let's all wish Joe a speedy recovery.\n\n",

I just wanted to give everyone an update on my health. Last Wednesday I went to the ER for severe pain to my side and back. I soon found out that I had massive internal bleeding of the left kidney. I was in the hospital for a week and had surgery and 4 blood transfusions. I'm out of the hospital now and on bedrest. I am doing much better but I still have a way to go to get back on my feet. The only really bad thing is that I don't have health insurance...”_\n\n_“And I wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone that sent me get well messages!! It was very nice to hear from all of my good friends, old friends, and soon-to-be new friends that I have never met. Thank you! Thank you! It means alot to me. Feel free to email me at kral (at) testpilotcollective.com.”_\n\n"
