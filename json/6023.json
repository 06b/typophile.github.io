It's a logo for a professional athlete agency in the Southeast (Georgia, Alabama). I am dealing with a challenging client, and don't expect to be able to make many major alterations at this point\n\n",

      "content": "Scott,   \n   \nThe right stem of the \"V\" looks too thin. I think a condensed sturdier font under the icon may give it more stability. Also, in the space between the thin and thick bars on the stem on the G should be more straight. In the other parts of the logo, the taper is less obvious.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019130904im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/42599.gif)\n\n"

I will look into some potential alternatives for the title line, although the logo has already been approved, as is, so I was expecting to only make minor adjustments. The rectangles are not part of the logo, just showing the logo with a background for future applications. The identifying colors are PMS 274 and 871\n\n"
