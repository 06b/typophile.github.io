Altsys, who developed Fontographer from version 1.0–4.0 was bought during the early 1990s by [Macromedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921100800/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Macromedia). Macromedia then released version 4.1.\n\nFollowing version 4.1.x, Macromedia halted the development of Fontographer. For almost a decade, no serious work was done to the software, although several mysterious beta versions (Version 5) were floated to selected members of the type design industry. During the late 1990s, Fontographer began losing market share among professional designers, as [FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921100800/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontLab) became a more powerful tool. The lack of OS X support for Fontographer inflicted another serious blow to its market share.\n\nOn May 9 2005 [FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921100800/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontLab) Ltd. announced the licensing of the full Fontographer product line from [Macromedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921100800/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Macromedia) Inc. and its further development.\n\nMany well-established (i.e. older) type foundries have built custom [Python](http://web.archive.org/web/20130921100800/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Python) scripts that automate repetitive tasks in Fontographer. Thus some firms still use Fontographer.\n\n",
