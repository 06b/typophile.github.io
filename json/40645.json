  "content": " I’m helping my sister-in-law—a newly graduated physician’s assistant—with her résumé, and I’m not sure how best to display the list of her rotations. A three column layout (medical subfield, place of work, date) is easy, if dull; not left-aligning every blessed field looks better but may not be as readable—I’ve playing with the thing too long to say for sure.  \n Which form looks and reads best? Is there an alternative I’m missing and should be trying?  \n Thanks,  \n—Joel\n\n",
