  "content": "Hi Typophiles\n\nI am working on a packaging project with Edwardian Script ITC as the secondary typeface. The capital Z however is a bit tricky.\n\nDo anyone know of a script that has a capital Z that would fit together with Edwardian Script but be more regular in it's shape? Right now I am trying on Snell Roundhand on for size but would like to hear from you. The Z has to stay above the baseline because I need to place a small text below. Worst case I need to draw the Z myself but it would be an easier process if I could substitute the letter and kern my way to a nice result.\n\nI did a search and someone posted Ballantines, but the capital Z looks a bit like a capital L to me...  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ballantines+script+&site=d&start=26&num=25](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202105524/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=ballantines+script+&site=d&start=26&num=25)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202105524im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Z_for_Zoo_5707.png)\n\n",
