  "content": "Hi  \nI'm looking for a typeface suitable for a jewish cultural institution in norway. Ir will be used for signage, letters, exhibitions, publications etc., must work in all sizes, and feature small caps, osf and the usual \"expert\" stuff. I want it to be modern, legible, and with a tiny \"twist\" to it. With \"twist\", i mean Oversized ink traps, signature letters, characteristic italics etc. I've only found one so far (after thinking for one hour), is etelka by storm type foundry [http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-15-etelka](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328193239/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-15-etelka \"http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-15-etelka\")\n\nideas, anyone? should condensed versions be a criterium?\n\nthanks!\n\nalex\n\n",

Jews feel they are subject to regular unfair and negative portrayals, and so the clients, if they are Jewish, are likely to be sensitive, and maybe hyper-sensitive, to this.

But the challenge is of hitting the right emotional note, which the client and the museum visitors will intuitively feel. I am a fan of Soho, but I would think that something more humanist, like PMN Caecilia, would be more suitable, if you want to go in the direction of a slab. I still like Fedra better for this use, as it has both very modern and humanist qualities.\n\nI will be interested to see what Alex comes up with and the feedback from the client.\n\n"

It the Hebrew is only in displayed items, it is of secondary importance.\n\nVisually harmonizing Hebrew and roman is difficult, because Hebrew has thick horizontals and thin verticals, and roman is the other way around.\n\nThe most usual way to harmonize is by putting them in mirrored columns, so to speak.\n\nOne way is to use 'sans' style in both scripts, as these have less contrast. An interesting effort is the Hebrew font 'Erica Sans', (as in Eric Gill) which manages to 'Hebraicize' features of roman type in a good way.
