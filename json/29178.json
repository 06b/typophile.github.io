  "content": "This is coming from something I brought up in another thread. I've noticed that students tend to use a lot of \"classic\" types from Adobe, and to some degree I think this might be because Adobe seems to be the only foundry with a low-cost collection of type for students. To me this seems pretty tragic, as it means some designers will leave school having never used a font Adobe isn't selling, and that means we'll keep seeing those fonts again and again, until we all die, especially from the designers who settle on a few faces early and never switch.\n\nAre there any such collections from other foundries? Have any of you thought about giving students a discount on your typefaces and decided against it? If so, why? If someone started a service that licensed fonts only for resale at a discount to students and educational institutions, would you be willing to sell your typefaces that way?\n\n",

The reality just isn't.\n\nA EULA can say whatever it wants. Reality has to step in at some point in the equation.\n\nThe ONLY way to get students to drop their hard earned money on something they could otherwise get for free is to add value to it. It's called value-added marketing, and even if that \"value\" is just a bit of educational wisdom that comes with a purchase it still has a higher chance of survival on the market than one without it.\n\nThat's one reason why I as a student haven't bought anything from Fontshop.com. They don't list any of the qualities, attributes, history, etc. about their fonts that might make me want to buy their product over another foundries. For instance, I only bought Bodoni Classico after reading the \"You Say Bodoni, I Say Bodoni...\" article by Dave Farey. That info is nowhere to be seen in FF land. And even if it is, then the user interface sucks and needs to get fixed anyway.\n\nInstead of worrying about semantics, foundries need to be focusing on the reality of trying to get a student to value his fonts over his beer. Is this package of nice, decent, useable fonts worth more to me this semester than wasting my money on booze or whatever? You'd better well convince me, cuz I'm getting thirsty and my broadband is calling out to me to download something.\n\n"

BUT, fact is, they already are! you can get pretty much ANYTHING, even rare typefaces like didot elder. so its not a question of IF they are there, its a question of \"are there alternatives for students\" who are also possible future customers of indie foundries. of course there's the typical \"use system fonts or buy one font per month, because you cant afford more\", but we all know that the reality is different.\n\nin my opinion, underware is still a good example: if a foundry can achieve a good image with trendsetters, many people will follow. i have the sauna-book and im on their website every other week. likewise with ourtype, i attended a talk with fred smeijers and loved their sansa and their website.\n\nsome kind of \"indie font collection for students\" could have the same effect for the part-taking foundries. of course its a risk, but the reality right now is that students dont buy many fonts, they just download them. but as small foundries you have a way better image than adobe or linotype (\"the small guys\" and so on), and i actually think that small foundries could benefit from it.\n\n"

Dan, excuse me if I'm wrong, but the value-add when you use a specific font is the design itself. Isn't it? If a student is going to a file-sharing server looking for a specific font, this student was made aware of the font somewhere else. This student has already been marketed to and is now going about finding it to use it themselves. I'm sorry but you're going to have to do better than that.\n\nI was a student once, I remember how it was, you don't need to tell me. I couldn't even afford a computer of my own, let alone fonts.

Get 30% off when you buy 10 faces, or pick 10 (or 50) from this list, for one price, with proof of enrollment, or whatever. I very much agree there should be student prices for font software, just like there are for other graphic arts software. Every foundry has to decide what prices are appropriate, but it shouldn't present extra problems or dangers to offer this discount; the EULA is still the same, and the student has legit software. Worrying about whether that student will share it is a red herring. Students that pay for their own stuff are not the ones likely to share it.\n\nTiff, I would say Dan has a point with value added to fonts: specimens and information. We all need to look at what a typeface can do before we spend money on it. Whatever information is provided increases the possibility of a sale, right? Those specimens and samples are essential to combating the dull sameness of everyone using the same safe Adobe fonts until doomsday. Graphic designers in the US are a very conservative lot in my view, and only use type they've seen used a lot before.

      "content": "Dan, all:\n\nYes, I'm very aware of how the fonts are distributed. There is an entire new thread here which we could start. But it takes years of education and honesty to get a collector (student or otherwise) to do the right thing. It takes the teachers be responsible enough when they are teaching typography to spend a little time showing the students how to license type, how to read and understand a EULA. Then the student must adopt the right attitude. (This could easily be applied to a boss/employee scenario.)\n\nEveryone says we need more education, but no one listens when little bits of education are offered. Typophile is proof that there is education available. It is up to us, the typophiles, to take what we learn here and do our utmost to apply it to our daily lives.\n\nI think Thierry mentioned the EULA because of the same reason in regards to what he said to me.\n\nThe negative answer: But, honestly, if a student can't respect a EULA without having to be given a golden carrot too, then the chances are that student will never be a client to a foundry anyway.\n\nThe postivie answer: Many foundries know that marketing is important. For instance, Veer does a great job at appealing to designers, student and otherwise. Is that what you mean by marketing Dan? FontShop does marketing as well. They have their monthly newsletters with juicy information about a variety of topics and they usually include a free font to boot. The smaller foundries do what they can for marketing, but they can't afford to do it as big as Veer. That is expecting too much. At the end of the day the value comes from the font itself. I may love the Veer catalogues, but the catalogues aren't my tools, the fonts are. I need to know those fonts are technically sound as well as visually appealing. I look to large and small foundries alike. I am sucked in by pretty marketing, all designers are, but it is the pretty typefaces that keep me interested. That doesn't take a lot of marketing. It just takes a decent site with a good type tester.\n\nDan, maybe I'm not following what you are meaning to say.\n\nSo, for instance, if FontShop started adding the history of the fonts on the preview pages you would consider that a value-add?

It is a huge burden on them and it creates a desire to use these great fonts in their projects. But, the burden is never lifted by the teachers or those around them. So the students find themselves having to have the fonts. (I went through this myself.)\n\nI personally think that there **should** be a solution to this problem. One obvious solution is that the teacher's alleviate some of this undo pressure by assigning the fonts to the students which they can choose from to solve the problem. Another solution is to have the department head approach a foundry and make a deal with them based on x-number of workstations. It has to be done at that personal of a level. I think.\n\n"

For a low annual fee subscribers get access to hundreds of high quality fonts for student and faculty use. A tiered program to fit any budget, fonts are provided in managed sets, including “classic text faces”, “Best of the Bauhaus”, and the ever popular “Typophile Picks of 2003”._\n\nEach font set includes best sellers from foundries like X, Y and Z. These are the full complete retail OpenType versions of the fonts in question, the only difference being that they include a unique serial number encoded within each font file and font name linking the font to an educational establishment. For example “Gill Sans” would become “Gill Sans Ed4567”, where 4567 is a unique identifier associated with the school.\n\nThe fonts are managed by a custom version of “N”, the leading font management utility. The utility includes advanced font auditing technology to help ensure that all fonts installed on the school’s workstations are legally licensed. Using the tool administrators set parameters to allow or restrict additional font installation or purge unlicensed fonts.\n\nIn addition subscribers also receive access to printed and online material describing the art and science of font design and development, and for a small additional fee a real living breathing type designer will visit the school and give a lively presentation on type design to the staff and students.\n\n"

Include enough fonts to get a design student through 4 years. Make sure they are all 'high-tech' enough that it takes the students a few years to exploit all the OpenType nuances. Get it under a hundred dollars. Include a beautiful pdf with histories of the fonts and bio of the living, working designers. Include another pdf of the OT manual. Include an autoplay installer, and a specimen poster and printed book. Include bookmarks to the foundries' sites, as well as to a like-branded site that lets users get new styles every semester from a unique ID in the box (or DL package). USe the same ID to go to allow access to a 'typophile jr.'-like site where the students can get support from each other and the creating foundries and trade ideas on what the fonts can do. This also creates a great place to analyze what goes into the next rev.\n\nThe next step is get it into university bookstores, where they can pick it up and grab it. Give free copies out to facilty, and make sure it is quality enough for them to reccommend. Have it available to be purchased simultaneously online, and if possible, have a 4x more expensive version, for non-students to increase the perceived value.\n\nIf all of the above sounds like way too much work, it might be. The website sounds like a great place to start and to learn if the idea has momentum.\n\nKeep in mind one of the things that keeps some students from not paying for things that are downloadable is the image of moviemakers, software developers (Gates, Carmack, etc.) and musicians as insanely rich guys. It shouldnt be too hard to not put that across for Type Designers. Just not having the name 'Adobe' on it will probably help the humanity of the potential costomers kick in.\n\nWhen my own purchasable fonts come out soon, I am planning on having a student license available, which, unlike licenses, will not be transferrable. However, it will be viable for commercial work; my hope is that it will develop lifetime customers.

At Parsons, the students have access to a great selection of software and some very decent fonts on every university workstation.\n\nAs to students purchasing software (fonts included) I hear students talk all the time of going in halves or in threes to spread the cost out and then share the software. When I point out that is is not quite legal, they usually just giggle.\n\nI also have had more than one graduate student ask for free copy of ClearviewHwy for use on their thesis project, I comply but only after requiring a lot of documentation from them and their professors. They also must sign an education license, which has some fairly demanding terms in it. It is interesting how the interest in free fonts drops off once you ask for a little proof of commitment from them and their supervising professors.\n\n"

If a teacher prescribes a font collection, the price is far less of an object, as it becomes a \"school thing\", not part of dorm-life starvation, for many of the more financially assisted ones.

I see a lot of senior design students prepare for graduation by buying Powermacs, piles of design books, and loads of fonts just because the student loan rates are so low right now. Anything I buy is coming from loan money (since scholarships don't nearly cover tuition) and this being my second time in school and my second career, I'm pretty anal about my spending at times.\n\n<cite>So, perhaps I should stick to one point, for now. How many faces and how many fonts does a design major need for a college education?</cite>\n\nThat depends on one's major, school, and professors. While I'm sure some schools are happy to leave students to the fundamentals, others are really trying to draw attention to their programs, and expect students to really push boundaries and do wild new stuff and want to see a lot of hot new type in use.\n\n<cite>I ithnk one of the things that jpad wanted was an escape from the barrage of word/adobe fonts. Or, at least, to plant fresher seeds in the students’ minds.</cite>\n\nBingo. I've seen what availability did in terms of homogenizing web typography, and I often see students who don't pirate type fall into using the same Adobe fonts over and over. This concept came out of a couple recent discussions, and is in part a reaction to Lupton's free font manifesto, which I find interesting but reject because I find it to be anti-capitalist.\n\n<cite>So when’s the release date, jpad? :)</cite>\n\nIt depends. I just changed my major to plain vanilla graphic design, which means that I'll have to take more classes than I was planning over the next year-and-a-half. I'll probably start a web site of useful resources for design students this winter and do a bigger relaunch next summer if it seems like something I can get capital for. I'll have to explore licensing a lot more before I try to put an actual together.\n\n"

If I paid money for a disc of fonts, and each had it's own terms, I'd be more than a little irked. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind if there were some editable fonts to learn from and build upon, like 'Lab's free font or that one from SIL. But I would expect consistency of product amongst any restricted ones, whatever that might be. I'd suggest talking to a very small number of those Indies you would want to include first, and draft a license for them, that they can collaborate on, then use that amongst the rest.\n\nNow, it's tangent time...\n\n_is in part a reaction to Lupton’s free font manifesto, which I find interesting but reject because I find it to be anti-capitalist._\n\nI neither reject, nor endorse. It still too early in the game for me to take a stand, and I imagine it won't matter either way. No matter what I or others here feel, that free (as in hippie) fonts will take the place of the commercial workhorses. These fonts take advantage of the legal ignorance of the creative factor if type design and its reflection in US (and hence, worldwide) intellectual property policy on fonts. Eventually, a lower priced product will win, all other qualities being equal, and plain-jane book fonts will become absolute commodities. It is just too hard to compete with free.\n\nThe inevitability comes from the fact that once one person does the work its there, forever, so free code only grows. It's okay, I suppose. The market will change afterwards and like how Sun, Redhat and IBM have adapted to FOSS, we may adapt to FOSF? I sorta don't even mind (maybe), as part of it is retaliation by those who pushed copyright too far first.\n\nSpeaking of tangents and FOSS, I have to say, this Firefox 2 auto spell checking is quite nice.\n\n-Choz\n\n"

After posting my earlier comment, I emptied out Font Explorer and loaded only the available system/MS/Adobe fonts. Boy, is that depressing. There are a ton of classic workhorse fonts.
