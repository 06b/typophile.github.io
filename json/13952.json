  "content": "PageMaker was the first major desktop publishing application for personal computers, first released in 1985 by [Aldus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Aldus). With the advent of [PostScript](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/PostScript), users were able to create their own multi-page documents that combined text and graphics. Though PageMaker was overtaken by [QuarkXPress](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/QuarkXPress) in the early 1990s as the industry standard, [Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe%20Type) took over PageMaker when it bought Aldus in 1995. Though Adobe's primary page-layout application is now [InDesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102747/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adobe%20InDesign), PageMaker is still part of Adobe's product line.\n\nURL: [http://www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011102747/http:/www.adobe.com/products/pagemaker/main.html)\n\n",
