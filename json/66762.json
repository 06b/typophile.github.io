  "content": "Hello,  \nI'd like some of your expert guidance on selecting fonts to use in branding. The company is an eLearning producer and has been using Verdana for 100% of everything. Visually, I'm more relaxed when reading Calibri - as it's not as wide as Verdana. But I'm not sure that a switch to Calibri will mean anything to anyone else.\n\nHow do you recommend we go about selecting (and justifying) a new standard set of fonts for our marketing and corporate communication?\n\nThanks in advance for your insights.  \nIrene\n\n",

      "content": "IKEA switched over entirely Verdana last year and nobody outside of typography forums seems to have noticed.\n\nIn making a choice of type for branding, it helps to know as much about the company and product as possible.\n\nDoes the company already have an established identity? To what extent are they open to changing it?  \nWhat is the specific nature of the product line?  \nWho are the targeted customers? Are the people who buy the product actually the same as the end users?  \nWhere are they located? Do they want to express a regional association or conceal it, or do they feel it should be irrelevant?  \nWhat situations require specific font designations, and where can product/publication designers be allowed free rein? Is readability or brand identification the greater concern?\n\n"
