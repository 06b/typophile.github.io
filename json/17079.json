(See the sample from the Script Font ID Guide at [http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg12.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060110041524/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg12.html)). If you thickened the strokes, I think you could make a rough approximation of your sample using a font.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
