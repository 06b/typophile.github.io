My fonts look and work perfectly in Windows but when I paste text in mac I have these problems: 1. In Mac MS Word all my diacritics get cropped at the top, and in the greek version the “tonos” gets vertically distorted (as if it tried to accomodate in the vertical space) and 2. In Mac Fireworks 8 I paste text with diacritics and get something like this: informaci‘on (instead of informaciòn) though this seems to happen not only with my fonts. Could this be a problem of ascender settings? I compared mine with other fonts (Adobe, FontFont, etc) and lowered the ascender, but I still have this weird appearance of the accents in the Machintosh, as oppossed to the perfection I get from my Windows version. Could anyone give me a tip on this? THanx! BTW I’m using TransType to convert my WinTTF’s to .bin - And please excuse if this seems like a stupid question for some...\n\n [‹ FontLab \"Expand Strokes\": parameter missing](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202194416/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29008 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Unicode Capitalization and Small Capitals ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202194416/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36223 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
