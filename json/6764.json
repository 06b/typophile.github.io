The wave effect is not visible in the file itself but only when you print out of Quickbooks.   \n   \nDoes anyone use Quickbooks? If yes, have you successfully added your logo? If yes, how?\n\n",

Only trial and error will yield the correct size . . .   \n   \nSorry I don't have a copy of Quickbooks to test this theory with. Back in the day I did exports from Photoshop but since AI 10 has the WMF export feature, it's probably going to generate a graphic with a better chance of working.   \n   \nGood luck!   \nStuart :D\n\n"
