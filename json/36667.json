I’ve been looking to find a copy of the PLINC catalog. Someone is selling a vintage copy on eBay for $250. Is there any chance that House Industries would republish it? And Font Book sells for $100 in one place and $350 in another. Why is that?\n\n [‹ Politics, Typography, and PETS!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172810/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20879 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The September issue of Galley Gab published ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080106172810/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36682 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The one you see at Amazon is a probably a used copy of the older Third edition. No reason to pay that unless you want the very few fonts that aren’t included in the expanded revision.\n\n\\> Is there any chance that House Industries would republish it?\n\nI don’t think there’s a very good chance of that at all. But they will be releasing the type soon in a very interesting way.\n\n"

I hunted online for awhile yesterday and the average asking price seems to be between $200 to $300.
