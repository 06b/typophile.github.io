  "content": "Hi   \n   \nFirst post from a long-time lurker. I'm looking for affordable, condensed sans serif typefaces with small caps and oldstyle figures. So far I've found three: URW's Franklin Gothic T Condensed, John Sans Condensed, and Avenir Next Pro Condensed. I thought that Myriad Pro Condensed and Scala Sans Condensed were candidates, but they don't seem to have small caps. Can anyone suggest any others?   \n   \nI will be using the typeface for tables, captions and possibly subheads in technical reports that I write. It should complement Charter, which is my primary text face. Right now I'm leaning towards URW's Franklin Gothic; John Sans and Avenir Next are very nice but don't seem such good companions for Charter.   \n   \nI know there are plenty of nice condensed faces which don't have small caps or oldstyle figures (Gotham Condensed comes to mind), but I'm a bit of a, er, freak about these things.   \n   \nThanks a lot   \n   \nM\n\n [‹ Help - need old school type illustrations](http://web.archive.org/web/20081020043142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/6945 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Painters&#39; signatures ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081020043142/http:/www.typophile.com/node/6930 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
