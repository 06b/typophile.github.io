They will perform  \n«Der Vogelhändler» (The Bird Seller) by Carl Zeller.\n\nHere is a link about the story:  \n [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der\\_Vogelh%C3%A4ndler](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042632/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Vogelh%C3%A4ndler \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der\\_Vogelh%C3%A4ndler\")\n\nI thought to use some letters from book covers of Emilio Salgari.  \nThe covers have been made during the late 19th century. This operetta was performed in this period the first time and this gives me an opportunity for an hommage. It might be a small connection, but i will give it a try.\n\nThe logo will be used for an advertising campaign (ads, brochure, posters, etc.). So it has to work in different sizes. The following logo is still in a rough stage, but the idea has been accepted by the client.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vogelhaendler_5610.jpg)\n\nI would appriciate if you could give me some feedback about the readability and interpretation of the letters. Any general thoughts are also welcomed.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/figlio_crosso_3883.jpg)\n\nThis is one example, you can find more here:  \n [http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&um=1&hl=en&rls=com.microsoft%3A...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019042632/http:/images.google.com/images?svnum=10&um=1&hl=en&rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-us%3AIE-SearchBox&rlz=1I7GGLG&q=salgari \"http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&um=1&hl=en&rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-us%3AIE-SearchBox&rlz=1I7GGLG&q=salgari\")\n\n",

I work on that when I have the final composition of the logo.\n\n@november  \nas you can see in the third example, which is my favorite so far, it helps the readability without the doubles.

I like it and it's easy to read. It still has the flair of the first idea. I know it's a complicated logo, but when I just want to do something simple, I would use a suitable Font and type the words DER VOGELHÄNDLER. This is not what I had in mind and so I stick to the idea I had in the first place.\n\nThe second is the same as before. I understand why you think the double crossbar on the «H» should stay henry. It helps to underline the beginning of the word «HÄNDLER». The OG ligature is a nice touch to symbolize the romantic side of that operetta. Have I sad that, I think the Icon itself gives me the romantic side. I'm not shure if I'll use the ligature.\n\nI have a presentation tomorrow.

We do it the french way. Anyway you right, I don't need them there. So I'll get rid off them. I'm not shure how the phone number should be set, again in Switzerland we have some other ways of doin things. I'll have to do some research!\n\n@Alaskan\n\nSorry, but this doesn't work for me. It's too conservativ, traditional and the readability is gone. About the focal Point: I imagine someone gets off the bus and sees the poster hangin at a wall and reconizes the birds first, the logo second and the info copy at last, but doesen't have to do a step forward to read each off them. I might have to try that with a test audience, to be sure it works. Thanx anyway, it's a good point.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nFischers Fritz fischt frische Fische, frische Fische fischt Fischers Fritz.\n\n"

In case you don't know, Alaskan, the print size of the poster is actually irrelevant regarding readability. In any paged layout, all elements should be readable from a distance that's equal to the diagonal length of the page. The proportions in your example would clearly fail that test.\n\nBTW, I totally fail to see how an asymmetrical layout is \"more traditional\". If anything, it's the opposite.\n\n"

My solutuion should be in the criteria as mentioned in the post above.\n\n«they seem from different eras?»\n\nYeah, there are. The logotype is based on art nouveau letters.
