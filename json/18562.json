In 2006 they set up KAPITZA FONTS, a new font foundry specializing in dingbat and pictographic fonts.\n\n[Blossomy](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140250/http:/www.kapitza.com/?section=fonts-blossomy) explores the beauty of shapes and structures in nature. It is the result of a long term interest in the organic and erratic lines of natural forms. Blossomy is featured both on the cover and in the article ‘The decriminalisation of ornament.’ (pp.18-37) of Eye Magazine Spring 2006.\n\n[East End](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140250/http:/www.kapitza.com/?section=fonts-eastend) is a portrayal of the multitude of people and cultures living in the east end of London. It is where we live and work and are unceasingly inspired by.\n\nBoth fonts will be featured in the upcoming issue of Computer Arts (April 2006).\n\n(All illustrations are based on photographs which have been traced by hand.)\n\n[http://www.kapitza.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070813140250/http:/www.kapitza.com/ \"http://www.kapitza.com/\")\n\n‡‡‡‡‡‡‡\n\n",
