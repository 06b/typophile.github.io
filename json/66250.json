  "content": "i received this email from Craig Ward (Words Are Pictures) regarding the use of Alouette:\n\nI just wanted to drop you a line to let you know I used your font Alouette recently in a collaborative piece with fellow typographers Sean Freeman and Alison Carmichael for the If You Could... exhibition which opens tonight in London. We took 3 pieces of graffiti that jumped out of us and made them into some beautiful typography and had them laser cut out of wood and applied them directly to the gallery wall.\n\nHere's a little write up on Creative Review's blog, my piece 'Obstruct the doors...' is around half way down the page, Alison's is the first image:\n\n[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/january/if-you-could-collab...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012224647/http:/www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/january/if-you-could-collaborate-opens \"http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/january/if-you-could-collaborate-opens\")\n\nHope you like and thank you for creating one of my favourite font discoveries of last year.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nCraig Ward /  \nWords are Pictures\n\n[http://www.wordsarepictures.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012224647/http:/www.wordsarepictures.co.uk/ \"http://www.wordsarepictures.co.uk\")\n\n-----  \nNeedless to say, I'm psyched! Thanks to Craig for using Alouette and thanks to Mr Meek for creating such a cool toy and tool.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012224647im_/http:/typophile.com/files/alouette_woodtype_0_3653.jpg)\n\n",
