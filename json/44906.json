I’ve currently got helvetica neu 95  \nwith a -10 kerning, but it needs the eye of a master given that this site will be so minimal in its design, its all about the font...\n\nhere is the link,\n\n[http://www.studiopyro.net/clients/HSPR/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906204813/http:/www.studiopyro.net/clients/HSPR/ \"http://www.studiopyro.net/clients/HSPR/\")\n\nMany thanks,\n\nJ\n\n [‹ 40's fonts.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906204813/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45137 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Newer version of Matthew Carter's Elephant. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906204813/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45132 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Because I have to scroll horizontally it feels like unused space as opposed to white space. I think this is a great direction, but you need to be more ruthless in your grid and space usage. Looks like a fun project.\n\n"

Then, have the second monitor small sized and set with 1024x768 resolution (or even 800x600), so that you can see how things look to the 99% of net users who don’t have 23 inch monitors.\n\nAnd when you get used to the second monitor, and move all application palettes over to it, you will never want to go back to a single monitor.\n\n"

If it’s old grannies using hand-me-down computers from their sons-in-law, then perhaps you do, but if your clientele is going to be more sophisticated than that you can assume their equipment will be too. Unless of course they will be viewing it on their iPhones...\n\n"

It has everything to do with the browser viewport.\n\nWhat size is that? Anything.\n\nKeep in mind that ’sophisticated’ users are just as likely to be using smaller devices (iPhones, as stated, or sub-compact laptops) as much as they may be using huge monitors on their desktop.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the larger one’s monitor gets, two different scenarios can result: a) they use 1, much larger browser window to look at web pages or b) they use many individual, but smaller browser windows to look at web pages (or have many other applications open)\n\n"
