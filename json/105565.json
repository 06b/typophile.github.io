      "content": "Actually, there is more than one single font per logo.  \nTHE STRENGTH GUYS: main lettering is [Outage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=outage), hard to say for me the 2 other ones.  \nVINTAGE INFUSTRIAL: I'm pretty convinced you'll find it out in this [post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/typophile.com/node/105488#comment-562631). Without too much thinking, I guess [United](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection) Sans and Serif should do you job for both lettering and digit.\n\n"

      "content": "Ryuk, thank you for your reply. I am only looking for the main-title type. I believe [Outage](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=outage) is on target for THE STRENGTH GUYS and for VINTAGE INDUSTRIAL, I would say is [Liberator](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.losttype.com/font/?name=liberator). I had looked at [United Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.houseind.com/fonts/unitedcollection) on HI but the \"I\" differs, however, it may be used for the digit and other letters.\n\nWould you happen to know the type in the image below for the cinema/theatre name that says \"Oriental\"? It looks very near to something like Outage again, but unsure. Thanks again for your help.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cinema_5541.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry, can't name it but doubt it could be a font. Most of signages and neon letterings are custom but... [Jeff Levine](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Jeff_Levine) has done many digitizations of these signages. Here are some, in the same vein with a main difference on /A (but easy to reconstruct from /O top half part): [Waite Park](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/waite-park), [Sign Production](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/sign-production)\n\n"

I'm looking at [Home Room JNL](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/home-room/regular/) as well as [Eckhardt Poster Display JNL](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/eckhardt-poster-display/).\n\nThey remind me of [Liquor Store](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/liquorstore/) by [Chank Diesel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063457/http:/chank.com/index.php) which is another option I'm considering.\n\nMy plate is full and I'm going to see which one fits best. Thanks for your time, it's greatly appreciated!\n\n"
