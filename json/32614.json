  "content": "hi!  \nam a student of graphic design and have been keenly studying pixel fonts and have some fundamental doubts..have been reading up on the net but thought i could cross check just to be sure.  \nare pixel fonts also called bitmap fonts/raster fonts or do they mean seperate things??from all that i have read up on the net, people use them interchangeably and differently on each website.\n\nsecondly, in todays context, are pixel fonts being used solely for usage on screens and not for print? (i understand that dot matrix printers are still in usage and the usage of pixel fonts for print is mainly restricted here.)\n\nin terms of function, do pixel fonts serve only where legibility at small sizes is required and in flash animations??(on web). where the intention is aesthetic of course it's a different deal, but otherwise is this largely the area they are utilitarian in?\n\nthanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Bitmap fonts are fonts composed of bitmaps. A bitmap is an array of binary bits--ones and zeros. The computer displays these as black and white pixels on a black and white screen, for example. \"Raster\" refers to any grid-like array of dots or pixels.\n\nSo-called pixel fonts are outline fonts that simulate the appearance of bitmap fonts. Outline fonts are by nature scalable, but pixel fonts are intended to be used only at sizes in which their outlines exactly align with the pixel grid of the computer display.\n\n"

      "content": "Bitmap fonts (pixelfont or \"hard\") continue to flourish exactly because outline fonts do have rasterization problems. Essentially, outline fonts are a convenience, and are mismatched to the way they end up being rendered. In print the resolution is simply high enough that you don't notice the problem. But it's there.\n\nFurthermore, scalable fonts promote ignorance with respect to optical scaling.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Mark and hrant, I don't quite understand what you are relating. An outlined (vector) font should scale up perfectly. I don't see that with Mark's showing. That looks exactly like a pixel font enlarged in a non-vector program.\n\nAny program that does not understand vector will create a fuzzy image. Therefore, create the image in a vector-based program first. Then convert to the pixel-based program. In that way, you can not go wrong.\n\n"
