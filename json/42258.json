  "content": "Hi,\n\nI have a dense, very Excel-looking reporting project that is auto-generated into a pdf for screen and crappy printer use. For the text labels, which are typically all caps (not even small caps), I'm looking at using Calibri (or: Verdana, Trebuchet, Orator).\n\nMost of the report is taken up by numeral blocks filling the resulting grid cells. They'd be at most 3 characters (0.00) and have a color coding scheme ranging 30%-90% gray, but usually at about 50%. Not every cell is filled, ranging from 30% - 90% filled, depending on the report (the sparser ones are naturally easier on the eyes). The attached [image](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083103/http:/typophile/files/matrix.gif) is an approximation.\n\nWhat would be a good, legible font for the numerals?\n\nThanks,  \nJulie\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [matrix.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023083103/http:/typophile.com/files/matrix.gif) | 48.21 KB |\n\n",
