  "content": "Is there a type width between Regular and Condensed?\n\nIf there would be such a width, would it be too much of a splitting hairs sort of thing for users to understand?\n\nI've got a typeface in the works whose regular width is just too extended for my tastes. But for certain reasons, it has to be labeled the \"regular\" width. I have condensed weights too, which aren't really all that condensed, but are narrower than the regular.\n\nShort of renaming my axis points (which isn't a possibility here), is there a proper name for a width that would lie between these two points?\n\n",
