Right near Frankfurt. A state-run art university that teaches fine art, advertising, product design, set design, graphic design, and a bit of typography, amoung some other things. Between 600 and 700 students total. The professor for typography is [Friedrich Friedl](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922115856/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Friedrich%20Friedl).\n\n[Klaus Hesse](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922115856/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Klaus%20Hesse) has been the professor for conceptional design since 199. His work (including his professional work at [Hesse Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922115856/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Hesse%20Design)) is very typographic.\n\nType design has not been part of the curriculum officially since 1979. Many type designers have taught at the school, however. For instance, from 1947–1979, [Karlgeorg Hoefer](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922115856/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Karlgeorg%20Hoefer) taught calligraphy and type design there.\n\nThe school's website is [http://www.hfg-offenbach.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922115856/http:/www.hfg-offenbach.de/)\n\nIn 2004, several students came together to form a type design collective, [TypeOff](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922115856/http:/typophile.com/wiki/TypeOff) as several attempts to reintroduce it officially back into the curriculum were thwarted.
