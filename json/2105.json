I apologize for the poor contrast.   \n ![45rpm logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525000801im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/20660.jpg)   \n   \nI'm mainly looking for sans-serif letters that have have a slightly worn, broken-in quality (like wood or lead type that has seen better days). Also, they should be readable at smaller text sizes. The example that I've attached has slightly rounded corners. I'd appreciate any recommendations for similar typefaces as well.\n\n",
