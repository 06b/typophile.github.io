  "content": "Hello there typophiles! I've got quite a bit of a down-time and have decided to put it to good use and sharpen my type and lettering. I'm hoping to do a series of drawings of New Order song titles and crank one out every month. The first one up for the chopping block is “Fine Time.” I thought this title may be a good way to ease my way into this project given I only have to draw five characters.\n\nI would really appreciate your comments on the letterforms and maybe what I can do to add depth. Thanks!\n\nAce\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Fine Time.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725184854/http:/typophile.com/files/Fine%20Time.png) | 33.45 KB |\n\n",
