Too close to an ordinary sans-serif and too far from the Bauhaus-ish feel of the other letters. Work on them.\n\nI think you should have more thin-line breaks, on the R, P, A, D, B, N, M, W, Y & y.\n\nIt would be helpful to see a real text setting.\n\n-matt\n\n"

They seem too fine for the proportions of the letters to me. Have you tried them (the white wedges) larger?\n\nIn the caps, C and G (and maybe Q) are trying too hard to be round. They’re going to jump out too much from what is otherwise a well executed, pretty normal gothic. I like many of them, particularly B, R, M, and X. I’d like to see how they look mixed with the lowercase.\n\nI’d encourage you to add to, rather than replace, the specimens you post in the thread; it’s rewarding to see the progression of designs.\n\n"
