To show our love and support we decided to pay homage to Stephen with a [pixeltee](http://web.archive.org/web/20091124180602/http:/typophile.pixeltees.com/).\n\n<center> <br><img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091124180602im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/16401.gif\" alt=\"coles-front\"><img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091124180602im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/16402.gif\" alt=\"coles-back\"> <br> <br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20091124180602/http:/typophile.pixeltees.com/\">Click here to check out the Stewf Tee &gt;</a> <br>\n</center>   \nThrough the wonders of high-quality thermal transfer magic, you can have Stephen arrive at your door. Buy the Stewf tee so Stephen can afford to take a nice Swedish girl out for some [Jansson's Temptation](http://web.archive.org/web/20091124180602/http:/www.recipesource.com/ethnic/europe/swedish/janssons-temptation1.html).   \n   \nAny royalties from sales go to Stephen. It's his face on there, after all; it's the least we can do.   \n   \n   \n\n* * *\n   \nGot an idea for a Typophile Pixeltee?
