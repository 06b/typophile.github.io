I really like it and I don’t want to modify it.\n\nDoes anyone know if I would run into any copyright infringement if I leave it as is?\n\nHere is a pic attached.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624020504im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_5565.png)\n\n",

      "content": "If your question is whether you can use Times New Roman for your logo, there should be no problem; the thing to check is the End-User License Agreement ( [EULA](http://web.archive.org/web/20090624020504/http:/typophile.com/wiki/EULA)), but there may not be a clear one if this is the version bundled with an operating system. Regardless, it is a valid use of a font to use it in a logo—otherwise, purchasing a font wouldn’t be very worthwhile. There are sometimes limitations (e.g. you may not embed the font in a PDF, you may not use it in a video game without prior permission, etc.). If your question is about something else, such as the name or appearance, that I don’t know.\n\n"

      "content": "Yes, but the EULA issue isn’t going to affect you, if what you’re doing is using it to create a logo, then delivering the logo as vector art (or other image file.)\n\nAssuming you have the rights to use the font, then you can use it to create a logo/wordmark. then you can distribute the wordmark as an image file with no licensing issues.\n\nThe issue would only come into play if you’re going to do some sort of template design or similar, where you supply a use of the typeface, then each user would have to have the font licensed for themselves.\n\nSimilarly, you can use the font to create an image, then alter that image in any way you like. Say, you type out “MiMo” in TNR, then convert to vector shapes, then delete some of the serifs, and distribute the image file. That is a fine use of the type.\n\nWhat you can’t do is open TNR in Fontlab, delete some serifs, save as a font called Times for MiMo, and distribute the font (unless the EULA allows that.)\n\nJason C\n\n"
