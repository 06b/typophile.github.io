      "content": "Hello,  \nArabic is written and read right to left. There are 2 types of Arabic calligraphy, one called \"Naskh\" which is individual characters, and one called \"Requa\" which is script calligraphy. However, all Arabic authentic lettering should have supporting shapes either on top or underneath in order to be read the right way. These shapes are like dashes, circles and some other shapes. Those shapes stand for the vocal grammatical pronunciation. Its quite a complex calligraphy especially the \"Requa\", and thats the one used in the Holy Quoran Book.\n\nI hope that was of help.\n\n[http://vysionous.deviantart.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424144236/http:/vysionous.deviantart.com/ \"http://vysionous.deviantart.com\")\n\n"

      "content": "Are you looking for technical information on how to make an Arabic font?\n\nDespite its title, _Arabic Typography: A Comprehensive Sourcebook_ is far from comprehensive, much of its technical discussion is very weak and actually derived from examples of Latin type, and there are inaccuracies and omissions. There isn't a single good source of information of Arabic typography. For technical information on Arabic OpenType fonts, this is the best place to start:\n\n[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/intro.mspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424144236/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/intro.mspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/intro.mspx\")\n\nIf you are interested in the Arabic script in general, as opposed to the technical stuff, there is a massive amount of material written about the scribal heritage (I don't use the term calligraphy, because that refers to a very specific kind of art-text, and misses the point that most of what scribes historically produced is everyday text.\n\n_There are 2 types of Arabic calligraphy, one called “Naskh” which is individual characters, and one called “Requa” which is script calligraphy ... Its quite a complex calligraphy especially the “Requa”, and thats the one used in the Holy Quoran Book_\n\nThis is a misleading statement in many ways. There are many more than two styles of Arabic script. Naskh (also called Nesih) is not 'individual characters': it the most common text hand used in formal manuscripts, including most Qur'ans (in Persian influenced areas, Qur'ans are also written in the nasta'liq style).\n\nMohamed Zakariya, the leading Islamic calligrapher in the USA, is developing what promises to be an excellent website devoted to the Arabic script. Unfortunately, his page on different styles is not yet illustrated:\n\n[http://www.zakariya.net/history/examples.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424144236/http:/www.zakariya.net/history/examples.html \"http://www.zakariya.net/history/examples.html\")\n\n"
