This would have to be short, sweet and to the point, but something more than just:   \n   \nDon't steal fonts!   \n   \nFeed the designers!   \n   \nDon't steal fonts!   \n   \nI'd love to hear your suggestions. If you could tell a massive corporation what they should know about fonts, what would you write? Better yet, can you do it in Power Point bullet point style so popular in the corporate world?   \n   \nThanks!   \n   \nkristin\n\n",

You're supposed to look at those ads and think, \"I need to go out and buy that stuff right now!!\" The marketing experts here wouldn't have a clue what to do with your reaction!   \n   \nThanks for the links, Si, Tiffany and Stephen.   \n   \nMore input is welcome, as well.\n\n"
