  "content": "I'm using Mac OS X 10.2.6, and InDesign 2. I can't get InD to behave when it comes to Arabic typesetting. Does anyone know how to whip it into shape?   \n   \nI've tried adding Arabic to the \"input menu\" that is system wide, but then that language is disabled in InD. When I copy and paste Arabic text into InD, it comes through backwards, and all characters are isolated (no connecting forms).   \n   \nLastly, Lucida Grande is the only font with Arabic support that I can get to even show up in the font menu. I haven't purchased any, but there are several other fonts that ship with Mac OS X that have Arabic support, none of which show up when installed.   \n   \nIs anyone here doing Arabic typesetting? In InDesign?   \n   \nShukran,   \nbaaaAAAAAdeen!   \n   \nAlan   \n   \nPS - is there a way to disable the Command-space shortcut to switch between languages in the input menu? This is, of course, beyond annoying for designers. Zoom in ... no! switch languages!\n\n",

I'd like to see that happen. Since Winsoft are so far ahead of Adobe on GPOS handling, it would be great to see their code rolled into Adobe's layout engine.\n\n"
