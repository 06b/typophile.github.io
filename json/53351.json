  "content": "Whe I saw Raphael Freeman's profile picture, I was reminded of a question I've had for some time: Is there a good reference for historical Hebrew lettering—perhaps even the Aramaic alphabet? Is there another engraved inscription as old as the \"place of trumpeting\" stone from the Temple?\n\n(I know the (Koren) [Yerushalmi] font is based on these forms; I'm wondering where there are good primary sources.)\n\nETA: I just remembered that Koren is based on the letterforms in the Aleppo Codex; my question has been corrected.\n\nEATA: Also I found the Uzziah Tablet online. Are there other good examples? I'm sort of looking for the equivalent to Trajan's column.\n\n",
