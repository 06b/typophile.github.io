I can not seem to find a font that flows well when in a circle or a curve. I am looking for guidance as tot he types of fonts I should inquire about as well as specific font suggestions if you have them. The text will be written in Albanian, which uses a modified Latin alphabet. Thank you in advance for your help.\n\n [‹ Heavy Metal Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20080604094311/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1332 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Alternative to/information about LinoLetter ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080604094311/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35924 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You might start with the letter shapes from a font, but they will have to be customized to fit the curves.\n\nIf it isn’t too much trouble, could you share a rough sketch of your tattoo, lettering only for positioning and not style? Also, please translate what the words mean. This should give us more to go on in thinking up suggestions.\n\n"
