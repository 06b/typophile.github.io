Buffalo is home to our dear friends at P22 type foundry, is close to our great pals at the Type Club of Toronto, and is a city full of incredible architecture (thank you, Frank Lloyd Wright), the Roycrofters in the region, and a cultural renaissance suited to all appreciators of the fine arts, contemporary music, innovative architecture, and design. We are back at a Hyatt, which we loved in Boston, and look forward to a fantastic event in the Buffalo-Niagara region.\n\n",
