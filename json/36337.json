  "content": "hi everybody,\n\ni hope i am not putting this question in the wrong place, although i guess i am b/c it is a backwards type ID — that is, i know the name of the font, but i just can’t find where to buy it, or even if it is for sale.\n\nso maybe, what i am asking for is similar fonts to this one?\n\nit seems that script fonts are somewhat in style now? so i was looking at some type books and found this cool font in the book “typology”, on page 63, #141, it is called “lo kursiv” and is by louis oppenheim and the type specimen sheet says “h. berthold ag” and 1912.\n\ni looked online and found a foreign site that mention it (a type forum i think in german?), and that has some images (attached), but i can’t seem to find a foundry that has digitized it and sells it.\n\nany ideas? it is a pretty cool font.\n\nthanks guys!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327074605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/503a_gruppe_viii __schreibschriften__ lokursiv_6663.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327074605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/503b_gruppe_viii __schreibschriften__ lokursiv_3803.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) Flower Mounds Jaguars w/ spiky serifs - (similar to) Penumbra {Mike Y}](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327074605/http:/typophile.com/node/36429 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Cherry Tomatoes\", not Cooper nor Goudy HeavyFace - ITC Souvenir {Jason C} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20090327074605/http:/typophile.com/node/36420 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
