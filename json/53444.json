  "content": "Hello all,\n\nI have recently noticed the lack of professional quality fonts available under open licenses here that are of any professional value.\n\nApple and Microsoft may have the money to license typefaces from other groups, or pay to have typefaces developed for them, but a community-built operating system depends on the community to contribute each in their own little way.\n\nI am looking for any open fonts on a professional level, there are a couple already like Gentium, Bitstream Vera out there, which is a great start.\n\nAre there any more freely available and freely redistributable fonts you're already aware of?\n\nI urge all of you who benefit daily from open-source technology (Firefox, Openoffice, even Typophile is hosted on a linux server) to consider contributing some of your work towards the community that has provided you with so much software.\n\nI am looking to build a package of only the highest quality typefaces under a free licenses and make that available for download on my site related to Linux and Design, but they would be valuable to people on all operating systems.\n\nAlso, the availability of professional alternatives might help even just a couple from pirating or stealing those fonts type designers sell to make a living. hopefully together we can give the community something valuable, generate more interest in good typography and at the same time help support those commercial designers who rely on font sales.\n\nAnd lastly, by releasing one font for free with credit to a group of open-source users who desire fresh new fonts, you can direct traffic to your other reasonably priced fonts and this will more thank likely channel an entire new market of clients that are currently not buying your fonts.\n\n",

Even Firefox is programmed primarily by programmers paid by Google (and is built on the old Netscape code), which pays the Mozilla foundation millions of dollars for search results from the search tool. The notion that great open source code is being freely given away by a bunch of generous hackers is largely nonsense; without financial backing of entities who have financial or other interests the code would not exist.\n\nAnd like all those paid programmers I have plenty of bills to pay. Going through design school put me in debt up to my neck. I’m not about to give my work away—especially when a global recession is kicking my ass. If the Open Source dorks can’t live without GNU/BSD/CC licensed fonts they need to convince someone with deep pockets to fund the labor.\n\n"

Open-source projects are known for turning into flame wars over simple things like indentation styles or code comments; imagine what happens when half the group decides the Akzidenz revival needs to look more like Futura.\n\nCommunal efforts with no funding are just going to create what the F/OSS world already has plenty of: malformed, disjointed, unfinished fonts that get used to pad out those 10,000 fonts for $4.95 collections.\n\n"

Based on the interaction I've seen on this site I never would have expected such an averse reaction to the idea.\n\nI understand that this is what people do for a living, but simply because something is released does not mean it is a free-for-all and subject to derivative works. What if the fonts are released in a CC-BY-ND licence, your work would be free to use and distribute, and even use commercially, but they would still be required to give you credit at the author, and they would not be allowed to make derivative works based on your typeface.\n\nAs for the big question of what do I get out of it, I think it's pretty clear. I personally have been using linux since 2001. I've used Firefox since it was Mozilla Phoenix, then Mozilla Firebird. All mac users use a proprietary desktop, built on an open-source kernel called Darwin. Safari is based on the open-source webkit engine, which was based on the khtml engine from the open-source desktop KDE.\n\nIf you've visited 3 websites in your life, chances are 2 of those depended on open-source technologies to be served to you. If they use Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal or another popular CMS it would also be running open-source software.\n\nIf you've ever been to wikipedia you've benefitted from open content, run on open-source sofware, hosted on open-source servers. And some of you have personal entries on that site too.\n\nSo, what do _you_ get out of it? I'd say you've already benefited from open-source in so many ways they could never all be listed. Although many other groups of people (programmers, artists, musicians, photographers, 3d modelers, etc) have seen the open-source movement and joined in, helping each other out, it has become very clear to me that type designers are a cold, ungrateful group of people.\n\nIt may take a company funding development to get a good typeface designed, but it's shame that it would require that before anybody would consider 'giving'. Because if you're paid, you aren't giving at all. Well, I hope you enjoy your fonts all by yourself then, and I expect none of you will use open-source software again (or visit the linux-hosted Typophile) because it's all just trash anyway.\n\nAre you guys serious with this response? When a schoolboy comes to your door raising funds for a charity do you tell him to get himself a job and donate his own money? I can't believe how cold-hearted this thread is. Khakis-on-Fire is the only one who understood what I was suggesting.\n\n"

People redistributing software do not want to get bogged down in crediting everyone who contributed something. These licenses got washed out of the free software over a decade ago when BSD distributions were shipping with multi-page lists of code authors.

I’ve used damn near every Unix system out there at some point, and I dumped Linux back in 2001 because it isn’t worth the headaches. I haven’t run Linux without regretting it in ages. I certainly don’t think Linux is worth giving fonts away.\n\n<cite>All mac users use a proprietary desktop, built on an open-source kernel called Darwin.</cite>\n\nThe UNIX code under the hood of Macs was developed by people working for AT&T, the University of California, DARPA, IBM, HP, SGI, Sun, NEXT and plenty of other organizations who had financial support coming from cold-war era defense projects.

This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).\n\nI've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)\n\nLinus ( [torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi](mailto:torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi))\n\nPS. Yes – it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.\n\n**\"And the Linux operating system as a whole is hardly the work of hobbyists.

I'm not saying that you should design a font-family for free. In fact, I only stepped in to clarify that many open source projects are started as hobbies that grow into something much more. Too, I never said that Linux was STILL a hobby. It's obviously much more than that now.\n\nFurthermore, what would it matter whether the programmers were doing it be philanthropists or merely \"nerds\" who wanted to mess around with code? They released it OS/Free all the same. And again, I AGREE that this sort of thing wouldn't really work with type design. However, if type design is something that you love to do, and you find yourself fiddling with a font in your down time, just \"tinkering\" around with it, why not release it for free if you're already not being paid for it? After all, OS/Free also doesn't mean that a team of people HAS to work on it. A lot of my favorite software comes from a single coder who is nice enough to share their personal projects with the net.\n\n"

The only problem with truly open-source typefaces is that, to its designer, a typeface is more than a purely functional tool. Trying to move typefaces into the open-source spirit of collaboration is tricky, for the same reason that an artist doesn't expect people to add more brushstrokes to his painting after he finishes it. While there are certainly technical aspects to type design, it is ultimately much more subjective than coding is. Someone earlier raised the issue of how a type designer would feel if someone suddenly decides that shortening the serifs would look better.\n\nI dunno, maybe I'm expressing it too simply, but I think that that's the major roadblock preventing type designers from joining the open-source community.\n\n"

      "content": "Given the generally generous spirit of typophilers, I must say that I have been surprised at the backlash against this request. After all, the motto of Typophile is \"Typographic Collaboration\".\n\nIn response to this bitterness, I would like to highlight how this forum has, indirectly, perhaps already contributed to the requested project. Typophile is a forum in which experienced type designers can share their knowledge both among themselves as well as among less experienced designers. Without the Typophile forum we likely would not be seeing, on the one hand, the quantity or quality of free fonts that are being released these days, nor, on the other hand, the number of people would be in a position to contribute to such a project. So while it might be imprudent to try to design a coherent type system using collaborative strategies similar to those used in the open source community, this forum likely has given knowledge to many people who could participate in a more organized, even modestly funded project. And many of these people would not have the knowledge they do without this forum.\n\nAs a final note, I do not believe that the massive [M+](http://web.archive.org/web/20150227041338/http:/mplus-fonts.sourceforge.jp/mplus-outline-fonts/index.html) type system has been mentioned. Most of the page is in Japanese, but the English portion reads thus:\n\n<cite>These fonts are free softwares.<br>\nUnlimited permission is granted to use, copy, and distribute it, with or without modification, either commercially and noncommercially.<br>\nTHESE FONTS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY. </cite>\n\nSince I can't read Japanese, I don't know if this project was/is funded or not.\n\n"

You question my ability to assess the hours of work that go into designing a typeface simply because I threw a question out knowingly against the odds? I don't see the logic in that.\n\nI don't think you have any basis for making statements calling my understanding of open-source development, the differing contribution models or the knowledge of different open-source funding models into question.\n\nI lack the authority on this forum to close a thread, but that cannot change my desire to do so. I think that while you all line up to take your respective shots at a young designer with your witty and _élite_ comments you might be losing sight of the fact that I'm not just some anonymous thug holding you at gunpoint and asking politely for your wallets, but one of you.\n\nI asked for a willing contribution, and if you don't find that in yourself I'm reminded of another saying: _\"Nothing to see here, move along, move along.\"_\n\nI could spend my time sitting here and replying to each of your individual personal attacks, flawed logic, inconsistent illustrations of the way you perceive the nature of open-source development, and insults - but at the end of the day I would have hoped you'd agree that my time could be spent doing something of greater benefit. I will simply consider the source and allow disappointment.\n\nYou have collectively, and completely, shocked me. It's not often you misjudge an entire collective of people, but it appears that in my life thus far I have become too accustomed to the helpful and giving nature of the open-source communities in which I take part.\n\nI offer not just those who have wasted five minutes of their time conjuring a seemingly harsh response to my ludicrous question, but to all members here, my most heartfelt apology for being so incredibly and publicly naïve, and through my suggestion placed a burden on your conscience that merited such hostility to overcome.\n\nI imagine you'll see less of me on here after this, I have greater things to accomplish than to become so consumed by money and propriety that I wither and rot into a bitter state of existence. Personally, the satisfaction for the work I do derives directly from how many people I am able to help through it, not from the money I can acquire if I keep ownership of it. I have now understood my error and will spend my time amongst people closer to who I wish to become.\n\n"
