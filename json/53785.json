  "content": "Hi all!\n\nI'm happy to announce that we've done Italics for our Foco fonts.  \nGentle angle, slightly narrower, cursive features; great for subtle emphasis on body copy and beautiful at display.\n\nThe italics are long waited and requested a number of times, including here at Typophile.\n\nHope you like it?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823092419im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Foco_ToTypophile_4667.gif)\n\n[www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/foco](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823092419/http:/www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/foco \"www.daltonmaag.com/browse/fonts/foco\")\n\n(A few samples and details can be seen on my flickr: [http://flickr.com/photos/fabiohaag/3214681859/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823092419/http:/flickr.com/photos/fabiohaag/3214681859/ \"http://flickr.com/photos/fabiohaag/3214681859/\") )\n\nCheers\n\n",
