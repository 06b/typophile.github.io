  "content": "Hi Folks,\n\nThis old movie title type is eluding me. The closest I found was Nick Curtis' version of the Saturday Evening Post type that he called \"Saturday Morning Toast\". It's at least from a typeface older than the movie, but it's not a great match. The rounded tops of the R and B should be good earmarks, but this may never have been digitized. I looked in the McGrew book, skimmed the Solotype Catalog, and even looked in a Photo-Lettering catalog.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?\n\nThanks,  \n- Mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140701102751im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RebelGirls_6137.gif)\n\n",

I think that's why I thought this looked familiar at first, but clearly not the same type.\n\n- Mike\n\n"

      "content": "It’s LSC Book, which used to be part of the ITC library. There’s no authorized digital version as far as I know.\n\nNow, LSC Book wasn’t released until around 1970, so you might think that would rule it out. However, the film was originally titled _Cuban Rebel Girls_ when it was released. In a later reissue of the film, the title was changed to _Assault of the Rebel Girls_. I don’t have a date for that, but judging by the type it was after 1970.
