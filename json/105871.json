I've used many online tools to try and identify it and no luck. Letters that stand out to me are the W,V,T, and U. I wasn't sure how to classify it. It looks part script part serif. Please help me identify what font it is.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Vinque \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [donshottype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140154/http:/typophile.com/user/205259 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Diablo3worldmap.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317140154/http:/typophile.com/files/Diablo3worldmap.jpg) | 275.48 KB |\n\n",
