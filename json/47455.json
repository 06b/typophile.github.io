  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI'm working on a minor update to my design co.'s logotype.\n\nOriginally my goal was to improve its look and legibility at small sizes, but upon recommendation from a very talented type designer friend, I revisited the form of the tail on the Q \"to play up its weird, organic shape, to balance it better with the \"O\" part, and by extension balance the Q better with the A.\" as he put it.\n\nWhat I did to the Q tail:  \n\\* Heavier at bottom  \n\\* Curvier curves  \n\\* Tail extends deeper into the center of the O  \n\\* A little longer  \n\\* Added a bit of flatness to the pointy ends\n\nThe total effect seems to feel more calligraphic, definitely clearer  \nat smaller sizes. I worry I lost a tiny dash of the personality of the  \noriginal \"slug\", but maybe that can be reasserted, or maybe it's not  \nsuch a big deal.\n\nIf I stick with this direction, it seems like the A needs a bit of  \n\"dressing up\" to match. Especially after adding that vertical flatness  \nto the sides of the Q's tail's tips, the current contrast with the Q  \nmakes the A feel even more like a plain-jane rounded sans.\n\nSo, how am I doing? Any suggestions on the \"A\"? Leave it alone? The original was better?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [aqlogo-2008-refresh.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150425030011/http:/typophile.com/files/aqlogo-2008-refresh.png) | 10.63 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hey, what's up cpalmieri...I understand where you're coming from. I do like the second version; the Q seems more pronounced with the height of the tail extending more into the inside. I also like the cleanliness and legibility when it's scaled down. Have you tried to make the bottom of the right side of the A curl towards the Q just a bit for balance between the two letters? Good luck with everything, I know how frustrating it can be. I would like to see what you come up with...\n\n"
