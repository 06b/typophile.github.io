(I think Aquamarine has alternate letters that may match the A better.)\n\nSome other fonts, like [Hollandse Mediaeval](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210105445/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/cg_hollandse_mediaeval_signature_virtual/), might match the other letters better.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
