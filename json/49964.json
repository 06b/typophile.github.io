      "content": "Diego,  \nI think that many of the embroidery fonts don't necessarily have a corresponding print face, as they were set up specifically for the sewing industry, and what works with yarns.\n\nWhat most of the script fonts don't share is the script lower case with the very pared down/almost print glyphs of the upper case in the sample you posted.\n\nYou can try [Commercial Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623001353/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/commercial_script_virtual/?sample_text=Lilly%20Beach%20House) or [Monotype Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623001353/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=monotype+script&x=0&y=0&sample_text=Lilly%20Beach%20House) for a similar proportion/weight.\n\nOr if you are having something actually embroidered you may find an existing similar embroidery font - [Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20120623001353/http:/www.llbean.com/shop/guidePages/monogram/index.html) for example comes very close.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
