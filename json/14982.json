Specifically, I would like to take advantage of the [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20150303172158/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) features available in some of my good fonts.\n\nThe problem is Microsoft Word doesn’t support the OpenType features, and I can’t write my papers in InDesign because it lacks some of the essential features of Word (e.g. Spell Check as you type, Thesaurus, Grammar check, etc). Besides, I’m much more comfortable using Word for the actual writing. However, I’ve become fairly familiar with InDesign’s robust type formatting options so when it comes time to take the type into consideration I would like to be able to use them. But when I import my Word documents into InDesign—or Illustrator for that matter—everything gets thrown in to one text block and I lose my page breaks, pagination, footnotes, etc.\n\n**So here’s my question: is there a way to import/open Word documents in InDesign or Illustrator and not lose any formatting?**\n\n",

I guess it could happen eventually by accident, but I'm still not bothering to try to make it work.  \nBoth Microsoft and Adobe have \"mature\" markets, which means they don't have any close competitors.

You can still have something better than the typographic average if you use the tool properly. For instance, since you're not going to have ligatures, you choose a font that doesn't need them, and so on. Get the margins and leading right. Do everything using defined styles, set up in advance, using templates. What you get will not be perfect (it won't be what you would want if you were actually publishing a book), but it will not only be acceptable, it will be significantly better than average thanks to a little typographical refinement.\n\nI would save InDesign for the very occasional piece that you want to make look even better. You then resign yourself to writing in Word (say), and then pasting it all into indesign and marking it up, which you do only when the \"manuscript\" is absolutely perfect in Word. For instance, if one were writing a PhD dissertation, one might do this as the last stage before submission. But not until then. For ordinary school papers it really is not worth the trouble.\n\nOne alternative is LaTeX, which will give you typographic refinement to some degree. I'm quite a fan, and if you are doing anything involving mathematical or symbolic things, LaTeX is probably the way to go. The trouble is font installation and set-up, and there is a very steep learning curve.\n\n"

Every document I work on has a \\*structure\\* I don't want to deal with structureless documents. I use the excellent Word 2003 to define the structure of my documents through styles. The actual formatting of the styles does matter as well: I usually set up Word so the proportions of the text column and the type parameters are equivalent to what I will use in the final typesetting. This way, I can estimate how much my text will occupy in the printed matter as I type (things like counting words are just a crude and primitive approximations.)\n\nI always use Word's native .doc format to move my files into InDesign, and of course I \\*only\\* work with styles (no manual formatting). What I haven't tested out extensively yet is InDesign's support for footnotes (I don't mean \"footnotes that appear at the end of the text\" because that's not \\*footnotes\\*, that's endnotes). Apparently InDesign CS2 has some support for real footnotes.\n\n\\> And forget about Word’s Grammar Check — it’s laughable.\n\nOn the contrary. I think Word's proofing tools are very useful, especially for a non-native English speaker such as myself. I use them in all the languages I write: Polish, German, English, Russian. Of course, as with any automatic tool, I would rarely trust it blindly.\n\nWhenever Word's grammar check underlines my sentence (or the spelling check highlights a word), I take it as a good opportunity to review it. Sometimes, the sentence is just fine so I ignore the warning, and sometimes it can actually spot things like a verb that I omitted by mistake.\n\nFrom the usability point of view, InDesign doesn't even come close to Word when it comes to editing text. Half of the useful shortcuts are not there in InDesign, and everything is slow. But most importantly, the 4-5 dictionaries that I have installed on my Windows machines all have Word macros that integrate them in Word, so I can do things like English-Polish translations right from Word without any copy-pasting.\n\nFinally, for the languages other than English, Word's proofing tools also beat InDesign's by miles. You could call the German or Polish spellchecker in InDesign at best \"experimental\" while the ones in Word are quite solid. I don't blame InDesign for that -- for last-minute checkups the spellchecker is perhaps useful but the only thing that I really need to work well in InDesign is the hyphenation algorithm.\n\nAdam\n\n"

Word's Grammar Check flags items which are perfectly grammatically correct, overlooks items that are patently grammatically incorrect, and often makes totally erroneous suggestions (_its_ and _it's_ being perhaps the most egregious one, _than_ and _then_ being a close second).\n\nYes, Word is a much more capable **word processing** program than InDesign, as well it should be: I don't think that I suggested otherwise. Use its (proper usage) tools to write the words (or get a semi-accurate idea of how much space those words will occupy, although there does exist an arcane discipline, known to some of us old-time typesetters, called copyfitting, which would serve equally as well); but chuck Word's formatting (basically .rtf) when you export those words. Apply your styles in the page composition program, which is one of the areas in which that particular kind of program excels.

Of course RTF is only an imperfect replacement for a proper distinction between structure and formatting. To do it properly, one uses XML (to devise the structure) and CSS, XSL, or any other formatting language, to devise the formatting.\n\nCurrently, the XML support in Word 2003 is only very basic but I hope it will improve in Word 12, so I can author my XML files in Word and move them to InDesign. Until then, I'll stick with RTF.\n\nFor me, the whole point of spellchecking or grammar checking in word processing applications is not making suggestions but pointing my attention to \\*potential\\* errors.\n\nThere is this feature in FontLab called FontAudit. Some users take it literally and instead of making an reasonable assessment, they try to fix every single potential problem that FontAudit flags. I could never understand that \"the computer tells me to\" attitude. When it comes to assessing legitimate situations vs. errors, the human brain is still eons ahead of computers. Automatic spellchecking does not lift the necessity of proofreading the text. And yet, it can be useful for identifying possible deficiencies by simply highlighting portions of text that need double-checking. With grammar checking, it's the same thing.\n\n\\> for native speakers who have degrees in English language  \n\\> and literature\n\nPlease forgive me (and some 700 million other people) for not having the \"luxury\" of being member of that \"elite\".\n\nAdam\n\n"

Russian is one I'm currently working on.  \nTried placing directly, and copying to Text Edit then to InDesign and saving as RTF and get pink boxes.  \nSo I tried inputting myself. Opened International Input menu and turned on Russian (Cryllic) Also tried languages with CE input. Then I chose the language under the flag menu and opened my Keyboard Viewer. I chose TNR PS in Keyboard and started typing. The Russian characters appear in Keyboard, but come out as pink boxes or highlights in InDesign when I type.  \nThe only font I can get to work is Times, but the client does not want True Type.\n\nAny solutions?\n\n"

As Levon said, starting a new thread for a new topic can help keep things from getting lost.\n\n1) The response to the original question would be: InDesign CS didn't have a footnote feature, so the Word footnotes are imported as a block. The latest versions do support footnotes and they import correctly.  \n2) Martin: Hebrew can be formatted very professionally using the ME version of InDesign, which was adapted by [WinSoft](http://web.archive.org/web/20150303172158/http:/www.winsoft.eu/products_solutions/adobe-indesignCS3.php).  \n3) InDesign doesn't ship with a thesaurus but InCopy does.  \n4) The pink boxes sounds like you are using Cyrillic text with a font that doesn't have Cyrillic support. Many more informal applications support a \"font fallback\" mechanism to use some font to draw missing characters. InDesign generally will use only the font specified to prevent unintentional use of other fonts.\n\n"

[To be sure that the file type really gets changed, do File \\> Get Info (Command+I) and edit the Name & Extension field]\n\nOnce you're done with the above, you'll need to put the .JSX file inside a folder that InDesign will access. If you're using CS2, the location of that folder is `Adobe InDesign CS2/Presets/Scripts`. If you're using CS3, the location of that folder is `Adobe InDesign CS3/Scripts/Scripts Panel`.\n\nAfter you've \"installed\" the script, just go to InDesign and open the Scripts palette by doing Window \\> Automation \\> Scripts. You should now be able to see the 'Footnotes2Endnotes.jsx' script. To run it, just double-click on it.\n\nNow it should be pretty straight forward to use the script.
