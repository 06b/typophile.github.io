  "content": "Hello Typophiles!\n\nHere I present my latest experiments. Intended to be a title/display font, these are the very first sketches. So far I think it is promising. What do you think about it?\n\nWould be nice to have some Q&Q. Thank you in advance.\n\nP.S.: working title is Pontifex, but I've found a font family named Poppl-Pontifex. I'm not sure if I should change the name. Should I?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416100002im_/http:/typophile.com/files/pontifex_test_012_3575.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pontifex\\_test\\_01.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416100002/http:/typophile.com/files/pontifex_test_01.pdf) | 392 KB |\n\n",
