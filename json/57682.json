The idea was to create something a bit “weddingy”, but not too formal, more fun.\n\nThis has been my fist serious attempt at designing any lettering “from scratch”: It’s been tough! I’d appreciate any feedback and critiques, especially on curves that look weird and the kerning- i’m not really sure how to kern a semi-script text.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [broll11.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515082322/http:/typophile.com/files/broll11.jpg) | 13.84 KB |\n\n",
