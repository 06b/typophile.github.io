  "content": "I created this typeface for the masthead of a cartographers’ magazine called “Atlas.” I wanted to make something elegant and soft, a contrast to the Myriad Condensed design the publication feutured before. I decided to use Whitney Book and Medium Small Caps as the secondary typeface.\n\nSo, tell me what you think\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811133143im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Atlas3.jpeg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Atlas.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811133143/http:/typophile.com/files/Atlas.pdf) | 184.77 KB |\n| [Atlas2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811133143/http:/typophile.com/files/Atlas2.pdf) | 22.93 KB |\n| [Atlas3.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811133143/http:/typophile.com/files/Atlas3.pdf) | 21.7 KB |\n\n [‹ Surfs Up Menu](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811133143/http:/typophile.com/node/17336 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo for zozieikhet.nl ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070811133143/http:/typophile.com/node/17734 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks for the imput on the “a.” The design I originally made was in much bolder weight, and i only tweaked it a little, I guess not enough for the light version.\n\nI reduced the space between the upper part of the “a” and increased the t’s height and put it against blue to increase contrast. I was wondering if maybee I should widen the t’s horizontal bar a little, you can see it up top as Atlas2.pdf\n\nAnything thing else would be greatly appreciated\n\n"

      "content": "I opend you pdf in Illustrator and saw that the glyphs have a lot of anchor points. Was the original typeface a truetype? The outlines are not smooth. When you remove all the points you don’t really need, you can control the surves better. Import your logo into FontLab or Fontographer and clean up the curves. Or do it in the program you made the logo in.\n\nPieter\n\n"

      "content": "I would reduce the crossbar on the left of the t, and at the top of the l. The area around the lower serif of the s is a bit “black” (in that it’s more solid than some of the other characters) I think you could look at reducing the width of the stroke as it enters the serif and generally try to get the stresses to marry up with those of the a.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Ok, I lightened the lower serif of the “s” and tried to simplify the “a” and “s” anchor points. Unfortunately, these are simply scans taken from Streamline of a handdrawn image. I tried shortening the the upper “l” serif and the “t” crossbar, but i personally prefer them as is.\n\nThanks for all your helpful comments, i just looked at my first and third version and realized how much more refined it looks.\n\nAnything else?\n\n-Alex\n\n"
