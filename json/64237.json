Do we know that they are fonts?\n\nAs far as the Korinna U, there have been versions of Korinna (usually by other names), where the U is like the one you showed above. I suspect that’s because the original U was a bit too strange (archaic) looking to whoever was planning to sell these copied and renamed versions. Image Club once had something they called ITC Korinna, but the lighter weight had the standard U as you showed, while the bold had the U with the left side curved inward. Some of the ’cloned’ bargain font sets just took a font and bolded and/or slanted it to create a new weight. We’ve all seen them.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
