  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm working on a futuristic game where they've chosen Eurostile for the main font. They're using it in upper case only and need a second font for lower case characters at smaller sizes that supports cyrillic characters.\n\nURW++ seem to do a lot of cyrillic character fonts including Eurostile. I've written to them for licensing details. Does anyone have any recommendations for the second font that would complement it? It most probably needs to be sans serif.\n\nQuite a tall order I think. If its from the URW++ library then all the better as we only need to negotiate the font license with one foundry.\n\nVery grateful for any suggestions.\n\n",

Their website is built with frames so I can't send you the page link but it says \"Character Set\" with an option for \"OTF Plus: West, East, Cyrillic, Greek, Vietnamese\". If I've somehow made a mistake there by all means let me know.\n\n"
