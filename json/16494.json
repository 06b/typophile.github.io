  "content": "Could anybody please explain to me why helvetica has a double storey a but single storey g? I am sure there are other typefaces that might do this but helvetica is so widely used I wondered why it is like that. I have been trying to find out the whole storey (!) of the lower case a and g as they seem to be the only two letters that have a commonly accepted alternate that all english readers recognise without problem, and maybe without even noticing. Thank you.\n\n",

      "content": "My old 1958 Encyclopedia of Typefaces says that grotesks that follow the German or continental model use a single storey 'g' while grotesques that follow the traditional English pattern use a double storey 'g'. This difference is the basis of grotesque (double storey) and neo-grotesque (single storey) as separate classifications (see the BS:2961 in the back of Rookledges Typefinder). The double storey version is older - essentially 19th century, rather than mid-20th century.\n\nYes its true that AG set the norm for German grotesks (see also Venus, Folio, Reform Grotesk et al) but I have also seen that variant of AG that includes a single storey 'a'...\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you so much for your help. I didn't know about the continental vs English aspect. I have followed the single storeys from script to italic type and through to more general use via modernist faces and am starting to look at use as infant forms for children's books although why that began I don't know.\n\np.s Dezcom, sorry to disappoint, I know very little about opera, I like some snippets. The Cosi comes from an old college project, I quite liked the sentiment behind the phrase, it always provokes discussion.\n\n"

I guess familiarity has a strong link to recognition too which is perhaps why the two forms have happily co-existed.\n\n"

The black letters seem to always have a more or less one story g (a hair line closes it), and often a two story a. The English Johnston, with Underground and the American Benton, with Franklin, did the two story g because of no blackletter influence.\n\n"
