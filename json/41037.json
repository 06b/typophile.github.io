  "content": "Dear all,\n\nI'm a fresh FontLab (5.0.4 on Mac OS 10.4.11) user.  \nWhile drawing I've noticed 2 behaviours that don't suit me:\n\n— Using the drawing tool, for sometimes, I couldn't directly close a shape. Instead of a small circle appearing next to the arrow when you meet the first point again, I had a “+” symbol. Now it's behaving the way I want (circle symbol) but I'd like to know how to switch this on/off if it comes back.\n\n— Using the rectangle and/or ellipse tools, as soon as shapes overlap, an auto-merging occurs?!?\n\nI've looked through the manual (mostly the preferences) and asked around, without any success. Help would be highly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance, best, mc\n\n",
