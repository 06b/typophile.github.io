I am designing a menu and had been using MrsEaves, but the client doesn't like that combo as she thinks that they are too contrasting. It doesn't necessarily have to be a serif font, I looked at Century Gothic and Engravers Gothic, but there is a lot of text to fit, so most serif fonts tend to fit better. Any suggestions on a simpler serif? thanks!\n\n",
