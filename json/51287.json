Clearly, it is a heavy sans serif design on which a shadow effect has been applied. We licensed a similar design from Hanyang in the 1990s, and the font is HYKakHeadlineStd-Bold. Here is a sample, using the same characters as shown above:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130207035853im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hykakheadlinestd-bold_6372.jpg)\n\nDr. Ken Lunde  \nSenior Computer Scientist, CJKV Type Development  \nAdobe Systems Incorporated  \n [lunde@adobe.com](mailto:lunde@adobe.com)\n\n"

It's not one of the usual suspects (Hanyang, Baekmuk, Sandoll, etc.) and I've exhausted the few specimens I have. Online samples are too small and most often don't include the glyphs \"한글!\". If you need an exact match, I can investigate further.\n\n"
