  "content": "Time to put this one on the chopping block...Last time I did this it was my old “Custom” type logo. This time it’s a personal logo that I’ve been working on for a long time. I \\* think \\* it’s finished. Do you?\n\nContext: This is a logo for me as a person, and as an artist. I wanted to create a simple, one color mark (for now...I’m ol’ school that way) which incorporated my initials (d + m), and also spoke to an abstract idea of my belief that I’m both physical (the shape of the M) and yet directly linked to a spirit (the curving shape of the ’d’, which, yes, does resemble a flame...I love a good flame job on anything, and fire has a spiritual connection, too).\n\nTechnically, (for what it’s worth) I’ve built a little ink trap into the middle of the ’m.’\n\nFire away, comrades. Tossing this into the wonderful fray of the Typophile community signifies a final group review on this thing before I implement it (tattoo, business cards, etc.)\n\nThanks in advance for your raw feedback.\n\nDylan\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo\\_final\\_freehand.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201121117/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_final_freehand.pdf) | 1.49 KB |\n\n [‹ Technology-related logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201121117/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28116 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo: small freelance dtp/web design business ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081201121117/http:/www.typophile.com/node/27929 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I think lengthening the 3D M and sharpening the baseline angles might add some weight and balance.\n\nI like the play on the physical/spiritual in the mark, but a part of me still wants to see the M take on a more organic shape. The D is so striking, that the M pales in comparison.  \nMy two cents.\n\n— tomás\n\n"

Because you explained the mark in the description there was no way to see it with fresh eyes so to speak.\n\nIf you need a negative to feel the critique is honest, I would say that the mark has a particular flavor that is strong. I would expect your work to have a similar style, and without knowing for sure, would anticipate that you have a working style of illustration as well. Now I’ll go check.\n\n"

Jon and Jim Goslee are great guys that way...very laid back brothers. But I never made the time to outline to them the effective nature of a complete identity system. So they’re ’brand’ has been a mishmash of stuff since. But they’ve opened two more locations, which begs the question...Would any extra effort on my part been worth the effort? And that’s food for another thread, right? Again, thanks for the compliment about the work. I thoroughly enjoyed doing it for the Brothers Goslee. Someday I might reach down, grab a pair (my pair, to be clear) and get serious about doing that kind of work full time.\n\n"
