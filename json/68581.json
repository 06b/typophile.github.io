      "content": "Wow, tricky!  \nFor the \"N\", have you tried maybe making just a flipped \"U\", which would look a bit like a lowercase \"n\"? Might work in such a font. Also, for the \"M\", I'd maybe try reducing the middle stem to one line (a bit like what you do in the \"B\").\n\nOne idea for the \"D\" (which I agree looks funky), although this would likely necessitate changes to other letters too: Have you tried giving it \"serifs\" on the left side – i.e. moving the left vertical stem a bit to the right and letting the top and bottom lines protrude out to the left? Don't know if it'd work, but it might be worth a try.\n\n"

X is cool; very Space Invaderish.\n\nMake numerals two pixels narrower, and you skip that problem.\n\nSpace the with two pixels, and things look a lot more natural. T,F,L and such only need one.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091545im_/http:/typophile.com/files/nepofont_5187.png)\n\n"

      "content": "Wow! Thanks for all the constructive criticism!\n\n@altaira - The Serif idea worked amazing! Thanks! I tried the flipped U but it does look like a lowercase N... in which case is invalid for the font.\n\nTomi from Suomi - Fixed the D, looks cool now. I liked the X as well, also thought of Space Invaders when i made it Hahaha. I'm going to increase width by 1px so that its 11px for the characters, then reduce the numbers to 9px width so the difference is more apparent. I'll check the spacing as well.\n\nCris B - Thanks Cris, thats good reference! -saved!\n\nHere's the Link to the 11px Width Nepo. - [http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/nepo\\_11px](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317091545/http:/fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/nepo_11px \"http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/nepo\\_11px\")\n\nI fixed the D, the M, N and W.
