Everyone would ask him, \"why are you wearing shorts?\" He would reply, \"Because I'm hot.\" Even with the blizzards and everything. Still with the shorts. Then the first day it broke 60 degrees, he wore pants. I saw him walk down the street and someone shouted out him, \"Why are you wearing pants?\" and he said, \"Because I'm cold!\" The biggest setup for a punchline I've ever experienced.\n\n"
