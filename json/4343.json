      "content": "As a result of the \"Homeland Security\" program, all foreigners from outside of the \"old E.U.\" countries must apply for a visitor's visa when coming to the U.S. Since I'm Polish living in Germany, I must apply for the visa at the U.S. embassy in Berlin. In order to get a visa, each applicant is supposed to call a contract call center (1.86 EUR/minute!) to make an appointment at the embassy. Every applicant needs to apear in person for an interview, so the appointment is necessary.   \n   \nDue to high workload, the call center tells you to make the appointment way in advance, so about four weeks ago, I made an appointment for the next possible time -- which turned out to be last Monday. Last Monday at 9:30 A.M., I appeared in front of the embassy in Berlin but to my great surprise I learned that \"I wasn't on the list.\" The security guards asked me out (politely) and told me to... call the call center. The friendly operator at the call center told me that \"my appointment wasn't in the computer\", and that he could not help me. There was no way to speak to a visa officer, superior or whoever else, except from the call center guy (who just operates the system and takes the appointments) and the security guard (who didn't know anything except that I wasn't on the list).   \n   \nSo, the call center guy suggested that I could make another appointment. The next available appointment was... August 26th! Yes, but that's a month \\_after\\_ TypeCon, I told him. Well, \"Sorry, I can't help you.\" \"Is there anybody else I can call?\" \"Sorry.\" \"And you don't know why my appointment isn't in your computer.\" \"No, sorry.\"   \n   \nHe actually sounded like he was sorry, I talked to him for some 15 or 20 minutes altogether. At 1.86 EUR/minute.   \n   \nAfter having heard that my next appointment was to be August 26th, I decided to make some noise. I sent a couple of faxes to the U.S. embassy fax number (normally reserved as \"American Citizes Services\" only). I described the entire situation, pointed out that there must have been a mistake, that I'm a speaker at the conference etc. etc. In addition, a few good people, including SoTA Executive Director Tamye Riggs, SoTA Chairman Richard Kegler, my colleague Ted Harrison from Fontlab Ltd., and quite a few other friends from font companies (big and small) have sent supportive faxes to the embassy, pointing out how \"important\" I was to have at the conference etc. Thank you guys for that support!!!   \n   \nAfter the overwhelming number of faxes, the U.S. embassy in Berlin apparently felt obliged to contact me per e-mail and give me a reply. So on Wednesday, I got this warm and friendly reply:   \n   \n\"Dear Mr. Twardoch:   \nThank you for your faxes. Due to the summer travel season, our visa waiting room is currently booked through mid-August at the maximum capacity allowed by our Embassy security officer. There are no earlier appointments available at this time. Please call our contract call center at 0190-85-00-55 and book the next available appointment.   \nSincerely,   \nVisa Unit\"   \n   \nThat's very sincere indeed.   \n   \nFor those interested: I could have theoretically made the appointment three months ago or so, not 4 weeks ago. This way, I would probably have gotten a second chance for an appointment before TypeCon. Unfortunately, my old passport just expired. I had applied for a new passport already last year (2003) but did not receive it until two weeks ago. In Poland, we now have to wait 6 months or so for the new passport being printed. We have a new passport design and now, everything, including your photo and name etc. is being offset-printed with some fancy hi-tech ink, in Warsaw. So your entire passport actually is being \"manufactured\" for you. A fascinating process for print lovers, no doubt, but not really as fascinating when you have to wait for a half a year to get the thing. When you apply for a U.S. visa, your passport must be valid for another 6 months, so I had to wait for my new passport and only could apply after I got it. Also after I got my passport, I had to get my German residence permit renewed at the appropriate German office. So altogether, last Monday was actually as early as I could get, and since it didn't work out for some mysterious reason, I didn't get my second chance except August 26th. Great.   \n   \nThis taught me a few things: (1) I should apply for a new passport at least a year before my current passport's expiration date. (2) I should apply for a U.S. visa three months before planning to go there. (3) With the current U.S. visa policy, TypeCon conferences won't be able to attract many international visitors if the conferences are be held in the U.S. (4) I actually learned a few more things but I won't announce them publicly ;)   \n   \nI really wish I were allowed to go to TypeCon. I had made all travel arrangements etc. Fortunately, I was able to cancel my flight with a penalty that wasn't excessive. But that's not so important.   \n   \nI really wanted to go to TypeCon because I think it will be a great conference. I was truly looking forward to it, and I really envy those of you who will be there. I wish you a lot of fun. Make sure that you enjoy that conference, especially that you \\_are\\_ able to participate!   \n   \nFor all those who signed up for the FontLab workshop: Ted Harrison will be at TypeCon, and we are working on a solution that will enable me to join you over the Net.   \n   \nBest greetings,   \nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "[ Hrant,   \n   \nI don't think Tom ever blamed the Saudis for something. ]   \n   \nOther than that, I must say that a few months ago, in Poland, we had a discussion along the lines: how come that Poland is supporting the U.S. war in Iraq and the Americans still require visas for Polish citizens? I found and still find this sort of argumentation ridiculous (bringing it down to a \"deal\"), but that was reality in our Polish media.   \n   \nI also actually do realize and acknowledge that a country such as the U.S. may want to set up any sorts of rules, including taking people's fingerprints and requiring every applicant to apply for a visa in person.   \n   \nHowever, what I don't understand and what annoys me is that if one blows up bureaucratic procedures to the extent as it is now with the U.S. visas, one should create bureaucratic capacities to accomodate for the procedures.   \n   \nJust like 4 years ago, German citizens going for a trip longer than 3 months, students, workers and non-old-E.U. foreigners are required to apply for a visa. However, 4 years ago, only very few people were asked for a personal interview and most visas were issued per post. A year ago, a large number of the applicants were required to appear in person, but people who already had previous visas that recently expired, and a large number of other cases were still allowed to apply per post. Now, everybody is required to appear for a personal interview.   \n   \nHowever, the capacity of the U.S. embassy in Berlin remains the same. Therefore, everything takes much more time now than it used to before. There is no option for expedited processing (even with an additional fee), there is no \"backup\" option or a hotline for special cases.   \n   \nWith the effective necessity of making an appointment 6 weeks in advance (July 12--August 26, that's really 6 weeks!), plus some more advance for the case something goes wrong, and some additional advance for the actual visa application processing (they say 10 working days), you end up having to plan every trip 3 months in advance. This effectively eliminates a large number of business travels or spontaneous touristic trips.   \n   \nWhile I have to apply for a visa since I'm Polish, note that even \"old E.U.\" citizens aren't quite safe. They don't need a visa upfront, but in the past few months the German news reported of several cases when business people, classical orchestra musicians and even some known German actors were refused entry to the U.S. \\_at the destination airport\\_. This means that they after the long and exhausting flight from Europe to the U.S. they had to buy an immediate return ticket and take the next available machine to fly back to Europe. I think I don't need to say more.   \n   \nGermany is known for their bureaucracy. This is true -- there's a lot of it where I live now. But these guys here at least know how to run a bureaucratic machine...   \n   \nOh, no need to mention that the U.S. embassy intends to keep my visa application fee of 86 EUR (roughly $100) that I had to pay upfront, despite the fact that my application wasn't actually even received. A yet another way to fund government spending. ;)   \n   \nBest,   \nAdam\n\n"

Guaranteeing hotel rooms (lots of them) + the catering for attendees at the hotel (not cheap) + the support of our generous sponsors (they are the best) + donations of time and services by our incredible speakers and volunteers (they rock the hardest) + the NEA grant for special projects (they dig type, too!) = low conference registration and workshop fees + peace, love, and happiness.   \n   \nWe strive to offer TypeCon attendees an affordable, high-quality hotel in a safe and cool location each year. This is a tall order, considering the huge amount of meeting space we need for TypeCon and the low cost of the conference.   \n   \nBy staying at the Nikko, you are supporting SOTA and TypeCon and helping to keep the conference affordable. And you can be sure that we have checked out the hotel thoroughly, and that it's a good place! And if someone can't swing the Nikko solo, we help with finding roommates.   \n   \nPlus, if you stay at the conference hotel, you get to take the SOTA shuttle to the workshops and Alphabet Farm instead of finding your own way. Not to mention easier access to the muffins in the morning if all you have to do is take the elevator downstairs...\n\n"

I know I'm not the only bride (or groom) with that thought. If you can make it, we'll be happy to witness your transformation into social butterfly. If you can't get to SF, I hope you'll join us for TypeCon2005 (maybe as part of a one-year anniversary trip with the wife?).\n\n"

Many of us faxed urgent letters to the US consulate in Berlin in an attempt to plead Adam's case, but to no avail. The consulate faxed a letter back to me stating sternly that they could not discuss anyone's application. I hadn't asked for information from them, just offered support for Adam's request for the appointment that he was already entitled to but for some technical screwup.   \n   \nThey also said they are terribly busy with vacation visa requests and all that. Naturally, a speaker traveling to an international conference funded in part by a US government arts agency doesn't take priority over someone's summer holiday!   \n   \nOn the other hand, several speakers from Brazil and other countries outside the US received visas within a few days of receiving our letters of invitation. Why does it have to be so hard for our friends in other nations???   \n   \nTypeCon attendees are predominantly North American because of geography and economics. But our conference is quite inexpensive, and with the weak dollar lately, it is certainly more affordable to travel here from Europe, SA, etc.   \n   \nMore international attendees come each year, and we certainly hope to continue that growth. We will continue to do all we can to bring more people from outside the US. I hope that things with our govmt and especially state dept will get better in the future, so we don't have disasters like Adam has experienced.   \n   \nAs for the market at the 'con, yes, most of the sellers will take credit cards, and they are again a friendly bunch. Lots of type and design books (new and antique), movie marquee letters, typewriter key jewelry, psychedelic posters... and for those of you wondering, Jan Middendorp has brought quite a few copies of his fabulolus \"Dutch Type,\" which has sold out of many bookstores in the US.\n\n"
