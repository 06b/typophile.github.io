      "content": "I've found a number of good newspaper design books at used book stores. I'm not sure about contemporary titles but there are plenty of old ones from back in the day. The one I have at my desk right now is titled Functional Newspaper Design and it's one of my favorite books (mainly because it's full of clippings and letters from the previous owner, who was an editor at the Detroit Free Press during the 60's). Try some old book shops or ebay. \"Newspaper Design\" would probably be a good search term.\n\n"

      "content": "honestly, i would really suggest books on grid systems and typographic hierarchy. These two things, IMHO, are the most important aspects of a newspaper. The book on grid systems that I would recommend would be this one [Grid Systems in Graphic Design by Josef Muller-Brockmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20130317203129/http:/www.amazon.com/gp/product/3721201450/ref=wl_it_dp/104-0529799-6655911?%5Fencoding=UTF8&colid=J1SPAXLSVHA0&coliid=I2DHVK79XGR5SU&v=glance&n=283155)I am sure you already have books on typography, so I wont bother mentioning any here, unless you need me to.\n\n"

It's spiral bound and is sort of a step by step guide to newspaper design. It has lots of examples and design ideas and I thought it was well explained and presented.\n\n"
