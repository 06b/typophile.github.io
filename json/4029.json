And you can't but notice the similarities with his [FF Schmalhans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011174735/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=719) too.   \n   \n\"Hans Reichel (born 1949) is a musician/inventor/composer as well as being a type designer. For 20 years he's made a name for himself as an accomplished acoustic and electric guitar player. He's also the inventor of the Daxophon (sic), an instrument where thin strips of wood are played with a bow to mimic animal sounds and human voices.\"   \n   \nMore information on his musical endeavors can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011174735/http:/www.shef.ac.uk/misc/rec/ps/efi/).   \n   \nFF Dax was his first release under the FontFont banner. Reichel also redesigned and expanded his popular Barmeno family for FontFont, but had to change the name to [FF Sari](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011174735/http:/www.fontfont.com/shop/view_singles_main.ep?id=2665) to avoid being sued by the new owners of the Berthold Type library.   \n   \nWhich in short means he doesn't own his creation anymore. Go figure.\n\n"
