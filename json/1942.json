It's still incomplete, lacking numerals and full punctuation, but I'm very happy with it's progress, so far--even though I haven't touched it in years.   \n   \nI really like the upper case, but still feel like the lower case needs more unity. Any thoughts?   \n   \n//joe\n\n",

      "content": "very very cool. an interesting combination of the geometric and organic. I'm debating with myself about the uc S. It is a little wider than the other letters, and makes the texture a bit uneven. However, I think the imperfection adds to the character of the face. I would definitely loose the taper on the top end, though. I'm with simon on the lc. i really like. I would loose the kink on the upper arm of the k (it works on the uc)-- it feels like it could be simplified. The x's kind of bug me. it seems the curved geometry is justified on the other letters, but feels forced on the x.   \n   \nare you planning on publishing it any time soon?   \n   \ncr\n\n"

I've also considered making the UC A with an apex, rather than a rounded top. I could see that working well with elements from the v and a more standard x, like you suggest.   \n   \nAnd, yes, you've found my biggest personal weakness, that S. Heh.\n\n"

My biggest question is how the upper relates to the lower case (the cap-height, mostly).   \n   \nAlso, how is the rhythm of the UC versus the rhythm of the lc? Do these relate well? I feel like it needs some work, but am unsure about the next steps...\n\n"

Maybe tapering the bottom and ending it a bit sooner would resolve the top issue. Have you set a whole page? Our language isn't hampered with the usage of too many capital letters (in body set type) so perhaps your concern with the lower and the upper isn't of such great import? How about your little trick on the 'k'? Perhaps incorporating that trick somehow in the 'x'? Because of the narrowness of the letters you might tighten up the over all word spacing as well. The 'r' seems to want a little more curve into the stem?   \n   \nBeautiful.\n\n"
