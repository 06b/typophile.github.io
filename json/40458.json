The first of which has about _240_ members (at the time of this post) and the other _516_ (also at posting time.)\n\nIt raised a small question in my mind... **Just how big is Typophile?!**\n\nAnyone know or want to give your guesstimate? Should Typophile have a resolution to expand (or contract?) By the way, I don’t have any control over anything Typophile does, I just thought it would be an interesting question.\n\n_This is shameless, but feel free to add me as a Facebook friend_\n\n [‹ What magazines?
