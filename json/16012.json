I think there is some confusion because many years ago Adobe included the Indonesian rupiah abbreviation _Rp_ in their expert set fonts. The rupiah sign is not encoded as such in Unicode, most likely because Indonesians simply use the letters _R_ and _p._ In their OT fonts, Adobe use a Private Use Area codepoint for the rupia (U+F6DD). My guess is that the Monotype folk who worked on Palatino Linotype were familiar with the _Rp_ glyph from Adobe expert set fonts, and thought this was the rupeeh sign.\n\n"

Since Type 1 fonts were limited to one-bye encodings, we soon decided we needed a supplemental set to hold the kinds of glyphs needed for more advanced typography. We set about building a list for what was to become the Expert set.\n\nMany pieces were obvious: small capitals, oldstyle figures, additional f ligatures, superior & inferior figures, more dashes, and the \"French\" alphabetic superiors. We looked around, and noticed that this set, combined with the base set, was very similar to the set URW was producing for ITC fonts at that point. There were just two additional currency characters in the ITC set: the colon and rupiah.\n\nAdobe hadn't learned much about the Latin market outside Europe and North America yet. We decided that if ITC was including these currency characters, there was probably a good reason, and we might as well meet the ITC \"standard\". So we added them in the Expert set.\n\nYears later, when I mentioned this to Cynthia Hollandsworth (now Cynthia Batty), she suggested that the colon and rupiah got into the ITC set via Agfa, which had some large corporate clients doing business in those regions. The derivation of character sets is always intriguing, and full of odds bits of legacy!\n\n- thanks,  \n David L\n\n"

Its history indeed is derived from the Indian Rupee which of mentioning -- reasonably suspected -- to have been combined with the mention of Arabs so that being \"rupiah\" (name) and \"Rp\" (symbol) and also \"IDR\" (international code)\n\nThe placement \"Rp\" at different codepoint on some fonts has confusing of course. While we see that Unicode still leaves some \"empty slots\" (U+20BA ... U+20CF). So in my humble opinion, it makes more sense if \"Rp\" should be moving to one of these codepoint. We wait from Unicode, Adobe, Microsoft or anyone authorized to handle this.\n\nAnd more importantly (related the standard codepage) I think this is the moment to arrange the codepoint of all the existing currencies.\n\nBest Regards.\n\n"

The technical abbreviations you mention are just the poor modern banker’s workaround to circumvent his disability of handling $, £, € and the like on his devices. These \\*typographical\\* abbreviations, on the other hand, have been born out of the scribal need (of former centuries) to speed up the merchant’s everyday recording pensum by replacing “Libra” by £ – and getting faster. But not every currency inherited it’s own typographical symbol.\n\nHowever, signs like £ and $ have gained symbolic meaning over the time. So that it became desirable for emerging currencies/states to furnish their own monetary unit with a special typographical glyph – both as an abbreviation in text \\*and\\* a brand-like symbol. Therefore we have seen quite a lot enterprises to establish new signs of such kind recently: Armenia, Azerbaidschan, Russia, India; not to mention many [local currency initiatives](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225214310/http:/www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=238) which also embark on creating a captivating sign for their own money.\n\nI wondered about the Rp./.Rs issue for years. Thank you all for enlightening me.\n\n"

Many currencies use the $ sign, for instance, and not only for dollars, but also pesos and other currencies. These need to be differentiated in financial transactions; hence AUD, BBD, BSD, CAD, FJD, HKD, JMD, LRD, NIO, SGD, TOP, USD, WST, etc.\n\n"
