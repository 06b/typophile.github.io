      "content": "Hi Chris. I like the new 'y' better. But the 'v' and 'w' are still problems. To me because of the bent right diagonals they look like italic characters mistakenly dropped into a roman font. If you compare Souvenir, where he has bent diagonals, he bends both sides in the roman and carries it throughout the face, caps and lc alike, except for the z.\n\nHere I think the v and w might work with just straight right sides like the y, or with your rounded corner serifs, this time turned outward to the right. Even with this the face will have lots of soft features, and will keep its overall look I think.\n\nOn the caps, my feeling is that there are too many serifs. The most successful semi-serif caps I think are Rotis Semi-Serif's and he just put one top left serif on everything. Somehow it works in combination with other caps or lc. It seems to be quite widely used. The only problem is the M. To me the top right vertex looks painfully chopped off in Rotis semi-serif, and even more so here. So I would try adding a serif there--against what I am saying otherwise. Or if you don't, in any case the right stem of the M can be lightened with benefit I suspect.\n\nThe unique look of this face is that it manages to be soft but clean looking. Cooper Black is soft but not as clean. Sauna has something of it, but is more soft, with a lot of italic details. Here you have more sharpness.\n\nAnyway, this I think is a unique look that still can be very usable--something not easy to achieve, but you're almost there, I think. Very impressive!\n\nBut I think it needs more consistency and a little more restraint to really become itself. Dr. Berkson's prescription: take two MFB (Morris Fuller Benton) pills and they will do wonders for you :)\n\n"

Some illusions are transient or are only affected in some rare glyph combinations and perhaps are not an issue. Others may come into play often and need a correction--sometimes this is just a kern and sometimes a redraw is required. The difficulty with a new typeface is that it has not settled yet in the viewers eyes and subsequent viewings may erase the problematic vision. I don't know if this is the case so we will let it percolate a bit longer :-)\n\nThis may well turn out to be a viable text face at the lighter weights. First I have to battle this weight through and hope you will help with comments on progress of all coming weights.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "\\>\\>asymmetrical treatment\n\nI think you can do asymmetrical, like the y you did. My problem is not so much with asymmetrical as with consistency. You don't have the bent right diagonal in the kxyz, nor any of the caps (though you can follow somewhat different rules there). That's why it sticks out to my eyes. (by the way, I think the x with the two squiggles is too fussy and needs to be simplified.)\n\nI pointed to MF Benton, because he took totally different styles like Broadway and Franklin Gothic and identified and carried through their logic with beautiful consistency and even color.\n\nOn the caps, like everything else, you can of course do anything you can pull off. Rotis semi-serif (not the semi-sans) is not geometric though not as modulated as much as Froggy. I was just pointing to it as one of the few successful semi-serifs to ponder.\n\nThinking about it further, I think the problem for my eyes with a lot of semi-serifs is that going half way, like on the current Froggy H, makes characters look mutilated to me.\n\nI think you could also go the other way on the caps: eg put small serifs on everything in the Caps except the thin strokes--you are almost there in your current version anyway. Or some variation, but with just leaving a few serifs discretely off, so the absence of them does not shout at you.\n\nOverall, I think there is a danger in trying to do too many things in one typeface. You have achieved a really nice distinctive look with your lower case, and I think the 'Benton pills' would make you just create good caps that work with it, and not try to be too innovative on the caps. After all, Benton was going to do over 100 faces--and you are so full of interesting ideas, you just might as well!\n\n"

But why isn't the r like it? I would prefer c, e and f to match the smooth and curvy r and not have the angle which is distracting.\n\nIf your H is going to have outer serifs, then shouldn't it have smooth curves on inside rather than corners. Like William B says, looks like some sort of chopping has occurred.\n\nOn the gh ligature I would make the g dominate and lose the pointy curve in favour of a gentler one inside.\n\nj would benefit from more closely resembling the cap J which has a prettier hook.\n\nI think William B is right, this would benefit massively from an audit and then a rigorous drive for consistency between characters. Hope that won't make it lose its character.\n\nIt's a robust concept though and I think I have sounded far too negative.\n\nKeep going.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>I don’t want it to be just the typical treatment\n\nChristian Schwartz said something very thought provoking to me at Typecon last year: \"You have to resist the temptation to put too much of yourself into a typeface.\" By that I think he meant that the face has to become itself, with its own nature. Like a child, it needs to be respected as having its own character, and the designer needs to work to realize that nature to the maximum. Once you have some basic ideas, it starts to have its own rules and nature, and resists you doing what \\*you\\* want.\n\nSo I am not against wanting to make any particular bit innovative. But I think that past a certain point making innovation a top priority can get in the way. Here you already have a concept that is really strong, which is an achievment. From my point of view, your challenge now is just to realize the concept most fully and effectively. I think if you \\*at this point\\* forget about being innovative and just be a servant of the typeface, it will end up with a very distinctive look anyway, and may be more effectively realized.\n\nInterestingly, a typeface becomes \\*you\\* even when you consciously avoid it. Goudy argued against being personal in type, and throught we was not being personal. But of course almost everything of his came out shouting 'Goudy'.\n\n"

I guess what I am saying is that the best path is neither the conscious attempt at innovation nor the conscious attempt at avoiding innovation by just adopting often-used solutions lock-step.

Perhaps thinning the far right diagonal will be enough to balance it. And perhaps changing its angle a bit. Another thing would be to go a different way and do two of your left squiggles like on the v and y, with thinner straight right diagonals. Perhaps you've tried and rejected that already.\n\nI was just concentrating on structural stuff, but I agree with Nick Job that the s is too wide.

      "content": "Chris, sorry i haven't been able to get to this sooner, but you've come a long way!!! I looked at an earlier PDF, but i didn't have time to give it full attention till now. I like the new caps, the lower serif on the L bothers me most -- it feels like a mistake to me. The tail of the Q feels like it was broken -- like the O portion fell on it and it got squooshed. Do i see a rubby slipper on that foot sticking out from underneath? \\>^p i also think the top of the c and the arm on the r should have the same treatment. i prefer the r with the smooth inner counter. smoothing out the c would also allow you to smooth out the e, which looks funny to me with that crick the way it is now. the s and e feel too wide, as does the v. i liked the old w construction better, it was just a bit wobbly before. the new w construction jumps out at me as you try to read text. is the tail on the eszett shorter than on the f? if so, why? the cedilla looks a bit alien to this face to me. your best characters imo are the g and r. the caps are very solid too. the lc just needs some quirks worked out to bring it all into harmony. keep up the good work!\n\n"

I didn't know it had to match the f. I was going to make the long s match the dblss. I narrowed the s some in this last cut, do I need narrow it more?  \nThe July 5th deadline is the last day to send entries from the Type Battle week stuff for the TypeCon show.
