  "content": "There are several arrow-looking glyphs in Minion Pro that have the same glyph number (2192). They have different GID numbers (i.e., 1364 and 1376). Is there a way to find/change using a GID number in the change field? How do you format it? (I know you put a unicode in angle-brackets, but in this case, when I enter the common unicode number, I get the arrow-looking glyph that I DON'T want [GID 1376] instead of the one I want [1364].)\n\nCan anyone help? thanks!\n\n",

Those versions are different enough to require three different encoding files for the LaTeX installation. The version I looked at is 002.000.\n\n"
