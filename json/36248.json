  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’ll briefly introduce myself. I’m a student, graphic and web designer, artist, etc. and am looking to create a large piece of ’Typographical Art’. I’ve searched the forums and the ’net and can’t seem to find anything. I might have accidentally made up the term in a dream, judging by my success, but I know I’ve seen some type-based art, I just can’t remember where. I’m basically after any art, and I don’t want to get into a discussion about what is and isn’t art, that not only uses type to communicate it’s message but does so without relying on the text and does not contain any significant graphical elements. I assume there is some stuff out there. I would love any pointer as to where I can find it. I really just want to see what people are doing in this field before I really start.\n\nThis is just a personal project so I’m in no rush to get it done, though I want the first piece finished by christmas (hopefully).\n\nI’d also like to say that the forum (and site) is amazing and well done for creating a pro atmosphere without making it at all intimidating. I’m so impressed, I might by a t-shirt or two.\n\nThanks,\n\nPete. :)\n\n [‹ What shouldn't be missed in NY?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191347/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37442 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [I'm a geek and it's ok;o) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202191347/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37118 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
