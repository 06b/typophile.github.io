  "content": "Workhorse is a Sign Painter's Gothic developed by Master Sign Painter Greg Reid. Workhorse captures the true essence of hand lettering. From the tapered waists to the elegant snaps of the brush; these elements present a warmth unseen in today's mechanically stiff Gothics. Greg Reid and Charles Borges de Oliveira collaborated to bring this truly one of a kind typeface to fruition. With the power of Open type, Workhorse utilizes Contextual Alternates to create random variations of the capitals and lowercase letters. This allows your text to have subtle differences in the letters without losing form which helps to create an honest hand lettered look. This feature can be turned on or off to suit your individual style. You also have the ability to manually choose the glyph variations from the glyph pallet to help you create one of kind designs. Both versions of Workhorse feature complete variations of the capitals and lowercase letters (56 total), Small Caps and six alternates. The Small Caps are not just the capitals scaled down. They have been designed as a unique second set that adjusts the stroke thickness to match the existing letters, creating what we like to refer to as \"Real Small Caps\". Workhorse is a timeless classic that can be used from early Americana advertising all the way up to present day modern use.  \n No matter how you use Workhorse it always looks and reads well.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Petersons-Bread_5407.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Hill-Top-Apple2_3820.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Workhorse-menu_3527.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Workhorse-Small-Caps3_4341.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Workhorse-CA2_5042.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Workhorse-Rough_3524.png)\n  \nAvailable at these fine font sellers:  \n [http://www.fontbros.com/families/workhorse/styles/regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115/http:/www.fontbros.com/families/workhorse/styles/regular \"http://www.fontbros.com/families/workhorse/styles/regular\")  \n [http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/workhorse.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115/http:/www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/workhorse.php \"http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/workhorse.php\")  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/workhorse/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/workhorse/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/charlesborges/workhorse/\")  \n [http://www.fonts.com/font/borges-lettering/workhorse#product\\_top](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115/http:/www.fonts.com/font/borges-lettering/workhorse#product_top \"http://www.fonts.com/font/borges-lettering/workhorse#product\\_top\")  \n [http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/workhorse/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/workhorse/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/family/workhorse/\")  \n [http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/borges-lettering-design/workhorse](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114115/http:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/borges-lettering-design/workhorse \"http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/borges-lettering-design/workhorse\")\n",
