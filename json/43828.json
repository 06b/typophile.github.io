  "content": "This is my first post... sorry to start off by just asking questions and looking for Font IDs, but apparently, that's how I roll. :)\n\nI am trying to find two different typefaces.\n\nThe first would be the typeface used in the \"district five\" logo. I am trying to find the typeface used for the \"american advertising association\" and word \"district\". I believe they are the same.\n\nThe second is the Rapha logo. I'm thinking it might actually just be handmade, like the Titleist logo (titleist.com) was... but thought I'd ask.\n\nAny help you might give would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nFlickster\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [d5.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141114043345/http:/typophile.com/files/d5.jpg) | 76.95 KB |\n\n",
