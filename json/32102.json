Maybe have an install option along the lines of “skip all those crappy filters that they tell you to never use on the first day of Photoshop 101.“\n\n"

Macromedia had a bunch of 3D technologies in their portfolio that they just let stagnate after they acquired Flash. Anyone think there is a chance Adobe might revive them any time soon? Just bundling an updated Extreme 3D in the CS package would instantly make Adobe a player in 3D graphics. Granted, it has a long way to go to bring it up to par with other modern 3D apps, and Adobe might not want to invest in that sort of development,\n\n"

But I’ve been known to assume wrong. ;o)\n\n“Just bundling an updated Extreme 3D in the CS package would instantly make Adobe a player in 3D graphics.”\n\nNot much of one, though. Extreme 3D was never really top of the class and at this point, the code base must be fairly full of cobwebs.\n\n"
