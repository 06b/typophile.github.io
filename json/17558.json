Here’s a sample setting  \nof the two smaller sizes:  \n(149Kb) [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Mana13&11.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090930101907/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Mana13&11.gif \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Mana13&11.gif\")\n\nAnd here’s a head-to-head comparison:  \n(197Kb) [http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/ManaCompar.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090930101907/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/ManaCompar.jpg \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/ManaCompar.jpg\")\n\nFor a serif face, to me Georgia is unmatched... for now. :-)\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, do you have anything wider than Mana? I find it to condensed for easy reading. It looks good in the navigation example contra antialiased Tahoma, but in the text comparison with Verdana I find the latter easier to read, even though the actual rendering of many of the individual letters in Mana is better than the b/w Verdana bitmaps. I’m sure this is due almost entirely to the narrowness of Mana.\n\n"

      "content": "I agree that it’s a bit too narrow for optimal reading.  \nAlthough the difference between this and one more bit  \nof width isn’t minor! In fact one more bit might make it  \nnon-optimal on the other side - at least at those PPEMs.  \nFor example a 14 PPEM bitmap font at the widths of the  \nMana-16 might be right on the mark.\n\nMy reasons for making Mana like this are that:  \n1) It’s a sans, so non-optimal for reading anyway. I have a serif in the works that’s wider. But, as above, part of the reason it looks wider is that the x-height is one bit shorter (and so are the descenders).  \n2) Since it’s a screen font, being able to fit in narrow spaces is a big plus, and this makes Mana more versatile.  \n3) It helps it stand out from the crowd, including Verdana.  \n4) Making it wider would cause the interal white to start overpowering the interletter spacing, especially in the lighter weights, which also have smaller x-heights (and especially for a sans). The “integerness” of everything in a bitmap font (including here the interletter spacing) tends to propagate issues throughout the design. It’s like the various “integernesses” :-) are in a multi-way tug-of-war, and you have to make sure nothing falls in the mud.\n\nBut really, I actually find Mana more readable than Verdana on that page, probably because: the grays hold the letters (and boumas?) together better; and it’s one bit taller, making it of comparable apparent size, something even more important onscreen than in print.\n\nBut if there’s enough demand (read: $) for a wider sans,  \nthen I’d love to make it - in bitmap font design that sort  \nof change isn’t too hard. The hard part is sizing. :-)\n\nhhp\n\n"
