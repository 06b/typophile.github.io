  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm in the process of replacing one element in a set of three fonts - headline font (Clarendon), bodycopy font (ITC Typewriter) and a tertiary font (custom face) used for highlighting. In this case the headline font Clarendon is the one for replacement.\n\nAttached are some headline fonts I'm considering. I'd love tips/feedback, thanks.\n\nLeft: Clarendon, Geometric Slabserif 703 BT Extra Bold, Goudy Heavyface  \nRight: Oxtail Black, Ziggurat Black  \nAdd'l note: Both secondary and tertiary fonts are fixed.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 2.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20141029171819/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%202_102.png) | 174.99 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Since you're going with a slab serif for both the headline and body text, I'd recommend using ones with similar letterforms, but with contrasting weights. Ziggurat Black has a two storey 'a' and binocular 'g' like American Typewriter. It looks the best to me, although it's really up to you.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
