Sub-topics of note:   \n   \n- Kurds in the ex-USSR use Cyrillic script with the additional latin \"q\". However, the capital Q is usually drawn like a big lowercase q. Does it deserve its own unicode slot? (I say yes!)   \n   \n- Wakhi, a central Asian language, has a mixed script of Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek letters.   \n   \n- The Byzantine Greeks used to use a lot of Latin-script words in their documents, but with Greek affixes and diacritics. Eventually, the \"Greek-style\" of writing certain words caught on among Latin scribes!   \n   \n- Certain Greek dialects use a Latin letters to represent sounds not present in standard Greek.   \n   \nCases like these could really push Unicode and type design to their respective limits.   \n   \n_However_, the real reason I'm posting is that this is the first website I've seen with all content available in English, Greek, Latin, Esperanto, Lojban, and Klingon!!! [Yes, that fact deserves a Triple-bang.] I wonder what his target readership is.   \n   \nPaul\n\n",

The Klingon script is not very interesting, in the same way that the Latin script is not very interesting, i.e. structurally. It's just a bunch of independent signs in a row. Structurally interesting scripts are things like Devanagari and the other Brahmi-derived scripts of India and Southeast Asia, and Arabic, and old Byzantine Greek cursive in which signs interract contextually, change form, move around, etc. Tengwar is of interest to script encoding engineers because it poses challenges and pushes the boundaries of technology. Developing an encoding for Klingon, on the other hand, would take about five minutes and wouldn't pose any challenge at all.\n\n"
