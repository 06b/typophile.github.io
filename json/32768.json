      "content": "Well, I'm biased of course. Rafaeli quoted one of my emails without my permission. He could have had permission (1) if he asked, and (2) if the email was explained -- it was a private email to Rich Hendel and was a follow-up to a telephone conversation. Unless the phone conversation was included, the email made no sense -- which may have been his goal.\n\nHis real purpose seemed to be to get at Rich Hendel, who I both admire and call a friend. I take the whole thing as deceitful.\n\nWith that in background, I suppose anything I say about this being a more or less useless book, and not that well set or designed, will have to be viewed as biased. However, that is my view.\n\nCharles Ellertson\n\n"
