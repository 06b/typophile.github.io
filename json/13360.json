Some of them are supposed to be used to build borders & patterns. That’s why i think 120% may be right as that seems to be the default leading in Adobe Apps & Microsoft Apps as well (but i’m not totally sure about that). Does anyone have any experience with this kind of thing and can offer advice? thnx for looking.\n\n [‹ Pulp Fiction](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109063058/http:/typophile.com/node/13187 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Two times pairing with what (Mrs Eaves and Copperplate) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109063058/http:/typophile.com/node/13345 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s much easier than setting 12 pt. on 14.4, or 11 pt. on 13.2.\n\nWord and the like can be set to exact line spacing, and borders are more likely to be used in a DTP app, where people are less likely to use default percentage based leading.\n\nYou \\_will\\_ provide all the rotations necessary to make a simple box, won’t you? Some fonts require the user to rotate elements, while the font’s EULA forbids the user from modifications...argh! And, please, don’t rely on kerning for horizontal positioning!\n\nOther ornaments, leaves and the like, just have to “look good” when set in a line with text. Of course, what “looks good” beside a uc A will look too high beside a lc a, or a smallcap A. I suppose one could make use of “case forms” in OpenType to help with that.\n\n"
