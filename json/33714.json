  "content": "OK, here's a (not so) hypothetical question...\n\nSuppose you know of someone who used Fontlab to change the permissions on a font so they could embed it in a website using WEFT. What responsibilities do you have, especially if they are not a part of your organization? What steps would you take? Does it change if you don't think highly of the particular foundry's EULA?\n\n",

I dunno. Gets into a grey area. Am I gonna report everyone I know who messes around with their tax returns? Hardly (altho the thought did cross my mind after an ex cheated on me). And it's not like you're going to be held liable for knowing and keeping silent. There's no font police that I'm aware of, nobody's life is in danger, and reporting your friend sounds awfully iron curtain to me.\n\n"

I will take action (or have someone at a higher level take action) in the actual discussion online (currently awaiting a response in non-official mode), but was trying to think through other implications - mostly because I \\*do\\* care about fonts, and therefore find I care about making sure font designers get their due.\n\n"

Or is it merely a breach of contract? Or is this just a semantic issue?\n\n\"therefore find I care about making sure font designers get their due.\"\n\nIMHO, embedding or not really seems to have no effect on the designer of the font. What's it to them if it's embedded on a web page or not?\n\n"
