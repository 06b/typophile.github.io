The closest I can suggest is Red Rooster's [Radiant Bold Extra Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150203064238/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/radiant/), which includes a symmetrical U as an alternate character. A tweak to the A and added quarter circle serifs would get you pretty close.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
