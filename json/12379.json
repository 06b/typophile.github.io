You can download Python from [www.python.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.python.org/ \"www.python.org\").\n\nFirst you should begin by reading the chapter entitled \"Macro Programming\" in the FontLab Users' Manual, which can be downloaded from the following locations:  \n**Windows:** [US](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.font.to/downloads/manuals/FLS5WinManual.zip) : [Europe](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.fontlab.ch/downloads/manuals/FLS5WinManual.zip) (.zip)  \n**Mac:** [US](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.font.to/downloads/manuals/FLS5MacManual.zip) : [Europe](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.fontlab.ch/downloads/manuals/FLS5MacManual.zip) : [Asia](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.fontlab.hk/downloads/manuals/FLS5MacManual.zip) (.zip)\n\nOnce you have done that, some great resources to start with:  \n [The Unofficial FontLab/Python API Reference](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/dev.fontlab.net/flpydoc/)  \n [The Letterror FontLab Scripting Mailing List Archives](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/mail.letterror.com/pipermail/fontlab-scripting/)\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n[Small release of several python scripts  \n](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/typophile.com/node/17596) [Book Recommendations: Python for FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/typophile.com/node/49944)  \n [Can You Program in Python...?](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2560)\n\n**Additional Articles:**  \n [FontLab: Python Scripting  \n](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/www.fontlab.com/python/) [WikiBooks: FontLab/Scripting](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/en.wikibooks.org/wiki/FontLab/Scripting)  \n [Robofab](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101055129/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Robofab)\n\n",
