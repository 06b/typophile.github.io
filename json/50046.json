The Cursive and Swash Alts styles  \nwere based on the idea for an uncredited film face called Whitley,  \npublished by a little known English typesetting house in the early 1970s.  \nLine & Hack are extrapolations of the above.\n\nSingle styles are offered in basic OpenType with linguistic support for  \nCentral and Eastern European, Turkish, Baltic, Celtic/Welsh and Esperanto  \ncharacter sets.\n\nCounter Cursive Pro combines Cursive & Swash Alts.\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/counter.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081026135723/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/counter.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/counter.html\")  \n————————————————————————  \nFor the month of October, P22 is offering a special Halloween-themed font  \npack- Five Frightening Fonts From Five Foundries!
