      "content": "It is a long story -- too long for a single post. But how about this: Sabon is basically a Garamond -- a \\*Garamond\\* Garamond rather than a \\*Jannon\\* \"Garamond\" (another long story).\n\nSabon was commissioned in the hot metal days, so that both the Monotype and Linotype fonts would be the same.\n\nLots of differences here -- , Monotype is based on the em-system and Linotype is not. With an em-based system, every character (sort) must have even units in width. Originally, an 18-unit em, I believe. No such limitation in Linotype.\n\nBUT. Linotype used duplexed mats, usually meaning the italic and roman were on the same matrix, and so had to have the same width.\n\nFonts for machine-setting with Linotype/Monotype are different from foundry type, which has neither limitation. (Severe limitations in setting speed, though.) I believe originally, the commission was to have all three the same, but in the event, the machine-set fonts were the same, but different from the foundry fonts. If I have this wrong, somebody on this board will correct me.\n\nSo. Sabon was a wonderful compromise, given the objectives. None of these objectives remain in today's composition. In fact, they were absent in the earlier photocomp days (em system yes, but a 54-unit em with Linotype and a 96-unit em with the last Monotype phtocomp machine). BUT. As it happened, Sabon in Linotype photocomp just happened to work out as a very good font -- it printed well. The italic was gappy, but you lived with it. The roman printed better than most other Linotron photocomp fonts\n\nSo from my perspective, Sabon Next was completely recut to get rid of the compromises which occasioned the font in the first place. That essentially makes it another Garamond (of the \"Garamond\" variety). Take you pick.\n\nFor more, search the web . . .\n\n"

      "content": "_As so much of Sabon’s identity, as designed, is predicated on its metrics, it’s hard to see how Sabon Next is really a Sabon at all, other than trading on the name._\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind that Tschichold designed Sabon for three different companies and their respective typesetting systems, not two: Linotype, Monotype, and Stempel 'foundry type', i.e, handset type. And despite the goal of making a metrically equivalent design for both Linotype and Monotype, the three designs were not identical. The foundry type version was not constrained by the mechanical restrictions, and if I recall correctly there is some indication that Tschichold designed the foundry version first and then modified the design to fit the restrictions of the mechanical systems. Jean François' Sabon Next is actually quite close to Tschichold's drawings _for the foundry version,_ with additional influence from the same 16th Century specimen from which Tschichold himself worked. The specimen book and history that Linotype produced for Sabon Next is worth getting hold of if you can find a copy.\n\nThat said, it remains a fact that very few people are familiar with Sabon in its original foundry version, and most typographers know it from the mechanical and derived photomechanical and digital versions. So there is a sense that Sabon properly has weird features like the huge italic o, because that is the form with which people are familiar.\n\nAlso, I do think the regular weight of Sabon Next is too light for use below 12pt, which limits its effectiveness as a text face.\n\n"

I found another Sabon that didn't specifically prohibit modification, and reworked the italics. A long time ago, but as I remember, I threw out all the setwidths and reworked all the wide letters. I had sample of at least one foundry Sabon to look at, though I believe it was fairly large size. Also took the look of some characters from (of all things) Bernier, an A-M offering based on some Monotype Sabon.\n\nWell, my drawing skills rival Jake the Plumbers, but it was OK in text sizes. Taught me a fair bit, & we still use it with jobs after informing the customer.\n\nBut the main thing it taught me was sometimes it is best not to hang onto a typeface after a couple technological changes, even though it was a superlative font for it's intended use.\n\n"

I've seen fews examples of Tschichold's original type from the late '60s (in books about type and typography) and it seems to me pretty much different from its digital renditions. What strikes me most is the shape of \"a\", for example: to my type-amateurish eye it looks narrower than the fatter \"a\" of, say, digital Adobe/Monotype Sabon. And the space between letters looks bigger in the digital version. In this respect, Sabon Next seems to me like a more faithful rendition of Tschichold's original work.\n\nTake a look here:\n\n[http://books.google.com/books?id=FiJ87ixLs0sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Ana...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322043314/http:/books.google.com/books?id=FiJ87ixLs0sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anatomy+of+a+Typeface&hl=com \"http://books.google.com/books?id=FiJ87ixLs0sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Anatomy+of+a+Typeface&hl=com\")\n\nIt's \"Anatomy of a Typeface\" By Alexander S. Lawson; go to pages 151-157 and see the differences between Linotype, Monotype, Stempel and Monophoto Sabon. They look like four distinct types; and the digital version seems drawned on the basis of the Monotype version, while Sabon Next looks closer to the Linotype cut.\n\nAnd here's a (very bad) scan from a book by Jost Hochuli, showing Sabon Linotype on top and photocomp (bottom).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322043314im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hochuli_sabon_4342.jpg)\n\n"

Of course, the nature of a silver halide crystal being what it is, the heavy strokes picked up even more density (gain). The price you paid to get the fine lines from fonts not properly adjusted for the technology.\n\nAnd in making the negative, the printer tended to \"underexpose\" to reduce the lines needing opaquing. More gain.\n\nOn Nick's skipping repro & going straight to negative material -- I believe there was one time when we ran film, as a negative, on the Linotron 202. Frightfully expensive.\n\nOn the whole matter of different masters in metal, of course. In the earlier days of photocomp, you could purchase different master sizes for a few fonts -- an 18-point, 12-point, and 8-point were the most common master sizes. Sometimes you simply used the 8-point for text, as it was the only one where the fine lines stood a chance of printing.\n\nAnd I remember Richard Eckersley using a font -- Vendome(?) for the text of a book. It was only available in an 18-point master, which meant we had to play a lot of tricks to get it to work.\n\nBy in large, photocomp was pretty screwed up, but in some ways, such as different masters, it was ahead of where we are with most digital type. I see the 4- and 5-\"masters\" available from Adobe as a step toward recovery. Countering this is graphic designers (not type designers) falling out of love with a typeface about as fast as casual listeners fall out of love with the latest hit song, so there isn't time for us comps (end users) to fix things, even when a font has a lot of potential.\n\nThis fixing isn't just a matter for type designers. It takes the graphic designers and the comps too; nobody, no matter how clever, can create a typeface that satisfies all needs.\n\n"
