Links?\n\n2) Where would you recommend living? I’m basically looking for a studio @ $1000~ a month...\n\nIf anyone can help me out, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nMike\n\n [‹ Font from printer's 1830 archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907210804/http:/typophile.com/node/45125 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type design DVD's/videos? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907210804/http:/typophile.com/node/18420 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
