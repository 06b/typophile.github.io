There's no reason Novell, Sun or Google can't pay for fonts if the need arises. I think it's happened in the past. The oldest open-source myth is that the people who create it aren't getting paid.\n\nI predict that for 99.99% of consumers, the new fonts have no effect on whether or not they chose to use Microsoft Office.\n\n"

I'm not sure why she thought this (maybe because it was the default choice in Microsoft Word) or why she joined the course, but she did leave a few weeks later. Perhaps she had a breakdown over the idea of using other fonts!\n\nStill, at least Microsoft are \"experimenting\" with another option as the default font. It'll probably involve lots of costly upgrades to the consumer, though. You know, will only work with XP Pro edition 2012 or something silly!\n\n"

Of course Office 2007 hasn't shipped yet but the new default is still there in the latest beta, so unless someone has a serious change of heart we'll be seeing a lot more of that font in the future. Although the font will work 'down-level' it's definitely been designed for the latest rendering technology. There's plenty of information here and on the blogs if your interested - search on \"Calibri\"\n\n"
