  "content": "I’m interested in architectural letters found on the American (and possibly other) apartment buildings from the 1890s and 1900s. I got used to seeing some really well-formed letters like these down in DC, but in New York I’m finding more variety. Does anybody know where these letters came from?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109001357im_/http:/typophile.com/files/viclettrs_4681.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "I assume they were drafted by the architect in his elevation, and executed by stone masons along with the rest of the details.  \nArchitects were familiar with drafting letters for the descriptive text in their plans, and fitted the style of lettering to the style of the building, so were practised and knowledgeable letterers. If lettering was required to appear on the buildings, they were up to the task. Although the L and M here are a tad wide, and the R too narrow.\n\nThe use of a period is interesting.  \nThe Wall Street Journal still uses a period in its nameplate.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, Nick, it didn’t occur to me that the letters would have been drawn by the architect. This would make a lot of sense—I’ve noticed that similar buildings from one neighborhood and one time period have matching letters. I assumed that the letters were cast or metal, but it probably is because the architect was drawing them all.\n\nI’ll still talk about it with James Mosely and Paul Shaw, tho.\n\n"
