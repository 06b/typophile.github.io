  "content": "Hello there,  \nI recently discovered this font about 2 or 3 weeks ago and found the website where it was being sold. The person selling it had only made two fonts, and this was one of them. Since then, I havent been able to find the site and I am wanting to purchase them. Its a quirky one, but I like it. Im not 100% sure its all type driven, the designer may have add some customer work to it.  \nAny help is appreciated it! :)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Screen shot 2013-04-10 at 7.40.46 PM.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130415164734/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20shot%202013-04-10%20at%207.40.46%20PM_1.png) | 179.59 KB |\n\n",
