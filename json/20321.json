  "content": "Hi everyone. I was wondering if I could get some font suggestions for a logo for a swing dance instruction company. They do workshops and private lessons for all kinds of swing dancing (east cost, lindy, charleston, etc.). I think there 2 big unique positions are that they focus a lot more on connection whereas other instructors just teach the steps and moves. The other unique selling point is that they are really good at teaching couples, although they've done private workshops for weddings and other things as well. I think the company's name is going to be Swing This! Tips?\n\n",
