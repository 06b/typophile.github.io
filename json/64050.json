This seems almost like a blend of them, but I thought [Raceway](http://web.archive.org/web/20091113121730/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/raceway/) was closer. Nick Curtis’s Lakeshore Drive is also this style, but not slanted. There are a number of others in this genre shown in Part 7 of my Script Font ID Guide, but I didn’t see an exact match. Maybe someone else recognizes it?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
