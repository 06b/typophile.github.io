It looks like a perfect circle, with no 'shape' or modulation. Does it look odd to anyone else? The first time I saw it in print I thought it was a mistake.\n\nI've tried to attach a scan, but I'm not convinced it's going to show up.

Western mathematics was not comfortable with the concept of zero for some time, and felt that it was not a number in the usual sense.\n\nAccording to [this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20100602123345/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)), the use of the zero came into Europe during the 13th century. Printing is 15th century, so the issue of the acceptance of zero is unlikely to be involved in the circular old style zero. I think it is for typographic reasons, to prevent confusion with the cap, small cap and lc 'o'. It is generally not, in fact, a perfect circle, though it is more circular than any of the o's.\n\n"

It is a problem that has never been really adequately resolved, and we rely heavily on context to distinguish these two characters. In historic revival projects such as Garamond Pro, the designer has to ask 'Should I follow the approach of the original to this problem, or should I try to come up with my own solution'. The answer in most revivals seems to be to follow the original; after all, the selling point of the design is that it is a revival of something e.g. cut by Claude Garamond in the 16th century.\n\n"
