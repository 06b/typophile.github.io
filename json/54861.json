I'm thinking of doing ascii artwork to illustrate the text and match them, hopefully using the same typeface.I'm hoping to find something along the lines of those multi-width typewriters, maybe three or four widths.\n\nMaybe I should look for a monospace typewriter and do some custom editing of wide and narrow glyphs. I want it to be read, but still keep the mono feel somehow.\n\nI'm not too keen on neither Letter Gothic nor The Sans. Magda is way too techy.\n\n"
