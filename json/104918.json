      "content": "I've researched a dozen or so incised, Roman inscription inspired fonts (such as Weiss Titling, Trajan, Grand Central), but found no exact match.\n\nThe serif at the top of the A, the short crossbar of the E, and the W without a serif on its center top point are highly distinctive. It's possible that the type was hand-drawn (Roman or Monumental Capitals are a common exercise for calligraphers).\n\n"
