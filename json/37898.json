  "content": "Hello fellow type-aficionados\n\nI'm sure a lot - if not all - of you do it: Take pictures of type that you think is interesting, well-made or odd in some way. Well, I decided to put mine up on a blog, and you're all very much invited:\n\n[http://www.madshougaard.dk/blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012195511/http:/www.madshougaard.dk/blog)\n\nMy idea is to tag each letter, so that you'll be able to hit (for example) 'e' in the sidebar and be presented with a lot of different ways to do e's. Geeky! I know.\n\nMy hope is that this will turn out to be some sort of inspiration resource when you're designing type or logos.\n\nIf you know of other sites that do the same thing I would be happy to hear from you.  \nOf course, I'd be happy to hear from you altogether :)\n\nBest regards  \nMads\n\n",

I love old street signs.\n\nI was just contacted by Mandy Milks who could answer my question.  \nApparently there are quite a few blogs like mine :)\n\nYou can check out their website here:  \n [http://villatype.blogspot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012195511/http:/villatype.blogspot.com/)\n\nThey also have a nice collection of links to others.\n\n"
