      "content": "The Typoart Garamond is one of the finest reincarnations of this theme. But you look on a \"italic\" for a linotype matirce - so the italic has to be on the same width like the roman. If you read some technical papers about the width limitation, the pro and cons of the linotype versus the monotype system, you will find out, monotype designs can be made more \"true\" (in case of histrical designs) than linotype matrices. There was a different version for monotype matrices too. The handsetting version from 14 or 16pt and above is a beauty. Since this book is a Romanian thing from the 1960ies, its obviously, they would use a \"eastern\" matrice since the hard western money was an issue everytime.\n\nOne thing I like on this Garamond is the kalligraphic and uneven look of the serifs. In these digital days lots of historical designs coming with cloned, equalized, hard edged serifs and steams. Its easier and faster to develop and look more crisp on screen but... the soul is gone. :-)\n\n-- [astype.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20140307112153/http:/www.astype.de/)--\n\n"
