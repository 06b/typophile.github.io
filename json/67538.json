  "content": "Plantin Schoolbook/Infant, Bembo Infant, etc.\n\nIs it that they are easier for children to read? The single-story \"y\" and \"g\", the \"a\", etc., all look rather amusing and fun. They seem to be more decorative variants of the parent font, however.\n\nI assume children find it easier to read this sort of type. Correct? Is it that the single-story shapes are perhaps less complicated and more readily recognizable by children? Or is it that these characteristic letter shapes themselves are smaller and more compact variants, therefore making them \"infants\"?\n\nThanks,\n\nChristian.\n\n",

      "content": "Riccardo, thanks for digging up those older threads. In addition to what Mark said, I repeat what I have written before:\n\nIn my opinion, the significance of a single-storey ‘a’ for children is, at least, debatable. Such a typeface might come in handy for teachers, when it is both used for reading and (as a model for) writing. Apart from that, the benefit of avoiding confusion of ‘a’ and ‘a’ is soon outweighed by the potential – and likely – confusion of ‘a’ and ‘o’.\n\nChildren are not stupid, they can handle more than one representational form per character. Their world doesn’t end at the edges of their primer. They do spot and effortlessly read a lot of different ‘a’ glyphs every day: caps, italics, serifs, sans-serifs, scripts, fat letters, condensed letters, single-storey and double-storey …\n\nFurthermore, here’s what the researchers involved in the [Typographic Design for Children Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234618/http:/www.kidstype.org/) at the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication (University of Reading) have found out about [infant characters](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234618/http:/www.kidstype.org/The%20project/Testing%20typography/Typefaces/typefaces.html#infant%20character):\n\n“Most children in our study were well aware that there were different forms of a and g, and some even made the point that single storey a's and g's are what we write and double-storey a's and g's are what we read. Some commented favourably about what they perceived as the 'normal' g used in Gill Schoolbook.\n\nOther thought that double-storey a's and g's were 'harder' than single-storey a's and g's, but this did not affect their reading performance.\n\nIf infant characters are used it is important that there is clear differentiation between charactes such as o, a and g. This is the case in Gill Educational, for example, but not in Avant Garde Gothic or Helvetica.”  \n— [](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234618/http:/www.kidstype.org/The%20project/Testing%20typography/Typefaces/typefaces.html#infant%20character) [www.kidstype.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414234618/http:/www.kidstype.org/ \"www.kidstype.org\")\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you for the informative replies!\n\nI certainly find infant variants of typefaces interesting to read - \"interesting\" in the fact that their single-story letter features tend to jump out at me as oddities. As an advanced reader I (like most of us are) I'm capable of reading even partially obscured letterforms, partial words, etc. One learns to recognize words and entire phrases in even the poorest of conditions. Of course, I'm speaking as an adult.\n\nAs for children, I think the issue is not as clear as some would like to think. While infant letterforms might mimic a child's handwriting (typically, at least), the child must eventually move on to fill the grown-up shoes of readers who are more readily familiar with standard letterforms. Which is especially true in this day and age of typed/on-screen material. Handwritten material (with a few exceptions) is going the way of the dinosaur. It might be best to move children into reading standardized type as soon as possible. perhaps avoiding infant variants entirely. Of course, this raises the issue of the importance of handwriting as an important step in the development of literacy.\n\n"

Typography for children may be inappropriately designed. _Journal of Research in Reading, 32(4)_, 402–412.\n\nAbstract:  \nWe present four studies indicating that the size and design of the typeface in textual material for children aged 7-9 may impair speed of reading and comprehension, and measurement of reading attainment. The first study compared the speed with which sample sentences were comprehended. The sentences were printed in Arial font with an x-height of 4.2 or 5.0 mm. The sentences were verified 9% more quickly when presented in the larger typeface. The second study compared reading age on the Salford Sentence Reading Test when the typeface remained at the initial size (x-height 3.3 mm) throughout the test, and when it decreased in size as usual. The average reading age measured with the larger font was 4 months older. The final studies compared the font Sassoon Primary with the font Verdana and showed that Verdana was read and searched more quickly.\n\n"

But as a style, formalism is historical.  \nSo the use of infant letterforms has a retro quality.\n\nAlso, the theory of distinct and different character forms for early readers says something about how its proponents think about childhood -- that children are essentially different and not just mini-adults.\n\n"

Japanese schoolbook face is aimed to provide a good example of written form (with pencil). It has some different stroke from Mincho, in which many strokes are stylized. Hiragana has shorter swash in each stroke to make children to learn how to achieve legibility. This typeface is used in primary shool books (age 6-12). After that, Mincho replaces it entirely.\n\nGoing back to Latin, as many people said already, I assume that the whole purpose of schoolbook typeface is that to teach children how to write (than to read). Therefore I think serifed schoolbook faces are pointless (e.g. Bembo). Upright italic typeface with serifless capital letters satisfies the purpose much more effectively. Hopefully, it should be monolinear to imitate pencil writing (Is this the reason why Comic Sans is popular in schools? At least I'm convinced). And it should be replaced with roman as soon as children become aware of the difference bewteen written form and typographic form.\n\n"

Instead, it has to do with the questions students ask teachers, or errors made when children print by imitating the printed model. Even if such typefaces aren't used in books, they might be used in display charts illustrating the alphabet.\n\nOf course, this suggests the use of faces that simulate handprint instead of Infanta variants of normal typefaces. Fortunately, though, it is unlikely that anyone will stoop to teaching the children of the future to read with Comic Sans or anything similar. (And then there's the culturally-sensitive and politically-correct Papyrus...)\n\nI know that when I was young, although Century Schoolbook was used for early readers, there was a sense that the \"canonical\" form of the print alphabet was Caslon - all other typefaces being deviations from that one truth. Today, if schools want to avoid straining the brains of the young tykes by teaching them to recognize the English alphabet in multiple typefaces, they could just use Times Roman for everything.\n\n"

However, it falls down on several grounds:\n\n- Kids see letters all over the place, not just in class. Most of the letters they see do not use the \"infant\" forms, so restricting the materials used in their class materials is of minimal help.\n\n- They already have to learn 52 letters, 10 numerals, and and assorted punctuation. Maybe about 65-70 characters altogether. Learning just a couple of variants is really going to be that hard?\n\n- If you want to avoid confusing them, actively \\*teach\\* them that these letters can take two different forms. They are going to encounter them anyway. What will really confuse them is encountering them without being told what they are! Similarly for sans vs serif and other concerns....\n\n- The one and only study on the subject, by Sue Walker, showed that even in first grade, kids preferred the more adult forms to the infant forms.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

Of course there are other problems, such as dyslexia, but a simple schoolbook type solution won't help there (nor will some of the so-called dyslexia-fixing typefaces, which complicate the matter by introducing far too many variables instead of looking for a simple solution)\n\nSince trying to teach children writing in block letters has been extremely sub par, the difference between the taught script and the reading letterforms is already huge, that the few 'schoolbook-specific' letterforms won't really matter much.\n\n"
