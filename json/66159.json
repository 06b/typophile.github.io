Any faces with unusual treatments of letters, like Ambroise's **g** I'd stay away from. Children's brains are built to understand that different instances of the same thing are the same thing. If the child's parents speak with different dialects, they don't have problems understanding both equally well. But if someone speaking a radically different dialect tries communicating, the kid might get confused because they haven't set up the sound-equivalences in their brains yet. Similarly with type (I would think), they learn very quickly that single-storey **a** and two-storey **a** are the same thing, but might not recognise Galliard Italic's **_g_**. Sans vs serif? My guess would be any comprehension differences would be minimal and could be without significance difference.\n\nI'd say pick something that looks nice with your book and make it fun.\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant, I am to this day confused about your position against skeleton-based lettermaking. As a guideline for type design, it makes ample sense. It's perfectly clear that type designers should be designing the inner and outer outlines, not some imaginary skeleton. But this should be all behind the scenes stuff, in service of the reader. When you talk about the need to instil doubt into children about skeleton-based lettermaking, you lose me. Nor is it clear to me that children are going to develop different opinions about letter-making just because they are brought up reading Legato instead of Helvetica.\n\nSkeleton-based thinking may be detrimental to good type design, but skeletons play a crucial part in how we perceive forms such as letters. We are able to recognize glyphs in vastly different styles to be representing the same character thanks to their shared structure. So lay people are perfectly justified in thinking of letters in terms of skeletons. They do not have to understand what makes the type they read successful, any more than they have to understand the theory of jet propulsion and lift to enjoy air travel.\n\nAlso, I am not ready to give up writing by hand. I've come to realize that many people hardly ever write with their own hand for anyone else to read, and only ever read type. But I am not convinced that we should forcibly be removing the connection between the forms we make by hand and the forms that we read. And I am certainly not convinced that we should not be writing letters by hand that are meant to be read.\n\nIndeed, for the moment, access to type technology is limited for certain cultures, and the standards of typography aren't advanced enough for certain writing systems for type to supplant handwriting. I understand Hrant's desire for progress, but be careful with pushing type too fast; limitations of technology have often forced simplifications on writing systems in the past (elimination of ligatures, conjuncts, contextual variations), whether desirable or not. For many writing systems, type is still playing catch-up to handwriting when it comes to beauty and readability.\n\n"

Object recognition—character recognition included—mostly does not involve higher cognitive processes, but it's certainly a complex process that we have trouble replicating with machines (hence the existence of captchas). It's not clear which features are extracted from the visual inputs, and it seems that several modes may be in operation (a primary mode picks up simple, familiar inputs and a secondary mode distinguishes the details not picked up by the first one). But for me, intuitively, the idea is that the brain reduces the words (or any object to be recognized) into simple components whose spatial arrangement is the key to its recognition. There are multiple levels at work here, of course, and things like serifs and areas of contrast present visual cues that enhance recognition. These cues are of course really important. But I think they work in service to the primary mode of recognition, which is based on the spatial arrangement of the basic shapes (like the idea that the letter \"D\" consists of a straight vertical line segment and a curved segment attached to its right), which is what I'm really thinking of as the skeleton.\n\nA skeleton of a \"D\", absent all other cues, would still be recognizable as a \"D\". You can have all the components (the serifs, the contrast, etc.) that make a typographically successful \"D\" but if they are not put together according to the skeleton (the particular configuration of shapes) of a \"D\", no one will recognize it as one. So the skeleton is an essential part of a letter's identity, and as I think of it, is more abstract than merely the path traced by someone with a marking utensil to produce a letter.\n\nI have to admit that it's really difficult to verbalize and explain what I'm thinking, and it's hard to see where it is that we actually disagree!\n\nHrant, until most of humanity is ready to give up writing by hand forever, I would be hesitant to sever that link. Type design is accessible only to a tiny minority, and the technology is more likely to have a dumbing-down effect and stifle innovation. In cultures where people still produce by hand texts that are meant to be read, I think there is a bit more room for innovation and individual expression. But here, I'm thinking more of scripts like Arabic than Latin.\n\n(Either Brian and Jongseong is fine. They both are my given names; I just chose Jongseong as my ID because it would be less likely to be a duplicate ID. Perhaps Jongseong will be less confusing for casual readers who don't check the profile pages.)\n\n"

It's about limiting it, but far more than what we've seen in type design so far. Most people don't even see there's a problem, so they can't be part of the solution (that being not some utopia, but merely improvement).\n\nWe cannot improve any more along this path - we're stuck in a rut.\n\n\\> In cultures where people still produce by hand texts that  \n\\> are meant to be read, I think there is a bit more room for  \n\\> innovation and individual expression.\n\nWhen it comes to innovation: I think the opposite.

No matter how you twist and turn while marking the Black, it can't be as ideal as marking their border.\n\nA fitting parallel I like to draw is the relationship of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, his slave.

      "content": "I will try to explain why handwriting is not something to be so easily discarded. Despite its obvious limitations, it has probably done more for readability than most purposely non-chirographic thinking, especially the tendency to \"rational\", geometric shapes.\n\nTake Legato. When I see Legato, I don't see clunkiness. As Hrant posits, if you are conditioned to expect only strokes that look like they could plausibly formed with certain writing implements, it may look awkward. But if you don't have that baggage, the letters look perfectly natural.\n\nEven more, I get a calligraphic feel from Legato (Hrant is going to furiously raise his eyebrows at this). It's certainly not calligraphic in the way the strokes are formed; the strokes emerge from the simultaneous design of the black and the white, not from expansion along a path. Rather, it's because Legato has a gentle but noticeable contrast in the strokes that depends on the angle. You can see that Legato's \"O\" is thinnest around 5 o' clock and 11 o' clock.\n\nThis sort of stroke modulation owes much to calligraphy, especially with the broad nib. At the risk of broad simplification, I think this enhances readability by adding more visual cues that distinguish differently-angled strokes than just the angles themselves.\n\nLegato's \"O\" warrants another look, as it is not the vertically symmetric shape found in many sans designs but is gently inclined, much like a handwritten \"O\". The curves in Legato generally stay away from the simple and symmetric shapes favoured by rationalists. This is good for readability because it means more cues for distinguishing different letters. If \"humanist sans serif\" is a term that is set in opposition to the constructed shapes of geometrics and grotesques, then Legato out-humanists the humanist sans designs that are more explicitly based on calligraphy, being constrained by neither simple geometry nor the devotion to shapes that can be produced by hand.\n\nSo Legato's strengths, I would say, are in taking from the good from handwriting without actually being constrained to make something looking like handwriting.\n\nOf course, these aspects of handwriting that aid in readability developed mostly accidentally and subconsciously. A handwritten \"O\" is inclined because it is easier to write, due to handedness or whatever, not primarily because it is easier to read. Also, people must have liked the shapes produced by writing utensils that give stroke contrast for reasons of style, not readability (at least not consciously). Indeed, I think extreme contrast may hurt readability, but it is often pursued for stylistic reasons.\n\nBut handwriting is much faster than designing type, and it gives room for great variety and experimentation. Through repeated practice, people can learn how to correct for optical illusions and give even texture while still making easily distinguishable shapes. Also, because they are not constrained to a limited glyph set, they can automatically adjust shapes to prevent clashes.\n\nSo I still think a thorough familiarity with handwriting and making letters by hand is beneficial to type design. As long as you don't think of type as something to reproduce the shapes made by hand but as a medium to free you from those constraints (admittedly quite tricky), your experience and ideas shaped by making letters by hand should be helpful.\n\n"

Heavy horizontal and light vertical works in Hebrew, but the glyphs are designed quite differently.\n\nLegato is not in principle reverse-contrast, as it has the principle of twisting the outer forward and inner back. But the result in the case of the s is reverse contrast anyway.\n\nThe other shapes I don't find particularly attractive either, but the 'clunky' I think is where the reversed-contrast pokes its head up.\n\n"

      "content": "Craig, that was perhaps a bit presumptuous on my part to make such conclusions on the intentions of whoever introduced stroke contrast. It's just that I think style is more visible than good readability (\"Hmm, that looks more stylish\" seems more likely than \"Hmm, that is easier to read\"). But maybe I'm denying our forebearers credit unjustly here. We're certainly not the first generation to question how to serve the reader more.\n\nWilliam, the reverse contrast (which you also see to some degree in letters like \"a\" and \"e\") doesn't bother me as much, maybe because I'm used to the stroke contrast model of the Korean alphabet and Chinese characters. These certainly don't have reverse contrast, but they can have lots of parallel horizontal strokes, and a common solution is to make the outer strokes slightly heavier; it's easier to see that applying this principle to the Latin lower case letters having some crowded horizontal strokes will yield heavy top and bottom strokes.\n\n"

The e I don't mind the thinner crossbar--Gill sans does have thinning in e and a somewhat similar, and it doesn't bother me, though some don't like it. So I don't object to the principle you mentioned of thinning inner strokes.\n\nBut the left side of the e looks lumpy to me. It may be the thinness at the the northwest corner, I'm not sure. I just think the theory he operated on ends up with somewhat awkward, lumpy looking glyphs.\n\n"
