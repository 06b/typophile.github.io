  "content": "Looking to get some critique on a new logo for a client, World of Beer. I am not formally trained in typography and graphic design, so I am unsure as to where to align the letters in \"World of Beer\". A couple questions...\n\n1. Should the \"W\" and the \"B\" sit slightly below the baseline because they are larger than the other letters?  \n2. Should the \"o\" in \"World\" also sit slightly below (but still a bit higher than the \"W\" and the \"B\") because it has a rounded lower extent?  \n3. I currently have the horizontal line below the \"World of Beer\" centered on the bottom left point of the \"W\" in \"World\" and the bottom right point of the \"R\" in \"Beer\". Is this correct? Should the right side of the line be aligned with the upper-right rounded part of the \"R\" in \"Beer\"? Should the left side of the line be aligned slightly to the left of where it is now?  \n4. The clear space on the left and right sides around the logo is currently calculated from the edges of the horizontal line. I'm unsure if this is correct, as it currently looks a bit off. This might be corrected by adjustments made from answers to previous question.\n\nAny other comments and critiques are welcome. Thanks in advance for the advice.\n\nCheers,  \nJ.W.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [worldofbeer.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019191523/http:/typophile.com/files/worldofbeer.jpg) | 34.86 KB |\n\n",

Does the fact that the \"W\" in \"World\" and \"B\" in \"Beer\" are much bigger than the other letters have any effect on where they should lineup in relation to the baseline? Should they be slightly below or directly on the baseline?\n\nI'm also still unsure about the horizontal alignment issue (#'s 3&4).\n\nThanks again for the article.\n\n"

So, the \"World of Beer\" part was not my design, just the globe. But it's not too late to change little aspects of it. I too have always thought that the \"of\" was just floating in mid-air. At this point, I don't think i'll be able to make a change as drastic as dropping it to the baseline, but i could make the \"o\" the same size as the \"f\" and align the top of them with the median line (see changes below).\n\nAnother person left a comment about the stroke weight needing to be uniform. I'm working on that right now. It's taking a little while b/c i dont actually have this particular font. I actually had to trace the old logo b/c all the client had was a TIFF file.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019191523im_/http:/typophile.com/files/worldofbeer_new_5930.jpg)\n\n"

If the sign on the storefront is the only thing they don't want to change, there's little to no reason to not improve upon the original for all other applications while you have the opportunity.\n\nAgreed about Arial. One of the babillion American gothics might work really well here.\n\nFunny, while I write this I can see the logo peripherally while I look in the box I'm typing. The indirect image out of the corner of my eye interprets it as the Jurassic Park logo. Try it for yourself.\n\n"

The storefront is certainly not the only place where this logo will show up. As far as storefronts go, they currently have one store, but 10 more locations are signed and scheduled to open in the next two years (with more to come i'm sure). In my opinion, now is the time to perfect this logo. Better to make the change now than two years from now.\n\nchecking out the babillion American gothics now.\n\nman, i haven't seen the Jurassic Park logo in years. I just checked it out, and it does look similar, especially when out of the corner of the eye. haha.\n\n"

Examples: Trade Gothic, Franklin Gothic, News Gothic, etc...\n\nI should have said: \"One of the many varieties of American gothic typefaces, such as Franklin Gothic, might work really well here.\"\n\nThis is not a great cut of Copperplate, either (if not an ingenuine knockoff; _faux bold_, perhaps?). I'm just saying that your globe and its placement is pretty awesome, and while you're updating this parts of this old-school logo, perhaps you should go all out and update all of the type. ; )\n\nGood luck!\n\n"
