Bitstream version [Flareserif 821](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014194646/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/flareserif-821) is another option to get such boldness. There are also [some extra-bold versions of Albertus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014194646/http:/typophile.com/node/27712) (Alaska) shipped by HP and Brother with their laser printers.\n\n"
