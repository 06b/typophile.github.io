I've tried myfonts to no avail. Thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Monsieur.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422023927/http:/typophile.com/files/Monsieur.gif) | 10.83 KB |\n\n",

The most readily available version is [Dieter Steffmann's Herkules](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422023927/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/h/herkules.htm). The download link says T1, but there's an Opentype font in the download as well.\n\nIt was also available from Opti as Huk Light.\n\n"

[Castcraft](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422023927/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/designer4/designer4.07.html) is the only vendor for these fonts these days and good luck trying to deal with them. Also, the fonts were made ages ago (in computer time) so I don't know about quality there either.\n\n"
