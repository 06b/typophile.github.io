The final I think is just too black, and I like the whole positive/negative overlay that happens in number 6, and number 4 I think is a good start...it still looks a little pieced together though. Perhaps if you made the little C the same thickness as the rest of it, it would appear to be more unified. Good luck.\n\nDavid\n\n"

I would recommend that you try printing the elements onto acetate and try overlaying and moving them until you get a clearer composition.  \nTim\n\n"
