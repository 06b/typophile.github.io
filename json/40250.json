As above, turn on hyphenation, or at the very least fine-tune your justification settings; the word-gaps (especially in the third section of page 2) are awful.\n2. While I find far too many books slaughter their margins and ignore proper proportions, I'd be surprised if your client doesn't kill you for all that wasted space (and paper) at the outer edge and bottom; this is, after all, not a 15th century codex -- also, as above, open up your spine margin a bit or it will get swallowed.\n3. I'd give more bottom air to your chapter heading and chapter title (that is, put some space between the chapter title and the small-cap intro-line).\n4. If the Chinese characters only appear on chapter openings (recto pages), I'd hang them outside the text block in that very generous margin.\n5. Letterspace your small-cap strings (the intro lines, but also everywhere you use small caps).\n6. The x-height is too drastically different from the first to the second fonts on page 1.\n7. (This is editorial, but) first lines of new sections should NOT be indented.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the comments Jason, they're what I was looking for when I posted. I'll take your points in order:\n\n1. Justification & hyphenation &c. _will_ be turned on when I move the layout to ConTeXt. I'm temporarily using OpenOffice to get a general feel for how things will look before trying an unfamiliar software package.  \nBesides, what program can hyphenate Lorem ipsum?\n2. I _am_ the client; this is a project for my own ammusement intended to teach myself (an engineering major) something about practical typography. I chose the Van de Graaf canon and 6″×9″ trim as a default; by all means suggest more practical/modern proportions and margins.\n3. How's this corrected version ( [Hanging Chinese.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310021238/http:/typophile.com/files/Hanging%20Chinese.pdf))?\n4. The Chinese headings are now in the margin; does this really look better, or is it just to \"use\" the margins somehow?\n5. The small-caps had been letterspaced; I increased the tracking a bit more. Is it better now?\n6. I matched the x-height, but now the color looks very different. Is that a good thing, or should I be looking for a different complementary font?\n7. Fixed.\n\n—Joel\n\n"

      "content": "Glad these bits & pieces are useful; a few more...\n\n1. Sounds good.\n2. To take a step backwards, 6″×9″ is a gangly page, too wide for its height, but it's also one of the two most standard formats in North American printing, so in terms of economics it's what most publishers would push for. However, as you're your own client, I'd knock the width down to 5.75″. From there, use the Van de Graaf formula to establish your text block, then move it towards the outer edge to allow for creep, then nudge your outer and bottom margins to find a balance between classical proportions and contemporary norms. I use no set formula for this, but, depending on type-size/leading/etc., paper, and, of course, the subject matter of the book itself, I try a variety of measurements until the page is right. Hanging matter (such as if you were to hang the Chinese characters) will also play a role in determining your margins, but generally it's just about finding the right contrast of text-block to white-space, and at the moment, although based on classical proportions, your page looks out of whack.\n3. I'm backtracking, sort of, but I'd either drop the first paragraph more, or less; at the moment the chapter headings are feeling a bit uncertain.\n4. More than just \"using\" the margin, I found the earlier setting awkward in the way the body copy wrapped around the Chinese characters. Try dropping the Chinese string down so that it begins at the same x-height as the first line of body text.\n5. It's better now with the first font; the second font still needs a bit more tracking.\n6. You're right, the color is a bit off, but the sizing looks much better. Maybe nudge the second font up just slightly in size to draw out the color, or, scrap the second font and find another with a better x-height match.\n\n"
