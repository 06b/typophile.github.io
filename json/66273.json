We should probably look at the [Monotype Lydian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043711/http:/www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=205752&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=77193&query=LYDIAN&SCOPE=Fonts), since I think they were the originating foundry in it's pre-digital form.\n\nHmm. The same differences appear to be present. I wonder who else has a version that matches these details you noted?

      "content": "I think it's fascinating how similar Chappell's typeface is to this one \"Stahl\". It wouldn't be the first time a foundry was 'inspired' by work from another foundry. According to Jaspert's Encyclopaedia Lydian was done for ATF between 1938 and 1946, not Monotype, as I had thought. McGrew's book says Lydian Bold Condensed was the last one designed. No mention is made in either book of \"Stahl\" as being similar.\n\nFrom what I could find looking at the Klingspor Museum site, Stahl is not a Rudolf Koch design. In fact, on [Linotype's page on the Klingspor Foundry's typeface collection](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043711/http:/www.linotype.com/49-14024/19331962.html) it lists Stahl as the work of H. Kühne, in 1939, a year after Chappell's design of Lydian.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
