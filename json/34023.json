The lowercase 't' puts me off trail (it's kinda like Bodoni, but not really)\n\nWhat are we looking at?\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110403021823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/scanorama_sans_6382.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110403021823im_/http:/typophile.com/files/scanorama_serif_3799.jpg)\n\n",

The numerals being used are the default hybrid/Scotch style, which are working well in running text.\n\nI wish that I could help with the text serif ID, beyond saying that it's not Miller or Mercury. In the sample inline above, there is a little bit of italic, which is very helpful.
