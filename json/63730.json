  "content": "Hi not sure if its ok to post two at same time. Any ideas on either would be great. Looking for an alternative to compacta or helvetica compressed.\n\n1) BasimPastillen.png\n\nFirst reads \"Basim Pastillen\" from a book called \"Sans Serif: The Ultimate Sourcebook of Classic and Contemporary Sans Serif Typography\"\n\nIt is credited as being from a Berthold Foundry catalogue. Does not specify which face it is though.\n\n2) KunstHalle.png\n\nFrom book about Swiss Graphic Design. The origins and growth of an international style. Page 214. Poster for Sculpture Exhibition by Armin Hoffman 1958.\n\nMight be Helvetica compressed or something but not quite sure.\n\nmany thanks  \nsmallprint\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830080703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/BasimPastillen_4193.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140830080703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Kunsthalle_4639.png)\n\n",
