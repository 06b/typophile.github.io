However, since it's a non-paying gig and the clients are my boyfriend and our close friend, I'm continuing to tweak it ad infinitum....\n\nWith the help of some typophiles, I've revisited the kerning. How does this look to y'all?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020190406im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_5346.png)\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "This font was designed to be set tighter I think - so when you open it up for logo use if you want to make it splendid instead of very good you have to change the shapes of the letters. I think it is quite good now. I might add a hair more space between the s & c to get that last little bit of what's possible before you edit outlines. BTW I think the wider spacing works better & is needed because the bright colors and the relative darkness of them interferes with reading the letter shapes a little. The extra space leps you find the forms. What if the puddle were slightly less high? Or higher? How does that feel? What if the puddles were just a bit lower?\n\n"

Eben, the logo will mostly be seen at small sizes, with the glaring exception of the large banner. While the latter may well benefit from changing the letterforms, I think the former won't.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020190406im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_3_6229.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020190406im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_cmyk_looser_flat_3b_6632.png)\n\n"

Theoretically you could make adjustments for any optical size that was different than the one the font was designed to be used in. Unless you want to second guess the designer, in which case you can have at the intended sizes too. I tend to want to do all that. Then there is the question of specific letter relationships and the question of being eye catching. Either of those could also drive you to adjust letters - especially in a logo. In your logo though the color is the eye catcher. For me this is what's left: the r keeps grabbing my attention because it feels too dark/heavy to me. But that may just be me. I would probably try a bit more space between the s&c again as well.\n\n"

That might be a place for special logo oriented letter shape alteration. Either the left outer serif on the m, or the tail of the a or a bit of both.\n\nYou could also just open everything up to match the a/m relationship. If it was going to be used very small I might go that route. For use at larger sizes I would pull the m in tighter.\n\n"

I've been forbidden from touching the logo any more, but if I sneak in some tweaks, it will be to extend the a tail a little, and perhaps loosen up the front of the word to match the end.\n\nFor now, though - I need to finish the flavors, sizes, and biz cards!
