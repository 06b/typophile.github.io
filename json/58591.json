Note: this is part of a Johnson boat motor.\n\nI have been able to find some near matches--like Agency and Bank Gothic--but have not been able to find a match with the horizontal terminal on the G and the correct slope on the 2.\n\nThank you for any help you can provide,\n\nDuncan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021031409im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Johnson-logo-typesample-3_6465.jpg)\n\n",
