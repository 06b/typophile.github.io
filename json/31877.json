Last but not least I’d like to thank Dr. Hakan Ertep & Dr. Tevfik Balcioglu for their understanding.\n\nThe letters of the alphabet, the characters of a typeface are building blocks ; as well as I believe that writing is architecture, _may graphic design & typography not be banned_.\n\n [‹ [bull-fighting] SOS ligature](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010709/http:/typophile.com/node/31909 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typography Books with their own websites ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080503010709/http:/typophile.com/node/31866 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
