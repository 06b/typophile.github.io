I have thought of a few ways to do this. Microfilm being the most efficient.\n\nCan you suggest other ways of going about this please?\n\nAlso can you suggest where I could find authentic fonts from that era?\n\nThank you very much\n\n",

This will of course give you initial dates of use, but fonts created 100 or more years before 1870 might still be in use.\n\nRather than microfilm, you might find that a university library is a good hunting ground for old type. A long established library will have many books on the shelves that are over 100 years old.\n\n"

Let's hope the local schools have what I'm looking for.\n\nI have been getting closer to what I'm looking for.\n\nI'm hoping to study typefaces such as the ones found in the GRAND THEATRE and BLACKPOOL posters found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170203/http:/www.blackpoolcircusschool.co.uk/circus_history.html)\n\nAnd the stuff Christopher H. Bing used in his re-design of \"Casey at the Bat\" in 2000.\n\nIt's the first time in my life as a designer that type strikes a deep and resonant nearly emotional chord in me.\n\nLink  \n [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170203/http:/www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-1929766009-0)  \n(sorry, no pics of the interior spreads which are stellar! That first spread blew me away! I finally understood the genius behind the genuine typesetters of the era he was emulating.)\n\nI simply must study this further. I am quite possessed by this in fact.\n\n"
