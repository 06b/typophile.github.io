The lettering in a tattoo can be a hand-drawn copy of a font, but it won't be a font until they invent a tattoo robot.\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry zunelle but, even if I can't agree more with Victor, you should reconsider your point of view for this one. I'm 100% positive. The base font is definitely Burgues Script. Have a look to the [glyph palette](http://web.archive.org/web/20140509080741/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/burgues-script/regular/glyphs.html) if you need more flourish letters. And for the rest, it has been modified and adapted to look more \"tattoo\": letters have been outlined and some flourishes reworked to look more \"pointy\"\n\n"
