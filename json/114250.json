  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nI'm trying to find some authentic (as possible) digitised versions of historical English sans serif typefaces.\n\nAlong the lines of: Caslon Sans, Figgins, Johnston etc.\n\nI've been trawling the forums and it seems like Caslon Sans is difficult to get hold of/has a strange license (I might be wrong). The one I've seen which I really like is John Morgan's version.\n\nI've looked at Figgins, and as beautiful as it is, it is a little 'bulky', for want of a better word, for my use.\n\nMy knowledge of type history is patchy and ill-informed at best so forgive my vagueness!\n\nI'm looking for something along the lines of a sans serif that could have been used on an English shop from an unspecified time 'back in the day', with a bit of quirk and character.\n\nEnglish designed and digitised would be ideal but willing to look at other digitised versions of typefaces based on grotesque's if need be, such as Klim's Founders Grotesk: [https://klim.co.nz/blog/founders-grotesk-design-information/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032053/https:/klim.co.nz/blog/founders-grotesk-design-information/ \"https://klim.co.nz/blog/founders-grotesk-design-information/\") which is as close a one I can find. It is a lovely font!\n\n",

Some were clumsy, some were elegant.  \nIf you are looking for grotesque typefaces that might have influenced sign makers you might start with something like Monotype Grotesque of 1926, available as a digital font [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-grotesque/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032053/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-grotesque/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/monotype-grotesque/\")  \nA list of headline grotesque fonts [http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/angloamerican\\_headline\\_grotesque/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414032053/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/angloamerican_headline_grotesque/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/angloamerican\\_headline\\_grotesque/\")  \nFor interesting variations google \"wooden type\" \"grotesque.\"  \nCharacteristics of the English grotesque, as compared to other sans may include a vertical spur on the G and a square M. Also check the design of a, e, g and t in fonts known to be grotesque.  \nDon\n\n"
