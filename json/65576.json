I just know it.\n\nAside from that insurmountable issue, I have to partition the drive & load windows to run some of my old windows aps and get at some of my old files.\n\nAny suggestions? Can I just use \"Bootcamp\", or as I have been told, do I have to install something like Parallel?\n\nthanks\n\n",

I do web design on my Mac, but I can monitor how things are working out (or not) in IE by running it through crossover on a secondary monitor. Works very well for me.\n\n"

There must be more specialized forums out there that should be of more help with this sort of question than Typophile.  \nThat said, in my understanding it mostly depends how you intend to use the 2 systems. I'd say Parallels is more flexible if your workflow involves some Windows programs – being able to run Windows and OSX «side by side», and copy-paste between them etc. is pretty nice. If OTOH the stuff you do on Windows stuff is not so «interlocked» with a Mac-based workflow, so rebooting is not a PITA, Bootcamp should work out fine.\n\n"

If you boot to Windows through Boot Camp, this isn't a problem. Don't know what software you plan on running, but I run AutoCAD and SolidWorks on my Mac/Windows machine, so having only half the RAM is not an option. I'm still running Tiger and Boot Camp Beta however (I couldn't tell you the last time I booted into OS X), so this restriction may no longer exist -- however I can't imagine that.\n\nYou might also look at Sun's Virtual Box for a VM solution.

Each app (including virtual machines) can take as much memory as they need. The hard disk will be used if there isn't enough physical RAM available, mainly for inactive apps, but even for the active ones if necessary. You can't allocate more RAM on your virtual Windows machine than is installed on your Mac, and you will definitely run into performance problems if you allocate the maximum (a couple hundred MB less than the installed physical RAM), but short of that, it's no different than using any other app.\n\nAlso, unless you are using some other app that is hogging the CPU, Windows will get all the CPU it asks for, again, just like any other app.\n\n"

      "content": "Perhaps new versions of Parallels are different, but I'm fairly certain that older versions did split your CPU in half. One core for OS X, the other core for Windows. Though I haven't looked into running Windows as a VM under OS X in 2 years or so. No doubt other VM solutions don't impose this restriction, and I wouldn't be surprised if newer versions of Parallels didn't either. Nor would I be surprised if I was totally misinformed about older versions of Parallels.\n\nIn retrospect, the 'half your RAM' crap I was told was probably just a rule-of-thumb for standard 2GB RAM MBPs. 1GB for each OS to avoid going into the harddrive swap that Mark mentioned. At any rate, doing 3D modeling on a VM doesn't make much sense to me -- nor does re-licensing all my software for OS X -- so it's been Bootcamp all the way.\n\nAnd I will say that the only bad experience I've had with Bootcamp is related to the battery driver. Again, no doubt fixed in newer releases. But if you decide to go with Bootcamp, and your CPU usage in Windows jumps to 100% and everything goes to pot -- before you're tempted to throw your computer against the wall, disable the ACPI-Compliant battery driver. If that 'fixes' things, re-enable the driver, reboot into OS X, reboot into Windows, and everything should be coming-up-roses.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi!\n\nFirstly I would recommend you Parallels as a solution for not too resource demanding tasks. It runs fast and smooth and file-exchange between the systems are easily done. Bootcamp I use sooo rarely, like once every 4 months when I play a game for an hour or two. That is the only reason I can imagine one could need Bootcamp for, if you don't use things like CAD or other heavy programs.\n\nSecondly, I like macs, I own one, but: Give it back now! And buy a new MacBook Pro in a month from now, a new CPU generation from Intel is arriving, Codename arrandale, and it will increase performance very noticeable, especially tasks which can't make use of a multi-core processor, the performance of a single core is boosted up quite a bit. Plus maybe apple drops price, or adds a bigger hard drive, more memory, or does some other make-over... more value for the same money. But this is just a personal opinion ;) Do as you please. ;) With SuperDuper! (free for basic function) You could make a bootable backup of your harddrive and copy it back with the migration assistant (OS X onboard application) once you have your new mac.\n\nBest,  \nFlo\n\n"
