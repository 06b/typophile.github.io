Sometimes the result is that the paired glyph 'violates' ductal logic. Meanwhile the dots reside somewhat in a world of their own.\n\nI am intrigued by all of this. And I don't want to imply that what you are doing with contrast is wrong. But what is the thinking behind this? How does this pattern of contrast manipulation play out in word- and text-length-contexts? Does this contrast flipping have a readability benefit or exact a cost?\n\n"

      "time": "26 Aug 2005 — 11:15am",
      "content": "Peter Enneson: yes, I noticed that too. The syllabary has two major symmetry groups. One, which I'll call \"delta\", has an internal mirror symmetry, and appears in four orientations. For example, \"I\", which strongly resembles a Greek capital delta, becomes \"O\", \"E\", and \"A\" when turned to 3, 6, and 9 o'clock respectively. The other, which I'll call \"p\", has no mirror symmetry (in other words, is chiral), and appears in a total of eight orientations: the four compass points times two for the mirror flips. For example, \"KI\", which strongly resembles a \"p\", becomes \"NE\", \"KO\", and \"NA\" in the four clockwise rotations, and becomes \"KE\" in left-right mirror symmetry (resembling a \"q\"), which in turn becomes \"NO\", \"KA\", and \"NI\" in clockwise rotation.\n\nI see that Jim has taken great care to respect the ductal logic for the 90 degree rotations (\"O\" is beautifully different from a 90 degree rotation of \"I\"), but for the reflections, the implied angle of the pen also reflects. Note that 180 degree rotation leaves pen shape essentially invariant.\n\nWhen putting the sounds together with the shapes, though, I observed that the logic of the syllabary is organized around reflections, not rotations. KI becomes KE with a reflection around the vertical axis, and becomes KA with a reflection around the horizontal. It also becomes KO with a reflection around both axes (in either order), which is also equivalent to a 180 degree rotation.\n\nSo it may well be that the contrast flipping violates the ductal logic but at the same time respects the syllabic logic. Jim, did you ever sketch the other way round? If so, did literate Canadians find one odd and the other natural?\n\nJim [re digitization]: I'm not surprised to learn that you used a Bezier digital outline as an intermediate step. Several straight-curve transitions have the abrupt curvature shifts characteristic of Bezier outlines, including TE (resembling \"U\") at 3-4 o'clock, and KI (resembling \"p\") at 5-6 o'clock, and at 9 o'clock.\n\nIf I were doing the digitization, I would be very tempted to release it as a free font. It seems to me that the most compelling argument against free fonts (that it takes away incentive for font designers to sell their work) doesn't really apply here - the pay-font market obviously isn't viable, or else somebody would have done a professional Cree digital font. (and btw, the font in the Unicode 3 book, which I'm using to look up the sounds, is just as bad as the other samples I linked above)\n\nJim [re averaging of letter frequencies]: actually, I'm not convinced that averaging is the best way to go. What you really want to do is shoot for worst-case usage. For example, for the glyphs which have West-Cree variants (mostly a different dot position), just averaging texts from West and Moose variants will leave you with about half the frequency for both variants. If you were going to set a book page in West-Cree, though, you'd want 100% of the frequency for the West-Cree variant, and wouldn't be upset at all about their counterparts sitting idle in the case. Similarly, for a very infrequent glyph such as SHO, you want to be ready for a page in which it appears in someone's name.\n\nSi [re Unicode]: Yes, absolutely. A font like this wants to be encoded as Unicode, not in ASCII with a keyboard mapping.\n\nSorry if I've geeked out excessively here. It's kinda my nature.\n\n"

      "content": "Hrant and Raph\n\nThanks for your questions and very thorough alalysis of the calligraphy in the Cree.\n\nYou are right: there are arguments going on back and forth between the mirrored glyphs. I could say I did this to simply annoy you both, but the truth is I did the drawings quickly with a big juicy ad marker in my left-hand calligraphic way. The contradictions are because I was rushing as I often do and merely flipped some of the characters. In many cases I went back in and altered these on the 360 point printouts that I used to cut as paper patterns. Many of them were missed.\n\nI agree with you that if this is to be a digital font it needs to be brought into line, and I will certainly do that.\n\nThe one saving grace about it as a metal font is that the terminations are so small as to not jump out too loudly. Since I think that the metal type will very likely never see the light of day outside my own workshop, I am going to leave it as is. At least it is an honest if hurried effort to execute the face with some style instead of the straignt geometric renderings I have been used to. On the other hand, now that ouy have pointed it out to me, it may irritate me so much that I will have to go back in and recut about 40 characters. Thanks a lot, fellas!\n\nThe idea of making this variant of Cree available as a free font is a good one. I have made an offer to a font company as a gift with the thought in m ind that sales would likely be slight, and that it would be a nice gesture to offer it as a free font. I almost cringe at the thought of making money on the backs of a culture that has been roundly dumped on in history. I feel quite embarrassed at the sight of a white man carving a Haida or Kwaikutl totem pole, and I want to avoid the notion that I have pinched something from the native culture.\n\nIf the opportunity comes about to make metal type available to Aboriginal groups on a gratis basis I would be thrilled to do that, less of course the cost of typemetal which is getting hard to find.\n\nI have spent this morning fitting the glyphs to their set widths, working at the Thompson caster. The outside temperature is in the mid eighties and it got to be too much to handle, so I'm taking this break.\n\nWell I got off the subject again. Once more thank you for your input. I will alter the inconsistencies is my calligraphy when making the rest of the digital font.\n\nJim\n\n"

I need to wait a little and see what is happening with the contact I have made regarding the face.\n\nGood news for me: The bookdealer to whom I have sold the patterns has not taken them away yet so I went down to the foundry and looked them over. I was so close to the project I had forgotten how thorough I have been. It looks like I have made all of the sensible alterations with a the knife when cutting out the printouts. I missed three, I think, and I can recut the patterns and the three mats. The partial font that is shown on this thread does not show the changes, so it really is disconcerting. I often make changes with a the knife when cutting the patterns; stress of curve, terminations etc., since it is less work to do on the computer. . . and I like the sponteneity that comes from working in a loose manner.

And perhaps reflecting syllabic logic in a diversified contrast scripting deserves more consideration. I'm not sure how this could be organized or implemented. But I do wonder if freedom and individuality in the structures of the Cree or Inuktitut scripts might develop without an indigenous scribal tradition (as Bringhurst suggests).\n\nAlso, Hrant, remember that ductal logics also underly advanced non-western scripts.\n\n"

The visual form of writing systems tend to reflect the tools with which they were first written. In the case of the Evans syllabics, there was no primary 'writing' tool (except in Noordzij's broad sense of writing): this is a script that began life as _type._ There has been no chirographic evolution of the writing system, so far as I can tell. The few handwritten texts I have seen in it have shown no aesthetic consciousness, and I'm not aware of any indigenous 'calligraphy'. The script is prized for its cultural uniqueness, as part of the identity of the user communities, but its expression is wholly utilitarian.\n\nWhen we white folk sit down with our calligraphic tradition to write the Evans syllabics, we pick up our broad nib pens because that is the tool we are most familiar with (at least since the early 20th century calligraphic revival). I did the same thing, when I started examining the Evans syllabics. But I'm not convinced that this is the best tool for writing these forms, and I think the evolution of the script, in both chirographic and type design terms, would benefit from much more experimentation with different tools (e.g. pointed brush) and with less fixed ductus (e.g. employing more rotation à la Noordzij's 'mannerist' classification).\n\n[Martin, Si, the Cree and Cherokee writing systems are unrelated.]\n\n"

Was it a necessary invention because of the problems with representing indigenous speech sounds with existing alphabetic scripts? What are the sources for Evans' forms? Did he devise it as a notational system for use outside the typographical realm or only inside. Should / could he not have started with notational devices used in the pictogram tradition. Should his initiative have been more collaborative. Was his initiative pre-emptive. What is the meaning of indeginous in this context? Might studies of pictograph writing on buffalo robes and petroglyphs help us think through issues of shape?\n\nIt seems to me that without a writing tradition (where problems of construction / contrast get resolved together naturally with reference to readability and legibility all in one feed-forward / feed-backward loop over time) it's hard to know how to proceed in typographic terms. Perhaps this shows I am not a type-designer. In a way Jim's efforts--probably earlier efforts as well--raise the question of how to give shape to Evan's formal code.\n\n"

I discovered that this produces differing stroke widths. In my ignorance I like this and kept to it as I went through the many characters.\n\nI can't see anything terribly wrong with this approach. To me it seemed to parallel flat brushwork which is not unknown to the Coastal cultures. I am aware that I didn't take a terribly studied, analytical approach to my characters. I just did what felt good to me. In a the final outcome, I prefer the face to have some kind of movement and variation of stroke, much more than the handful of rigid geometric attempts I've seen to date. I'm aware that evans' approach in devising the characaters was of strict monoline stroke and geometric construction, but I believe he did this as a method of keeping this new language simple and uncluttered, and I am almost certain from my own experiences in typecutting that his specially ground tool gave him this consistent weight and line quality.\n\nI did make a couple of attempts at a present-day design over the past 20 years plus, but I kept coming back to this one.\n\nThanks for your comments. It's indeed nice to have more people than I had expected take an interest in the face. I'ver made a couple of tentative contacts to Aboriginal bodies; brobably the wrong ones, without any response.\n\nIn the end I don't expect to make a buck out of cutting this. It was simply a way of paying a small tribute to the determined Rev evans. I'd be pleased if sometime a group or individual in the Abriginal groups could get to cast this type for themselves and print some kind of text. With all the things governmants can think of to spend money on, it seems to me that a workshop could be set up to do the work.\n\nYou may recall that legendary BC printer Will Hudson was hired to teach the Inuit people to print up on Baffin Island. They produced at least one fine book. Maybe someday . . .\n\nJim\n\n"

There is a replica engraving tool and replica sundry other tools that are to be seen in photogrpahs on the internet. If you start searching by typing in \"Norway House, Evans tools\", you will eventually come across the pictures.\n\nI can describe the cutting tool as being ground to the stroke width of the character. Unbelievably, evans simply cut his Glyphs into the end grain of hard oak wood (described by Robert Bringhurst as \"burr oak\"). Presumably since his matrices were carved with a single stroke to a prescribed near depth, this gave him a uniform width of line.\n\nThe photos go on to show that once he had cast lead into the resulting cavities of the wood, he then shaved the face of each piece of type level and to a consistant \"height to paper\".\n\nIt's my assumption that Evans achieved a uniform monoline becuase of the precision of the tool's width and becuase he was aiming for an absolute simplicity of form. This is of course only my theory.\n\nThose who have followed in making the face available to current typesetting systems have pretty much followed the general flavout of Evans' work, and that makes sense. I was merely taking a departure for personal reasons, and I may be completely mistaken in doing this, but I do like the crispness and precision of the way my metal version prints. The obvious disparity in line width when letterpressed at 14 point is not glaring, and I believe there is a pleasant, softer more personal look to the type set in words.\n\nAnyhow, it's done now, and that's my one shot at it.\n\nIf you can locate Robert Bringhurst (he has moved to yet another island, thsis time, Quadra) and I haven't been able to trak him down to thank him for the information he supplied me a couple of years back regarding character sets.\n\nIncidentally, I gather that when evans devised his language he got by by cutting only nine glyphs, which when rotated 90 degrees did for everything. With the addition of over-dotted and differing tribal character requirements, the character \"set\" that I cut had come out to 125; to my chagrin, a lot of patterns and matrices to cut!\n\nI'm sorry I can't direct anyone to the site with photos, but I am certain if I can stumble across it, you will find it.\n\nMany thanks\n\nJim\n\n"

Rotation allowed him to cut a single matrix for multiple syllables and even to use the same piece of type for different syllables. I don't think Evans had any pretensions to being a type designer: he wanted to print some prayers and hymns in Ojibway and, later, Cree translation, and determined to make his own type simply because he didn't have any other. It seems to me quite likely that if he had a font of Latin type at Norway House he would have devised a Latin orthography. He doesn't strike me as the sort of man who would make unnecessary work for himself if there were a simpler way to achieve his goal.\n\n"

When people sit down -- as James Evans sat down -- to create new shapes for writing and reading, the tendency seems to be almost always towards simplified, geometric shapes. I think the chirographic evolution stage is important, because it is through the making and remaking of the shapes, at different size, with different implements, that one first begins to really understand the forms and then understands how to manipulate them and, eventually, how to deliver them from chirographic models.\n\nHrant thinks it should be easier to produce good type design without a writing tradition behind it. I'm casting about for an example to support this view, but I simply can't find one. Type design as a craft seems to exist only within cultures with a strong writing tradition. This is not to say that type design necessarily needs to 'ape' chirographic forms, but it strongly suggests that there is an evolutionary process that cannot easily be skipped.\n\n"

      "content": "Jim, I think the difficulty with the strongly contrasted, broadnib ductus applied to the Cree syllabics is that we don't have a good understanding of readability in this script. I'm concerned about the considerable variance in the weight of vertical or near vertical strokes, and considering that some combinations in text may produce areas of greater lightness or darkness, depending on the sequence of syllables, and that this may result in reduced legibility, especially when light strokes are adjacent. The ruggedness of the near-monoline, traditional forms avoid this problem, which is why Ross' designs, though modulated, have a low contrast.\n\nConsider, for example your U like form and its inverted variant. This convention of making the left vertical heavy and the right light is a typical typographic form for the Latin uppercase U. But the uppercase U is a very infrequent letter in almost all Latin-script languages: it typically occurs, like all uppercase letters, only at the beginning of words, and even then it is a relatively infrequent letter (more common in German than most other languages). So that fact that the right side of the U collapses visually, isn't a major legibility issue for the Latin script, but we shouldn't assume that because this convention works in the Latin script that it can be applied to Cree. How do Cree readers understand the visual identity of this syllable? What, to use Peter's term, is the role architecture of the verticals? If it is to bound a space, linked by a curved bow, then weakening one of the verticals may reduce legibility. I don't know what the answer to that question is. I don't think anyone else does either: as far as I know, very little study has been done of syllabic reading in general\\*, and I'm not aware of any studies of Cree or Inuktitut reading.\n\n\\* The obvious place to conduct studies on syllabic reading in general -- e.g. to compare and contrast with our developing understanding of alphabetic reading -- would be Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there are very large numbers of literate adults reading a syllabic script on a daily basis. Part of the problem with designing type for Cree is that relatively few people read it, and there are few texts published in the script; the situation is better for Inuktitut.\n\n"

Perhaps this will make more sense to you if I say that a script without a chirographic tradition is as handicapped as a script without a painting tradition or even a musical tradition. You see? I'm not saying that type design needs a chirographic model per se, but that it needs to be informed by something other than the whim of the type designer. On this, I think we agree theoretically at least. You want type design to reference an understanding of reading, rather than an understanding of writing. This sounds like a great plan, except for the fact that a) our understanding of reading as it relates to design is limited and b) what we do know doesn't suggest a prescriptive design agenda because we read comfortably across so many different scripts and styles. So I'm concerned that there isn't enough knowledge to anchor this reading-centric approach to type design, and it will simply be used to justify arbitrariness.\n\nThe Cree/Inuktitut syllabics are an interesting case of a script that is very important to its users in terms of 'identity politics', i.e. it is part of what makes its users culturally distinct from the dominant civilisation in this country. At the same time, though, it never seems to have been naturalised into the broader aesthetic cultures of the Cree and Inuit peoples. It is something apart from their art and craft, and has not yet found an aesthetic expression within those cultures.\n\n"

To some extent the Evans shapes are in an inbetween world between western minuscules and majuscules. And this inbetweeness has made its way into Jim's glyphs in the left and right stem characteristics of the U-type forms. So I'd say a dimensional vector approach has its pitfalls here, probably because it has not played a part in the formation of the role architecture of the characters. And it is probably not good to sustain it in any rigorous way accross theJim says, \"The obvious disparity in line width when letterpressed at 14 point is not glaring.\" I hope Jim will give us a peek at how these glyphs set in a real text context.\n\nI found it very interesting to see that Evans character set is recognizably descendant from the James Frere, Thomas Lucas, and Isaac Pitman efforts, which are essentially stenographic.\n\nIt is hard for me to see at the moment where perceptual processing issues come in.

This person is actually a non-Inuit who has learned the language and script. He notes that common sequences of syllabics are recognised as such: syllabic bouma shapes.\\* Of course, as we know, a person's description of how he reads doesn't necessarily conform to the reality of the optical and cognitive processes.\n\n\\* Actually, now I think about this, multi-glyph bouma shapes are potentially more useful in reading syllabic scripts than they are for reading English, since the spelling is much more consistent and the correlation to spoken language much more regular and precise. This means that any repeating sequence of two or more glyphs will always correspond to exactly the same sounds, allowing variation for stress and emphasis of course.\n\nSome of these thoughts are informed by my work on Ethiopic, a syllabic script that I know better than Cree/Inuktitut (Ross is the one who has done a lot of work for North American aboriginal languages). Interestingly, surviving examples of the south semitic Sabaean script from which the Ethiopic or Ge'ez script is evolved are very geometric, regular and sometimes monoline. This is no doubt partly due to the fact that almost all surviving texts are stone inscriptions; the Sabaeans presumably had a less rigid, more informal style for other kinds of writing. But if you compare the richness and relative variety of the long and glorious Ethiopic manuscript tradition to the absence of such a tradition in the Cree and Inuktitut you can see how the organic evolution of a writing system _through writing_ is productive of new ideas and styles. Maybe we should give the Cree and Inuit another couple of thousand years with their script and see what they come up with.\n\n"
