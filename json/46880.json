      "content": "Do you mean you want to find a type and then trace over it? I'd still say that'd be just as bad, too clean. Look at a font you like and then just eye it, it will make it less imperfect and fit so much better with the cover illustrations.\n\nOr if you're really against hand drawing it, then maybe try printing out the title (In a chosen font). Cut out the letters so it's individual letters, but tape them to another piece of paper (Just to make it less perfect) and then photocopy it. Then photocopy the photocopy, and so on. You'll get a more broken up appearance that might work well. Paste it on and do some funky coloring similar to the illustrations. (just an idea that came into my head)\n\n"
