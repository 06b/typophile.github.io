  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m new to the type id board, and was wondering if anyone knew what fonts these are. Both are from XLR8R Magazine (one is their logo & the other is a font used for headings throughout the magazine). I’ve got a feeling the logo is a custom font, but any help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [xlr8r heading font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929203054/http:/typophile.com/files/xlr8r%20heading%20font.jpg) | 51.14 KB |\n| [xlr8r title font.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929203054/http:/typophile.com/files/xlr8r%20title%20font.jpg) | 29.92 KB |\n\n [‹ Clarence House Logo Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929203054/http:/typophile.com/node/49687 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Old Font Identification - Please Help ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929203054/http:/typophile.com/node/49648 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
