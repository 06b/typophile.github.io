  "content": "Looking for fonts that could be used as a corporate display font for a large shoping mal complex. It should be used in all their ads as a large display font together with b&w fashion imagery. The keywords for the font should be: 1. Classical, seductive (HTF Didot or Mercury Display are good examples but I need some more) or 2. Entertaining & strong (Boxing match vegas lightbulb font) This should be a vector font drawn with similar quality and professional approach to the typeface design as you would find in any of Tobias Frere Jones typefaces. Is there any typefaces like this around????)\n\n",
