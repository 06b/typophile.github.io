It’s like Kabel and Geometric 231 but not because the ear of the “g” is diagonal and the “L” has a tail.\n\nAnyone know what typeface this is?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

However, some fonts come with alternate versions of some characters - and sometimes a font will be used for a purpose like advertising, and an individual character in the font will be altered.\n\n"

The original one by Koch and the one from ITC with the typical large x-height, which seems to be the one in the sample.\n\n"
