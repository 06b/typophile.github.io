Multiple adjectives before a noun are hyphenated:\n\n<cite>This is my long-range rifle.</cite>\n\nIf they are put after the noun, no hyphen:\n\n<cite>This is the rifle I shoot at long range.</cite>\n\nBTW, everyone is detail oriented. What's important is what details they are interested in. Only a certified compulsive is interested in all of them. Most companies don't hire \\*certified\\* compulsives.\n\n"
