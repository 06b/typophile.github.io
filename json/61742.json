      "content": "Many metal typefaces had an increased x-height in smaller sizes. In many of the examples I have studied the variation of the descender length is literally the only change that was made to the letter shapes.  \nThe interesting thing is that in some cases the descenders are longer in large text sizes than they are in very small fonts but they get shorter again in the display sizes, having a maximum at around 14 pt or so. This makes sense, of course: making the x-height as big as possible in small sizes on one hand, and making the vertical proportions more \"compact\" in the display sizes to allow for tighter headline setting.\n\nGiven that adjusting the descender height is not much effort, especially in the digital world, I think including different options would make sense and give the typographer more flexibility – you may want super-tight newspaper-style headlines, or an airy layout with elegant long extenders and more generous leading. I think using an OpenType feature such as titling alternates would make things easier, you wouldn't need separate fonts.\n\n"

Folks could have invented the standard alignment numbers based on measurements of actual type, and hence reflected pre-existing optical size considerations, and promoted future optical size proportions, yet that need not have been a deliberate objective as such.\n\nT\n\n"

On the other hand, there were those who decried Standard Alignment when it was first adopted.\n\nUpdike states the case thus: \"There are mechanical advantages inherent in this scheme, but they are attained at the expense of the correct proportion of certain letters. . . . This disregard for proportionate length of descenders of types of different sizes pervades the whole scheme; and consequently no size of type (excepting possibly 7-point and 11-point) which is cast on Standard Line can have descenders of adequate length.\" [D. B. Updike, <cite>Printing Types</cite> Vol 1, p.35. Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1922]\n\nWhen Updike starts ranting, you have to take it with a grain of salt; but this makes me question just how much Standard Line conformed to traditionally accepted optimum proportions for sizes.\n\n"
