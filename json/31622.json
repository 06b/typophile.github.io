  "content": "I am holding a branding workshop for highschool students of an after school media arts program in april. I am interested in any suggestions that may help me educate the students about the world of branding, design, typography, etc... These students will have little to no experience in this field of course, so I am starting from scratch. The workshop is very short term and my intend goals are for each student to produce a logo type and an advert implementing it. Any suggestions, ideas, resources would be much appreciated.\n\n",
