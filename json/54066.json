I would just like to know what is the font printed in Sugababe's album \"ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES.\" I think it's a pretty simple and common font (but I just love it so much), it's so retro or something. I hope someone could help me out! Thanks a million!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215101725im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Angelwithnofaces_5921.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215101725im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Angelswithdirtyfaces_5137.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100215101725im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Dontchafreaklikme_4211.jpg)\n\n",

Illegal. You donâ€™t do that, do you? Most of the people here are living by designing beautiful things, many of them by designing typefaces. It is like a slap in their face if the people come here and asking for free downloads for their hard work. Respect them please.\n\n"
