Problem is I can't get out of my head [Times](http://web.archive.org/web/20140331084507/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/times). Funny thing is I'm pretty convinced it could be quite easy with it, mainly stretching it, pulling upward /E central crossbar and reworking a bit /T top stem serifs.  \nMy 2 cent now. If you need something in the same vein (minus the chiseled effect), [Beaufort](http://web.archive.org/web/20140331084507/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort) Condensed (Light) might work pretty well. Less contrasted but far more elegant.\n\n"
