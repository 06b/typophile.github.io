  "content": "Does anyone know of a list, ideally reasonably comprehensive and up to date, of fonts which incorporate optical scaling? For present purposes I'd define this as fonts with three or more variants for different ranges of point size. (There must be quite a lot more with just two variants, most often text and display versions.)\n\nI was asked this question by a colleague the other day, and on the spot could only respond with those I happened to know of already (the Adobe opticals as an obvious starting point, plus some others such as Cycles, Freight and Requiem). But all attempts to build up a more systematic list haven't so far been a great success. MyFonts turns out to have an \"optical sizes\" tag, which currently returns 51 hits (but with a bit of duplication, so the real number is less than 50). However (a) there are plenty of foundries MyFonts doesn't handle - they do not sell Requiem, for instance - and (b) the tagging clearly isn't perfect: thus although Cycles is in the MyFonts database, it appears not to have the \"optical sizes\" tag and is not retrieved by the foregoing search! So a better strategy is needed to come up with anything at all representative.\n\nIs a list of optically scaled fonts a possible topic for a Typowiki page? There is an existing one on the principle of optical scaling, but it is very short on specifics.\n\nAlan\n\n",
