This is an old-old format (20+ years) that nowadays can’t deliver what is needed. OpenType (TT or CFF) — and TrueType to some extent —, is where you should put your money.\n\n"

Unlike the Swiss Army knife, you can do real work with it, though like the Swiss Army knife, you do encounter situations where it’s limitations really get in the way.\n\nI assume you aren’t asking the question “what’s the difference” from a technical point of view. From the practical point of view, you would have to make the decision based on what you actually do with type — what is now called the “workflow.”\n\nAt a deeper level, at some point you will likely have to change to the OpenType format.

Now Quark 6.X will do that, and has some features not currently available in any OT-savvy layout program.\n\nOr, suppose you’re like me, and every two weeks or so, have to set texts that few OpenType fonts (currently) support — characters from Latin Extended A, for example. Or texts using quotation marks. Or footnotes, etc. It is a lot easier to re-work a Type 1 font than an OT font.\n\nIn my workshop are all the sizes of Phillips screwdrivers, not the one-size-rounds-the-slots-on-all of the Swiss Army knife. Also a 15-40 Clausing-Colechester lathe and an old Bridgeport milling machine. But even with the lathe & mill, there are still times when hand tools will do the job better. The same is true of type.\n\n"

But then we ran TeX out of a DOS box & could encode a Type 1 font any way we wanted. I’ll allow that doesn’t fit most users.\n\nOne reason to stick with Type 1 fonts might occur to you if you ever had to add some kerning to an existing OT font. And the bugs in IDCS2’s exception dictionary drive us crazy, esp. since they seem to be worse in CS3.\n\nHaving said all that, you pick your poison based on your needs, which I hope was my original point.\n\n"

It depends on the license you have when you originally purchased the font. For instance, when I wanted to buy Scala from FontFont for a PC, It was only available for a Macintosh. “Just convert it,” they said.

I’m not sure how prevalent the practice is but I would think that offering “upgrades” in format might bring in more revenue for a foundry than simply offering new formats as if they were new designs. The conversion process is certainly not as labor intensive as the initial design release. If no features are added, and in many cases they are not, the upgrade price could be minor, if additional features are added, the upgrade price could reflect this. I doubt there would be much resistance if handled in such a manner, and I’d suspect there is more financial reward for the foundries.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nGerald\n\n"
