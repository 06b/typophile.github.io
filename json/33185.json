  "content": "Howdy folks, new guy here. This is the first typeface I’ve ever created and I’ve been working on it for a few days now and I still have some work to do on it. It’s all based on the grid you see in the background and all the angles are 45 degrees. I still need to adjust some of the widths of the characters and I’m not loving the N, but overall I like the way it’s coming out. I’m just creating uppercase characters cause I eventually want to use this for big headlines and such. I also plan to do numbers and punctuation as well. Let me know what you guys think. Go easy on me...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124035928im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typeface_6200.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Welcome, new guy. It can be a quite tense experience just to throw a graphic up here. A'ight, I'll give it a go if everyone else is quiet. Some of my comments are guesses at what others might think, because thats sorta fun.\n\nLove the G.\n\nWith so many other symmetrical letters, not super hot on the Y. I might think otherwise if I saw it in action.\n\nHow closely are you planning the letters to sit? If they are too close it will make even headlined tough to read, but I think that A would look cool perfectly abutting its following glyph.\n\nThe B makes gridsense, but is probably unsettling to the locals with the suggested center-stroke being so low. I suspect the logic was to match the P & R, but if you want that purposely top-heavy vibe, bring it out in another letter or two as well, maybe? There is more room to play with \"inside the grid\" than you might first assume.\n\nThe chopped centers of M & W have some interesting potential. They fit well qith the uneven top-right of the V and the Bottom-right of the A. Perhaps you could snip the inside of the top-right corner of the W to a 45 degree? What I see here is not \"formal\", so play more and see what you get. What about moving the angled leg of the K up n' over a bit so it chops off like the A?\n\nThe O is adequate and logical. The Q, however, is very cool, and requires that the O look exactly like you have it.\n\nIf you aren't down with the N, maybe it could get a right triangle lopped off on the inside of the left top. That would make it look like the W if that approach worked there, and would yet strangely reinforce the most striking aspect of the letter.\n\nHide the grid for screenshots unless you need it to illustrate something particular, and I think people will be less distracted.\n\nTwo more suggestions. Throw a word or two up for analysis, like, \"hotdoggievons,\" or, \"free beer with font.\" Then people can _see_ the flow better. And if you think you **might ever** want a numeral or punctuation, start visualizing it now. (edit: I mean start actually drawing it alongside the letters, so that they can borrow from each other, synergize, or whatever one might call it.)\n\nOh yeah, last of all, before you take any of my advice seriously, you should probably search what sort of fonts I make. Guess that goes for others, too.\n\n"

      "content": "Choz, thanks for the feedback, it is very very helpful. You make some very excellent points that I'm definitely going to consider.\n\nI see what you mean about the Y and I will definitely try a version that is symmetrical. The reason I did the Y this way was because I saw an opportunity to create and not so traditional character that played off of the angles of the A, V and K. It's actually a K flipped and the top arm removed (I still don't have my type terminology down).\n\nI do have to see how the letters work with each other in a word and that's the next thing I'm going to try out. Not sure yet how closely the letter will sit but your idea with the A is very interesting. Should create some very interesting shapes.\n\nThe B is starting to not feel right and yes the initial idea was to match it to the P and the R. I'm going to play with it some more I just feel that if I do change it and its not working with the P and the R that it won't be consistent.\n\nI have considered bringing more of the chopped feel into it but if I do adjust the K it will throw off the R as well. That's something I'm going to play with a little more.\n\nI have some ideas in my head based on your suggestion for the N that I'm going to play with and see how they come out.\n\nThanks again for the feedback, it was very helpful and gave me some new ways to approach the typeface. I'm going to make some more adjustments and post again.\n\n"

      "content": "Ok so I worked on it some more today and I think I have all the characters down. I've adjusted the N, X, B, K, Y and Z. I also decided to use two versions of the A and V and 3 versions on the Y. When I create the actual FONT I want to build it so that it figures out which combnations of letters to use to make they work best together. I know this is possible cause I've seen multiple fonts do this but I'm not exactly sure how to create that. Anyone?\n\nI've arrange some words out to see how the letters play with each other and you will notice the use of the different A's, V's and Y's. Actually I just noticed that the A in the word Magic is the wrong direction.\n\nAnyways, I still need to create the numbers which will be my next step and I have started on some of the punctuations. I want to create as many as I can to make it as complete as possible.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124035928im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typeface_4167.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Seeing it used helps me get an idea about your intent. Is this meant to be good for posters where the idea is to catch the eye with a 'mistake' that can be interpreted correctly?\n\nI think your M is oddly enough working already. Whereas the V is not at all. The K is working. I think you should consider making more weird versions of the semi normal ones and some more normal versions of the weird ones. And just explore more. Like Choz said there are way way more solutions out there. Also, other folks have made a ton of fonts like this. Look at what they did. See if you can justify the existance of this font with a novel solution/letter-shape or overall feeling.\n\n"

      "content": "Seeing text really makes a difference in this one, since the charm is largely in the interaction, I think. The tight spacing is compelling in the AY. The mirrored variants are a great idea. That is the kind of thing I would have stumbled across back in the day, and happily agonized over which to choose in a banner or masthead. Are those going to fill up some of the free area in the lowercase zone? (Of course, there's 3 Ys, oh no) :)\n\nI do have to note that the \\| version of the V reads a bit like a minimalist N when I go fast.\n\nStupid question, perhaps, but, uh, why don't the A's have blacked-out counters?\n\n"

The character had more \"character\" with the counter.\n\n2. If you notice all the blacked out counters are all curved ones.\n\nI do see what you mean about the \\| version but this typeface is intended to be used very large and for big blocks of copy. Not meant to be used in a big copy block so I think even though it might be confused with an N at first, that the viewer will pick up that its a V.\n\nWhat do you mean by the free area in the lowercase zone?\n\n"
