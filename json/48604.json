The R foot serif is not like the Adobe versions, because it sits flat on the baseline, but I can't seem to find one that seems identical in all details.\n\nAs for the ligatures like st and ct, most of the OpenType versions of classic serif families have them and some of the older (PS/TT) families do as well, usually when they are from the major foundries.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
