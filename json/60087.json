      "content": "- Before you pick your trim size, type size, and margins, look at _all_ the poems in the book and see how long the longest lines are. You may not be able to avoid line breaks altogether, but design to avoid frequent line breaks.\n- Pay careful attention to leading.\n- Look at the lengths of the poems, and design your trim size and margins to avoid either excessively short pages or too many page breaks. When you do have a page break, put the break where it makes sense in the poem, not just where you run out of room.\n- You'll have a lot of paper showing, so choose a good quality paper, off-white rather than bright white.\n- Don't use running heads at all, and don't use folios (page numbers) unless the book is longer than 40-50 pages. Pages of poetry usually have a lot of white space, so running heads and folios are much more conspicuous--and distracting--than they are in books of prose. \n\nMy first book design assignment was a book of poems. Good luck, and please post some sample pages here when you're done.\n\n"

      "content": "Let me add a few things to Mojo's very sensible comments.\n\nPAGE SIZE is very often dictated by the publisher. Even publishers most sensitive to poetry will often tell designers what the page size is to be. Publishers have their own arcana on this matter, which they consult during séances. When the publisher tells the designer the page size it almost inevitably creates difficulties (OOOPS: I mean \"challenges and opportunities\") for the designer and/or compositor.\n\nPAPER is also often chosen by the production manager at the publishing house. If this book will be printed by a book printer, paper choice will be further limited by papers the printer keeps in stock. Few books of poetry will have sales enough to warrant a special order of paper. Mojo's right: natural or off-white is best.\n\nFOLIOS need to be discreet in size and placement. Head to the library and look at a lot of poetry books and folio placement. This can be a tough nut to crack with poetry books, thanks to the white space Mojo mentions.\n\nRUNNING HEADS cannot be automatically dismissed. A poetry anthology may require them. Even at times a book by a single author may require them. This may be more of an editorial call than a design call.\n\nDesigning poetry books can be a lot of fun. In my current job I miss doing poetry. At times designers get lucky and end up collaborating with editors and poets, engaging them in discussion and showing alternate examples of settings. It often reduces the profit margin on design & composition even further than its already low state. But you may find some excellent writing and you may make a pal of a poet who gets a good design. I'm eager to see what you come up with. Good luck; have fun.\n\npowers\n\n"

      "content": "\\> Publishers have their own arcana on this matter, which they consult during séances.\n\nHa, ha. However, for those who might not see this as a quip, I want to point out that the publishers dictate page size based on press specifications. If you add even a quarter inch in dimension to a page, you make it too large to be printed economically on a certain press. The result is that the job has to be printed 8 pages at time instead of 16, effectively doubling most of the production costs.\n\nIt may seem like arcana if you don't know the procedure, but in fact it is simple math. And economics.\n\n"

      "content": "Don:\n\nI was indeed attempting a quip. But there's a bit more to it than the purely math and economic aspects of paper size and press size. Why, for instance, do many publishers reckon the \"right\" size for a book of memoirs is to be 5.5\" x 8.5\"? Why not 6\" x 9\"? Why must academic books be 6\" x 9\" instead of 5.5\" x 8.5?\n\nWhy cannot a book be an \"odd\" (say, tall, and slender) size if the economics are not negatively affected? Trying to get these notions changed for a book that may need a special treatment can be a tough nut to crack. I've been exposed to these decisions for decades now, and I'm often flabbergasted. Especially with poetry, some works call out for a different size, but publishers cannot be convinced. Often the discussions do take on the aspect of a séance.\n\nIt should also be noted that bookstore shelf size is also a factor in deciding the size of many books.\n\npowers\n\n"

Having also been involved in some of these \"calculations\" when I was Creative Director at Storey Publishing, I will say that there are a number of factors which make up the \"arcana.\"\n\nProduction economics are an important factor. Those being met, then design considerations and suitability to the content may come into play. But market expectations and trade considerations will also play a key part. (Even down to what will fit on the shelves in a particular section of a bookstore, as Will pointed out; some sections will have taller or shorter or deeper or shallower shelf sections -- think art books vs. fiction.)\n\nYou could theoretically have the exact same book (same title, same content, same production costs and price point) but markedly different proportions -- say, one tall and slender, the other nearly squarish (remember, I did say \"theoretically\") -- and one will be deemed more sellable than the other.\n\nAs with any design destined for the marketplace, there is a delicate dance to be found between going with the flow and standing out from the crowd.\n\n"

      "content": "Paper can comprise half the cost of manufacturing a book, so publishers and printers are keen not to waste any. 6 by 9 inches is an economical size because most book papers are manufactured in a 25-by-38-inch size, which just fits 16 pages (four 6's out of 25 and four 9's out of 38, with just enough left over for folding and trimming).  \nIf you're printing a quarter-million copies of _Harry Potter and the Dingbats of Doom_, it makes an enormous difference whether your trim size is 6 or 6-1/2.  \nBut this ain't Harry Potter, it's poetry, and if the print run is more than 1000, I'll eat my Haberule.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141225212211im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Haberule_5976.jpg)\n  \n_(My Haberule)_\n\nPoetry lives on the fringes of the publishing world, where you don't enjoy economies of scale, but you're not subject to the tyranny of scale, either.

      "content": "I agree with bowerbird about the majority of poetry books being rather uninteresting in terms of typesetting.\n\nTo me, careful and individual placement of poems is the most important aspect; each poem must relate to the page as a whole. This fails miserably in the case of short poems clinging to the upper left corner of the text block. The most pleasing -- but also the most functional -- placements, which allow the poems to breathe, are (visually) centered on the horizontal and have maybe a generous vertical indent, too.\n\nI've seen many books where the poems were set so that their last line was always at the bottom of the text block -- what was changing was the vertical position of the first line. This doesn't always work, though, and sometimes too much jumping around can also become distracting. You have to figure it out accordingly.\n\nThere's an example of a poetry book in Hochuli's Desining Books with the title on the verso and the poem on the recto.\n\nNothing fancy, no poetic cliches, but make sure that individual poems don't look like they were falling down or out of the page. Don't make them look ashamed of their existence, place them in a way that will underline their self-sustained aesthetic importance.\n\n"

(Like a unit price of 4.27 for the smaller size, and a unit price of 4.59 for the larger price justified selling the book for $40 more).\n\nComputer books in the 90s were other books that would sell at any price, and thus were overpriced. They also tended to be a slightly larger format.\n\n(I just got a book from the college bookstore yesterday for a course I am building. 1 inch thick (500+ pages) 9x12 hardcover format, and a price tag of $142.75 Canadian. Something tells me that the poetry book that this thread is about will cost closer to 10% of that.)\n\n"
