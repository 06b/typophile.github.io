  "content": "What about this one. It's from the Swedish newspaper Kvällspesten [sic]  \nI am going to make a fake poster for a friend who asked me to make one for him... but I cannot figure out what kind of type they use. Maybe it is something they've invented themselves? the Ä and Ö and A with an ° on top must be specially made for their headlines.\n\nAnyone who could recommend something for me to use? I can make the Ä and Ö and A with an ° on top myself in illustrator.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [KVP.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829055309/http:/typophile.com/files/KVP.png) | 365.25 KB |\n\n",

If you are looking for a similar retail font with such compact diacritics, see Scangraphic’s Supertypes Series, labeled with SH – e.g. [Futura SH](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829055309/http:/myfonts.us/td-zwprBg). This series started in the 1980, i.e. before OpenType. The compact alternates are still not properly encoded as alternates, but can be accessed via ~ (tilde) for Å and { for Ö. In the early 1990s, URW released its Poster series. In [Futura P Extrabold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829055309/http:/myfonts.us/td-0X8lia), such integrated accents are the default.\n\nAlbert-Jan Pool kindly provided me with this information for my recently published [article on unusual umlauts](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829055309/http:/www.flickr.com/groups/fancy-diacritics/discuss/72157633790076349/) for TypoJournal.\n\n"

I would have used more white space to make it more useable for smaller headlines.  \nDon \n"
