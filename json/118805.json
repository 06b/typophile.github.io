  "content": "Hi all, I'm returning here to seek your help after a long absence.\n\nThis sans-serif font has many distinctive features, so many that I'd think identifying it would be a snap. However, I've spent hours poring over identifont and various catalogs and specimens and I haven't been able to identify it. Here's a representative sample:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203820im_/http:/typophile.com/files/VLCScreenSnapz001_6540.png)\n\nThis is a frame grab from a video of a PowerPoint presentation (long story). I actually have the PowerPoint document but none of the fonts it claims it uses match this font. I've unpacked the file and it looks like there are some fonts embedded in the document. I think these are encrypted, though, so I can't extract any information from them, even the names.\n\nCan someone help? Thanks!\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Sakkal Majalla \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [DPape](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203820/http:/typophile.com/user/3945 \"View user profile.\")\n\n",

      "content": "Ha! Very interesting, thanks. They were right under my nose. (Well, not really, as I'm a Mac guy.) I found a Windows 7 system to check out and they're there all right. The documents came from a Windows system and had specified some other font, but possibly through misconfiguration or transferring between systems that didn't have the font installed, the documents ended up using this system font.\n\nIt's somewhat startling to see an interesting Latin font buried within a non-Latin font. From what I've seen the Latin characters of non-Latin fonts are usually a copy of something else (like Arial) or are some fairly uninteresting design. Kind of cool to find this hidden gem. It would be interesting to do a survey of other non-Latin fonts to see what Latin character designs might be there.\n\nAlso interesting that this design has apparently never appeared in a Latin font. At least, not one that any of the ones that I've run across.\n\nTo kthomps5, thanks for the link to whatfontis.com. I had tried WhatTheFont at myfonts.com but it didn't find it.\n\nI note that Sakkal Majalla has a regular and a bold variant. My sample is the bold. The regular looks pretty nice, too.
