  "content": "I am looking for a very very condensed font, to use for numbers (prices) on store shelf tags.\n\nI've searched and searched but have not found anything quite skinny enough. The prices have to fit in a very small width space but are required to be a certain height (by law).\n\nIn the past I've adapted a font by further condensing it, but I'd prefer to buy a very very condensed font for this new round.\n\nI'll need a heavy or black as well as a light or book face. Even better if $ and ¢ are smaller than the numerals.\n\nThe font should be sans serif, and should play well with avenir which will probably be used for the rest of the type of the signs.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated!\n\n--Betty\n\n",
