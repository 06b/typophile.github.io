I forget sometimes that I majored in Classics ...\n\nit's a rough workup, but i'm wondering what folks think if it's a better direction:\n\n[http://www.fpcukiah.org/images/omega\\_5.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023203413/http:/www.fpcukiah.org/images/omega_5.png \"http://www.fpcukiah.org/images/omega\\_5.png\")\n\n"

It's so overplayed, cheesy, and cliche.\n\n(sorry, but this is a constant gripe for me).\n\nThat said, your second concept is worlds better.\n\nI also disagree with Henry. This doesn't need to be livelier, curvy, etc.  \nThis is headed in a good direction. You may wish to refine the Omega Symbol. The bar on the \"M\" needs a lot of work. It is a little clumsy here. Maybe something a little sharper.\n\nI would also consider a different face for the text. You know what might work well with this is Klavika.\n\n"
