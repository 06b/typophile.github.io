Lining figures are often [titling figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/titling%20figures), however they may be smaller and lighter than titling figures. Unfortunately, lining figures are the default figure style in most digital fonts where [text figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/text%20figures) would be more appropriate. However, this problem can be remedied in [OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20140501053111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/OpenType) fonts which may offer several sets of figures to be used in different types of settings. Sometimes indicated as LF in the font's name.\n\n",
