  "content": "I do not have any sample of this font, but I remember that I sometimes used to use a font called \"Blue Jeans\" at my previous work place. If I remember correctly, it is a Type1 font, but I am not 100% on that one.\n\nSo, if anyone has any information at all about \"Blue Jeans\" (foundry / who made it / where can it be bought), then I would appreciate hearing it. I haven't been able to even come up with anything proofing this font's existance through google, although I remember using it for several DVD covers.\n\nInformation that I remember:  \n- Blue Jeans (100% sure about name)  \n- It is a trashy font. We found it suitable on the covers for horror movies and such.\n\nThanks in advance,  \nJohan\n\n",
