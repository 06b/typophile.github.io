Try also having a look to these 2 Sci-fi/tech sections at DaFont, [Techno \\> Sci-fi](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718104329/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303) and [Techno \\> Various](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718104329/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304) ( [Boom Box](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718104329/http:/www.dafont.com/boom-box.font)...).  \nTo get a ready-to-use /N (diagonal meeting right-hand vertical above foot), I'd probably start with either [QType FF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718104329/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-qtype) or [Bourgeois VF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718104329/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/virusfonts/bourgeois). [Bladi One 4F](http://web.archive.org/web/20140718104329/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/4thfebruary/bladi-one-4f) would work pretty fine as well.\n\n"
