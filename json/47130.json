The guide is for UK students and is a trendy useful directory of gigs, theatre... plus articles. he wants a logo that students will like?? are these just rubbish and i am wasting my time trying to be a designer LOL\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [All-logos-so-far.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045557/http:/typophile.com/files/All-logos-so-far.jpg) | 497.17 KB |\n\n [‹ Unleashed - Please help me...](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045557/http:/typophile.com/node/46577 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Did I get too inspired by another artist's design? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023045557/http:/typophile.com/node/47142 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Wanting ’a logo students will like’ is way too vague for it to be much help for you.\n\nWhat are your clients goals with the redesign? What didn’t work with the original logo?\n\nWe could comment on these, but it really wouldn’t be much help in terms of what your client wants.\n\n"
