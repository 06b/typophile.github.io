      "content": "I agree. Working at 100% eliminates another variable for those doing the production. I've had to produce signs at smaller sizes before, however, and find myself being incredibly careful and giving clear instructions to my rep and the production people. As long as you sign off on a PO or Work Order that agrees with what you need to end up with you should be, ok. But, you see, the word \"should\" scares me to death. I've been known to call people twice to make sure we are on the same page.\n\n"

With large signage call the printer and find out what they want you to do and then deliver it.\n\nI have worked from 1/48 scale in Illy to full scale in Photoshop and everywhere in between.\n\nGood communication with the vendor will get you there.\n\npbc\n\n"

      "content": "I've done many large format signs in Illustrator, and it's important that you talk directly with the printer before proceeding. Depending on the media and the printer, you may encounter major problems with certain design elements.\n\nOn duratrans material, for example, I've seen vector gradients print as choppy stripes, depending on the printer. There are tricks to resolve this, but only the printer knows how to fix it -- and if it can be fixed. Sometimes it can't be fixed, so it's better to know beforehand and design around the caveats.\n\nGood Luck!\n\n[Eileen Burke Graphic Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415123229/http:/www.eileenburke.org/)\n\n"
