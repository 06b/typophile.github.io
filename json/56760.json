  "content": "I have until recently used Ben Kiel's 'Font Generator Version 1.1' script to generate OTFs. After I changed the shape of my serifs (they are components placed in the relevant glyphs) the merging of contours have started to fail in some places. If I do the procedure manually, the result is the same as with the script. I have tried to optimise the paths, set pathdirections, cut and paste from working glyphs to bad ones, re-draw sections, set new start points, but to no avail. Sometimes a left side serif is missing, sometimes the stems and serif parts get entangled after merging instead of merging. What to do?\n\n/Claus\n\n",
