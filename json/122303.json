  "content": "Hello,\n\nA friend found the following bit of paper in the back of a drawer in an old desk. They didn't know what it was but liked the text so framed it and put it on their wall. There are Hebrew characters in the text but some other non-Hebrew characters as well as a seal. Can anyone tell what the scripts are and what the text says? The text is one long string followed by the seal so I took a photo of the entire text. You'll need to zoom in on the text in order to read it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114404im_/http:/typophile.com/files/odd-text_3948.jpg)\n\nSince the image is wider than the supported size, I've also attached the image as a file attachment.\n\nThanks,\n\nZev\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [odd-text.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317114404/http:/typophile.com/files/odd-text.jpg) | 463.66 KB |\n\n",
