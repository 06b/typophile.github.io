It reminds me of a wartime (WW2) poster that was on here a couple of months ago which probably wasn’t exactly identified at the time either. Hmmmm. Not sure really, but definitely ’Ditchling-esque’.\n\nIt raises an interesting proposition, that of an LL ligature where the first arm is shorter. Anyone else come across that? Should the arm of an L change its length depending on the next character. Is that even OpenTypossible?\n\n"
