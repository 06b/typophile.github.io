The style originated in Byzantine (Greek) books in the 11th century, and is related to the style of Greek [uncial](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123035558/http:/typophile.com/wiki/uncial) lettering employed in Orthodox icons. It spread in Russia and flourished particularly in the 16th century. Three kinds of interlocking are typically found in _vyaz'_ lettering: stem ligation in which adjacent letters share a common stem, letters or parts of letters stacked vertically, and enclosure of smaller letters within larger ones.\n\nMaxim Zhukov provides the fine attached example.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123035558im_/http:/typophile.com/files/vyaz.gif)\n\nThread: [http://typophile.com/node/14377](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123035558/http:/typophile.com/node/14377 \"http://typophile.com/node/14377\")\n\n",
