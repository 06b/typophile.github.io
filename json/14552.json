      "content": "Hi Daniel,\n\nI know that you are excited about your new font release. But posting a notice in three different forums at the same time isn’t exactly necessary. Nick is correct: this information really belongs in release only. However, you could also post a NEWS article (especially because of your sale price).\n\nThe way one posts NEWS articles on the new Typophile site isn’t so clear. If you (in the future) go to the the page, you’ll notice that (for now) all posts have been posted by moderators. Just click on one of their names, and send them your text. We’ll post it for you.\n\nI’m not going to delete this thread, for three reasons:  \n1. I’m a new moderator, and don’t want to go willy-nilly deleting threads, just because I can.\n\n2. Discussion has cropped up on this thread. I’m always for discussion, even if it starts off on a less than perfect foot.\n\n3. You are new to posting here, as Dav correctly points out. I’d like you to stick around, so I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBUT, I am going to delete your post in the DESIGN section. No one needs three posts to say the same thing.\n\nGood luck with the type sales, Daniel!\n\n"

I did not attack our first time poster at all, I just commented on the typeface he so eagerly advertised in three areas of Typophile at once\\*. _Open discussion forum_ implies we all can voice our personal opinion, even if it is less favourable and not to everyone’s liking.\n\nI won’t be getting into a fight over this, so if anyone thinks I went out of line, let me know and I’ll apologise. This is not worth staining my already dodgy reputation. :^/\n\n_\\*If I \\*had\\* attacked him personally, I might’ve commented we don’t take spam-like posts lightly at Typophile. Which I didn’t.

If I did that in the wrong place and too many times then I’m sorry for that also. I was simply trying to self-promote myself, and my font, and I apologise if that came across as being arrogant. This is not an easy game to play, after all; there are hundreds of thousands of fonts and it’s difficult to make ‘one’ stand out. Thank you to everyone for your comments and critiques.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel Keith Bale\n\n"
