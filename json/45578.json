You could at least state what you have found yourself, so far, or what medium/period etc. you are focussing on. See also [this similar request](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102095303/http:/typophile.com/node/45208).\n\nAll I can do is give some general advice for finding typefaces in use:\n\n[Search typophile.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102095303/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12344). Most of the faces you need have been asked for before. There’s a _lot_ to find.\n\nLinotype.com has a pretty neat [in use section](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102095303/http:/www.linotype.com/2106/byalphabet.html).\n\nA lot of other foundries maintain such showcases aswell.\n\nEspecially if you’re looking for images, [searching Flickr](http://web.archive.org/web/20100102095303/http:/www.flickr.com/search/?ss=1&ct=6&w=all&q=palatino+font&m=text) (or similar services) has proven helpful, to me. You might try adding ‘font’ or ‘type’ to your query, when searching for short/ambiguous terms like ‘Arnhem’, ‘Bell’ or ‘DIN’.\n\nF\n\n"

The original by Letraset for instance had very interesting alternatives, which were not easily available digitally until recently. At ITCfonts.com you can see them now in the AvantGarde Pro series. But when you look at (old Letraset catalogues and) the ElsnerFlake EF alternative designs, you will see a few very distinct letters (e, v, w, y) that did not make it to the Pro obviously.\n\nMany gorgeous headlines and logos resulted, and i am sure that you will find samples everywhere. Although it seems that AvantGarde is not extensively used recently.\n\n"
