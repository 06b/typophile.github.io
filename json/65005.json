There's all kinds of 'em.\n\nWith the last bakery I did a logo for I was going to use [Delicious,](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074001/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html) because it worked - and the owner was amused by the font's fitting name. In the end, I used another one that worked even better. [Fontin,](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074001/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html) also by Jos Buivenga.\n\nBefore that I used Garamond for the name (Grainfields) and some hand-lettered blackletter spelling out \"Das Brot\" in a banner under a sheaf of wheat.\n\n…  \n-=®=-\n\n"

The target market is the Spanish market. matching the font with Motter corpus is a good idea to match the 'baked' puffiness.  \n-mrMoto, I agree with the oddness  \n-altaira, It is not an upmarket bakery [yet], most likely I will do a redesign (does the handwritten make it seem an upmarket bakery ?\n\nThank you all for your help and [in my defense, i have not yet officially taken gd courses :P, I'm an architecture student but enjoy very much to do gd as well.]\n\n"

It's not just the handwritten thing that looks posh, you've got it all: centered alignment, a star in gold!, classy serifed, tracked-out all-caps. And that gradient. It does look good, just potentially too high-class. –&nbsp;Motter Corpus is a good suggestion in terms of earthiness / puffiness I think; find a font that smells like fresh baked country bread. :-)\n\nAlso: If you have the word \"Bakery\" in 2 languages, you may want to set those so that the 2 words also look like they have the same function. This way it looks like \"Bakery\" is the \"subline\", but \"Panaderia\" looks like, dunno, the signature of the founder or something.\n\n"

It would match to bread like **[this](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074001/http:/ademie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/bread480.jpg)** or **[this](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115074001/http:/schnuppschnuess.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/19/kln_zimmermann_schwarzbrot1.jpg)**, but not to a light baguette.\n\n"

Buying bread as a daily routine is accustomed in their country of origin and when it became available [just within the last 5 years] it was evident the tradition was not lost and their routine would not have to take a plunge. The desired customers definitely love their morning [and evening] bread with hot chocolate or other traditional beverage.  \nThe foreseen bakery is small [not fancy] but its attempt it to stand out from the other established bakeries [a few in other townships but none in the township it will be established], but the goal is not to step over the boundary and over the customers comfort zone. The migrants are costumed to simple [decor] and anything [logo identity] that resembles their small town hand lettered signs and bright colours. The focus is not on the fancy or strange. The main goal is between the cross breed between a small coffee shop feel with a \"panaderia\". The more home-town feel the better while keeping it well designed.\n\nAnd as I write this and see my previous design, I now think, If I was one of those customers, I would not walk in there to buy my morning [evening] bread :)\n\nthank everyone, i will work on a redesign and post for comment.\n\n"
