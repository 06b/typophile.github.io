One of them is your RR tyepface, the other Jared's match except for something I'd missed earlier ï¿½ while all of the other characters are a perfect match, Rivoli Initials has a curved left upright on the 'U'.   \n   \nHarold Lohner has made a version he calls [Koch Rivoli](http://web.archive.org/web/20050528000331/http:/members.aol.com/fontner/frontpage.html) (see Revivals).\n\n"

Does your image simply  \n incorporate an alternate 'U'?\n\n"
