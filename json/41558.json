I’m afraid of even starting, since Thomas Phinney came to my class and scared the bejesus out of everyone by telling them how long Robert Slimbach would work on a font. Ouch.\n\nSo here are my guesses, based on what I would plan on doing, 1-2 hours a day to start:\n\nThere’s obviously the need to know the interface and workings of the design app. Maybe a week or less of fooling around with tutorials?\n\nThen the design stage on paper or rough digital, with pre-production planning, thumbnails and roughs. Maybe 1-2 weeks? Maybe have the basics of the entire U&lc/numerals within 3?\n\nThen the outlines begin, and if my Adobe Illustrator classes have taught me anything, good beziers only come with time and experience. For me, I’d say that this would be the bulk of the work. 2-3 months? Any longer than that, and I quit. This is supposed to be my first font, not my last.\n\nLast, spacing and kerning, which I know should be done roughly during the previous stage, but finalized and perfected here, alongside testing and revising. Maybe a month?\n\nSo, what’s that add up to? I’m willing to invest about 5 months to get a good, solid font that covers all the basics and doesn’t suck. I’m sure I could whip out some autotraced “grunge” font in about a week, but who’d want to?\n\nAnyone think I’m totally off base with my assumptions?\n\n"

I still am happy with the overall concept I had, but if I were ever to bring it to market, there would be thousands of extra hours I’d put into it. I’d say I grossly underestimated what was involved in creating a font, and I’d imagine that’s a common realization for most designers.\n\nCheck out [http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203232331/http:/www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics \"http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics\") for some general guidelines\n\nThe best thing to do is open up FontLab and look at how some fonts you love are built. The first thing I realized when doing this is 1) most of the bezier points are at 90 degrees or 180 degrees, and 2) the best fonts are not slaves to the sketch you scan in, nor do they slavishly try to adhere to any geometric or mathematical rules.\n\n"

If you happen to take on something manageable and within your capabilities, it MIGHT end up worth releasing, but that’s not something you can determine until you get halfway into it.\n\nPossibly a better question: how long until a good font?\n\nSince there are thousands of different approaches, and thousands of possible styles, there can be no standard, even if you gave the same challenge/assignment to 100 people of equivalent experience and skill. Some fonts are autotraced (and not necessarily garbage), and some are carefully hand-drawn, one glyph at a time. Revivals, digitized lettering, adapted handwriting, large type systems, roman and italics, etc. etc. are different kinds of design challenges. Your first font is likely to be a learning experience, so you will repeat or discard previous work when (yes, when) you discover it isn’t right.\n\nThe other thing about estimating this time is the additional time that typefaces seem to need to be left alone, unseen, while the designer has other experiences and gets some distance from the design. You can’t count that as design time, but the time has to pass, and it contributes to the design.\n\nLet’s just say the answer is probably “longer than you think”.\n\n"

I have been stumbling around for 4 years now on my own and have a dozen typefaces “in the works” but none “finished”—whatever that means is a moving target.

And then I found fatal flaws in that design as well, and that got aborted as well. And then rinse and repeat.\n\nWhile my numerous attempts so far bare little resemblance to each other (I’ve done garaldes, transitionals, bracketed serifs, wedge serifs, and waded through a broad range of design decisions), each successive attempt represents a refinement of the previous idea. So arguably, I’ve been working on my first font for more than two years.\n\nThe mountain metaphor is a good one, I find. Well, I wrote about climbing Mt Kilimanjaro in my college application essay, and noted how scaling the peak in the cover of darkness with no real sense of how much we had left to climb probably prevented us from giving up in despair.\n\nI remember thinking when I began my first font that I’d be able to finish it in a couple of months at most.

As a matter of fact, I would recommend if anyone has spent more than a few weeks on a particular font, and it’s still not working, just put it away and start something else. The font may work out once you look at it with fresh eyes, but usually what you draw in the mean time is better anyway.\n\n"

A revival, mind you, and just one cut, so don’t ask me why it aint finished yet.\n\nBefore that (around 1992 I think) I did a real quick and dirty one, with Fontographer (that I bought especially for this) of a book cover font that struck my fancy, naïve and impressionable I was at the time. Took me a day or thereabouts to digitize the existing glyphs and make up the rest of the caps and lc. Posted in on the web (called CompuServe at the time, haha).  \nAnd I did see that typeface being used, to my shame, (NO, I will never tell — it seems to have disappeared in the digital void, thank Allah).\n\nThe last four years I have been thinking about a new concept. Could take some time, though. But I DID buy the most recent software, just in case… And I have done pages and pages of sketching.  \nNothing digital yet…\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

      "content": "As many others have said, it’s probably important to start and finish a typeface, even if you realize more and more that you have everything to learn in the process. You will always be learning if you are really interested in doing good things.  \nNot being a “professional” type designer I always suffered from the problem of not finishing what I started.  \nMy first typeface with some idea behind it had been [Ottomat](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203232331/http:/www.emigre.com/ot.php?id=113), and I owe a lot to Rudy and Zuzana Licko for having published it, since I would have probably continued designing and perfecting things without never ending them.  \nDepending on your motivations, if you work for many years - somnetime sporadically - on a family, you may end up realizing the face no longer relates to its premises and/or to your experience, and so it can happen that:  \n1) you drop it, even if you worked on it for a long-long time;  \n2) you manage to understand it in context and you re-work it considering the acquired gifts.\n\nFor me, I’m unable to say if my own Neoritmo (designed mostly between 1996 and 2000) will ever see the light in its actual state.  \nMy friend Panos Haratzopoulos of Cannibal Fonts used it (designing a Greek version) for a great project: the new identity of the [Benaki Museum](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203232331/http:/www.benaki.gr/index.asp?lang=gr&id=10101) in Greece, but this, besides being a great honor, showed impiously all Neoritmo’s problems to me…\n\n"
