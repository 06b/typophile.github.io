  "content": "I’m a student at the Ontario College of Art & Design, creating a travel magazine called When in Roam. It’s about blending and participating in current and contemporary local culture when abroad. This is an interactive magazine encouraging people to be active observers and participants in their travel experience. In my photo essay I’m showing postcards (front & back) from the destination each issue is themed around. The first publication is featuring Buenos Aires. So, I’m asking for anyone in BA or South American countries to send me postcards to feature in the magazine. I will pass on my address to all those lovely participants interested! Thanks so much for the help.\n\n",
