  "content": "Hi Typophile users\n\nAfter the initial critique last month on 'Typophile' I went away and studied every aspect of this font to see why it didn't seem to work.\n\nI realised that the weight of vertical and horizontal strokes weren't visually in harmony. This was due to the height of the vertical strokes. I rectified this by reducing the thickness of the horizontal strokes by a third.\n\n[strokes.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171742/https:/www.dropbox.com/s/7xjs9vrprbqlke6/STROKES.pdf) - As you can see the top and bottom stroke of the body of the 'Q' are slightly thinner.\n\nThe thinning of strokes also helped to make the curves feel more natural. Because of this the thinner strokes gave the letter forms more white space. In turn the perfect circles that previously made up counters and white space turned into ovals.\n\n[ovals.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171742/https:/www.dropbox.com/s/meh1pnr8a37b7vm/OVAL.pdf) - The straight and curved strokes are less noticeable.\n\nThe width of certain letter forms where complicating the overall feel of the uppercase so I split some of the letters into sections, each section with a specific body width. 'E', 'F', 'L', 'T' and the 'Z' hold a lot of white space so I decided on reducing their width so they sat comfortably with other wider letters. 'B', 'K' and 'R' where slightly wider to compensate for the lower counters or white space so they didn't feel too top heavy.\n\n[groups.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171742/https:/www.dropbox.com/s/atqq1q623hc5pax/GROUPS.pdf) - They now sit more comfortable with each other now.\n\nLastly stroke edges have been made to feel softer with barely any sharp points in site. This was achieved by rounding off most of the sharp points.\n\n[desperation.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171742/https:/www.dropbox.com/s/x0etyiu21h6q5hq/FONT.pdf) - The overall UPPERCASE of desperation.\n\nPlease let me know what you all think?\n\nMany thanks\n\nDarren Reay\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [FONT.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317171742/http:/typophile.com/files/FONT.pdf) | 7.1 KB |\n\n",

I've now started picking it back up and playing around with it again. I appreciate your reply :).\n\nI agree about the strokes on both EF, the contrast in weight are too much, I think I was being too strict with the grids. The S is definitely unfinishes and needs more work on it.\n\nI've recently started creating the lower case and finding it hard to contain the same character as the UPPERCASE but I'll post the progress over the next few weeks.\n\n"
