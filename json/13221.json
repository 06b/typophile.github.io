We've had our share of good and nightmarish experiences. Is there a printer(s) you would highly recommend? Lets get some epinions!\n\n",

I used them for postcard printing for my wedding photo thank you cards. Most of their designs and templates are for business but I was able to design something myself by uploading photos and whatnot. The quality was great and the price was unbeatable.\n\nI think this is the postcards page or you can just click around to find them from the home page... :) [www.vistaprint.com/vp/ns/splash/splash\\_postcards.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074950/http:/www.vistaprint.com/vp/ns/splash/splash_postcards.aspx \"www.vistaprint.com/vp/ns/splash/splash\\_postcards.aspx\")\n\n"

Gives amazingly crisp type and unbelievable detail for photos. The screening is so fine, you need higher-res digital images than with normal offset, or pixels will show.\n\nClubcard has a location in Vancouver as well as SF. Their presses aren't any trade secret, and actually their screening process isn't either (look around on their website). You could try to locate someone in your area that uses them.\n\nIf you work with Clubcard, do make sure to provide all the crops and marks, as they gang many jobs and aren't necessarily pampering your job when it's run.\n\n"
