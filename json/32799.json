  "content": "Good evening, all.\n\nI’m a design student, about a year away from finishing my BFA in Graphic Design. As a graduation gift from my parents, i’m getting an all expenses paid trip to Europe. I’m looking for opinions on where exactly I should go. Preferably somewhere with good design to study and interesting sights to see. (A good nightlife wouldn’t hurt, either). I was leaning toward Berlin, but I wanted to broaden my options by polling some of you who live in or have visited Europe before.\n\nTo recap, my “checklist” of a good candidate:  \n1) Active, on-display design culture  \n2) Interesting sights  \n3) Good places to catch some live music  \n4) Just good to visit in general\n\nSuggestions? :)\n\nThank you!  \nEric\n\n [‹ Anybody got Type Tourism Tips for San Diego & LA ?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008040854/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32490 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Journal on letterpress ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081008040854/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32736 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In my experience, this has been a little more difficult in Italy and France. Here in Germany, though, many will immediately switch to English when they begin to hear me talk, which is not necessary, although I always appreciate that they are trying to be helpful.\n\nIf you stay in Berlin and want to go to Antwerp and Zurich, it would be best to take the train to one of them, and then stay in that city for a night or two (or longer!) and then return to Berlin. Zurich must be 8 hours away from Berlin, even via fast train. Maybe Antwerp can be reached in four? But don’t forget Dessau and Weimar. These are easy day trips from Berlin.\n\n"

It’s hard to explain, but I feel like the places are more alive. You also get along with a very slow english and making signs. Maybe a train trip like Prague-Krakow-Budapest-Kroatia?
