      "content": "Good evening,  \nor whatever time it is when you read my comment...\n\nThe problem is:  \ntwo dozend of Antiqua were built between, lets say,  \n1900 up to 1920. All called with a name part like  \n\"Roman\" (Römische or Romanische). They all look  \na little bit the same way.\n\nThis one shows some typical signs like the lower  \ncase \"e\" or the upper case \"A\", not to forget the  \nspecial \"R\" rounding (this is typical for those  \nRomans.\n\nThe best source \"Seemann - Handbuch für Schriften\"  \nis not senseful to use because they used the word  \n\"Hamburg\" or \"Hamburger\". But not in this case,  \nI checked it.\n\nIts a typography book, mh?  \nIt tells something about form and spirit (Ausdruck).  \nCan you tell me in which year the book was printed?  \nOr the title and author? That makes it easier to find  \nit. Is it printed in Leipzig e.g.? So it could be a  \nSchriftguss or Schelter & Giesecke type.\n\nYou see... I'ld like to help, but I'ld need your support.\n\nRegards,\n\nGeorg  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n„Ich bin ein Preuße, kennt Ihr meine Farben...“\n\n"
