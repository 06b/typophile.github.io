  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm looking for a Flemish Blackletter from the beginning of the 20st century (or older). I prefer one that hasn't been digitalised yet.  \nI allready tried a catalogue of Platin Moretus in Antwerp and found two typefaces, but these were allready made digital ('Cloister Black' and 'Wedding Text Std.')\n\nCan anyone help me?\n\nThank you\n\n",

Walloon, not Flemish, but was there really a distinction in style?\n\nCliquez ici pour le [Spécimen des caractères de la fonderie normale à Bruxelles, provenant de la fonderie de Jules Didot et de son père, Pierre Didot](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317112003/http:/typophile.com/wiki/https%3A/%252Farchive.org/details/spcimendescaract00johe) (1914).\n\nI've actually been working on a digitization of this myself, mainly for an exercise of my own and not for any end goal. Almost complete set of decorative uppercase, missing some lower case examples but fairly easy to fill the gaps in the same style.\n\n"
