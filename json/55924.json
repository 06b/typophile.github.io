  "content": "/ THE CHALLENGE\n\nArial was created as a substitute for Helvetica, but most graphic designers consider it a poor substitute, and avoid using it if they can.&nbsp;\n\nThe challenge is to redesign Arial, perhaps with small changes, perhaps with major changes, but to make it into an alternative to Helvetica that a designer could love, maybe even prefer. <cite>Making it look like Helvetica is not allowed.</cite> Making it more easily distinguished from Helvetica is a plus. Just as Arial's metrics are identical (or nearly so) and its weight and proportions similar, so should the \"fixed\" version.\n\nWinner take all, no holds barred. May the best designer win.\n\n// REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Image size: 550 width x 400 height. 72 dpi\\*  \n- Color: Black and White  \n- Format: JPG or PNG (make sure there are no spaces in the name)\n\n**\\*Please try to keep your file sizes to a minimum! 50k per file max.**\n\n// ABOUT TYPOPHILE [TYPE BATTLES](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021113128/http:/www.typophile.com/typebattles)\n\nThis is your chance to stretch your type muscles on a weekly basis. You have one week to create and submit your entry. Anyone may submit a design response to the challenge. You may enter as often as you wish. Post anytime. Critiques and comments are welcome throughout the game, from participants and spectators alike.

      "content": "Basically, what's wrong with Arial is it's too up tight. It needs to un-wind.\n\nIt needs a freaking vacation!\n\nIt is not that it is good or bad. Just an overworked typeface trying to fit in where it wasn't really wanted and being wanted where it doesn't really fit in. It feels guilty for being forced to do Helvetica's job, even thought Helvetica has been overworked for years and years. Designers, the only people on the planet who could pick Arial out in a police line-up, despise Arial for being a cheap impostor, even if they also despise Helvetica. The fact is, because of its interloper status, it never really gets judged for its merit. It's always, \"Oh, that Helvetica wannabe, Arial…\" Not that most people judge it all. It's just a steady work horse to most, who gets called time and time again to fill in for somebody else because he'll work for less, or he's just there: \"Here's a pile-o-crap, would you clean it up for me.\" Arial says, \"B,b,b, But …\" but accepts the shovel, sighs and gets to work. \"here's a load of cod's wollop. would you dress it up and make it smell nice.\" Arial says, \"B,b,b, but,…\"\n\nSo, my solution was to help Arial relax. Get it out of that suit. Send it to the spa for some pampering and a nice massage. The whole nine yards. In the Caribbean. On the beach.\n\nIf you want to relax a typeface, what do you do? Why, of course, you convert lines to curves, make them smooth & you remove nodes. Lots and lots of them.\n\nArialicious: Arial is so relaxed, he's downright counter-culture. Hand that kid a dooby.\n\nComarial Sans: The tie is loosened, the top button opened, but he's ready to work. Maybe something not too demanding down in shipping.\n\nHelvarial: Think mullet. Hockey-hair… Business in the front, party in the back back.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021113128im_/http:/typophile.com/files/arialicious_6713.jpg)\n\n"

Back in the days of lower res monitors, it made a difference in smaller sizes, like in body text. You only had like 7 pixels and no anti-aliasing to define your caps, and Helvetica's humanistic roundness didn't resolve as nicely as Arial's straighter lines.\n\nNow that screen resolutions have all but obliterated Arial's advantage, let's take the typeface back to its roots to inject some character back into it. Maybe take some influence from Grotesk and Gothic faces. And fix some real annoyances while we're at it. Like that God-awful cap R leg. And the fugly lowercase a and r. Here's a quick go at it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021113128im_/http:/typophile.com/files/arialnext_6519.gif)\n\n"
