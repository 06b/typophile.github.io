  "content": "Following on from this Twitter conversation [https://twitter.com/typographica/status/307302297250168832](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414141756/https:/twitter.com/typographica/status/307302297250168832 \"https://twitter.com/typographica/status/307302297250168832\")\n\nThere's obviously a lot of feeling about the recent trend of launching fonts with 80-90% discounts. Some foundries say it cheapens fonts, and some are forced to emulate the offers in order to be noticed. As a marketing technique, it really works well in the short term as it pushes the new fonts quickly up the sales charts, but after the sale's ended, how long do they stick around?\n\nThe sales charts at MyFonts are based solely on dollar value, so a font family at $5 has to sell ten times as many as one at $50 to reach the same chart position. I had an idea for weighting the charts in favour of more realistically priced fonts:\n\nFont Family X - standard price $200, 90% intro offer = $20 each family  \nFont Family Y - standard price $200, 50% intro offer = $100 each family  \nFont Family Z - standard price $200, 0% intro offer = $200 each family\n\nAs it stands, to reach the same position, X needs to sell five times as many as Y, which needs to sell twice as much as Z.  \nIf the sales charts mechanism was changed such that the dollar value received was also affected by the offer price, say by taking half the offer percentage off the resulting price (only for working out chart position), the prices of each font above (in terms of how the chart sees them) would be:\n\nFont Family X - standard price $200, 90% intro offer = $20 each family . minus 45% = $11  \nFont Family Y - standard price $200, 50% intro offer = $100 each family . minus 25% = $75  \nFont Family Z - standard price $200, 0% intro offer = $200 each family . minus 0% = $200\n\nClearly, the more heavily discounted fonts now need to sell even more in relation to non discounted fonts to reach the same position in the chart. There is still a marketing advantage to putting your fonts on offer, but the more ridiculous offers would not be as effective as they are now.\n\nWhat do think? Is this fair? I'm undecided, but I think the system as it is now is starting to force foundries making decent fonts to discount heavily in order to keep up with not-so-decent fonts. If it continues, it won't be long before every new release is 99% off for a month then never sells again after that. If a new system could be shown to give more long term sales, that can only be a good thing.\n\n",

They are supposed to reach an audience which has over 100.000 fonts to choose from and hundreds of new Twitter messages every day. So for a short period of time you make a loud offer people can't resist and by this you spread the word. That's it.  \nThose fonts don't sell because they are in the bestseller list, but because of the offer itself, which is such a good deal that people start to spread the news and that creates the snowball effect. So I don't think it's caused by the list or it's calculation.\n\n<cite> If it continues, it won't be long before every new release is 99% off for a month … </cite>\n\nCertainly, that will happen for some fonts.\n\n<cite>… then never sells again after that. </cite>\n\nMyFonts is just a retailer. It's up to the foundry to keep the sales up and there are many different strategies to achieve this. A bestseller list is just that. It shows what sells. It can't weigh anything to support “quality fonts”.  \nMaybe they could start an “Editor’s choice” section where quality fonts are suggested, but I don't think we need to blame the calculation of the bestseller list for how foundries set up their pricing.\n\n"

I'm not really concerned about cheapening my brand by putting things on offer. If I was overly concerned with my 'brand' I'd have ditched a load of fonts by now. I guess I just feel for newer foundries whose only way of gaining exposure is to underprice. I have a feeling this pricing model may just be a trend that is unsustainable in the long run. I hope so anyway.  \nMy worry is that customers may stop buying any fonts at full price, knowing that vastly discounted fonts are never far away. Hopefully though, this may cause foundries to make ever more interesting and different fonts, as big discounts cease to be a factor in separating their fonts from others', because virtually all fonts are hugely discounted.  \nBTW, I don't wish to come across like I'm saying all fonts with big discounts are bad, or that big discounts are inherently a bad thing. I just wanted to carry on the discussion where participants could use more than 140 characters!\n\n"

I might be wrong, but nothing on the best sellers list is currently on an introductory sale, but there's plenty on there that were. That would seem to indicate that the penetration idea works, and that sales are sustained afterwards by a font's higher visibility. There's also fonts on there that were promoted by other methods, such as free weights (which remain free, by the way –&nbsp;no restrictions there).\n\nAnthony\n\n"

Probably the first full family sold at a breath-taking introductory price on MyFonts was HVD’s Pluto in mid-2011; it has remained a seller at full price. But I wouldn’t be surprised if Hannes was inspired by the high-profile introduction of Axel (a Spiekermann production) two years earlier by FontShop Germany at less than €/$ 20 for a four-weight family.  \nWhile typohiles (including some of us at MyFonts) may have mixed feelings about the trend, it does have its positive aspects. Typically, non-pro and semi-pro customers have always bought single weights, even when volume discounts on larger (text) families were substantial. Thanks to the family-at-the-price-of-one-weight craze, average users have become familiar with the idea of buying an entire type family, which to many always seems to have looked like a rather extravagant and unnecessary kind of purchase. So while some argue that low prices teach people a wrong thing (fonts can be cheap) it might also teach them something good: fonts don’t necessarily come one at a time.\n\n"

So begin with a massively deep discount for, say, a week, and then start incrementally increasing it up to the full retail price. The latter could either be a fixed amount comparable to other fonts, or simply at whatever level the particular font continues to sell an average of X licenses per week. Just an idea.

Although the calculations differ, the idea is the same as for a regular Dutch auction, to enable the buyer to make reasoned decisions within a predictable structure. Because Dutch auctions apply to limited commodities, there is an element of gamble involved in waiting for a lower price (someone else might be willing to pay more, and you'll be left with nothing). In my reverse model, with rising price, there is no gamble but there is pressure to buy early, increasing upfront revenue, but without the simple jump from deeply discounted to full price. I see it also as a useful tool for designers dealing with clients: \"This is the font we want to use for your job, but the longer you delay decisions/budget/PO the more it is going to cost.\"\n\nThe other benefit I see in the model is that it provides a trackable progress of sales relative to price -- adjusting for other factors --, which is something sellers generally lack. The process by which the 'market' determines price is generally pretty much guesswork: a seller looks at similar products, and guesses how much he might be able to charge. He typically has no data to tell him whether he might, in fact, make more money selling at a slightly lower price or if he might sell the same volume at a slightly higher price. By gradually increasing the price over time, one can collect information on buying behaviour relative to price.\n\n"

A photolettering disc did cost 20 times what a font costs today and it only had around 200 characters and could not be used indefinitely, let alone be copied to 5 machines.  \nThere is nothing wrong with falling prices when the number of sales rises, especially with digital goods.\n\n"

When someone is looking for a font for a particular project, especially when doing a keyword search, they will consider a variety of typefaces, not just what’s hot at the moment. They might remember something that caught their fancy several years ago, but which they haven’t yet had the opportunity to use.\n\nTypefaces can become fashion items, but they are also extremely durable, both stylistically and technologically.\n\nUltimately, if one applies the Long Tail or Zipf distribution to itself, it becomes apparent that while one end of the curve is subject to fashion, price, and popularity, a large part of the market does not follow these principles.\n\nFor instance, the Scotch Modern is not presently considered a good text type, and the Shinntype version is very expensive, has never been discounted, and has never made a best-seller list.

It's rational and it provides motivation for buying. And that's the key: it's rational. The massive discount model (a discount ending when? and why?) has no explicit rational foundation -- by which I mean the buyer or end-user can't determine the reason. Sure, I'm seeing the reason in this thread, but not at the point of purchase.\n\nAnd the real end user, the final client, what do I say to them? \"Well, this font's not as good but it costs 99 cents at a 95% discount.\" Most people have never heard of discounts like that except on flawed or blemished goods; goods that don't work properly; children's toys made of lead at a night market.\n\nUltimately, I want beautiful work-horse typefaces that I have to pay a fair bit of money for and not everyone can afford.

When Apple dropped the price of the iPod (or maybe it was the iPhone) by a big amount a few years ago, people complained and Apple gave recent buyers a $100 voucher. So go ahead and complain away! No human needs to be forgiving towards a corporation, only other humans.\n\nhhp\n\n"

At present, this style of discounting is not possible at MyFonts, where you can put your fonts on sale for a set period of time, and must wait another set period of time between sales. I think (I considered it!) it might be possible to do by issuing voucher codes, but then you have the situation where you have to find a way of publicising those codes. I guess foundries with enough following could do this pre-release on Twitter, but then these foundries probably don't need the discounts to shift fonts.\n\n"

If you would want to make that comparison, it would mean that a web shop like MyFonts would offer you a refund if you find the same font on FontShop.com. MyFonts would be willing to give up a little bit of their(!) profit in order to have you buy it on their website. The maker of that product (in this case the foundry) isn't even involved in this deal.  \nSo those retailers fighting over the cheapest offer is something very different from makers of products setting up their prices (including sale offers).\n\nAnd if you want to compare it with physical goods: Every season there are new clothes, and when the next season starts, there will be heavy discounts for the same products. Do you expect refunds when you paid the full price? It's the very same good offered for very different prices. The only thing that has changed is the time of the purchase.\n\n<cite>The stock market is something else entirely where the assumption of risk is understood.</cite>\n\nMy point was: the two sides agree about worth and price. Why should a buying option for other (future) customers make a difference? If I decide to double the price of my font tomorrow, because it sells like hot cake, can I then come to you as someone who bought it yesterday, and ask for 100% more? I guess not!  \nYou will say: a deal is a deal. If you don't want pay that additional price, then you also shouln’t ask for a refund, should the prices drop for a temporary sale offer.\n\n<cite>Maybe I'm a dreamer but I still believe trust is an essential aspect of a commercial transaction. </cite>\n\nCertainly! Now that there are over 100.000 fonts available and the font makers can’t control the prices thru proprietary typesetting machines anymore, the human connection between buyer and sellers becomes very important. Maybe not if you buy at fonts.com, but certainly for all the independent foundries.  \nBut this trust doesn’t mean that I will keep my prices unchanged forever, so existing customers can still “feel good” about their purchases. You got the product you wanted and you got it for a price you considered acceptable at the time of the purchase. There is nothing to feel bad about, should the prices change (in one direction or the other).\n\n"

      "content": "Todd, very well expressed.\n\nRalf, the reality is that many customers simply don't think the way you describe. If the price drops a great deal on something bought the day before, many people don't just feel unlucky, they feel betrayed. And quite often that feeling is entirely rational because companies don't decide to lower a price 5 minutes before, they've already decided at the time you bought it for the higher price. And when people feel betrayed by a company, the company pays for it - either by having to give back money or credit, or by losing a future customer (often due to word-of-mouth).\n\nIn many US department stores when you're about to buy something at full price, they will actually tell you to wait until the next day when the item will be discounted! Are they stupid to do that? I think they're very clever. And try using an expired coupon at almost any fast-food place: does it work? Yes. Think about why that's the case.\n\nRetail businesses don't get rich by being fascist about rules.\n\nhhp\n\n"
