The way the strokes end heightens that effect.\n\nOnce again we are back in the realm of hand-printed fonts (= cheap & easy to make) and so anyone with experience in hand-lettering could have created this font.\n\nThe next question it makes you ask is ’aren’t there a lot of fonts that are enough like this that I wouldn’t be able to tell them from this one without looking at them side-by-side?’ I think the answer to that one is ’yes’.\n\nMike’s Rule of Hand-lettered fonts: If it’s too much trouble to find the exact match, pick a close equivalent, and get on with it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
