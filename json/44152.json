  "content": "Howdy all,\n\nVery early thoughts on Soseus [soh-see-uhs], that is an online & offline business marketing and consulting firm. Soseus is a bastardization of \"socius\", which is Latin for \"partner\".\n\nThey work mainly with medium-sized companies who are generally profitable but aren't very _interesting_ (insurance, chemicals, etc), and make them so to other businesses and consumers (and a better bottom-line) -- by advising on all parts of the brand, everything from how the receptionists sound to the marketing collateral to rebuilding their website to be more functional towards what their customers want -- and end up being quite integrated with these firms along the way.\n\nI wanted to make a wordmark with a bit of corporate, a pinch of design-studio, and a personal touch... and kept coming back to something near [metroscript by Michael Doret](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106094756/http:/michaeldoret.com/AlphabetSoup/metroscript.html). Any other thoughts?\n\nWhat is it you expect if you saw this logo on a business card at a tech conference... say CeBit or IEEE?\n\nAll comments accepted and respected, of course!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [soseus.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106094756/http:/typophile.com/files/soseus.gif) | 3.61 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I like this mark a lot, although unfortunately it may be a bit too hip for the target audience. Do you think that insurance company types and chemical engineers would be turned on by this? Read this description of the [Meyer-Briggs type ISTJ](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106094756/http:/www.personalitypage.com/ISTJ.html) and then reconsider your direction. Please know I think you've done good work, but I have doubts about you connecting with your audience.\n\n---  \nNick Hladek\n\n"
