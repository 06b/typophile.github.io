What a cool site.\n\nQuestion:\n\nI’m resetting a pamphlet published in 1883: William Smith on Mormonism.\n\nIt was printed in Lamoni, Iowa (at Herald Steam Book and Job Office), as I said, in 1883.\n\nWhile I have access to the text, I have been unable to locate any images of the actual document.\n\nWithout that, I have no idea what font was actually used. While I’d love to know, I’d settle for at least setting it in a historically-tenable font.\n\nDoes anyone have suggestions?\n\nMuch thanks for your time and help, folks.\n\nChris\n\n [‹ Fair Trade font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080110171642/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40533 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Segmented fonts? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080110171642/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40478 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This was done in partnership with Linotype as they had done some preliminary digitization.\n\nThe fonts are available from Carter & Cone, or I believe Linotype. The C&C has all the goodies, but as it is a Type 1 font, they’re spread out across multiple fonts. Monticello is essentially the same as <cite>Oxford</cite>, and could be thought of as a Scotch.\n\n"

At least then I’ll know the identity of the font(s) to which I don’t have access.\n\nThe body-text font doesn’t seem \\*particularly\\* distinctive, at least in my fairly-uninformed opinion, other than the upper-case “J.” But the title-font surely must be identifiable from a mile away if one has the right set of eyes.\n\nAgain, thanks much for the help.\n\nChris\n\n"
