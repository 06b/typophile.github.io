I think that Caslon is also a little too intricate to compliment a font as neat as Officiana Sans...\n\nIs there any particular reason that you aren’t looking at Officiana Serif? That is a nice simple Slab serif Font that i think would work (it is a type system!) but then again it also depends on the context of it all.\n\nIf i had to pick a, I think Century Old Style?\n\n[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/scangraphic/century\\_old\\_style\\_sh...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180959/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/scangraphic/century_old_style_sh/ \"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/scangraphic/century\\_old\\_style\\_sh/\")\n\n—  \narjun\n\n"
