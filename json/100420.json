First prize would be a positive response, but unfortunately the deadline is looming, so not sure I can wait much longer.\n\nbartd: The way the bowls and stems in the lower-case connect is something that has never seemed quite right to me.\n\nhrant: I totally agree. I'd rather not have something that's too common. I was looking at [Replica](http://web.archive.org/web/20131010185234/http:/lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Replica/) but it's quite pricey. (I'm in South Africa and the conversion rate is harsh)\n\nsatya: That is really beautiful, when is the release date?\n\n"
