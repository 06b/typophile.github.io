My toy piano band Twink ( [http://www.twink.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108034941/http:/www.twink.net/)) is releasing a \"metal\" EP, and I designed a special logo for the package. I'm wondering what typeface(s) might compliment the logo, for use in the album title (\"Welcome to the Jingle\"). Thanks!   \n   \n ![Twink metal logo GIF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108034941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6964.gif)\n\n",

It's simultaneously whimsical and tough, and seems to be a good foil to a sculpted logo. (Track list will go below the title, possible in Bureau Grotesque. Bunny skull will be front cover, text on back.)   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108034941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7001.gif) ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108034941im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7002.gif)\n\n"
