  "content": "I'm trying to set up some bar codes, these need to be printable as fonts with limited pre processing, I've selected a barcode called Code 93 which is quite condensed compared to say, Code39 (its predecessor)\n\nI'm now trying to get/create a font for it as it seems to be hard to track down (and I have no budget to fork our $100 dollars) I have had some success fixing a broken free font but I'm a bit lost at the \"Hinting/Instruction\" aspect.\n\nI'm trying to print this barcode on a 203dpi Thermal transfer label printer, what kind of auto hinting etc do i need to do get this to work (From MS word initially and a FoxPro form generator down the line)\n\n[or does anyone have a working free version, the first results on google lack start and end characters required]\n\nThanks,\n\n",
