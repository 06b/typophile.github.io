  "content": "I just modified an Adobe font for a client for their in-house use. But then they asked me to work on two weights of Helvetica. Of course I said I think that's not allowed & sure enough that's right. So then I asked my fine pals at FontShop about this & they told me that; yes, almost everybody wants to either prohibit that now or do that work themselves - which is their perogative. But I still have this client & I am bound to ask on their behalf:\n\n- If they bought the font before the EULA changed and can prove it, where am I?  \n- Can you think of a Helvetica-alike with at least two weights whose EULA is more Adobe/Shinn type like? I would prefer they used an indie font anyway.  \n- What if they buy various Helveticas from Adobe? Does the Adobe EULA apply?\n\nCertainly if there is no legal way to do they work I will refuse and refer them to Mono-Lino.\n\nBut if there is a legal/ethical way to get this done I would like to do that.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Perhaps there is some sublicensing agreement that allows Adobe to apply their EULA.\n\n[Helvetica Alternates](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209002654/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica_alternatives.cfm), just in time. Consider URW's [Heldustry](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209002654/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Heldustry) or E+F's [Folio](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209002654/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Folio).

      "content": "Stephen:  \nThis has been discussed numerous times. The EULA offered by the vendor to the buyer is the EULA that the buyer agrees to: if you enter into an agreement with Adobe, it's Adobe's terms you've agreed to, not Linotype's.\n\nThat's a major reason to buy from Adobe: they often have better terms than the original foundry. Take MVB Celestia™ Antiqua: license it from Adobe, and you can embed it for print and preview (see [this list](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209002654/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html)); get it from MVB themselves, and \"if you have purchased a Basic License, you may distribute a PDF containing the subset-embedded Font Software to not more than five (5) computers at your one geographical location.\" See more [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209002654/http:/www.mvbfonts.com/html/info/contents/eula.htm)\n\nMajor players like Adobe and Microsoft manage to negotiate more favourable terms for their clients: that's why you can find editable embedding versions of fonts in Microsoft products that, if purchased from another vendor might not allow \\_any\\_ embedding. That's how Simon Daniels explained it to me.\n\nSee [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20111209002654/http:/www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?14@@.3bc319b0/0) very recent thread on Adobe's forums.\n\nAnd, unless the EULA has a clause saying that the agreement is subject to future unilateral alterations (and, sadly, such EULAs \\_do\\_ exist!), the agreement you made when the money changed hands is the agreement you have.\n\nIt pays to shop EULAs!\n\nNow can you modify Adobe's Helvetica? Well, that's one for the lawyers! Maybe it is easier to go with one of your alternates.\n\n"
