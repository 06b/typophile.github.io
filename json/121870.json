      "content": "I've done graphic design work for several regional banks. Some used to use custom fonts but they've all gone to standard fonts.\n\nThe reason I was told was that with many branches, employees, vendors, etc. their graphics departments got sick of constantly sending the custom font to people, and also seeing pieces done in the wrong font when the vendor didn't have the right one.\n\nIt's easier to say to a vendor \"just use [common font]\".\n\nYou'd think that employees could send it without bothering the graphics department, but most employees can't even pick the right color, let alone the right font.\n\n"
