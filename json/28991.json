Not much of theory but technical and the general terms used in publication and the random questions related to typography.\n\nI found lots of rare terms people don’t know and I would like to know them too. Yesterday someone had asked me what does “pangram” means? and I had no idea what he was talking about. I think being a design student i must know all these basic terminology.\n\nPlease ask me questions as much as you can. Anything related to typography/publication or basic graphic design. Ask something which you feel I would not be able to answer. Cause that way i will try myself to find them out and will learn more in the process. Kind of a revision of the course.\n\nThanks in advanced\n\nsatya  \nstudent, graphic design  \nNID, India\n\nPS: Please don’t answer my questions until unless i request for them.\n\n [‹ sms](http://web.archive.org/web/20080203202855/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29207 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How about matching fonts to horror movie titles... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080203202855/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29198 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

When trimmed the inner pages are narrower than the outer pages, counteracting the creep.\n\nTotal pages in book, divided by 4 (for each 4 pager), times paper thickness. Take that number, and divide it by the number of flat sheets in your book. This number will be quite small, but will represent the amount that you should adjust each page’s outside margin, as you get closer to the center of the booklet. This works in most cases but using a folded, drilled, dummy of the actual job stock is best.\n\n"

There have been a number of attempts to teach it here and to switch over to it. The switching over part has failed quite miserably as you might expect. Even though the metric system is far more logical in every way, change is difficult at best. I think a great impediment is in the inability of people not used to the metric system to visualize a measure. Those brought up in the Enlish system have a feel for what an inch or a foot or a mile might be but can’t get a visual grasp on centemeters and kilometers. They have to make the conversion calculation before they can “see” it. We all know how much we love having to do a calculation thrills us so the resistance continues.  \nChrisL\n\n"
