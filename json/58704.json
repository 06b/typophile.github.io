I've used font book's validate file option, which found no errors. But font book won't install the file.\n\nsome people have told me they are able to install the font, but absolutely nothing happens when I try to get font book to open it.\n\nany suggestions?\n\nthank you\n\nMathew\n\n",

I think Font Forge automatically becomes the default application for all font formats on Leopard so, if you already have the font open in Font Forge, it might look like nothing is happening.\n\n"
