  "content": "There is a media campaign in New York's subways designed by Milton Glaser to raise awareness about the massacres in Darfur. What's interesting about these from a design standpoint is the avoidance of the expected shock photos of poverty, violence, etc. Instead, the solution is completely type-based, and quite effective, I think. By avoiding the heart-wrenching people-as-victims photos, I think the people in question retain dignity and the \"coversation\" transpires at a rational level. (Although one could make the point that the disaster has passed the point of \"rationality\" being appropriate.) Any thoughts?\n\nHere is a story with some photos of the ads:\n\n[http://www.designdrivethru.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20100402063458/http:/www.designdrivethru.net/ \"http://www.designdrivethru.net\")\n\n",

The fact is that the US is a derivative of European culture and the majority are of European ancestry, and through the media and travel French have some familiarity with the US.\n\nIn the case of Darfur, for most Americans Darfur was so unknown and alien that it took an effort to empathize. The point of the campaign was to say we should empathize, as those in Darfur are human too--which of course is both true and important. But instead of saying we should--which some do, but not in massive, effective numbers--they say 'we are all africans' which is true neither literally nor in the sense of empathizing reflexively.\n\nSecondly, it was evident to French and other Europeans that they wouldn't be exempt from the threat of groups who were terrorists in the name of Islam, such as those who had attacked the US. This was also unfortunately true.\n\nThe immediate threat of the Sudan government-sponsored violence against the people in Darfur is not a threat likely to be immediately redirected at the US and Europe in the same way.\n\nThe poster campaign gets it very right by emphasizing the common humanity of those in Darfur, but the 'We are all African' is wrong enough to detract from the message, IMHO.\n\n"

      "content": "It seems that the most significant obstacle campaigns such as this face is the sort of paradoxical relationship between their message and their environment. Billboards, bus sides, magazines, posters all play host to objects of our desires and fears, and as consumers we are accustomed to thinking of these as liminal spaces containing fantasies, lies, distortions, all sorts of salesmanship, and much of it already very intimate and presumptuous. If you want a message about a real emergency in the real world to really cut through the fog, you've got to do better than clever, and be more daring than elegant.\n\nThe \"acceptability\" of Glaser's solution lies in the fact that you could use the poster for cancer, wearing a seatbelt, clean drinking water, or a variety of other issues. The tactic of presenting a destroyed version of something valuable (be it the word \"daughter\" or a Lexus) as a way of illustrating personal responsibility is typical of public service announcement scolding (there is also here the authoritarian threat that this could happen to you and your family). To the degree that it reinforces the general message that you as an individual ought to think about the larger world, Glaser's solution probably works just fine.\n\nBut I think there is a real missed opportunity here. \"Innocent people just like the innocent people in your family are dying in Darfur in an arbitrary fashion as though they are being crossed off a list\" is not a very motivating message. Afterall, innocent people die in random, senseless ways all the time. And in a time of war (our own or Sudan's) we may even have an elevated tolerance for such deaths. Instead, the message ought to have been concerned with the injustice with which these people are being killed.\n\nThe people of NYC don't need to be encouraged to be more compassionate or more caring than they already are. They're fine and I trust them to know injustice when they see it. What they generally don't know is who the Janjaweed are and what they are doing. If the headline \"Genocide in Darfur\" isn't furious enough and won't win any design awards, I might suggest a campaign that features some photos of the Janjaweed's criminal brutality with the tagline \"Mind your own business.\" Not on a dare, they wouldn't.\n\n"

And given what is happening in Iraq, the idea of entering into an on-going civil war is pretty horrifying.\n\nI admit that I don't know politically and militarily what exactly is going on--other than a huge massacre and displacement of people--and what to do about it.
