  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nA while ago a famous Argentine cartoonist had an ilness that paralized his arm and did not allow it to draw anymore. So a good illustrator and friend draw the comics from him and to keep his characteristic handwriting style which was a signature some designers converted his calligraphy to regular fonts. The Anarosa Font. Here is the link\n\n[http://www.tipo.net.ar/custom.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201074231/http:/www.tipo.net.ar/custom.html \"http://www.tipo.net.ar/custom.html\")\n\nDo you know what software could i use to convert the handwriting of an architect that i know to a digital font? Is there any info in the web about how to do it. Besides, one of the great technical challenges i guess is to make a digital font that reflects the different preasure strokes that a good handwriting style sometimes have.\n\nThanks for any info and cheers,  \nSebastian\n\n",

Setting your compound paths correctly in Illustrator takes a little practice so they display correctly in Fontagrapher. The same process could certainly be used to create a handwritten font.\n\n"
