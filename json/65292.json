The closest fonts i found were [Quixley](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072524/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/quixley/) and [Jackdaw](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072524/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-alias/jackdaw/), but neither of them is especially close. (In case you cared about 'Santa Fe' that is Ray Larabie's [Deftone](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315072524/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/deftone/), with some grungifying).\n\nBecause this has the look of a freebie, I spent a lot of time first at Dafont looking for categories I thought would cover the style, but I couldn't find it. Partly, this is maddening because I think it looks familiar.\n\nMaybe this post will prompt someone else to get aboard?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "Austin, I know you don't post here often, but it does help if you give a more descriptive title for your post. \"Informal Uneven Sans Taqueria\", for example, would have clued in folks who know more about that style of font, and Taqueria would be a key word I would remember if I found the answer, but wanted to find this thread again. You can edit the thread title, since you were the one who posted it.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
