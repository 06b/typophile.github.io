      "content": "Carmelle has bulb serifs like Cooper Black but othersise is a long way from Oswald Cooper’s type designs of 1920. It has about the width of Cooper's Cooper Black Condensed, a “condensed but not squeezed” variation on the Cooper Black theme released in 1925.  \n [Cooper Black Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804155644/http:/www.fontspring.com/fonts/wordshape/cooper-black-condensed) available from Wordshape is similar in width to Carmelle.  \nBut Cooper Black, regular or condensed, is too heavy for Carmelle.  \nBitstream includes a bold weight in its [CooperBT](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804155644/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cooper/), but the width is wrong for Carmelle.  \nThe photo-compostion era produced some alternatives to Cooper, such as Photo-Lettering Inc.'s Cavanagh Hamilton, but the ones I have seen are not much closer than Cooper.  \nDoes your friend have any idea where Carmelle came from?  \nLogo? Advertisement? When?  \nIf it's a modern logo it would be feasible to compress Cooper Black to the width of Carmelle, which would more or less match Carmelle's bold weight, and edit letters to match this design. Extensive editing would be required.  \nDon\n\n"
