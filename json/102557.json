For his project [Library of the Printed Web](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120303/http:/libraryoftheprintedweb.tumblr.com/), Paul was looking for a dotted typeface reminiscent of the punched-out caps on Marcel Duchamp’s 1934 [Green Box](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120303/http:/www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2002.42a-vvvv). As he could not find a typeface close enough, I was spontaneously tempted to make one. This is it. ( [Paul’s beautiful blog post](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120303/http:/soulellis.com/2013/04/selavy/) also reflects on the process.)\n\nSélavy (named after Duchamp’s pseudonym Rrose Sélavy) is a dotted typeface that does not follow a non-dotted model; it exploits its dotted character for instance by forming spontaneous «ligations» between letter pairs like fi or fl, but also EE or LL. (Or FTW!) It is quirky (especially in the caps) and recognizable, but pretty legible also in non-huge sizes (whereas if set very large, it tends to disintegrate into a pattern of dots).\n\nIn addition to being used by Paul in his abovementioned project, we are simultaneously releasing Sélavy to the public as a free font under the SIL Open Font License. And we are not only making the ready-to-use font file available but also the fully component-based source UFO file, making it easy for those with access to type design software to generate new instances of the design.\n\n[Project info / download page](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120303/http:/ninastoessinger.com/projects/selavy/)\n\n[Typophile Critique thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414120303/http:/typophile.com/node/102309) (thanks, all!)\n\n",
