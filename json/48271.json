  "content": "According to Antonio Cavedoni, Giovanni Mardersteig’s Zeno has two shapes for c, m and r, long and short. Right now I plan to find images of this in “THE OFFICINA BODONI, AN ACCOUNT OF THE WORK OF A HAND PRESS, 1923-1977” which is in at least 2 libraries I will be visiting. But does anybody already have images of these? I only ask because I am excited to see them in context. A bit childish of me...\n\nRelated threads:\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/12226](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122070413/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12226 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/12226\")  \n [http://typophile.com/node/29241](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122070413/http:/typophile.com/node/29241 \"http://typophile.com/node/29241\")\n\n [‹ Your latest designs?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122070413/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46452 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lecture on Gaelic typography Thursday 20 November in Dublin ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122070413/http:/www.typophile.com/node/51766 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Both versions of the r are used, not sure about the c and m. In the latter, the difference is pretty subtle.\n\nJM\n\n"

The Worldcat interface I have is a bit buggy.\n\nThis image does have alts in it.\n\n[http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Zeno1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122070413/http:/www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Zeno1.jpg \"http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Zeno1.jpg\")\n\nIn the sample I see one kind of f, one kind of c, two kinds of e, one kind of g. So it’s mixed.\n\nI think that the g must be there for the same reason the p with the short descender is - to make thighter interline space possible or to solve for a interline near miss with a g above & an f below.\n\nMaybe if I contact the exiting firm I will be able to get the best answers about the intent behind these.\n\n[http://www.stamperiavaldonega.it/public/index.cfm?id=344&changeLang=2](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122070413/http:/www.stamperiavaldonega.it/public/index.cfm?id=344&changeLang=2 \"http://www.stamperiavaldonega.it/public/index.cfm?id=344&changeLang=2\")\n\nAntonio says he has some samples in use as well.\n\nHopefully this material will make it into my Atypi talk as well.\n\nThanks!\n\n"

It’s not a text setting, but a specimen of the typeface. I see that Hrant’s image linked above does have many more glyphs in it, some look like alternates to improve fitting (wide and narrow versions of the same glyphs), but some other are just stylistic alternates, like the p with the protruding spur from the lower connection of the bowl stroke to the stem.\n\n"
