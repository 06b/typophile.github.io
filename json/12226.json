Martino Mardersteig continues his father’s work, printing and publishing both handset and machine (and now computer) typeset works under the imprints of the Officina Bodoni and Stamperia Valdonega. If you want a book typeset in one of Mardersteig’s private typefaces, then you go to the Mardersteigs. The digital versions of their types are reportedly extremely good: much better than e.g. Monotype Dante.

In Adobe’s Multiple Master technology, there are a small number of (often four) master outlines present in the font, and then you can derive a vast number of instances from them by interpolation.\n\nIn ATF lingo, your “pattern master” would be called a “pattern plate,” largely because it was actually a 4” plate made of brass or tin. I’m inclined to keep using the term, because in the virtual world you need lots of metaphors.  \n<cite>Reduced relative to what?
