I did this basically in 2000, and the book   \nwas published in 2001.   \n   \nIf you're interested, there's a [huge gif here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020200213/http:/www.rcapeto.com/etc/houaiss-normal.gif) - the   \nnormal weight only, but it also shows the italic -   \nand a [small gif here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020200213/http:/www.rcapeto.com/etc/houaiss-prop.gif) showing the general scheme of   \nvertical proportions. Be aware that this face was   \ndesigned to be used at around 6-7 pts.   \n   \nPaul: thanks. I hope to put up a decent showing of   \nthat heavy sans one of these days (the PDF Hrant   \npointed to is not \"under my jurisdiction\").   \n   \nregards,   \nR\n\n"
