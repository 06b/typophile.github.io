  "content": "Here's the opening spread from Machiavelli's 1506 Decemnale (first edition.) The typeface looks to be a Jenson or a close relative thereof. I'm looking for a font that matches the look of this letterpressed text. [Fifteen36](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201145050/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/grummedia/fifteen36/) looks very promising, but I am concerned that there's no bold, italic, or small caps. I'd prefer to buy a font family that would give me the most flexibility. P22's [Mayflower](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201145050/http:/www.p22.com/sherwoodtype/mayflower.html) is a nice looking font, but I'm fairly certain I will go to hell for using a typeface from 1610 in a book about Machiavelli (1469-1527.) Plus it's not Venetian, Florentine or anything else.\n\nAny suggestions for a nice antiqued Roman font from Machiavelli's era?\n\nThanks,  \nDon\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [000002.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201145050/http:/typophile.com/files/000002.jpg) | 210.42 KB |\n\n",

The organic look of a period typeface integrates much better with my pen & ink artwork. Even the clearest line I can make with a quill pen can't match the precision of Adobe or LTC Jenson.\\*\n\n\\* well, technically, I probably could, if I were using the smoothest hot press watercolor paper or Bristol board, but in this project I'm not.\n\n"

(Thank you for the pointer, by the way) It may be the font I choose, but before I shell out for it, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a Jenson variation, I'm definitely willing to \"swing farther afield.\" It just needs to be based on a Renaissance form, and it needs to be antiqued, so it has the appearance of being printed by letterpress (like the P22 Morris you pointed out.) For example, [Telegdi](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201145050/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/telegdi.html) is another I considered, but rejected because it is _too_ distressed.\n\nThanks,  \nDon\n\n"

P22 does excellent work and I've had good luck with their fonts. I'll be using it for captions, book excerpts and written correspondence, and Operina Pro (also P22) for speech.\n\nThanks,  \nDon\n\noh yeah, and when I was in MyFonts with my credit card out I figured, well, I've already got the card out of the wallet, I might as well pick up this excellent Pacioli font. I might not use it in _Machiavelli_ but then again, I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with the chapter pages, so I wouldn't be surprised if it finds its way in there. Anyone know who designed it?\n\n"

But even here I am indebted to you, for it was in poking around P22's site that I found Operina. I had experimented with a few different type treatments before coming here, but it was your advice which helped form an critical part of _Machiavelli'_s visual style.\n\nSo thank you.\n\n—Don\n\n"
