  "content": "Hi. I just wanted to ask if any of you are familiar with this font that I've been looking for quite a long time already. I don't know what it's called. It looks like century gothic (even width of lines) with a serif, and the most distinctive letter is the capital 'O' because it has a cross in the middle. The font has this church-y, almost gothic feel to it. Hope you can help. Thanks.\n\n[http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c155/wingspread/o.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020110315/http:/i27.photobucket.com/albums/c155/wingspread/o.jpg \"http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c155/wingspread/o.jpg\")\n\n",
