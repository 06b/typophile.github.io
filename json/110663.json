  "content": "Hi,  \nsince Bohemian Coding discontinued their App Fontcase and it kept crashing(their new App Fonts really doesn’t fit me needs), I finally decided to switch to Font Explorer Pro 4 Mac in hope of long term use and less performance struggles.\n\nFirst I was a bit overwhelmed of the structure and usability compared to Fontcase. I hat to discover very early that neither merging fonts nor renaming/correcting a font’s info isn’t possible, which makes organizing your Library not essentially easier.\n\nIn Fontcase I’ve developed a method which was pretty handy to find and sort fonts very easily (I guess I’m not the only one in doing so).  \nI had very general Genres like Serif, Sans and Script and the tags defined their attributes like text, Swiss, Dutch, geometrical, rounded and so on.  \nVia Smart Collections it was very easy and fast to find a specific range of Fonts by sorting by specific Genre and Tag.\n\nSince Fontcas kept crashing while generating a Smart List I decided to change to FXP. In FXP there is the function to classify your fonts (tip: cmd+t works for multiple fonts, the first time I opened the software I thought I had to go through each individual font file) by the given Linotype Tags, which feel a bit strange for me, or even your own.  \nI thought of Themes as Tags and Categories as Genres as they were in Fontcase and maybe Usage for foundry since it isn’t possible to rename it in the file and they are not very consistent even if a font is from the same company.\n\nAfter tagging some of my fonts I wanted to try a Smart List and I encountered a huge problem to my method. It is impossible to set a specific category/usage/theme as a parameter for your list. It is only possible to mark Linotype’s Tags or your own ones in hole.  \nSo the parameter for for category would be Serif, Sans and Script at the same time and this is very unhelpful for sorting fonts effectively.\n\nI’ve been searching the internet for some time now to find a solution. The only thing in the manual is this sentence: “Classifications can be viewed in the font list and the small information panel and you can also create Smart Sets based on classifications”\n\nWriting comments seems not like a solution to me, because there isn’t a way to edit multiple Fonts at once.\n\nAm I using the software wrong, did I miss anything? Or am I not the only one struggling with this problem.\n\nThanks for your help and time,  \nJannick\n\n",
