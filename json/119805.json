  "content": "Hi all,\n\nThis is driving me a bit nuts. There's a great 3D/layered font in the new Jamie Oliver book 'Comfort Food' that isn't listed at the front of the book. Its looks pretty damn similar to Industry Inc but I can see the M is slightly different. The inline stroke in the book touches the bottom of the letter, in Industry Inc it stops short. Amongst other things, its a different font of course.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nthanks,\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [DSC\\_0632\\_.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140927000401/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0632_.jpg) | 179.08 KB |\n| [DSC\\_0633\\_.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140927000401/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0633_.jpg) | 133.43 KB |\n| [DSC\\_0635\\_.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140927000401/http:/typophile.com/files/DSC_0635_.jpg) | 174.25 KB |\n\n",
