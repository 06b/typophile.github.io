  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nWe are looking for a font to be used in a film. This film \"stars\" a computer operating system of the future.\n\nWe're looking for a font that we can use for subtitles etc, that gives the right feel - futuristic and computery, and that is also easy to read as there will be quite a lot of text.\n\nCan anyone recommend a font please?\n\nLook forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards  \nNeil\n\n",

      "content": "The problem with fonts that look futuristic and computery is they almost instantly look dated as well. Consider other fashion trends in your film: what are the characters wearing? what is the architecture like? You will likely see those trends reflected in the industrial and graphic designs too, and the computers and the OS running on them especially. Look into the speculative sci-fi of the past, consider what predictions they got wrong, since the present was the future in the past.\n\nGraphic trends often have a cycle of rebellion and conservative backlash, followed by innovation, then getting really weird, followed by rebellion in the form of conservative backlash. Or something like that. Perhaps in your speculative era extraneous ornamet will come back into fashion, and we'll see some double-serifed blackletter hybrid on the computer screens. Of course it would still have to be legible on the viewing technology of today, seeing as that is what you and your audience have available.\n\n"

Clean and sophisticated geometry, not the... traditional concept of a futuristic look, based on brutish screen fonts of yesteryear (I believe this paradox is also what Cuttlefish had in mind).\n\n"
