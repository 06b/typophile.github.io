I remember his early frustration as the work progressed and his joy as it moved to realization. I knew it was in him then and I am happy to see it out and about for the rest of the world to see. Bravo Kris and thank you Village for having the vision to see what a great contribution Kris has made to the type world.\n\nGo have a look and even a buy at:\n\n[http://vllg.com/KLIM/Feijoa/mudTyper+Weights/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004846/http:/vllg.com/KLIM/Feijoa/mudTyper+Weights/)\n\nRegards,\n\nChrisL\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321004846im_/http:/typophile.com/files/KrisBravo_4882.png)\n\n",

Pathetic.\n\nThe only reason I know my membership length is because I had to go through the password rediscovery rigmarole to write this message.\n\nWhy? The brilliance of Feijoa motivated me: the slackest of typophile readers and wannabe designers. It motivated me to post a message saying:\n\nCongratulations Kris. I am pleased to see what I always knew would happen, happen.\n\nI am also mighty thankful that I have been able to work with you since our sh\\*tty projects in first year.\n\nA mate well made.\n\nCheers,  \nAndy.\n\n"
