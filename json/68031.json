  "content": "Hello.\n\nI'm designing some panels to an exibit.  \nThe previous designer used MS Comic Sans for the photo descriptions.  \nI don't want to design the new panels much different from the existing ones, but I refuse to use MS comic Sans.  \nIs there any similar font, very close to Comic Sans but a little bit more formal?  \nA font that the client may not notice the difference at a glance.\n\nI found Chalkboard to be very close to Comic Sans, but it is still to informal.\n\nThank you.\n\njrsilva\n\n",

Either it's going to be close to Comic Sans OR it will be a bit more formal.\n\nFor something that's handwritten, I like Mark Simonson's Felt Tip family:\n\n[http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20130721013812/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html \"http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/felttiproman.html\")\n\n"
