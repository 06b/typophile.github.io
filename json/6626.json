  "content": "Greetings all. I've been asked to replicate this card, and I'm trying to pin down the fonts. The DeVinne is easy to recognize, and I think the first line is Grant Antique, but I wanted to get a second opinion. If I'm right, does anyone know where I can get it? Letterhead Fonts offers a version, but it has no lowercase. Solotype doesn't have it in digital form that I know of. If it's unavailable, does anyone have a similar font to recommend? ![Grant Antique sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050817121401im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48688.jpg)\n\n",

If you need to reproduce these exact characters, your best bet might be to redraw the just the ones you need based on this scan. The cent sign looks like it's a \"c\" from a different font.\n\n"
