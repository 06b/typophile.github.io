  "content": "Quote from P22 email:\n\n\"P22 Zaner, designed by Paul Hunt, is based on ornamental penmanship as  \ntaught by Charles Paxton Zaner at his art college at the turn of the 20th  \ncentury. The Zaner font set includes four unique fonts that complement the  \nother fonts in the set. Each font is available in PostScript and TrueType  \nformats as well as OpenType which offers even more characters, options and  \noverall functionality. Set options include PostScript and TrueType with a  \nbonus set of extras and a \"super\" pro set containing over 3,000 characters.  \nZaner is perfect for wedding invitations and documents that require a touch  \nof elegance.\"\n\n[http://www.p22.com/ihof/zanerset.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015042428/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/zanerset.html \"http://www.p22.com/ihof/zanerset.html\")\n\n",
