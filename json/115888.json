  "content": "Hello folks,  \nI felt in love with \"Antwerp\" font made by Henrik Kubel for Playtype.  \n [https://playtype.com/index.php?q=font/antwerp](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013223/https:/playtype.com/index.php?q=font/antwerp \"https://playtype.com/index.php?q=font/antwerp\")  \nBut i'm really annoyed by its \"J\". (see jpg)  \nI asked Playtype if there was a mistake.  \nI got this quick answer :  \n\"The Antwerp lowercase ‘j‘ was designed this way.  \nIt is not a mistake, in fact it helps the direction of reading and matches the ‘i’ better.  \nThere will be a future version of the Antwerp font(s) without this detail.\n\nI'd like to use that font for a book and find it more distracting then helping, as it is really unusual.\n\nMy question here is : do you know other fonts with such 'J' ?  \nOr is it a sort of trick to add a 'j' that didn't exist in the 1500s ?  \nI have to admit that knowing that form exists somewhere else at some point could help me using it.  \nI think also that if a modified version is scheduled, i'm not the only one to find the 'j' awkward. ;-)\n\nMany thanks in advance for your comments.  \nStef\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [antwerp.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150331013223/http:/typophile.com/files/antwerp.JPG) | 51.43 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "That feature (probably inspired by a particular section of the book \"Counterpunch\" by Fred Smeijers) most certainly does not help reading. Letters don't need to sit, they don't need to \"point\" in the reading direction, and making the \"j\" more like the \"i\" is the opposite of what one should do.\n\nIf they don't fix it soon, you should fix it –or get it fixed– yourself.\n\nAs for others fonts with this feature, there are some rare historic designs that have it (although AFAIR more prominent in the capital \"J\") but usually much more subtle than this.\n\nhhp\n\n"
