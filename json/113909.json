      "content": "I think it's coming along nicely, Matthew! A couple of things to consider:\n\n- there are some inconsistencies with your stroke weights, particularly in your thin strokes, such as the branching of the /m/ and the bottom branching of the /a/ and /d/ which need to be much thinner\n\n- a bit too much space in the counter of the /s/? Overall, that form doesn't carry as much weight as the other letters either, thicken it up a bit\n\n- the exit stroke of the /d/ could be a bit shorter as well\n\n- the crossbar of the /H/ and the adjoining top right loop seem to be different widths as well\n\n"
