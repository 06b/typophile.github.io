  "content": "Hey all, thought I'd throw this out there in case anyone has been down this road.\n\nA young designer I work with has chosen DIN Black all caps for a clients' corporate word mark ( I know most German designers will be shaking their heads, apologies to them...) The client has approved it and he needs to come up with a secondary sans serif typeface for the tag line. He's in a panic so I thought I'd put it out there to you all. I can't include the word mark or tag line for confidentiality reasons.\n\nAny initial thoughts or reccos are appreciated.\n\nCheers\n\n",
