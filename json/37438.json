It seems to have originated in the Seventies, but I don't know who designed it. The Letraset catalog is mum on the subject (usually they give credit). I'm pretty sure it's not related to ATF Jenson.\n\n"

Her first job, in 1972, was with Letraset International where she worked as a photographic retoucher, later moving into their type studio. Under the supervision of Bob Newman she learnt the skills of drawing type and stencil cutting, and began to design headline faces. She became involved in producing artwork for the Letraset instant lettering dry transfer sheets, and trained junior designers.\"\n\nand she has since designed Jenson Old Style bold condensed (with Colin Brignall, 1982)\n\nwodyareckon?\n\n"

Also, if she had done it for Letraset, why would they only offer two of the five weights? Finally, Letraset always gave credit in the designs they originated and included \"© Letraset\" with the credit, as they did with her Jenson Old Style Bold Condensed.\n\n"
