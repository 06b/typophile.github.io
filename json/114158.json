  "content": "Hello,  \nmy name is Krzysztof Stryjewski and I am graphic design student from Poland and I would like to tell you about my master's project - typeseeing.  \nTypeseeing is meant to be a guide, collecting voices and thoughts on local typography from different parts of the world. If I receive enough answers, this small anthology will be published and everyone whose text is included in the book will receive a copy.\n\nIf you like project's idea and want to help me, please follow the video link below.  \nI would not only like to hear from you and see yours answers in this publication, but also would be very grateful for any support or sharing news about typeseeing in the world.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.  \nKrzysztof Stryjewski / typeseeing.wordpress.com\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0GpJG5NcKE](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414182950/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0GpJG5NcKE \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0GpJG5NcKE\")  \n<iframe width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"/web/20150414182950if_/http://www.youtube.com/embed/c0GpJG5NcKE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n",
