  "content": "I am looking for a reference to the layout (could be of historical significance) of many different typefaces, various sizes, vertical and horizontal baselines. or parodies of this -- maybe on a tshirt. It has an advertisement feel. It looks kind of 70's to me. It has faces like: like cooper, vag rounded, ag oldface, berliner grotesk.   \n   \nany ideas where i can find an image of something like this?\n\n",
