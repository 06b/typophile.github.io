The \"problem\" is that many typefaces are optically balanced to compensate for the human eye's differing perception of the thicknesses of vertical and horizontal lines, meaning that often the horizontals are made slightly thinner to create the illusion that they are the same width as the verticals. So finding a font with perfectly equal horizontals and verticals might actually not be ideal, as it would not appear that way. But then again, you might already know this.\n\n"
