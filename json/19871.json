  "content": "Have you ever thought about designing your own tombstone? A morbid idea, perhaps, but something a true typophile should certainly consider as it may be the most everlasting piece you design—a sort of last business card in stone. It’s not something I necessarily thought about until nearly two years ago when I had to design one for a family member. I didn’t want to go with the standard designs and type options the monument company provided, so I asked if I could design it myself. In case you’re interested, it only requires an Illustrator/EPS file much like one you would prepare for a vinyl letter cutting machine. Everything has to be converted to outlines and you have to keep in mind how the machine works. I started by doing some research in the cemetery into which the tombstone I was doing was going to be placed. Attached are some photo that served as my primary source of reference.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [HOOD.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060618174714/http:/typophile.com/files/HOOD.jpg) | 23.79 KB |\n| [SNOW.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060618174714/http:/typophile.com/files/SNOW.jpg) | 34.41 KB |\n| [LEWIS.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060618174714/http:/typophile.com/files/LEWIS.jpg) | 32.02 KB |\n| [THOMSEN.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20060618174714/http:/typophile.com/files/THOMSEN.jpg) | 24.73 KB |\n\n",
