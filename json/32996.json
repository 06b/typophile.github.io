  "content": "Hi everyone.\n\nI'm trying to find the typeface used in this\\* great old gum wrapper for a friend.  \nMy guess is that I won't find the specific type, with it's quirky spirals, but if you can point me toward the root font of this face I'd appreciate it.\n\n\\* [http://www.victoryseeds.com/candystore/images/adams/blackjack\\_70s.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020161627/http:/www.victoryseeds.com/candystore/images/adams/blackjack_70s.JPG \"http://www.victoryseeds.com/candystore/images/adams/blackjack\\_70s.JPG\")\n\nI'm looking for the main \"Black Jack\" face, not the sans serif, though that is a really nice one too.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n\n-JB\n\n",

[Edison](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020161627/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/edison-swirl-sg/?refby=typographica) has your swirls, but it's a very different style of face.\n\n"

I linked to the Red Rooster version, but there's one from pretty much any foundry that has done a Bodoni.\n\nI'm sure a revival of this style is coming very soon, and then you will be drowning in alternatives.\n\nSean Glenn  \nArt Director  \n [www.superunicorn.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141020161627/http:/www.superunicorn.com/ \"www.superunicorn.com\")\n\n"
