This means that the proportions of the text sizes have been preserved, and the tendency to pare down hairlines and to prettify serifs and other detail work has been firmly resisted. Also, this version contains only what Mr. Baskerville himself wrote: Roman, italic and small caps– no anachronistic boldface.\n\nFigures are lowercase or 'ranging' text figures of course. Those who occasionally need uppercase or 'lining' figures will however find them in the small cap font . Roman and italic ligature fonts are available, as the period design makes these not only desirable, but actually necessary.\n\n**External Links**  \n [Baskerville 1757](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328232255/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/baskerville1757.asp) at [Fountain](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328232255/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Fountain)  \n [Baskerville 1757](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328232255/http:/www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FT.118653.0.0) at [FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150328232255/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontShop)\n\n",
