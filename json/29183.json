The S is not an exact match. It does not resemble Gill Sans.\n\n“PHILIPS” I would guess is custom lettering. It also does not resemble Gill Sans.\n\nHowever! “Sense...” really is [Gill Sans Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511185045/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.52.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=sense+and+simplicity&sampleSize=32).\n\nSkylar\n\n"

I’m asked to find samples of Gill Sans still used today, but apparently I’m not doing so swell on the logos. I’m just starting out with my design classes, so I’m not fully aware of each typeface. Apparently, to me, they look similar to Gill Sans but I guess they are not. Much help appreciated.\n\nIs this logo Gill Sans?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090511185045im_/http:/typophile.com/files/united%20colors_5972.jpg)\n\n"
