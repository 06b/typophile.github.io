  "content": "Okey, I'm creating a logo for a research project of mine. It can be described as _a xml-based markup standard for defining graphical user interfaces_. The technology name/acronym is XUG, which means, roughly, \"XML Graphical User Interface Language for Games\". It's kinda like HTML, but for game interfaces.\n\nThe general idea is that I wanted something that looks simple and modular. It's not a commercial project, and not something for large database applications, so I don't want anything bussiness-like - it has to be a bit fresh.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019105707im_/http:/typophile.com/files/xug_logo_5311.png)\n\nThe use of red/green/blue is kinda obvious, since it's a technology for defining the appearance of stuff on screen.\n\nThe glyphs are meant to be very simplistic and, again, very modular. The \"G\" is meant to look like an arrow circling - one of the main features of the technology is the ability to have animations/transitions done easily, so I wanted to give a little hint of that on the logo.\n\nIs it too cliché? I know these blocks around the letters is probably overused, but I can't remember of any similar logo right now. Can anyone remember a good example that will force me to change that?\n\nAnd what do you guys think overall - does it have too much space between the blocks? Are the glyphs too heavy?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

Quite possibly worse :)\n\n"

      "content": "I like it. Fresh colors, simple yet sturdy, and I get the modularity thing you mentioned.\n\nMaybe the blocks could be more close, I think it's a little too wide now. And the G is too thick; the arrow tends to 'dissappear' now.\n\n"

      "content": "Good strong idea, agree with the others that the letters probably need to be slightly less thick so you can make the arrow on the \"G\" clearer. Like the symbolism of it, it's appropriate yet rather subtle. Love the simplicity.\n\nMaybe tweak the colors around a bit, try making them less saturated or try a couple of different color schemes, perhaps even different shades of the same color.\n\n"

      "content": "I like it.\n\nThough I agree with Jon that I would expect to see this logo in a toy store or on baby-care products. It's got huge child-appeal (or, parents of young children-appeal?)\n\nI like the colours. Given your explanation, they make a lot of sense.\n\nI agree with Tiff about the 'roundness'.\n\nI think it's a good logo. But I would love to see what Jon's tweaks do to it. Mostly out of curiousity.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, guys. Good suggestions so far; it all makes sense and I'll review it based on these accounts.\n\nThe child-like appearance was bugging me too; it's good to see it's not just me. I think I'll still go with R/G/B, but tweak it a bit to make it less saturated - just a bit more serious.\n\nSpacing and positioning has to be tweaked too. Funny that some stuff started to bug me just because it was mentioned and I wasn't seeing it before. :)\n\nThanks again!\n\n"
