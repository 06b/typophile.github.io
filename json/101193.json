What do you guys think? What should I recommend? Any other font you'd recommend instead?\n\nHe's requested two options:\n\nMongolian Baiti with Copperplate Gothic Bold\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418203058im_/http:/typophile.com/files/A_6469.png)\n\nor\n\nFelix Titling with Copperplate Gothic Bold\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418203058im_/http:/typophile.com/files/B_4954.png)\n\n",
