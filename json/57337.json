  "content": "There’s this British band called Travis that uses this interesting sans-serif font. The “A” & “V” tend to bend into one another. And the “T”/”H” interact interestingly as well. I’m not sure if they’re just using an italicized version or not, but I’d really like to identify what font it is that they use. Here’s a few links to google images:\n\n[http://www.galeon.com/allmusic/caratulas/t/Travis-The\\_Invisible\\_Band-Fro...](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503105915/http:/www.galeon.com/allmusic/caratulas/t/Travis-The_Invisible_Band-Frontal.jpg \"http://www.galeon.com/allmusic/caratulas/t/Travis-The\\_Invisible\\_Band-Frontal.jpg\")  \n [http://images.coveralia.com/audio/t/Travis-The\\_Man\\_Who-Frontal.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090503105915/http:/images.coveralia.com/audio/t/Travis-The_Man_Who-Frontal.jpg \"http://images.coveralia.com/audio/t/Travis-The\\_Man\\_Who-Frontal.jpg\")\n\nI’d really appreciate the help identifying the font.\n\nThanks!\n\n",
