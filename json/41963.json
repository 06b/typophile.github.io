I was busy with a Photoshop design contest (I got both my entries in the finals - w00t!).\n\nAnyway, a friend of mine would like to know what the title font is being used on [this site](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704192937/http:/www.teamxray.com/teamxray/m_intro.php?Xnet_Session=051b674349aa40b1cb9bdc109f5296c3). Like, for instance, “M18TPRO”, “COLUMN #15”, and “MULTI-FLEX”.\n\nThanks.\n\n [‹ (x) George's Greek Cafe - various {gang}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704192937/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41969 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [designed to help book | which font is that? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704192937/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41910 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
