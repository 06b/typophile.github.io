As far as i can see it isn’t a typeface done by Dalton Maag but i could be possibly very wrong. I couldn’t find anything related online as well.

We initially supplied various typographical routes with the one currently in use being crafted to work well in different sizes and applications. The most challenging aspect was to ensure that the type works well on the curve of the logo._\n\n"

Assuming it’s custom I think I’ll go with Barmeno, nice alternative. Thanks again guys.\n\n"

It was a bit tough to make it work on an arch but it was finalized then made into an eps file in Illustrator from the letters made in Fontographer I believe since it was before FontLab might have been finished.\n\nI was trying to pick-up how they wanted to round off the logo and the way they changed the inner holes of the globe.\n\n"
