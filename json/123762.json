  "content": "Some time ago while reading Müller-Brockmann's _Grid Systems_ I came across a lettered list that skipped the letter 'J'. At the time I thought it was just a typo, but I've just read Jan Tschichold's essay \"Consistent Correlation Between Book Page and Type Area\" and there's also a list that skips 'J'. Googling turned out nothing so, so I'm hoping someone here might provide some insight on why it's done this way in (at least) Swiss German.\n\n",

      "content": "The letter \"J\" was only relatively recently distinguished from \"I\". In Fraktur in particular, the capital I and J are often very similar or identical, so it might cause confusion to distinguish them in indexing. Here's a reference specific to German:  \n [http://feefhs.org/guides/German\\_Gothic.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322035232/http:/feefhs.org/guides/German_Gothic.pdf \"http://feefhs.org/guides/German\\_Gothic.pdf\")\n\nIn general, it seems like this was also once a more widespread practice based off of the Latin Alphabet; see page 186 of the following:  \n [http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC\\_1959/Prop021.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322035232/http:/www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1959/Prop021.pdf \"http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC\\_1959/Prop021.pdf\")\n\nPossibly related, the U.S. Library of Congress classification scheme uses only J and not I. It does distinguish U and V however, so the reason for not including I might be simply to avoid confusion with 1.\n\n"

      "content": "In German the ambiguity of I and J remained longer than in other areas where the Latin script was used. In blackletter fonts I and J weren’t differentiated at all until the 19th century. And in turn for Roman fonts, people often also didn’t feel a need for clear differentiation. So they rather used a J-like design to represent an I – which could otherwise be mistaken for a lowercase l. (See riccard0’s link)  \nTschichold didn’t like that at all. And regarding the I and J in blackletter he had a traditional view and hated the development of making a different design of blackletter I and J. So to him, the existence of a differentiation was directly connected to the type style.\n\n"
