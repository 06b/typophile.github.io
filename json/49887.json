I want the lettering to be white and the surrounding color to be that blue (well really, I want the surrounding color to be transparent, but the specific blue will do). I don’t know if it can be done and I don’t have a lot of money. I’ve tried to locate the exact font, but to no avail. The “e” and the “r” are never correct. Avant garde gothic pro book is the closest I’ve been able to come.\n\nI understand that all you designers out there will rate this logo bad to poor. Regardless, I’m stuck with it for the meantime. Sorry.\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated,\n\nCameron\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080927033740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_6510.JPG)\n\n [‹ What kind of Times...?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080927033740/http:/typophile.com/node/49895 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Bold for Asian Fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080927033740/http:/typophile.com/node/49882 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
