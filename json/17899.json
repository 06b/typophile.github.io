      "content": "What about placing the broken part down in the lower right-hand corner, like you did with the u? With the V and the W, there's something at cap height on the left hand to help identify the letter, so the right hand side can have the broken part without sacrificing too much in legibility. With J, there's nothing else at cap height for the eye to latch on to, so it looks (to me) like it the brokenness interrupts the visual rhythm you've established. I think it works much better on the 1, though.\n\n--Jim K.\n\n"
