      "content": "Hi, Siaron,\n\nI read the info about your book on the **mbp** site... Sounds like an interesting project! Did it begin as a student thesis? I ask because some other recent design books had their genesis in student theses. Off the top of my head, I can think of [_Mexican Blackletter_](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821092332/http:/www.markbattypublisher.com/servlet/book_view?number=40), [_Parallel Strokes_](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821092332/http:/www.parallelstrokes.com/), [_Fraktur, Mon Amour_](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821092332/http:/www.fraktur-mon-amour.de/en/), and [_The Ten Commandments of Typography/Type Heresy_](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821092332/http:/www.amazon.com/Ten-Commandments-Typography-Type-Heresy/dp/1858943558/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233809292&sr=1-1) (and I'm sure there are others).\n\nSee also the _Mexican Blackletter_ thread, here on Typophile:\n\n[http://www.typophile.com/node/17496](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821092332/http:/www.typophile.com/node/17496 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/17496\")\n\nI agree with Yehan's comment... Are you allowed to post some spreads? :-)\n\n"
