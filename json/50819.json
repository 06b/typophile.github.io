Is there any (good) freeware? any demo versions?\n\nthanks in advance, and enjoy your day!\n\nChriggy\n\n",

      "content": "If price is your concern (as I imagine from you asking for freeware), there's a few budget options:  \n- [Typelight](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017035613/http:/www.cr8.netfirms.com/typelight.html) is a super simple freeware font editor, that will let you do all the basics.  \n- [FontForge](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017035613/http:/fontforge.sourceforge.net/) is an open source font editor, from what I understand, has quite a lot of features, but is also not straightforward to install on windows.  \n- [Type 2.2](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017035613/http:/www.cr8.netfirms.com/type.html#header) is typelight older brother, with loads more features. You can buy it for €46.00 EUR (approx US $65)  \n- [FontCreator](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017035613/http:/www.high-logic.com/fontcreator.html)is another shareware editor, you can buy a home/professional licence for $79/$149  \n-And finally, [Typetool](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017035613/http:/www.fontlab.com/font-editor/typetool/) is Fontlab's younger brother, with less features but still a quite robust font editor. It's $99\n\n"

      "content": "It's too bad that the FontLab people don't make a demo of Fontographer 4.7 for Mac.\n\nIt's really a much cleaner, and intuitive (easy to understand) interface. I used it professionally for over two decades, and do not see the great advantage of FontLab, besides the fact the industry now expects it to be ones primary tool.\n\nI really hope the FontLab people develop it into a 5th version (Fontographer 5) and add basic OpenType support and better integration with Adobe Illustrator (one used to simply option-cut and option-paste from each other).\n\nEven if they jacked up the price to FontLab's level, I'd pay it, like thousands of others who prefer Fontographer to FontLab.\n\n(Don't get me wrong: FontLab has some really great sophisticated features, so the pros would need both.)\n\n"

FontLab bought Fontographer (their biggest threat), and made it run under System 10. Wow. Great. Will they dare to take it further?\n\nIf the FontLab people addressed all the concerns people expressed are lacking currently in Fog (as it's known), it would be their flagship, and FontLab would be reserved for us type geeks.\n\nIf they sat with their Excel speadsheet, they would see that with a higher priced Fog 5, they'd have their cake and eat it too. And Adam would have twice as much to do!\n\n"

      "content": "\\> FontLab bought Fontographer  \n\\> (their biggest threat)\n\nI never considered Fontographer being a threat for FontLab simply because Macromedia stopped doing any work on it (including marketing) in 1996. When I was looking for my first tool for type design in 1997, I had some experience with Fontographer but I felt it was on its dying verge, so I decided to buy FontLab (version 3.0 at that point). I ended up being hired by the company seven years later, and all that time I did not see much movement on Fontographer, and I actually gave up on it.\n\nIt was Macromedia that approached FontLab with the idea that we should buy Fontographer off them before they merge with Adobe. In fact, we were quite surprised by this. I think Macromedia felt that within Adobe Fontographer will follow the fate of FontStudio and FontChameleon (all tools thaken over by Adobe and removed from the market). Font editors is just too small a market for a giant for Adobe, and was also too small for Macromedia when the company grew rapidly due to the enormous success of Flash.\n\nSo please be assured that we did not consider Fontographer a \"threat\". But of course we did see a value in acquiring it: we wanted to learn from the best practices of the application, have access to some of the best algorithms, and reconnect with the existing customers.\n\nAnd yes, we do have plans to continue Fontographer, but it's too early for me to talk about it publicly.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nproduct and marketing manager  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"
