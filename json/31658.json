This face is (perhaps) the first [neohumanist](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/neohumanist) [slab serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/slab%20serif), with a true slab serifed [italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060111/http:/typophile.com/wiki/italic) to match. The italic is based on renaissance parameters, meaning it slopes at 5°. This face is a graceful and sturdy slab serif, useful for various applications.\n\n**External Links:**  \n [PMN Caecilia at Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060111/http:/www.linotype.com/1313/pmncaecilia-family.html)  \n [PMN Caecilia at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060111/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=PMN%20Caecilia)  \n [PMN Caecilia and TheSerif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023060111/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/197268636/in/set-81960/)\n\n",
