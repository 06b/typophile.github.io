  "content": "hello type people,\n\ni am just about to write a long research paper about country identity within type, and will be focusing on french typography. I want to show that different countries do have an identity with type and show that a country can be reflected with type.\n\ni think its hoopefully going to be about 6000-8000 words long.\n\ni am finding resources quite scarce though and was wondering if anyone knows of any good books i should check out aimed at this general topic, any articles in magazines... ANYTHING that would help me to write a good research paper on french typography and identity.\n\ni have just got back from paris!. i took myself there so that i could get a good look first hand and french typography, but yea i do understand that the rest of france might be quite different but yea i got a taste for it at least!.\n\nanyways so any help would be much appreciated ok CHEERS!  \nfrom  \nMark\n\n",

Surely Detroit=America, not Volkswagen!  \nIf you go with material from the books Mark, you will be discussing country identity in pre-defined terms, i.e. by what those authors have chosen.\n\nFor comparison, how would you write a history of Hollywood movies?  \nWould the films you discuss be taken from a list of Oscar winners?  \nFrom a list of Golden Globe winners?  \nFrom a list of the top-grossing movies of each year?  \nOr the most watched movies, taking into account TV re-runs?  \nOr the most written-about movies, the canon of literature about the movies?\n\n"

At the risk of stating the obvious, _any_ history, research paper, etc., is going to be subjective, because its author has to make choices about what to show and what to leave out, among other things. And then there is the author's stance, the paper's thesis, etc. (I'm saying such obvious things that it hurts. Sorry.)\n\n_Right away we see that the ads in question must be “creative” to be considered worthy of history._\n\nOr, perhaps it's just that Krone's ads broke away from what was typical. That's what I was taught, at least. They are in the history books because they focused on the VW's supposed disadvantage (smallness) rather than an advantage -- unheard of back then! And because they represented a major shift in how things were done (think of that scene in _Helvetica_ where Michael Bierut compares the 1950s and 1960s ads in \"Life\" magazine). But I see your point, Nick: the other ads were representative of American advertising, too -- up until then.\n\n_If you go with material from the books Mark, you will be discussing country identity in pre-defined terms_\n\nBooks are just a starting point, but what else can a student do?

(Just finished reading Gombrich's _A Little History of the World_ -- so that particular history has been on my mind.)\n\nAnd you make it sound like the only kind of art director and graphic designer who would buy a design history book is blinded by \"the award-winning stuff.\" Some designers buy design history books to learn what came before, ya know. :-)\n\n_What best represents national identity: the mainstream of design as it exists in the mass media, or the minority tastes of the design community?_\n\nI think it's more complicated than that... For instance, look at what Gerald said: \"One could certainly say that the history of the development of typography certainly had nationalistic tendencies right up to about mid-twentieth century.\" So you also have to take historical changes into account.\n\nYou would probably need to tackle this question from many angles to get an ample view of the [insert country name here] identity in type.\n\n"

The western world is becoming a popular lifestyle choice. Things in some ways, from a diverse style point of view, seem to be merging. well thats how i see things in my mind anyways.\n\nnow from a typographical point of view i think i will talk about the whole modern type and try and see if there is any information out there, about what people think style holds for future typefaces, what with the whole Eu seemingly trying to become one, will this mean the \"brand\" of Eu, and cross over of styles, means that a national identity for a said country will be lost... these are just all my own thoughts i figured i would write how my mind thinks on the topic, its not an introduction to the essey or anything just be blabbling.. haha madness!! ahhh\n\ni need to do a lot more research to clearly understand what take im going for in the essey, so yea i will be doing a lot more research,, this stage of finding me resources before i start really looking at stuff has prooved really great though... and yea much appreciate everyones help!!! this is such a great website full of amazingly knowledgeable people.\n\nHA books arrived just as i finished typing this!!

      "content": "Hello there\n\nAfter years of lurking here I am, to kick in the beehive I'm afraid.\n\nI am french, and I think that you can't seriously link type with national identity. In all these years, cultures always interpenetrated each other, and economical aspects also contributed in the fast propagation of specific styles - Didot and Walbaum making copies of the super successful Bodoni for example, thus bringing a very italian style in France and Germany. If you show a Bodoni-like typeface to some french guy now, He'll say it looks very french. and He will be right: Didot, Bodoni and Walbaum have been extensively used over here, thanks to Balzac, Voltaire, Knapp or Appeloig. Show it to some american ladies and they will recognize it as extremely north american, thanks to the logo of Harper's Bazaar. The Roman inspired Trajan reminds instantly of Hollywood Blockbusters today. The use or overuse of a typeface contributes to its unconscious gegraphical identity, not its actual point of origin on earth. Thanks to Apple, Garamond looks american when condensed, though it can also be considered very french. Frakturs always look somewhat german, until you show them to some Harvard or Cambridge student. And today's types, especially modern humanistic lineales, are just, thanks to Internet, completely \"apatrides\": they belong to the whole planet. Of course come typefaces just seem to stick to a specific country, like Mistral... But these are really very few.\n\nYou are lucky I am not in the jury when you show off your study, for I absolutely disagree with you :-)\n\nWell, that was my point of view,  \nDavid R\n\n"

(I'm currently assembling an [exhibition on national identity and modern type design](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415222725/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36998).) From my perspective, a typeface isn't necessarily \"French\" because it was designed in France or by somebody with French ancestry, or used more than others in France - I'm more interested in why types have been associated with France in historical discussions. To put it in a different (and perhaps only more confusing) way, I'm interested in \"French\" types, not French types. (So I guess I'd defend a link of type design and national identity, but by pointing to what David R just called \"its unconscious geographical identity, not its actual point of origin on earth.\")\n\nI believe that what needs to be recognized is that national identity is a cultural construction - but is no less real or important for that. I think this is the way identity works. I might liken it to discussions of race: as I understand it, \"race\" doesn't really exist, genetically speaking, and yet it would be hard to say \"race doesn't matter\" socially.\n\nAnother example: when I moved to the Twin Cities, I looked for housing in both western Minneapolis and eastern St. Paul (separated by the Mississippi). While I was househunting, locals seemed to always ask in which city my search was happening - as if it would be weird to look in both, rather than \"declaring my allegiance\" to becoming a Minneapolitan or a St. Paulite first. This struck me as ridiculous at first - could it really make a difference whether I was on one side of the river or not? - but I have come to realize that the fiction of difference between the two cities, because it is held by a good number of residents, actually does shape the culture of each. It isn't an \"objective\" difference, but there is a cultural difference.\n\nOh, and this  \n_Writers and speakers who embrace both the existence, provisionality and provenance of their point of view have my respect and keep me reading & listening_  \nis beautifully put!\n\n"

I am not willing to toss out cultural analysis ( as opposed to glyph analysis ) as long as it is moderately rigorous. Succumbing to a mythic or sloppily romantic view happens all the time though; a quick look at many student queries about 'National qualities' in type on this board will quickly show that. So I can am sympathetic to Nick's instinct to be suspicious. Still, it sounds like you are up to the task Craig!\n\nI also agree with Nick that an analytical approach to the glyphs themselves and they way they were used is something that we don't see enough of. Certainly more of that would go a long way to putting the myths down and increasing our understanding & appreciation.\n\n"

If we only recognize myths as constituting identity, we will continue to live in a primitive dream world.\n\nIf you're going to mess with nationalism, why not recognize French typography as it is practised, rather than as it is imagined?\n\nThe reason why that approach isn't happening: it's hard work collecting and analyzing data, and boring for those in the humanities, especially when they have to deal with the quotidian stuff, with no opportunity to wax lyrical about the award winning work of design heroes.\n\n"

I think that the complete avoidance of engagement Myth or perhaps better put 'story making' is simply not available in human thought. Story making is where insights and theory come from. Insights can be pounded into a theory which can be pounded on with evidence. But plain data without interpretation is essentially unusable.\n\nBut all this discussion of intellectual frameworks may not be the deal way of pushing foreward on it's own. Maybe it would be better to suggest a model of study that you would like to see done.\n\nFor instance I would be semi-interested to know what fonts feel 'french' and by what degree to people broken out by font, and by specific city/region and in multiple countries with lots of datapoints. Likewise it would be interesting to take discreet features of a single typeface say serifs maybe and see if they are seen as more or less 'french' in association as the feature changes. I suspect that what would be chased in both cases is a false phatasm. But... Sorry these are just examples and don't reflect a serious interest in the idea of National type.

Day mentions the quantitative type-use surveys done by W. Harold Butler in _Advertising Weekly_ from 1928, and his own analysis of types in the International Book Exhibition of the National Book League in the 1950s, where he compares the preferences of different countries.\n\nA recent work built on a firm statistical foundation (not about typography, but very relevant to it) is William St Clair's astonishing _The Reading Nation in the Romantic Period._\n\n"

      "content": "Sorry guys for joining this discussion so late, but I am heavily stuck in this topic. I am the guy Florian Hardwig introduced and I spent quite some time on such a french topic.\n\nIn my opinion, the very first thing is to seperate form from usage. What I found out was, that there is a pretty distinctive french way of contributing certain roles or functions to different sorts of letterforms (Caps, minuscules, scripts). It is rather the uage (connected to cultural ideas of beauty and appropriateness) than the shapes of the letters that makes the french twist in daily life signage. And that's the very important next point: please consider the difference between type as lead typography and lettering. In my opinon, the national identity thing rather relates to lettering than to type in the narrower sense.\n\nI disagree with the statistical approach though. The fonts most used in Germany today are Times New Roman, Arial and Comic Sans. I would make a bet that you'd get similar results for northern America, France and, say, Andorra. What does this tell about national identity ? Nothing. Would you choose these to design something, say, andorrian ? No.\n\nTake a look on french packaging of the 19th century and compare it to contemporary products. You will find consistencies and differences in layout principles, ornament and lettering and you will find that some sorts of products are closer to the graphical tradition than others. Wine bottles will want to refer to it, medical products won't.\n\nThe best-selling charts of contemporary foundries won't give you a clue either, as these are extremely influenced by the 500 biggest enterprises of Europe and the USA who will for the biggest part have adopted a sans serif type that is \"neat\", \"clean\" and \"neutral\" in a way not to refer to a specific country. Most of them will have a mid-tone or dark blue somewhere in their corporate design...\n\nThe question, wether culture is a construct (myth) or not seems meaningless to me as it is real in a way that people like to believe in it and by education make sure that this believing is transported from one generation to the next. Never the less it is possible to accept and appreciate culture and still regard it with some sort of scientific, cool distance. Humanities is a discipline of discussing and rediscussing constructs over the centuries without ever coming to the point of having a clear, reliable result. It tells as much about us than about our ancestry and future generations will enjoy to get a picture of us when they will read what we thought about, let's say Andorra in the 17th century.\n\nIt was already mentioned before, and I agree that the nationality of specific designers is less important. I think what is important is to find out who were their teachers, what school of spirit the adhered to and what general spirit ruled the period they worked in. French designers arround Maximilien Vox thought of Helvetica gestaltung as a major threat for the french graphic culture. German designers of the same 50s/60s period thought of it as liberation from the nationalistic and mystical traps Germans had been running into. The same typeface has a very different meaning. By the way: the swiss school was very influential in post-war France too, so you will always have to consider wether the designer was on the \"swiss\" side or the \"french\" side.\n\nThis whole subject is far to big to be handled in an online forum. It's great to have it going, I enjoy reading all the different opinions. Maybe there should be a congress on that soon !\n\n"
