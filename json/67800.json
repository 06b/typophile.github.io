Modern Suite is a great font package, very complete and with fine numbers. Nick pays attention to details and have a deep historical knowledge.\n\nI don't think it's old'ish – almost all fashion magazines adopt modern typefaces, for example. And Figgins has real italics, adding flexibility to text composition. But of course it may not work in the design you're planning.  \n.\n\n<cite>Utopia is nice, pitty there is no sans.</cite>\n\nIt works very well with Myriad/Frutiger. For me, the major problem in Utopia is the lacking of small caps in italics.\n\nCeleste is another superfamily you may find good for this job.\n\nThe serif family I'm developing ( [http://www.typophile.com/node/67787](http://web.archive.org/web/20150424141613/http:/www.typophile.com/node/67787 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/67787\")) also aims to be suitable for texts with many numbers. But it's just an essay by now.\n\n"
