The A, the R and the G are very typicals.  \nI've found a font named \"Hector rounded bold\" wich is realy similar but a little bit too rounded.\n\nCould you help me ?  \nThank's a lot.\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Garage gothic bold \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062443/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [photo.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062443/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_43.JPG) | 168.71 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "\"The A, the R and the G are very typicals.\"  \nIt would have been helpful if you had included an image. My idea of a typical R-- straight leg -- & G might differ from yours.  \nI found an R from the book title, vertical leg with a kick at the base of the leg.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062443im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LichtensteinTypophile112377_5196.jpg)\n  \nAnd possibly a G, seems to be part of the same font but I can't be certain.  \nAnyway size is small and details are obscure.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317062443im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LichtensteinTypophile112377B_5845.jpg)\n  \nIf the labels inside the book are the same as the title, i.e. with an R with a kick at the base of the leg, then I think it would be something something other than Garage Gothic.  \nAlso, it would be helpful if we could see a larger scale image of G and if Q appears in the book, that as well.  \nDon \n"
