The only difference is that the stroke endings of Helvetica Rounded are rounded rather than squared. The overall effect of this display type is more playful than its traditional relative. The original Helvetica design was created for the Haas Type foundry in Switzerland and further developed by the Stempel Type foundry and by Linotype. Based on earlier Grotesque designs, Helvetica brought a new level of mathematical accuracy to the sans serif genre. Helvetica™ is a trademark of Linotype Corp. registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and may be registered in certain other jurisdictions in the name of Linotype Corp. or its licensee Linotype GmbH.\n\n",
