I'm interested to know the names, locations, and dates.\n\nThere is an entry on Wikipedia under 'Spread of Printing', and there are some maps in Elizabeth Eisenstein's 'The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe', but I'd like to cross-reference them with alternatives, online or off.\n\nThanks  \nWilliam\n\n",

So it covers printers, scribes, typefounders, printers, publishers, and book sellers, and does a thoroughly good job to explaining the relationships among the persons and technologies involved.\n\n"

      "content": "Don, I have found further evidence that the Wikipedia list is incomplete, and arguably inaccurate. Ken, I know the Updike tomes, and they are good. Charles, I've ordered your suggestion. Thanks to all of you.\n\nAt present I am going through the British Library record of incunabulae at St Brides. But this will require some padding out I think. The BL record contains all the books they hold, in chronological (and then city) order - but doesn't include anything they don't hold.\n\nI would welcome any other suggestions.\n\n"
