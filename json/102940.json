  "content": "I am looking into purchasing the most “complete” Goudy family (SC, OSF, Blackletter, &c.) that is closest to the original which pairs well with Goudy Sans. I’d opt for a larger family that meets the afore mentioned criteria over an “authentic” version with a single style.\n\nI have found many options, but it’s the authenticity/complete family/pairs with sans tradeoff that I am struggling with.\n\nVersions with a Web option would be ideal.\n\nMy short list at this point is:\n\n[Goudy font family](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415081241/http:/www.linotype.com/497/Goudy-family.html)  \n [ITC Goudy Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415081241/http:/www.fonts.com/font/itc/itc-goudy-sans#product_top)\n\nSuggestions?\n\n",

Steve Matteson has revived some Goudy fonts; you can see the links [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415081241/http:/www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/SteveMatteson/). And Font Bureau's [Californian](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415081241/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/CalifornianFB/) has had various hands reviving its weights, including Carol Twombly and David Berlow. And Berlow did Goudy's [Village](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415081241/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Village/). Tony Stan's [ITC Berkeley](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415081241/http:/www.linotype.com/580/ITCBerkeleyOldStyle-family.html) us another, softer take on Goudy's California Old Style.\n\nLanston's Goudy Old Style has the option of the original full descenders, which is nice. I think Typophiler Paul Hunt had a hand in the Lanston Goudy revivals, but I'm not sure. The Font Bureau's versions have tons of weights and styles.\n\nThe quality varies at lot—including among Goudy's originals!— so sorting through these will take a while. I haven't done it.\n\n"

      "content": "I've worked with very few Goudy types. I'm not a fan. I admire Scripps College Old Style, and to a lesser extent Californian, but that's about it. This isn't to say that I don't recognise his importance or understand why some of my colleagues are such big fans. And I do appreciate Goudy's insistence on controlling the production process, of not only designing but cutting and casting his own type. In this respect he is the fore-runner of all of us who make our own digital fonts. But most of Goudy's types are not to my taste.\n\n"

      "content": "I think I remember Erik Spiekermann, who I think likes Goudy, saying that Goudy Sans is 'over designed'. By that I think he means that it is so assertive and has so much personality and individual quirks that its use is restricted. Personally, I think it can look great in some settings by itself, but I'm skeptical about it 'playing well with others.' Because of the slanted crossbar on the e, you might try some of Goudy's many faces with slanted crossbars on the e, such as Deepdene.\n\n"
