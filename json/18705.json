I would be ever so grateful as it is for a project which has this coming Friday as deadline.\n\nThank you all!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [CarolinaHerrera.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013134402/http:/typophile.com/files/CarolinaHerrera.JPG) | 3.15 KB |\n\n",

Again, great work all around, just dotting the 'i's and crossing the 't's. :^)\n\n"

I might even be brave enough to post the result.\n\nCheers!  \nW.\n\n"
