      "content": "It really depends on how much and the type of copy you are trying to fit, however, I would recommend that you don’t try any of the substitution methods, keep it as much like as any other copy you want to be read, you can reduce the word spaces slightly, but anything else will reduce the usability. Try keeping it left aligned with the right ragged with as few hyphens as possible, if there is a lot (a page for example) use columns rather than a long measure. When you mention printer settings are you trying to print this using a laser printer? I have achieved fairly satisfactory results with both these faces at 5.5 on 6.5pts, but bear your audience in mind.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/condensed-no-18/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070311000614/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/condensed-no-18/)\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bell-centennial/](http://web.archive.org/web/20070311000614/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/bell-centennial/)\n\nTim\n\n"
