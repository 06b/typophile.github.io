In the ’hugs’ and ’UoW’ examples it looks great, less so in the other two.\n\nBy the way Jos can I ask what your commercial model is? Not that I have any complaints about your giving out fonts free:) It’s great, but I’m just curious how it works.\n\n"

I worked full time as an art director and type was (just) a hobby and I was happy to be able to cover my expenses with the donation I got/get.\n\nBecause I’ve become well known as ’free quality font foundry’ and because my site traffic has grown exponentially (nearly one million pageviews and half a million visitors this year) I’ve decided to make a change this year. I now work a day less per week so I’ve an extra day for doing type. The first (partial) commercial font I’ll release will be [MUSEO](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706090059/http:/exljbris.wordpress.com/2007/06/03/museo). I’ll sell the 100 and 900 weight for a small amount and the other three weights will be free. I’ve no idea how it will work out, but I’m counting on my numbers :-)\n\n"

It’s the Arial next to it that spoils it a bit :)\n\n“My commercial model...”\n\nThanks for sharing that. I’m sure Museo would be a resounding success and enable you to keep working the way you currently are.\n\n"
