Check your SMTP server settings in Mail Preferences and verify any advanced settings with your system administrator.   \n-----------------------------------------------   \n   \nThe address is correct and so are the SMPT settings.   \n   \nThanks for any help,   \nDavid.\n\n",

Though i have never noticed if i had to check mail first, do you mean I actually have to click on the mail \"to check\" because i get alot of junk and just delete such mails. This is all just on my laptop so I am not connected to a server, when I connect to the internet I open mail it checks for new mails from an account I have with an email provider and some mails I hit reply, type my message and that error appears.\n\n"
