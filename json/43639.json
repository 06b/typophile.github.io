The very first thing that caught my eye, however, was the lack of eyes on the dog. I just kept seeing it as a symbol of blindness. Maybe its supposed to be a silhouette but being outlined gives a different effect. The type placement in relation to the image seems a bit tricky, but probably not far off.\n\nStephen Rapp\n\n"

I might try getting rid of the stroke on the dog and spacing out the legs to make the shape stronger. I might also change the dog so that it is panting or something, just so that it isn’t faceless like Stephen said. ;D good coprorate colors.\n\n"
