      "content": "I would consider both of the commentaries from Loren and Mike. Perhaps, rather than changing the color or weight of the \"L's\" you can just make sure that they are in the same style as the roof and foundation (\"rough\" in your existing design). I apologize for not having the time to do even a quick search for you right now, but you might be able to find a font for the whole \"building letters\" title that would match (i.e. same style) the roof and foundation well. Good luck...I'm anxious to see what you come up with. You have a good foundation (no punn intended) to start from.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

It may still need a little refinement (i.e. Loren's comments), but you're heading in the right direction.   \n   \nAn interesting observation is that the \"t's\" have a slant resembling a roof top. I'm not sure if this is good (perhaps another direction can be explored) or bad (it may be noticable to others and distracting). I don't know\n\n"
