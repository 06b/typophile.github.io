      "content": "Note that the serif is bracketed, i.e. the linking stroke between the stem and the square serif is curved. This letterform is named after the Clarendon Press, where it was used from the mid-19th century onwards. Robert Besley is usually given credit for the design. A vast number of Clarendon variations have been designed since then.  \nI would describe the book title font as something like Clarendon Black Narrow Condensed. Don't know what you mean as an \"old\" book cover but the letters it may be something from the font photo composition era. The treatment in the title pushes the limits of how far whitespace can be squeezed with the Clarendon design. I expect that a digital designer has also tried this and released it as a font, perhaps under a name other than Clarendon, which is registered by Adobe. Perhaps this will jog the memory of one of our typophiles.  \nDon\n\n"

Your mileage may vary. :-)\n\nI scanned the cover of the fourth printing of the book (1977) to give you the image sample, although I presume that the same typeface was used for the first printing in 1967.\n\n"
