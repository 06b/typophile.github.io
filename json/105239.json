I've asked for a better copy of their logo but they keep sending me tiny, useless images (not vectors).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [EnergizerHoldings.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417210703/http:/typophile.com/files/EnergizerHoldings.png) | 170.03 KB |\n\n",

I was able to use LT Condensed Black Oblique with just a little tracking and kerning the sides of the \"i.\" It matches almost perfectly. (Blue is my version over the black original).\n\nThanks again!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417210703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FoundFont_3559.jpg)\n\n"
