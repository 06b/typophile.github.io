Apply a thin layer of glue to both objects using a piece of matte board or bristol with just a little glue on the tip.  \n3. Sandwich everything between layers of paper.  \n4. Press in a book press overnight. Since you don’t have one (and who does?) just pile a bunch of heavy art and design publications on it overnight.\n\nSince you’re doing a bunch of these, the best thing to do is have one person glue while another person sticks the envelopes under the books.\n\n"

I bought a sock of .75 oz plastic food service tubs (250 of ’em for $3) at a warehouse store just for this purpose, and they work great.\n\nAs James said, pressing overnight makes them nice and flat — put a sheet of wax paper between them so they don’t accidently stick together (or to whatever you’re using for weights!), and you can pile a bunch up.\n\n"
