      "content": "It is a very nice idea to be inspired by an inscription, such as the one you found) to design a typeface. Even if you have photographed a few letters (E, L, A, O, T and R) from the inscription you could still make various interesting alternate letterform designs.\n\nYou gave the title ‘Dominico: Low Contrast Condensed Interpretation’, as I understand it you wanted to give to the stroke weights a lower contrast (16/12) instead of the contrast displayed in the inscription, which is (21/12) and which accentuates the letterforms even more nicely.\n\nThe serifs in the inscription are not the same from letter to letter (compare the letters E and L and look at the attached JPG). The semi serifs in the letter A should be kept and it would be better than making them full serifs, - and this could also be done to letters such as V and W. The middle triangular shape in the letter E is quite innovative and should also be kept.\n\nThe serifs could be rendered in many ways, from very simple to more novel. There are many interesting and aesthetically appealing ways to introduce all sorts of serifs.\n\nOne doesn’t have to do a full ‘HAHBHC...’ test, writing ‘THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG’ is enough.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417173304im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Web_El_Domenico_5542.jpg)\n\n"
