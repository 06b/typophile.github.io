I was like Bah! thats been the next font on my list since i got an email about it months ago! (when i get funds to buy fonts)\n\nBut it got me thinking how this is like the only forum for any type of design i've come across with celebrities in the buisness who participate. And I also read that the hydro 74 guy is a member and professors of typography... So I was just wondering who our other Rock star members in the buis are?\n\n",
