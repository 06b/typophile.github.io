      "content": "Thanks I enjoyed listening to this program. It is fascinating to hear experts describe the rich ferment of translation, scholarship and enlightened research in Baghdad and other Arab and Islamic cities a thousand years ago. They called it 'the first Renaissance' because it was a direct cause of the Renaissance in Europe a few centuries later. It was interesting how many non-Moslems were active in the translation movement from Greek to Arabic. A parallel to that today would be how some non-Arabs are active and even pioneers in Arabic typography! Right, John?\n\n"
