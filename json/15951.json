  "content": "Oh Sheesh!  \nI can’t figure this one out and would LOVE some help. It’s been months that I’ve been querying this font on the internet. You folks are the best so I’m sure you’ll know what it is.\n\nIt’s the typeface that is used on the packaging for Diane Von Furstenberg the fashion designer. I think I saw the font used in a project by [www.practise.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918102431/http:/www.practise.co.uk/ \"www.practise.co.uk\") that I saw in a book on typography. Of course, going to their site, I couldn’t find the font in use BUT discovered another one that I love that was used for their project about Joseph Beuys. Anyone know what that one is as well?\n\nThanks so much!  \nB\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [tate-beuys-guide-cover.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918102431/http:/typophile.com/files/tate-beuys-guide-cover.jpg) | 48.08 KB |\n| [P93628\\_hero.jpeg](http://web.archive.org/web/20090918102431/http:/typophile.com/files/P93628_hero.jpeg) | 13.23 KB |\n\n",

I think something like it is used in a daily, youth-oriented Toronto newspaper called Dose. I suppose it’s high on the hipster list now!  \nThanks again.  \nB\n\n"
