Many foundries have made Clarendon's since 1845, when Besley/Fann Street first published it. The version is not clear from the business card. Other letterpress names for Clarendon include Besley. See digital [Besley Clarendon](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019063352/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/besley+clarendon/fonts/).
