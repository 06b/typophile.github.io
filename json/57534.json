Attached to this post are a number of examples I found on places like flickr and google and one great advert as well. When experimenting, I found they key is to be patient and have a little faith. It takes a while to take shape. Any thoughts on my effort shown above are appreciate. Not quite finished yet tho.  \nhope you guys think these are as cool as I do.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2200183211_78fc7ed948_5972.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2272651332_7c478bcdbc_b_5497.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2591269575_21f42bf1c3_o_6562.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/2635880156_63a99635d0_o_5829.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3154114314_00a31bf0f4_4820.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/10032008165635171053_4070.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/commercial,drawings,food,advertisement,art,ball,point-0cfad7bad178ea495082a692c24e4f30_h_3955.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516075152im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ist2_5558088-spiral-doodles-notepaper-xxl_3963.jpg)\n\n",
