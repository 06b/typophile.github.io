  "content": "Hi there!\n\nLooking to find out what font is used for the \"Thirst Quencher\" bit. Or at least something really close to it! I assume this is NOT a custom typeface, given how much it is used on the label, etc. I also assume this treatment has been skewed. Or maybe this is the italic form?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screenshot%202014-03-26%2014_5960.53.48.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screenshot%202014-03-26%2014_5782.53.57.png)\n\nA shot of the \"lemon ice\" which appears to be in the same font.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002122im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Screenshot%202014-03-26%2014_5334.57.39.png)\n\nThank you!\n\n",
