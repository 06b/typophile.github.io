  "content": "Hi all,\n\nAs things are really slowing down with my freelance work, I am pondering on offering portfolio photography services as a side gig. My question to you is what would you expect the service to cost? I am thinking a flat fee for photography, clean-up, and resizing 12 pieces with color correction and isolation as extras. What do you think?\n\nBelow are some samples that I shot for my own portfolio.\n\nAny input is much appreciated, thanks!\n\nAce\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 108.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109001531/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%20108.png) | 224.53 KB |\n| [Picture 106.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109001531/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%20106.png) | 512.53 KB |\n| [Picture 107.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109001531/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%20107.png) | 273.79 KB |\n\n",
