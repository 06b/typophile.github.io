As Martha Stewart, for whom the typeface was developed, would say \"it's a good thing.\" A monoline slab serif with ball terminals from typewriter letterforms--a very efficient and effective design. I checked the numbers category at H&FJ but missed the numbers on the Archer page. My bad.  \nDon\n\n"
