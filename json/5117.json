  "content": "Good day. Here is a logo for my own business that I woul like to be critiqued. I'm starting up some freelance work since I've just finnished school and I need an identity. I choose Metric Design, since I am a canadian living in the US and the name suggests a different way of looking at things. I basically settled on a geometric shape(s) in the form of an \"M\" and simple text for the logo (eurostile). Here it is on what I would like to be my business card. Its fairly narrow of a card, 4cmx9cm. It is all pantone metallic silver ink, because I want it to look like a ruler. There is a diecut circle like most aluminium rulers have (which I will be doing myslelf after print, with a simple handheld holepunch), and on the back is an actual ruler in centimeters with a small conversion chart for cm to inch.   \nI want it printed on a very heavy stock paper. What do you think? I would love coments and critisisms. Thankyou.   \n ![Metric Business Card](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022211240im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37729.jpg)\n\n",

First, I feel that the 3 dementional logo doesn't relate to the ruler idea which you are presenting on the back of the card. When I think of metric I think of the centimeter(singular) which you have used as a graphic element on the back. I don't think of three dementional space as much. Basically what I am trying to say is that there might be to many things going on on this card. I wish there was a way to integrate the centimeter scale idea with the logo. You know.. it's early in the morning so if I am not making any sense I am terribly sorry. Oh! have you tried just using 1 centemeter unit for the logo. The lines of the centemeter kind of look like an M for metic. Anyway I hope some of that makes sense.\n\n"

Chances are your production run is pretty small so using an expensive paper might be cheaper/better than two inks, or a double hit of silver etc.   \n   \nFinally, the font.
