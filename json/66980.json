  "content": "On a recent trip my father made to Vietnam, he picked up an interesting piece of cultural artifact. He went to an institution where people wrote poems. I cannot think of an equivalent in Western culture.\n\nThis is written on a thin handkerchief—the image measuring approximately 6\" x 6\".\n\nAt first glance you would think the writing is Chinese calligraphy. It is not.  \nRotate the image 90º counter clockwise and upon close examination, the writing is in Vietnamese (roman characters) calligraphy.  \nThough very tough to read for someone who is able to read Vietnamese.\n\nI thought this piece of artifact is interesting because I have never seen a written language written to mimic another.\n\nHere is the link  \n [http://designtn.com/type/chinese\\_vietnamese.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419144748/http:/designtn.com/type/chinese_vietnamese.jpg \"http://designtn.com/type/chinese\\_vietnamese.jpg\")\n\n:tony\n\n",

My thoughts are based on having studied [Standard Script / 楷书](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419144748/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_script) for two years for my GCE O'Levels. That was about 10 years ago.\n\n"
