Since this will be permanent, I’m treating the responsibility of choosing the typeface rather seriously. Here are the lines:\n\nBut fiction flaunts its grave deception,  \nFlies its flags of grand illusion,  \nCast a glimpse of truth across my eyes,  \nThen blames me for not anticipating  \nWhat foreign ideas have danced across  \nMy very being ever since page one ...\n\nI know this could go a number of ways in terms of mood and personality. I’m currently considering a few Blackletter style typefaces for a more traditional tattoo feel - namely a free font (I know, yikes!) called “Cloister” from DaFont.com. But I am also considering Minion Pro Semi-Bold and Trajan Pro Bold. I like Trajan for this, except that all caps is a horrible idea for something with the expressive, musical quality of poetry.\n\nI am probably looking for a serif font with a timeless appeal that has just enough “style” to make it stand out from the typical classic serif fonts. But I would love to hear any of your ideas or suggestions, regardless of whether they fit within these parameters.\n\nThanks!  \nEd\n\n",

      "content": "If I was you I’d try not to agonize over picking a digital typeface and laying out your sample on screen. I think a more fruitful approach would be to find a good tattooist who knows / specializes in lettering, explaining what kind of “feel” you’re after, and have them work from your ideas.  \nSkin is not paper is not the screen. And there are people who specialize in skin.\n\nAnd whatever you do: that’s a lot of text; be sure you don’t go too small with it, especially if you’re considering a somewhat detailed (such as a seriffed) face.\n\n"

      "content": "Altaira, thanks for the advice! I know that skin is an entirely different animal, but I am hoping that a tattoo artist who knows what they are doing will be able to use my printed type as a starting point and adjust as necessary to make it work without losing the essence of the font in translation.\n\nI don’t think size will be an issue. The friend of mine who is getting the tatt already has some fairly large lyrics on his back, and I wouldn’t want to go much smaller than what is already there. Which brings up a point in how the new font will interact with his existing ink. I requested a photo of what it looks like now, and I fully expect that to influence my decision.\n\n"
