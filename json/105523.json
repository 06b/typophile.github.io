Base on that knowledge, two very different digital versions: [http://www.myfonts.com/person/Douglas\\_C\\_McMurtrie/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414065726/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/Douglas_C_McMurtrie/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/person/Douglas\\_C\\_McMurtrie/\") Pity they both lack the graceful stricture of the metal type. :)\n\n"

If you prefer less contrast go for SG.  \nTo compare with original check the [Ludlow Typefaces](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414065726/http:/archive.org/details/LudlowTypefacesEditionD1140) book at archive.org. Ultra Modern regular and bold is at pages 166 to 169. Note that Ludlow also produced an italic.  \nDon\n\n"
