  "content": "Recently citroën has redesigned its identity. I believe to have achieved some innovation, though \"Créative technologie\" removes the french accent out of the brand (on purpose?)... But I'm interested in finding out what is the corporate typeface, that seems to work very well with the logo's typeface and personality of the brand.\n\n[www.citroen.fr](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019181309/http:/www.citroen.fr/)\n\nThanks.\n\n",
