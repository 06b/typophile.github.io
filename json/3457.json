There is a treasure trove of Bertold Wolpe's books and machinery some of it from the old Monotype Foundry and some donated from other now defunct foundries. Check out the street signs in that area. A book shop in Soho that you should visit is on Broadwick Street (I think, I normally walk straight there without noting the street names), definitely off Wardour Street. It is not Magma books but does have a selection of graphic books at lower prices (probably subsidised by the adult section in the basement). Also check out the bookshop in Tate Modern while you are visiting the Design Museum (which can be a disappointing visit for the expense, depending on what is showing there).   \nHave a good visit.   \nTim\n\n"

I think it is well worth a visit. The level of engineering is humbling. The Design Museum can be a fruitless experience - I don't know why, you would have thought the opposite. I do recommend Tate Modern though, brilliant use of an old power station. The bookshop is also close to Charing Cross Road North which has a large selection of secondhand book shops - good for browsing if you enjoy that.   \nTim\n\n"
