  "content": "Hello!\n\nI'm looking for a little feedback on a font I recently designed; Elken - a black, solid, display face with a stencil-type structure. (I didn't set out to create a stencil font, it happened by itself?)\n\nSpecifically, I know there are many problems with the spacing/kerning, and I have issues with c, g, s and t. I'd love to hear any comments or criticism... As it is my first font, I have much to learn.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416051527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/elken_3865.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416051527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/r_5444.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416051527im_/http:/typophile.com/files/elkend_6625.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Could you share with us the concept, thinking behind this typeface?  \nI like the look of it. Look very industrial, like metal screw.\n\na, c and u look similar, just different width. What if you eliminate the top right serif of letter a. what is wrong with g ? s might look like o, but the diagonal cut help define it, try to experience with other shape instead of circle. t is different because it is 1 shape, unlike the other have 2 shapes.\n\nI can't read the word elken, thought it was ellren. Maybe because the kerning and letterspacing is the same.\n\nSmall l look like uppercase I.\n\nWhat do you think about r.\n\nx and z has the same shape, but different cut.\n\n"

      "content": "hi! thanks for your comments... I haven't had time to look back at my work since posting this, and now things seem to be a little clearer..\n\nthe letter shapes grew out of some abstract-y sketching of mine based on the systematic/organic shapes of elk antlers - then I was looking at creating letters out of a modular sort of version of those shapes. but the final forms did turn out to be relatively.. hm.. cold, compared to the original scribbles.\n\nI had a look at jenson; thats quite an unusual feature... haven't seen that before?\n\nyes, the spacing is tricky - the letterforms themselves actually prevent the spacing from working out effectively. I'm thinking maybe a little bit of a redesign might be in order..\n\n"
