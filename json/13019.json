The attached image shows what I have now which is the over-used and boring (to me) Futura font.\n\nthanks for any and all feedback.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [2006bicyclegroup\\_jersey\\_web.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522231512/http:/typophile.com/files/2006bicyclegroup_jersey_web.gif) | 47.87 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Esteve, I too have designed a Bicyclist’s Kit. I have samples at my site. What I would change is make the main name on the front and back solid white. When your sprinting to the line at 30+ mph you need simplisity to be read at the line. The red is to close to the blue in the tonal range to be distinctive even with a white stroke.\n\nOne other thought, its popular now to put the name on the back of the shorts. Its very visible especially if you have a dot com.\n\n"

This lower cost short does not have the space to put a logo/text on the back of the short.\n\nThanks again for your input.\n\nSteve\n\n"

Loose the globe, that’s no good.  \nTo lower the cost I used plain blue shorts, which you can buy anywhere.  \nTake a look at this link, I used a The Mix from Luc(as) De Groot.\n\n[http://www.vosreinaert.be/wielrennen/fotos.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522231512/http:/www.vosreinaert.be/wielrennen/fotos.shtml)\n\n"
