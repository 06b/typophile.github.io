      "content": "In my experience, paragraph and section marks occur most commonly in conjunction with figures (in legal and scholarly references). As such, I design them to correspond to figure proportions and alignments.\n\nThe other common use for the paragraph mark is as a paragraph signifier in the middle of a solid block of text (or sometimes decoratively at the beginning). As such, it is usually followed by a capital letter. I generally design the paragraph mark to top align with cap height. But the bottom may descend.\n\nYou might look at these marks in other fonts that you admire to see how those who have come before have handled them.\n\n— K.\n\n"
