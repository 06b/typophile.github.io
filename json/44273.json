      "content": "The font is an Arts & Crafts-era type, originally designed in 1916 by Elizabeth Colwell as \"Colwell Handletter\" and released by American Type Founders in 1923.\n\nSeveral free versions of the font exist, all of various quality and faithfulness to the original.\n\nNick Curtis' [McKenna Handletter NF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108001512/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mckenna-handletter-nf/) is based fairly closely on Colwell's work.\n\nApostrophic Lab's [Colwell](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108001512/http:/www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/lab_colwell.htm) is rougher and includes several alternate forms, but moves slightly further afield from the original.\n\nThe H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society also offers a nice, if rough, version, called [HPLHS-Colwell](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108001512/http:/www.cthulhulives.org/toybox/PROPDOCS/PropFonts.html).\n\nOther digitized versions of this type have been available in the past from several typefoundries that have apparently become defunct.\n\nPrinted samples are also available in various Solotype books, so they may offer a digitized version as well, although I haven't been able to find them.\n\nDavid Thometz\n\n"
