I've purchased the complete Berthold Futura in order to have these in all the various weights. I've found the Berthold version to be excellent.   \n   \nAlso check out the link from Tiffany:   \n   \n [http://www.d.umn.edu/~jkmetz/GDH/04-24-01\\_3.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020125943/http:/www.d.umn.edu/~jkmetz/GDH/04-24-01_3.html)   \n   \n- Paul\n\n"
