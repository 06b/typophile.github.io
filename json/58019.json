I'm now playing with 10/14, and was wondering if anyone else has used Caecilia for extended text who would care to share their experiences.\n\nCheers,\n\nErik\n\n",

      "content": "Yep, she's a big girl ;-)  \nI'm not the most experienced typographer in the room, but I'll say that to my eyes as well, Caecilia seems to be happier with quite a lot of leading. I've set it at 10/15 before, but that was at a measure of 26p8. Come to think of it, I wonder if 10pt on a 26p0 measure isn't a bit on the large side? It seems to accommodate just over 2 lc alphabets (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc).\n\n"

      "content": "The slight condensing I suggested is a way to use a slightly larger size and still have the same character/line count. And Caecilia being a very well designed typeface, it can withstand this practice. And 92% is the limit imho. Try it with some arithmatic (characters/line as a constant — stepping up the size in quarter points).\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"
