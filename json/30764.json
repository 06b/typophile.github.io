I think making the whole a bit more aligned could make it look more airy and clean. Give the shapes some air, and you will also lend it a bit more legibility.\n\n"

Did you try playing with the opacity of the yellow text to let the tower shine through? This may (?) give the effect of the letters being made of the moonlight … especially if you added a subtle yellow “spotlight graphic” (flashlight triangle) hitting the back of the text (from the moon). Just a thought.\n\n"

The choice of a serif for the BRAC Center… text seems strange I would look at the sans style with tighter leading, using half line spacing to keep the three elements (The BRAC Center… in Paris II, date and time, and ticket information) separate. btw, You need a space between •Reserved Tables.\n\nTim\n\n"
