If you have not yet compared to other squared-off sans, you want to compare these:\n\n[Stainless](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035808/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Stainless), which has a big variety of widths and weights for magazine work.\n\n[Kalvika](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035808/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html), my favorite at the moment,\n\n[Simian](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035808/http:/houseindustries.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=24&subpage=viewfonts), which is very well done but rather wide\n\nand the new [Elektra](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035808/http:/www.stormtype.com/elektra.html)\n\nalso Sophisto at [http://www.macrhino.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20111217035808/http:/www.macrhino.com/ \"http://www.macrhino.com/\").\n\nI know you can get PDFs at the sites for Stainless, Klavika and Elektra and Sophisto at the sites, and I'm sure more from all the foundries.\n\nI'd be interested in your choice and why you made it.\n\n"
