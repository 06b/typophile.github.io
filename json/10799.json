Don't want to overdo it.   \n   \nThe interview went well, and I've been invited to the entrance exams.. Which is good! Wish me luck   \n   \nI showed a bit of an updated version of the font with some very small alterations such as the x-height adjustments for the e, f and h.   \n   \nhere it is:   \n ![moloko](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018041227im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7995.gif)\n\n"
