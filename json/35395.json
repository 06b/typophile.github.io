  "content": "hi all. i have been searching for the past 2 days or so for a paper company that offers \"paperbag\" coverstock paper samples. i have a client that wants to get all their collateral done with this type of subtrate, but, as with most clients, have no idea about the differences and nuances of paper. i've called most of the local printers here in ATL, and all have lead to dead ends. does anyone know of any resources? thanks!!\n\nMB\n\n",
