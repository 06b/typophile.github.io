  "content": "Hello all,\n\nYou've all been very helpful before and I'm afraid I need your help again. I need to redraw several logos in vectors so that they can be used for Print. But instead of redrawing all the fonts, I thought it best to just ask the Typophiles which fonts these are. I recognize most of them, but I can't find their names of the top of my head.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140825061959im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logoscompo_5621.jpg)\n\n",
