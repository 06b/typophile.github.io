      "content": "Hi Wanda.   \n   \nYour background and text are fighting each other to be the most important thing on the card. There so close their about to come to blows over it!   \n   \nYou can minimize the type by making it smaller and choosing one weight and color. Or, minimize the graphic by tinting it, or making it 85% on a blue background, knockout type. Also, consider cropping your graphic differently, try rotating it, try an asymetrical layout. BTW, any reason why the ball terminals are two different sizes?   \n   \nHave fun with your layout!   \n   \nCheers,   \nRandy\n\n"
