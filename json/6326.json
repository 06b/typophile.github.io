That style G is about the most common one there is.   \n   \nYou've got to be kidding if you think we are going to know 'Ribjoint' from CAKE Publications, based on the G, or even the whole alphabet. And I'll bet your clue about Bitstream is absolutely the only reason Yves picked their version of Gill Sans. There is no difference in those two characters.   \n   \nI know I don't have to 'play', but I have to say that such questions seem to me like a waste of time.   \n   \nWhere is that 'Bah Humbug' when I need it?\n\n"
