It does produce ttf or otf file but Hebrew characters can't be typed if I'm in InDesign for example. English - yes, but not Hebrew. I added Encoding and Unicode codepage - Hebrew and Unicode ranges - Hebrew. But still - no go. Other languages work just fine - cyrilic, greek, etc. What am I missing here?\n\nMichael\n\n"
