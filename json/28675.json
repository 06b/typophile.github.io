One of the features of Pistilli Roman is extremely fine hairlines in the thin strokes. There were two or three different versions of Pistilli Roman with hairlines of different thicknesses--optical scaling for three different display sizes, in effect. The one selfservicemagazine uses looks like the thinnest one.\n\nDidoni was a knock-off of sorts and only had one \"optical size\" and the digital version seems to hedge on this to make it usable at sizes smaller than 48 point. The hairlines are noticeably thicker. Didoni also had a a couple dozen alternate and swash characters which are not present in the digital version.\n\n"
