  "content": "I'm looking for a good handwritten font with alternate versions of characters for a project that I'm currently working on. I've read through the discussion of [favorite handwritten fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018065913/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/14521.html) from back in August, but I think I'm looking for something a little more specific.   \n   \nWhat I'm looking for is something that possibly has the feel of [Ingrid Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018065913/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/enrich/ingrid-font/) but with the functionality and alternates that [Caflisch Script Pro](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018065913/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1725.jhtml) has. But, most specifically, I'd take any handwritten font as long as it has some good alternate characters.   \n   \nCan anyone help? Thanks!\n\n",

The only thing is that I'd love to use a typeface that has a couple versions of each character (or at least the caps) in each weight to keep it looking more natural and less repetitive.   \n   \nThanks for the suggestion though\n\n"
