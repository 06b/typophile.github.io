  "content": "The Disappearing Euro   \n   \nI'm currently in the final testing stages of a new typeface created in Fontlab 4.5.1. It's postscript Type 1 set to Imported encoding. When I test strings of text in InDesign 2.0 any instance of the Euro or Apple symbol are left blank. Is this a standard for InDesign? Or is this on my end?   \n   \nOf course the symbol can be inserted via Insert Glyphs but not with a keystroke. Using my system True Type fonts the Euro and Apple do however show up without using Insert Glyphs.   \n   \nAnyone have experience with this?\n\n",
