  "content": "Dear fellow Typophile's and experts of all things type,\n\nPlease share your recommendations for a typeface that is strikingly similar to United Sans Lt and Md by House Industries. The typeface is to be used with CSS @font-face embedding within a website I am making. I'm sad to say that House doesn't allow @font-face CSS embedding of their typefaces and as such I need a replacement. All insights are greatly appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415225453im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unitedsansreg-medium_5493.png)\n\nPlease note the angularity of the letterforms...\n\n",
