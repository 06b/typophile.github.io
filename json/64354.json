  "content": "Greetings,\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew this specific blackletter typeface.\n\nThe sample comes from Lord Hobo, a beer hall located in Cambridge, MA (which is in Boston for anyone who does not know) near the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I have looked through reams of blackletter on MyFonts but have yet to identify it precisely. I have also posted it on WhatTheFont.\n\nThe website I pulled this sample from is: [http://lordhobo.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017082206/http:/lordhobo.com/)\n\nThanks all.\n\nAa\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017082206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_60_4215.jpg)\n\n",
