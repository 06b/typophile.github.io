  "content": "So for those of you who haven't heard, Typophile is DJing the Saturday night \"Digikana\" event at TypeCon San Francisco. And while we've been doing our best to amass a pile of tunes that will please the discerning typographer, we're left with a question:   \n   \nWhat are the must-have tunes to please a Typecon crowd?   \n   \nMind you, I'm not fishing for \"what's your favorite song?\" here - I'm looking for specific songs that mention type, alphabet, fonts, letters, etc etc. Spoken word or musical.   \n   \nAny links to downloadable MP3s of typographers speaking (or something similar) would also be welcome here.   \n   \nthanks-   \njb\n\n [‹ Typophile Small Talk Generator: TypeCon Edition](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121133422/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5680 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typing around Corners ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121133422/http:/www.typophile.com/node/5640 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
