  "content": "Hi,  \nAlthough I have followed this site for a while, I am new to posting and I hope I am following the guidelines correctly. I saw a recent post suggesting the use of Aviano Sans, a font I was not previously familiar with. I am doing the film title for Suspended Belief and think Aviano Sans Thin might feel very balanced for the word suspended, as it blows or rotates. I am having a hard time with a font for Belief. Serifs make it seem too religious a word and the title, Suspended Belief, is a play on the phrase suspension of disbelief and really has nothing to do with religion. I would appreciate any direction anyone can offer. I would like to stay with Typekit fonts. Again, I am a big fan. Thank you.\n\n",
