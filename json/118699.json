  "content": "I've been tasked with unifying a bunch of different products into one large book.\n\nProblem #1: The body copy on most of the products is sans-serif so the boss wants to keep all of the body copy as sans-serif. I've tried Trade Gothic, Frutiger, Avant Garde, Franklin Gothic, Futuri, Avenir Next, and Univers and they are all difficult to read in my opinion.\n\nProblem #2: There are some pages that have plenty of space and not that much text, but there are also pages that are FULL of text so I need a typeface that I can set at small sizes and tight leading and still be readable. Maybe a typeface with a condensed option in addition to the normal weight?\n\nProblem #3: This product is also \"reproduceable\" so I need a typeface that is still readable on black and white copies.\n\nIs this is even feasible? If I can get my company to pay for them, what do you think about using FF Legato, Sensibility, or Whitney?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

I suspect that you might think that sans-serif text, in general, is less legible than serif text, which can be debated from both pro and con points of view.\n\nStill, unless you're designing something for yourself, your opinions on readability should take a back seat to the target audience's opinions. Of course you can't really survey them all to find their preferences, but people tend to think that the typefaces they're most familiar with are most readable. So if you want to play it safe, you might consider using a common, all-purpose, generic sans-serif, like Helvetica or Myriad.\n\n"

Seven weights 22 variants. Check particularly the book and book small caps.
