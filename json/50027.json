This is very useful: some font packages are so designed that you dont get a true, say, italic, just by pressing ctrl i. You have to actually select the italic variant, which is very tiresome anf time consuming. An example of this is Zapf Renaissance.\n\nIn WP you can go to font mapping and select the font you want whenever you select italic etc. The process is thus automated.\n\nDoes such a process exist in Word of any vintage? I use 2003 if I have to use Word and have not found a similar feature\n\nJohn\n\n",
