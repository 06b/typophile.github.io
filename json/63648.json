  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm just stuck with this issue. I have Adobe Suite CS3 for some time now, and I don't know why, the .ai files are not associated with Illustrator. I already reinstalled the whole Suite and nothing.  \nApparently if I drag a file into Illustrator it opens, but it's just boring. I want this to work properly.  \nI'm just loosing patience here.  \nSome help would be appreciated :).\n\nThanks  \nJoão\n\nP.S.: I know this is no typophile like issue, but I have no patience to google.\n\n",

It ought to work (probably), but you can first try manually changing the association.\n\nIn HKEY\\_CLASSES\\_ROOT, \".ai\" points to a default handler for \"Adobe.Illustrator.13\". This key, in turn, contains all necessary Explorer information -- eg., the icon to use, but also the Shell stuff (as in \"Open\",\"Print\").  \nThe Shell subkey there contains a subkey \"open\", which _then_ has a subkey \"command\", and this is finally the one to edit. Its value \"(Default)\" should read -- _including the quotes_\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Adobe Illustrator CS3\\Support Files\\Contents\\Windows\\Illustrator.exe\" \"%1\"\n\n-- but note that this is the path on my system, and yours is highly likely different.\n\n"
