It looks a lot like [Surrey](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829234040/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/surrey/), except that the actual letter doesn't look the same. I've browsed through the family on myfonts and can't find the style pictured, and I've seen work using the same font on another designer's site so I'm convinced it's a typeface. Perhaps there's another style of this one that I'm missing? I've googled and haven't found anything.\n\nThanks for any help :)\n\n",
