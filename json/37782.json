I’ve never seen it before”. The question we’ve had to answer several times the last weeks and the answer is rather simple: The font is called “Borealis” and is designed for the festival by the eminent designers in the local designcollective Grandpeople. More about Grandpeople at [http://www.grandpeople.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821125050/http:/www.grandpeople.org/ \"http://www.grandpeople.org\").\n\n"
