      "content": "<cite>There is no suitable “web safe” replacement</cite>\n\n:) Well I was not sure how to say what I was asking.\n\nI just wanted to be sure that if the typeface Bliss is used in an identity system the next logical replacement font for web and MS Office use should be Gill Sans. Looking at other identity style guides I kept seeing Arial, Tahoma, and Verdana as the replacment font for web and office application use and thought is that right. I just basically wanted comfirmation from someone experienced in typography.\n\nIf one were to do a google for \"Bliss font and identity guidelines\" you would see what I mean.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nI know I am in my own little world, but its ok.
