I am more than willing to be taught these skills, as I will be creating multiple fonts utilizing this feature and possibly some other advanced ones. If anyone is interested and believes they are capable of such a task, please contact me at [thepcnerd7@gmail.com](mailto:thepcnerd7@gmail.com). I highly appreciate any advice or input, and thank you for your time and willingness!\n\nFor His glory,  \nAustin M.\n\n",
