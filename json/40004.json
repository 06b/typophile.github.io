      "content": "Hi Jim,  \nall of them are quite classic. One could add [Stymie](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Stymie) and, of course, [Clarendon](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Clarendon) to this list.\n\nLubalin Graph is Avant Garde’s slab soul brother, therefore _very_ geometric. Nice for headlines, not easy – to unusable – in text.  \nCaecilia is at the other end of the gamut, having humanistic proportions: not so bold-faced, but more versatile.\n\nNot-so-often seen (can’t call them ‘hidden’) gems: [City](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/city-bq/familytree.html) by Georg Trump, [Boton](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/boton-bq/familytree.html).\n\nSimilar but fresher faces would be [Giza](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/slab/Giza), [Dispatch](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/slab/Dispatch). Or [Silica](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/silica/), if you like to follow the Caecilia line.\n\nCheck out this thread [on Serifa, Glypha, Egyptienne F and other slabs](http://web.archive.org/web/20140719103435/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31962), too.  \nF\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks Florian - Giza is a beauty, I shall be picking that bad-boy up.\n\nThe face will be used for titling only, so Lubalin Graph was my first choice. I'd rejected Clarendon because of the bevelling on the slabs, and its current ubiquitous-ness.\n\nFor my money Memphis and Rockwell are just too similar to Lubalin Graph to merit use on their own terms (certainly on my budgets) -- do you feel there's an argument in having all three in your arsenal, or just picking a favourite and aligning yourself to it. After all, even if I had the cash, I don't want to end up with 800 typefaces, when many of them are very similar...\n\n"
