There are a few at the top of this list of [handwriting fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305212458/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/contemporary-handwriting-fonts/).\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, Nick. Of course you're right about \"script\". What about \"discrete\" handwriting? I'm not sure that would make it immediately clear, though, if I said, \"I'm looking for a neat, discrete handwriting font.\" And \"print handwriting\" is probably the most common, I should have thought of it. \"Print handwriting font\" might be confusing, though.\n\nI think I'll go with \"non-cursive\".\n\nI like a few of those from the FontFeed. And Soli Px is nice, but I'm struck by your avatar, spiral, it's adorable.\n\n"

      "content": "I created a non-script handwriting font for the creation a child's primer to teach handwriting, from formation of letters to clear easy-to-read handing.\n\nThis involved a few True Type fonts. Two of the fonts were very identical, featuring stand-alone versions of each letter, and same thing just with little arrows around each letter, indicating the correct manner to draw the letter.\n\nThe third font was extremely difficult to create, because each letter had a tail or extention to connect to the next letter. To achieve a perfect connection for every combination: the a with an a, the a with b, the a with c, the a with a d etc., the b with an a, the b with an e, etc. uppercase with lowercase; the widths of each letter had to be test and tweaked, requiring much much time.\n\nThere were some letters which did not have a baseline connection, but an upper connection, for example, an m with an o. So, there was a default baseline connection for m, and exception upper connection in a fourth font.\n\nThen, there were combinations that neither choice would work. So, I created a series of ligatures containing two or three letter combinations.\n\nThere is a new technology called OpenType where the position of floating glyph elements and the replacement of them can be programmed into contextual tables, so the abovwe goal could be achieved in only two or three fonts, and have much better, even near perfect results.\n\n"
