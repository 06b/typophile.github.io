I don't mean Palatino Nova, but good old digital Palatino from Linotype. Last year I purchased a license for one of their Palatino family packs and I've been experimenting with it.\n\nIt seems to perform quite well at 11/13 points with with 10-12 words per line, printed at 1200dpi on somewhat thicker, creamy paper. The colour is nice and dark and the spacing seems fine. The italics in particular look great. It might not be designed especially for text but it seems to work. It's an amazingly readable face. At the very least, it doesn't seem to suffer from the problems characteristic of metal types translated to digital form.\n\nAm I missing something?\n\n",

Perhaps I haven't read enough bad Palatino. The Linotron version used by Puffin Books in the mid-80s was quite charming and very sturdy. And in recent years digital Palatino has become even more useful (for those who want it) with the addition of some nice extras.\n\nWe know that Zapf didn't intend for Palatino to be used as a text face, but it seems to work. And although Aldus might be more suited to text at smaller sizes (below 10 points), it certainly lacks the charm and elegance of Palatino.\n\nI guess people have simply seen too much of it over the years.\n\n"
