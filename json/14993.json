      "content": "\\> she got a nose job\n\nJust goes to show that looks and brains are rarely found in the same person. The human consciousness cannot fully design [for] something \"natural\". As I pointed out in my Typo#13 article, the human nose is extremely complex\\*. And then they want us to believe they've actually nailed down the act of reading, which involves the retina, perception, and cognition. It's funny/sad how quickly hubris tends to verge on plain old idiocy. Reality is to Modernism what Katrina is to the Mistral.\n\n\\* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4133093.stm](http://web.archive.org/web/20141031100913/http:/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4133093.stm \"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4133093.stm\")\n\n\\> The Professional\n\nYes, a superb work.\n\nhhp\n\n"
