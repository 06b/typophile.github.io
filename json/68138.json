  "content": "All magazines that think they've got something serious to tell about wellness, as well as lots and lots of companies that operate in the field of well-being, find it hard to choose anything different from Helvetica Light Extended. I don't blame them, it looks awfully good (I was going to type <cite>awesome</cite>, but that's a bit too much...).\n\nAnyway, I thought \"Why not make them an alternative?\". Light, wide, clean... I've used a big part of my free Sunday to draw up some glyps. They need a lot more work, but I'ld like to hear your opinions for now...\n\nThanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Helv XLE alternatief.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419203214/http:/typophile.com/files/Helv%20XLE%20alternatief_0.pdf) | 221.05 KB |\n\n",

There is really something about the /G/, maybe it's just me.\n\n"
