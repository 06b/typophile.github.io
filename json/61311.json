You can see there are twirls added for design. The straight line in the letter \"e\" is not as straight, it kind of narrows from right to left. The tree is obviously there for design.\n\npreview:  \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301231503im_/http:/www.vamonosamigos.com/s-gie.jpg)\n\nthanks\n\n"
