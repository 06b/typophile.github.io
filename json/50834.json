  "content": "Afternoon all,\n\nI'm currently looking at how the study of the effects of [aesthetics](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107115125/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/aesthetics) on [legibility](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107115125/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/legibility) can help to improve the reader experience.\n\nNow I know this is a very much debated area, the whole area of \"how do you measure legibility\" (of which [http://typophile.com/node/41365](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107115125/http:/typophile.com/node/41365 \"http://typophile.com/node/41365\") is a great thread), and the fact that aesthetics are subjective (as I believe is legibility to a point - reader preference, familiarity, etc.).\n\nWhat I am looking at, is if the conducting of legibility tests, followed by subjective aesthetics tests (in which various samples would be created with varying levels of creative elements and the same tests applied as in the legibility studies as well as preference, etc.) to see if it is possible to find a balance point between the two. The theory is that if you can find a point where the legibility is maximised, and then find the point where the aesthetics don't negatively affect the legibility, then you can effectively improve the reader experience.\n\nMy thought behind the possible application of this is in uses such as study materials and required reading. For example if you can increase the aesthetics to a point where they are maximised without decreasing the legibility of the text, can you in theory improve the reader experience, and would it have an additional effect on other aspects; retention, comprehension.\n\nI know this possibly sounds a little vague, but I'm really interested in people's thoughts on this.\n\nThanks\n\n",

They're also what gets left out of any legibility testing I'm aware of. It is absolutely crucial to any understanding of legibility, readin' ritin' and comprehension in general. Aesthetics is the part of design that gets dismissed immediately by those folks who want to figure out how reading works. After all, designers just want to make things look attractive and beautiful, right?, And this gets in the way of real scientific understanding. Right?. But really - what is, or, are aesthetics, other than the way we humans tend to like to have things organized so that we can comprehend them. A chart, or a dense passage of text that can be described as \"Pleasing to the eye\" is probably better, i.e. more readable and comprehensible than one that could be described as \"A dog's breakfast\".\n\nBut, how do you test for the aesthetic component in any credible way without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars? In all seriousness, more like Millions of dollars. It's not a small problem. I do know how far a hundred grand will get you and that's really not much to write home about. Personally, I think that good designer or artists understand aesthetics in their bones. It's a non verbal kind of intelligence and unless the results of any such research are applied to further developing those skills for future designers, I really don't see the point. Scientifically design type is like scientifically through basket balls... You may know all the physics, but it doesn't mean you can through a ball.\n\n-=®=-\n\n"

Do you think it's possible though to look at these criteria on a case by case basis and then build almost a kind of process for creating reading materials that maximise the reader experience whilst retaining the highest possible level of legibility. Maybe it's more from a user testing perspective rather than a definitive 'these are aesthetics' perspective?\n\n_Aesthetics is the part of design that gets dismissed immediately by those folks who want to figure out how reading works_\n\nThis is part of my frustrations also, and the idea is to look to see if you can keep a partial focus on the aesthetics, so when it comes to layout and design of the material as opposed to just the 'science' of the text, you can ensure that the legibility isn't compromised. It's all born out of a frustration with complying with standards and legibility, and how you can make them work together.\n\nSorry if I'm rambling, I've currently got the lurgy and am not thinking quite straight!\n\n"

It’s known that people perform better on cognitive tasks after being induced into a good mood by receiving a gift or seeing something pleasing. I examined if it was possible to do this with typography and found improvements both on the candle task (a cognitive task) and a reduction in the amount of activity in the corrugator (frowning) muscle after reading with better typography.\n\nIt doesn’t cost millions of dollars to do this. In fact I did a live demonstration of this effect at ATypI in Helsinki with the remote associates task (a different cognitive task). After listening to me drone on for a while, I asked the audience to find the word in common with <cite>swiss, cottage, and cake</cite> (answer = cheese). Perhaps half of the audience found the correct answer. Then after listening to the highly entertaining Herr Spiekermann for a minute, I asked the audience to find a different remote associate, which about three quarters of the audience found.

All scientific results need to be scrutinized and questioned. All research methods and procedures need to be examined and questioned without being held in awe. To me, the biggest issue is that the conclusions that are drawn from data are made by humans. The data may be correct but the conclusion may be wrong. If data tells me that regressions in reading are greater when a reader comes across a word in italic, that may indicate that italic is harder to read or it may also tell us that the reader is pausing to contemplate why that word is in italics or just triggers a memory like \"I remember reading that book in college.\" Both may be true but how do we know? There is judgement in analyzing data just as there is in designing a glyph visually. Either can be misjudged.

      "content": "\\>I’m trying to find if there is a benefit in using subjective aesthetics testing to benefit the scientific part of the research, the ’case study’ part being “can it benefit the reader experience”\\<\n\nThis is excellent. But it is completely wrong. However, the fix is simple: simply invert it to 'the case study part being \"do [good aesthetics] _detract_ from the reader experience?\"'\n\nIt stands to reason that good aesthetics are noticeable as such, and the time spent noticing them will be time wasted on admiring aesthetics when all time spent reading needs to be spent . . . reading.\n\nThe problem with type designers today is that they are obsessed with harmonious aesthetics to the detriment of readability. Graphic design is not, in many respects, a good foundation for readable type design. Because what the graphic designer finds beautiful, harmonious and attention-getting is a thrust that does not relate at all to what the reader finds easy to read.\n\nI see graphic design as being primarily about a kind of macro experience and type design as being primarily a kind of micro experience. (That's a very bad way of expressing it but the best I can do at this moment -- enough maybe to get the germ of the idea across?) This was brought home to me when I had a glance at Paul Hunt's Reading project. The typeface seems to have tentacles that want to reach into the very fibres of the paper. Here, I thought, one could see a design axis, a design will, a design theory, a design practice, a praxis, that was relevant to _reading_.\n\nIt was brought home to me in a different way when I saw a large dual column edition of Shaw's essays set magnificently in metal Fournier. The pages all but read themselves.\n\nThe moral of that experience was one I have felt was paramount since I first tried to design type: nobody, nobody, nobody, is ever going to get _reading_ until they start designing single-size fonts. A single master used at multiple sizes is always a fatally maimed 'monstrico'. Nor is there the slightest justification for single-master/multiple size fonts other than money, money, money.\n\nYou can ask: 'where is the money for us to design single-size fonts? We can't afford to spend ten years, rather than one, on a text design that only a few will buy.'\n\nMaybe the answer lies in T.S. Eliot's prescription that the poet needs to have a job separate from poetry.\n\nCertainly, if you look at what is happening today, with the designers who _are_ designing single size type, that is what happens. Two examples: Robert Slimbach's new Garamond (which with four entirely separate optical multiple masters can be permitted, for this argument, to count as single-size) was designed _entirely in his spare time_ over a period of many years. In this he is still following the direction of Sumner Stone who cannot possibly be making enough money from the great Cycles family to compensate him for the endless thousands of hours of development and sheer _being_ that it cost over a period of more than a decade, and continues to cost.\n\nSo I guess my larger point is that there is no point in talking about readability until you have thought through some of the obstacles to readability which have been set in motion by the direction that typeface design has taken since, roughly, 1960.\n\n"

      "content": "\"the kind of test you are talking about is too all embracing to be realistic/useful as a scientific test.\"...\n\nEben, of course it is! That is my point and it is not the scientists fault. The reason more tests are not done and that more useful results don't come out is that there are so many variables to control, which are so far not possible to control, as to make both the test too complex or the data too vague. Other issues are that there is very little financial support for this arena of work and the potential of monetary profit is small.\n\n\"all this gnashing of teeth about scientists coming in to stamp all over our nice typographic grass is a bit silly as well and frankly just as naive.\"\n\nWho said that scientists are coming in and taking our turf? Not me. Scientists are not coming in and there is very little work done in the area of typography. My beef is not with the scientists--there are several in my family. My beef is with the rest of us who jump beyond the scientists conclusions and give the studies greater weight than even the scientists who made them. Scientists are not afraid to question each other but we are afraid to question results or to limit the scope of results to the level intended by the scientists. Scientists work incrementally. They take a small piece of the puzzle and analyze what bits they can and build upon the previous work done by others, Other scientists take different chunks either independently or cooperatively. After years, there is a body of work which others look at objectively and may prompt yet another study. This goes on for years. The scientists are not in awe of each other; they just work and read what others have published.\n\nWe all need to stop being so full of ourselves and just look at our role pragmatically, even naively. When we pull and push control points about in FontLab, we are experimenting, too. It may not be rigorous scientific method but we control some variable and change others. I have prattled long enough.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

I have also never been against good scientific research on scientific research on design legibility and aesthetics, as Kevlar talks a lot about. But as one can see, sometimes, some forget where the peanut gallery is, and where the use of scientific research is just another live wire in the design business.\n\nCheers!\n\n"

Perhaps you missed my other comment a few posts below the one you quoted: \"Scientists are not afraid to question each other but we are afraid to question results or to limit the scope of results to the level intended by the scientists\"  \nAn example of what I mean is a recent quote taken out of context. There was a study done regarding screen fonts on web sites. The only fonts tested were bundled fonts in certain screen read situations. The quote taken out of context said something to the effect \"therefore, Arial is the best font for reading\" leaving out all the conditions of the study and making the reader think that Arial is the best font for reading anything anywhere anytime. The researcher did not say or intend this but never the less some non-scientist (I can't recall but I think he was an editor of some sort) jumped all over it and took it as god's gospel because it was \"science\". You can be sure that a true scientist would have been quick to point out his error.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Taking this into the realm of metaphor though, if Socrates was the sun, might Plato not be admitted to planethood after all?  \nSee: [http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824\\_planet\\_definition.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107115125/http:/www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824_planet_definition.html \"http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060824\\_planet\\_definition.html\")\n\nHow my comment about reclassification on account of redefinition applies to the issue at hand is that, if legibility or readbility are operationalized in terms of eye movement patterns (saccadic amplitude and the absence of regressios), or ease of visual word form resolution (as quantified by the size of the word superiority effect), rather than simple reading speed, or the simple _discrimination affordance_ of letter shapes under compromised conditions caused by distance or illumination, what counts as a legible or readible font might be expanded or contracted or reclassified.\n\nImproving the reader’s experience can of course involve all of these things, but often includes much more, including introducing elements that enhance expressive specificity but have measurable — but non-fatal — perceptual processing costs. Some of the ‘much more’ might only be accessible to anecdotal report.\n\n"

In the second case, the legibility factors are negatively impacted but the communication is enhanced without another word being added.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Later, they reprinted these books, same size, but with the typeface changed to one (I forget which right now and I'm too lazy to track it down) with a relatively higher x-height and at slightly larger size, reducing the white space.

This becomes blinding. We go around in circles. We stop trusting our cultivated vision and craft wisdom. We kid ourselves into thinking we have understood readability in this way. We've gained no understanding at all of what our type-forming micro-decisions actually **do** _in perceptual-processing terms_. We can sense and experience what occurs, but we haven't deepened our vision and craft wisdom with evidential knowledge about what occurs. Yet, intelligent design requires just that.\n\nWe need to know, for example how spacing affects the formation of word-level codes. How does too wide or overly tight spacing disrupt this? Why? What are the tolerences?\n\nOr we need to know, does decreasing stroke contrast, or making it variable effect the cue-value of distinctive features in such a way that word-level codes are harder to assemble in the visual cortex.\n\nMany sciences have acheived this level of specificity and particularity. Why not the science of reading?\n\n"

The latter part of the quote I don't understand though. What \"how exactly\"? Ideal reading conditions means words that are distinguishable and recognizable as such. What riddle is there that needs to be solved?  \nBy the way, I am amused by the term \"crowding\", especially when confronting it with the older \"gestalt\". Both acknowledge the same phenomenon but approach it from opposite directions. It looks like the \"crowding\" is rooted in Anglo-American philosophic tradition which is obsessed with reducing everything to smallest particles as if these had some built-in evidence, but gets trapped in the un-answerable question, how come that we are able to get from these particles to a unity? From sensual impressions to conceptions, ideas, objects? (The \"reference\" problem.) \"Crowding\" nicely reflects this, alluding to a bunch of particles lumped together _somehow_. \"Gestalt\" instead starts out with concepts, ideas, objects -- the unity which \"crowding\" acknowledges, wants to explain, but does not really know how. From a \"gestalt\" perspective, perception is perception of objects, period, and particles are recognized only in as far as they form unity.  \nOff-topic.\n\n"
