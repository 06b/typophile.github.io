      "content": "The article fails to mention Apple has supported Windows operating system interoperability since PowerPC and perhaps a little prior. There used to be a card that Apple or third party used to sell that allowed Windows to run. There was 486 card and a Pentium card. That was the old days. Then prior to BootCamp we had VirtualPC.  \nNow Apple is using the Intel architecture (I happen to prefer AMD) and we have access to Windows without any expensive emulation enviros.\n\nIs it the best solution? Probably not.  \nDoes this mean Apple is trying attract more developers to MAX OSX? Yes.  \nDoes this mean Apple will one day try to wave the white flag and merge with Microsoft?- NO!  \nIs Vista trying to accomplish what MAC OS X does? Yes.  \nDoes Microsoft copy Apple? All the time.\n\nMikey\n\n"
