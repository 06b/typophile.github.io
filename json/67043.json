  "content": "Looking at the Google logo, I thought to wonder about the typeface used for it.\n\nI had previously tended to assume that it was Caslon. Looking closer, I thought that perhaps the letter e at the end was tilted deliberately. Then I noticed that the g was the wrong shape to match with any oldstyle font I knew of, so I did a little web search rather than bothering the Type ID board on something for which the answer presumably was well-known.\n\nAnd, indeed, there were articles discussing the history of the famous Google logo at length. When I saw a specimen of Catull, seeing it to be a calligraphic face, I was quite surprised - I was never expecting the lowercase a, for example, to have such an idiosyncratic shape.\n\n",
