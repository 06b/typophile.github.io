And I also wonder whether there should be at least one connex b/w the strokes (I reckon the middle of the ’B’) to add a bit of tension, to make it look more spontaneous and less thinky (if that makes sense),  \ncheers\n\n-N\n\n"

I’d push them one way or the other.\n\nThe logo is nice, conceptually. Well done.\n\nThe type is lacking, though, and is way out of scale with the mark.\n\n"

      "content": "Yep, clean up the curves and you’ve got a nice logo. Have you thought about adding a belly button? ;)\n\nI agree with Nick’s comment about connecting the middle of the B. Your stroke widths seem a little uneven.\n\nAs for the type, I would make the logo a bit smaller so the type stands out more.\n\n-Scott\n\n"
