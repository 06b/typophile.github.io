I also found this font named Mostra (Two) quite fitting:  \n [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/](http://web.archive.org/web/20090514071125/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/ \"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/mostra/\")\n\nWhat fonts come to mind when you think about negative and positive space? Sometimes, when the font is bold enough or the type is set close enough, positive and negative seems to switch or isn’t easy to pin down. I’m looking for that sort of effect.\n\nThanks for your input!\n\n",
