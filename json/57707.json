[Interrobang](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018215028/http:/typophile.com/wiki/interrobang) is a close second.\n\n[Patrick & Co.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018215028/http:/www.yelp.com/biz/patrick-and-co-san-francisco-2) is the last (and best) independent stationery and office supply places in SF.
