Coming soon will be a group for decorative faces. So, if you feel so inclined, this is your chance to wear your favorite typeface on your chest.\n\nSkreened uses only American Apparel products - [http://www.americanapparel.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20120423185747/http:/www.americanapparel.net/ \"http://www.americanapparel.net\") - in a variety of styles and sizes. Suggestions for any faces not currently included are welcome.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [BodoniTshirt.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120423185747/http:/typophile.com/files/BodoniTshirt.jpg) | 56.39 KB |\n\n",

Yes, we in Ohio must bow to Florida's current athletic superiority. But there's nothing wrong with second place -- better than plenty of others. And if you want it, I'm sure that Daniel will print it.\n\nPaul Nini  \nDept of Design  \nOhio State Univ\n\n"

We expect him to stick around as an emeritus faculty, however.\n\nPeter Megert did \"retire\" some years ago to focus on professional practice, but he has been teaching with us part-time since then. We're very glad to have him. It's a great experience for our new visual communication design students to have their first typography course with someone who practiced in Switzerland in the 60s, was hired by Paul Rand to work at Westinghouse, etc.\n\nWill Kunz was at OSU as a guest instructor in the 70s, when we had a large number of well-known guests on a regular basis. Unfortunately the funds for such things dried up years ago. We do still have guests, but now it's just for a day ot two, as opposed to a whole academic term.\n\nFinally, the Dept of Design will celebrate its 40th anniversry in 2008. You're invited to join us for the various events.\n\nPaul Nini  \nDept of Design  \nOhio State Univ\n\n"
