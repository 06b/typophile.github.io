  "content": "I’m picking through the bone yard and looking at some rejected work. These concepts were for a film production company that focuses on horror. The name relates to a ghost story where a woman is picked up by a lake and dropped off. The driver later discovers that she was a ghost.\n\nAnyway, we went through several ideas and ended up going with a type treatment that was finally bastardized and combined with some animation.\n\nPlease, if you have a moment, comment on which are the least appropriate. I’m looking for a kill list, but like the depth of development in general.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419030532im_/http:/typophile.com/files/concepts_3933.png)\n\n",

Clearly there are too many ideas—ghost story, lake, film production. The illustrated version with the woman is fabric rather than butt, but it doesn’t read well or reduce well. The other issue is that she needed to be wet from having come from the lake. Freakin’ Hollywood!\n\n"

I like the other two for different reasons. The one Nora highlights is the most simple, but the other might really be amazing to translate into motion. Well, I guess they both would but I'm seeing something different from each.\n\n"

Landing lightly on the bottom of the screen, then next to it, the words, Whiterock Lake fade in.\n\n-Corny, but it sounds like something I'd see in the opening credits.\n\n"

They stop and give her a ride. As they drive along toward the address she has given they turn to the back seat and notice that she is gone, but the seat of the car is damp.\n\nThe next day they go to the address and inquire to find that there was a young woman that had lived there, but she had died in an auto accident years ago on the the same night when the car she was riding in drove into the lake.\n\nHere are some cool images.\n\n[http://www.whiterocklake.org/?page\\_id=564](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419030532/http:/www.whiterocklake.org/?page_id=564 \"http://www.whiterocklake.org/?page\\_id=564\")\n\nYou can google and see what Aaron came up with. He does character design/visualization and was understandably set on rendering something himself. Although I suggested the type treatment what is on the page is not what I gave them to work with so no nasty comments.\n\n"
