  "content": "hy i study design in darmstadt/germany. this semester i try to handle pixelfonts and handwriting. their properties and what happens if i mix them.\n\nbut before i can plant my pedigree i have to do some research about the basics of pixelfonts.\n\n- who inveted the first one? (i guess there where some bevore the computer)  \n- which development they made over the years? (the fonts)\n\nits pretty hard to find something in the internet. maybe some of you have some information.\n\ncheers  \njens\n\n",

You'll find plenty of screen grabs from both technologies on the Web.\n\n"

There were also lighted signs composed of rows and columns of light bulbs before computers. I have also seen different colored bricks used to spell out a company name on old chimneys and buildings.\n\nEven though we associate this kind of letterform with computers, it was not a recent idea. I'm not sure exactly when bitmap letterforms began to be used with computers; probably the early 1970s. It was more common for early CRT displays to use vector-based letterforms because it used less memory. These would be simple connect-the-dot designs, not like modern outline fonts.\n\nI don't think it would be possible to say who \"invented\" pixel fonts. The idea was known for a very long time before computers existed and I'm sure was simply used because of its natural affinity with the kind of displays used with computers.\n\n"
