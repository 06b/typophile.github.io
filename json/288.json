I was thrown by the site design at first. whether it's in-progress or intentionally old-school in it's approach, it works very well as is.   \n   \nthe type is quite nice. the low-tech revivals are done with a lot of personal style (the site design makes infinitely more sense once you see their fonts). I'm not quite sure about their \\*text\\* label. I suppose text might be acceptable nomenclature in web terms, but I'm not going to be using them anytime soon for any of my upcoming book jobs!\n\n"
