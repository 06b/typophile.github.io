  "content": "I'm looking for a quotation mark that works as a display-size graphic and pairs well with Ed Roman and Ed Gothic:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/getimage%5B1%5D_5888.php_id=830)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/getimage%5B1%5D_3518.php_id=829)\n\nI've made Ed Roman warmer and heavier with an outline stroke (not shown). And don't worry about the quotation marks being \"fun,\" I can just shift one glyph higher than the other to make it fit in.\n\nUnfortunately, the quotes on these fonts don't quite work for me, nor does anything I currently have installed. The best I could come up with, oddly, was Stencil, the \"it came with the computer\" font. Here's Ed Gothic, Ed Roman and Stencil:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/quotes_4351.png)\n\nGothic's to stubby, Roman's too wiry, and Stencil has about the right proportion, but the tail (finial? hangy-down? hangy-up?) should probably come to a point, or near-point. Here they are, more \"fun\":\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150305002147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/funquotes_5194.png)\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",

      "content": "It's more or less the same stubby character as Ed Gothic. I should stress that the quotation mark will be a standalone graphic. The actual quotation text will be set in a web font, likely Georgia. The quotation mark should really just look like what an average user would expect it to look like: a big ball with a curl coming out of it, tapering to a point ... and then a twin next to it.\n\n"
