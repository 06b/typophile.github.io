It just makes me feel safer because an incomplete copy is clearly marked as incomplete.\n\nThe audience are recruiters who rush through resumes are an alarming pace. From what I can gather, their eyes track the page top-left to bottom-right and if they get distracted or did not see what they are looking for, its in the bin.\n\nHowever, with such a short collection of pages, some folio positions just do not work. For example, if you bleed the right hand edge then Page 3/3 causes them to look for Page 4/3 and they get confused (witnessed it first hand). While that is not an immediate problem for most jobs, its clearly flawed and may reflect badly if applying for design-related jobs - so its in the bin.\n\nSo where should they go? :)\n\n",

Those awful personnel departments tend to sift through resumes before giving a list to recruiters.\n\nSometimes they OCR the document and use computers to scan for keywords. That's a problem that my thread is not addressing :)\n\nHi Jackson, could you please elaborate? I will confess to having too much to put in my resume. My last career advisor was really stuck and told me to take out education because it was the weakest part (I am postgraduate).\n\n"
