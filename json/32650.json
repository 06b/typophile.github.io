If you need to use 0,0 as a reference point, you don't need the (movable) reference point to do it. For example:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191222im_/http:/typophile.com/files/referencepoint_6687.jpg)\n\nNote that \"zero point\" is one of the choices for a transformation.\n\n"

In the manual, the term \"reference point\" is used interchangeably to mean either the movable reference point (the little asterisk icon you can move around) or any other reference point. It's a bit confusing that one of your choices for a reference point is the reference point.\n\n"

It tells you that the reference point is useful for a symmetrical letter--though I'm not sure why as you have the option of rotating etc relative to the center of the selection--but doesn't tell you that it's only of any use in restricted situations. Basically, you have to figure out how its functionality or lack of functionality fits into the job of developing a typeface. A manual ought to give the user more guidance on this.\n\nAlso because you never need to use it at 0.0 it makes more sense for it not to be always on the glyph window, but rather to be inserted optionally when you want it, at a desired rotation center, etc.\n\n"
