The position of the words makes it read backwards. Why is the text broken this way?\n\nSecondly, the text sizes make 'people' the least important part of the logo. At small sizes that word is going to become unreadable.\n\nThirdly the mix of type styles seems not to be purposeful. Why is 'people' in caps? Why is 'moving' in a serif font?\n\nFourthly, what are the segment and the swoosh supposed to represent? Why is the graphic element obscured by the text? It looks very cluttered.\n\nFifthly, the m and p look poorly executed custom jobs.\n\n"

Other than the point about the M being too far removed from the rest of the word 'moving', making it appear as 'Oving', I'd also sat that the Enlarged First Letters of each word are too disparately sized for it to be cohesive enough as a logo. In a word 'messy'.\n\nJH\n\n"

Hire a designer and trust their experience and expertise (it's what you're paying for) to design. And yes, as with almost everything in life, you generally get exactly what you paid for in terms of talent, experience, ability and quality of ultimate outcome.\n\n2. Take on a role of design expert or experienced art director in the project, if you've dedicated your professional life to the visual communications industry (or are secretly an unappreciated design genius—aren't we all). Otherwise, don't.\n\n3. Designers are not robots who \"input my visionary direction into software programs I can't be bothered to learn.\" (If this approaches your conception of design, just hire a nephew who knows some photoshop).\n\n4. And remember, the phrase \"designed by committee\" is never, ever, ever a compliment. (It also implies unsteady leadership and lack of vision). Even ten brilliant individual art director visionaries, if they're put on a committee with everyone's input given equal weight, will produce a compromised, negotiated, bland, mediocritized, unfocused pile of mush).\n\n4. Did I just invent the use of mediocre as a verb? Mediocritized?\n\n5. Final Step: If you've done step one and only step one, enjoy your organization's professional, apropos and unique new visual identity.\n\n"

This WILL come up at the next board meeting though, which is why we submitted it here and asked you all for your honest opinions. Sometimes knowing you are right, and why you are right isn't enough.

You will need to think a little harder about what makes the company unique though, then hopefully you can start to think about how those values are portrayed in the logo. That's what branding is. The current logo communicates no brand at all and it unlikely to succeed on its own. (What I mean is that unless somebody already knows about the company they are unlikely to suddenly get interested by seeing just the current logo.)\n\nThe unfortunate thing is, unless you have senior management buy-in you'll find that nothing can change. If they can't see for themselves that a new logo is an incredible asset, they're not going to be persuaded about something they don't understand.\n\nI'm speaking from the perspective not of a designer here, but of someone who has in the last six months taken an international company through a dramatic rebrand and met with a fair amount of resistance. I'm still not sure our Managing Director is convinced of the reasons we rebranded, but he does trust out judgment and that has been really important.\n\nIt sounds like the people in this company could benefit from talking to other organisations that have rebranded, to design agencies, and to their target market to find out their opinions. Our market thought our old brand was 'ok'. For a company positioning itself in the 'premium' category this was not what we wanted to hear.\n\nI hope I'm not teaching you to suck eggs :)\n\n"
