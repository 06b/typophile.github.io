I would welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n\nA few of the glyphs are identical to the equivalent Latin forms (which, I understand, is perfectly acceptable) but, as with the [recently added Greek character set](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054411/http:/typophile.com/node/121394), I've avoided bolting together segments from existing Latin glyphs to create a new Cyrillic one.\n\nThe first link shows a small sample text in Cyrillic; the second is the full character set from this font thus far, including Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (but not including small caps, alts etc).\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/2eb0b8d24d.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054411/http:/freepdfhosting.com/2eb0b8d24d.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/2eb0b8d24d.pdf\")\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/c934899649.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054411/http:/freepdfhosting.com/c934899649.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/c934899649.pdf\")\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the Cyrillic characters.\n\nI see the original version did not have the flare serifs characteristic of the current Cyrillic.\n\nAs for your Greek, the only unusual thing is the capital Omega that looks like an underscored O.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi John, I think you probably saw an older version of the Greek character set; the underscored /Omega/ has since been replaced with a more conventional form. The underscored style will be retained as an alt.\n\nAs for the flare serifs, this internal inconsistency was not intentional and has been corrected.\n\n[http://freepdfhosting.com/1eb695813c.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054411/http:/freepdfhosting.com/1eb695813c.pdf \"http://freepdfhosting.com/1eb695813c.pdf\")\n\n"
