The word at the bottom of the page is a cue for the first word on the next page, the idea being that you don’t miss anything while you are turning the page.\n\nA similar feature is found in most copies of the Qur’an, and provided an opportunity for scribes to demonstrate their skill in writing the same word in two different ways using dissimilation of letterforms.\n\n"
