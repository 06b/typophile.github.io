  "content": "Hi there,\n\nI was directed here because it appears that the members here are already familiar with the Olduvai font.\n\nI've just purchased a Mac version from Veer, and I'm having problems creating the banners using the Ornaments. When I type in the keys to create the banner ligatures, the characters don't appear properly. (The specified keys to create the ligature are \" and '. I've attached a jpeg to illustrate what I mean.)\n\nI feel foolish about asking for help, as I'm sure the answer is pretty obvious - but I'm at my wit's end. Any thoughts?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Olduvai_4713.jpg)\n\n",

I think I have the reason and solution for your problem:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133544im_/http:/typophile.com/files/olduvai_5755.gif)\n\nHope that solves it. Feel free to post here or contact me if you have any more questions. I'm revising the pdf field guide that accompanies the font to reflect your discovery. Many thanks!\n\nWith my monacle and pith helmet I remain,  \nRandy\n\n"

BTW, Illustrator is better for arranging the borders if you're going to be using them in a low resolution file. Rasterize them as a group after. At a course resolution in photoshop, it's difficult to line up the fine details.\n\nI'm curious to see what you're up to as well :-)\n\nRandy\n\n"

      "content": "Tiffany: thanks for sharing that. First time I've seen Olduvai used by a non-family member (haha! merry christmas, here's a font). Veer often presents the font by setting the ornamented initials as words instead of drop caps. It always strikes me as funny since I never intended it that way. Looking good in your hands despite the fact that letterspacing drop caps is explicitly forbidden in the EULA.\n\nPaul: Tiff owes a small part of her layout to you... The Pineapple! If I recall a raven flew up to me and mentioned you were planning to set some POEtry in olduvai. Is that nevermore?\n\nMarc: The in-use thing has come up before, but I think it gets shot down because of the potential for bragging and bashing. I really enjoy seeing the laborious fruit of longtime typophile regulars. It gives you just a bit more of a picture of who they are. I think it could work though. The format I'd like to see is by font in more of a blog-style. So each entry in the post would be an image example, with comments attached to each image (but hidden a click away).\n\nKind of like this site: [www.TheSuperest.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133544/http:/www.thesuperest.com/ \"www.TheSuperest.com\")  \nWhich is most excellent, and features regularly the exceptionally-lettered illustrations of Kevin Cornell ( [www.bearskinrug.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415133544/http:/www.bearskinrug.co.uk/ \"www.bearskinrug.co.uk\")).\n\n"
