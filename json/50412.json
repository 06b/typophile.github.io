It needs to be clean, slightly condensed and it should be capable of a some torturous glyph scaling in Indesign.\n\nthe only font i can think of is Vectora but I’ve used that to death. Anyone with any other suggestions?\n\nthanks for the time!  \narjun\n\n [‹ Knockout Serif version // Type Conversion](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192320/http:/typophile.com/node/50464 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [serif help! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192320/http:/typophile.com/node/50493 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Thank you so much for the interest. I have uploaded a few images of my project so you can have a better look. The lamp is called moonflower and has been displayed in the top most image. the second and third images were taken for the purpose of putting them as full bleed BG shots in my final presentation. A Few paragraphs of text would be running around the page in a good grid.\n\nI really liked Grotext! Thank you Stephen. I think that it would be perfect for the moonflower! Its the best image as of now. The presentation is in two weeks but will try and upload some trials with fonts in the near future. Do keep font ideas coming!\n\nThanks again!  \nArjun\n\nPS; More images can be found on the project blog - [http://protocoled.blogspot.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192320/http:/protocoled.blogspot.com/ \"http://protocoled.blogspot.com/\")\n\n"

And call me stupid if you like, but I don’t see the blackletter in there (and folks at my classes have been telling me I see blackletter everywhere).\n\nAnyway – I’d even try something really blackletter-ish. [Kaas](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192320/http:/www.vllg.com/Thirstype/Kaas/mudTyper+Weights/) comes to mind; see attach, I hope you don’t mind my quick comp. Maybe something lighter, but equally modern, would be very nice too.\n\nI like how the lettershapes interact with the origami-like shapes of the lamp (Hrant’s quote of the “crystalline flower” is a wonderful way of putting what I probably want to say here :) ), and how they’re oscillating between historical (& “home sweet home” style traditional) and techno aesthetics.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192320im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kaas1_6161.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192320im_/http:/typophile.com/files/kaas2_5864.jpg)\n\n"
