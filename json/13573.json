  "content": "I was told that the company I work for had commissioned the typeface Barmeno, for use as its identity system. Recently while perusing the Typophile forums I discovered that Barmeno was expanded into FF Sari. Barmeno contains NO italics and is exactly the same typeface as FF Sari. Why is this? Does anyone know any more details about this? Yves maybe? I ask because I use Barmeno daily and have to manually italicize Barmeno in Quark to set type properly.\n\n [‹ Starting a design studio](http://web.archive.org/web/20071118044251/http:/typophile.com/node/12471 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The first assignment: Caslon ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071118044251/http:/typophile.com/node/13420 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Reading that makes me understand the viewpoints of many of the members of Typophile. As I’m very new to the game my heart goes out to Nick curtis, Nick Shinn, Erik Spiekermann and many others who I’m sure this has happened to.\n\n"

And I think he licensed his designs to other companies that built the equipment (eg Berthold) and later on digital versions to others?\n\nWell, it’s late, so my thinking may be muddled...\n\n"
