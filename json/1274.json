Two years later, she left the Bauhaus early to pursue her own endeavours.   \n   \nFor more on Alma and her contribution to graphic design, we encourage you to visit [http://www.almaconservancy.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020090556/http:/www.almaconservancy.org/)   \n   \n   \nWe welcome your collaboration for the Typophile Calendars. Send your desktops to [submissions@typophile.com](mailto:submissions@typophile.com).   \n   \nPlease include your name, country, and the composition's historical context, if any.   \n   \n   \n [http://www.typophile.com/downloads/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020090556/http:/www.typophile.com/downloads/)\n\n",
