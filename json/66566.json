Your examples have the same general shape as Report, but one difference that jumps out at me is that in all these example fonts (described in layman's terms by a non-typographist [i.e. me]), all the lines in the characters are exactly the same thickness, whereas in Report they are weighted differently within individual characters. I think that very factor is what has always given it the eye appeal for me.\n\n"

In other words, it isn't supposed to be smudged, but clean. Saving the jpeg file off and shrinking the display down to something more reasonable might give a better feel for the overall general typeface appearance.\n\nBy the way, I did see a lot of Magda-like typewriter copy during the same general era (70s-80s) in various paper newsletters to which I was subscribed, almost all from Europe. That particular typeface didn't seem to catch on as well here in the 'States.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi there; I'm the creator behind the SV Basic Manual font. In fact, it is one of my very first attempts at drawing a font, and it probably shows. I did not personally own a typewriter with this font (and thus I was not aware of its name), but I had a computer manual written with it. A particularly important problem was that at the time I did not own a scanner; however, I had access to a fax and a modem, and so I managed to get a bitmap template by faxing to my computer! Obviously, the resolution was very limiting, and some of the subtleties were no doubt lost.\n\n(The more recent update, version 1.1, included vowels with ogonek, since that was requested. I don't remember doing any other improvements.)\n\nI can not make any promises, but it would indeed be interesting to attempt to redo the digitization from scratch, now that I have a high-resolution scanner, and perhaps at least a little more experience with vector drawing. To that end, if anyone could donate high resolution scans of a, preferably, first generation document, I would be very grateful: in particular, I need examples of @|•½¼²³¶§†, which did not appear in my manual; also (if they exist) \\_\\`^~, as well as any other rare characters.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm afraid the current version will have to suffice. I'm not aware of any other digitization of \"Report\".\n\n"

      "content": "Oh, I see; thanks anyway!\n\nI have now done some research, and it seems that the 1980's BASIC manual that I had as my template when I made the SV Basic Manual font most likely was printed with a Swedish Facit typewriter. According to the typewriter experts I consulted, this particular font was very common with the Facit typewriters, if not the standard during this period, and it went under the name \"Cubic 10/12 FA 46\". As edo\\_nick rightly points out, it is not exactly identical to Report; most notably, the numeral \"1\" looks like the letter \"l\" in Report, but in Cubic it is different. (Curiously though, the glyph \"½\" in Cubic has the \"l\" shape; yet it is not identical to the ½ of Report, for that one has a slanted solidus, while that of Cubic is horizontal.)\n\nEvidently, it was not at all uncommon that different typewriter manufacturers had similar fonts, which all differed in some small details. For example Triumph-Adler has a font named \"Prestige-Cubic\", which is identical to Report in some respects, and to Facit's Cubic in others; yet it has a \"W\" and \"w\" which are wider at the bottom than those of either Report or Cubic.\n\nI have now acquired a nice specimen from the Facit typewriter, which I intend to digitize. (And so replace SV Basic Manual, which I already regard as deprecated.) I guess that with an alternative glyph shape for \"1\" it will pass as a remake of Report as well. If the administrators agree, I will start a separate thread in the Critique forum, where I'll discuss this digitisation process.\n\n"
