Jim called looking for advice on the landor thing, and wanted to know how he could get neville from london to texas which I turned into Jim coming to my house. I also rounded up Matthew Carter and Alvin Eisenman to review the Landor work, so by the time Jim left, Landor was unhired, Venus was Vonnes, 54 styles of tweeked Venus and Neville was doing the ID.

How many times have you been looking at the menu for 10 minutes, and realized you haven't read a single thing, and have no idea what you want to eat, then end up ording something just because the name has a very interesting \"y\" in it?   \n   \n(BTW, what is it about menus that they are almost always designed to be difficult to read?

The biggest challenge being restaurants change menu items so quickly to keep 'ahead' of the competiton and keep the regulars interested . . .   \n   \nI'm also convinced menus serve as more of a branding piece than for function at some places . . . Counterpoint to that, I've said it before, I'll say it again, there is an entire industry in Chinese menus which I am repulsed and strangely attracted to simultaniously . . .
