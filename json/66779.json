  "content": "The mission of Center for Advanced Design Research and Evaluation (CADRE) is to develop and execute relevant original research in the areas of architectural and engineering design solutions having an impact on: end users, including occupant well-being and user effectiveness; operational performance; and sustainability of the built environment. Dissemination of this new knowledge to end users and the design community is inherent in our organizational intent.\n\nAfter much discussion we decided the logo needed to be bold, technological, and organized. It could represent in an abstract fashion the ideas of dissemination, the center point for emerging ideas, a surveyors benchmark, form which new directions are established and buildings built.\n\nAlso, it is important to establish Cadre as a word and not just an acronym. Cadre vs C.A.D.R.E.\n\nMy concept originated from abstracted arrows that pointed to new directions, all emanating form the word Cadre.\n\nColor has not been applied yet. There is no budget for this. I am working on this probono through my firm.\n\nI would love to hear some thoughts from any one out there. Does it read? Should it be less legible? more? any comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nC L Jones\n\n",

If it gets to heavy it looses something, so finding that happy medium has been rough. Here is a heavier version.\n\n@ Cuttlefish\n\nSure it will fax. If you know how to operate a fax machine. If you are referring to the fact that the light gray might drop out, well you might be right. I will look at that when i start applying color.\n\nThanks guys.\n\n"

      "content": "This is looking interesting, but I'm bothered by the gray lines being flat rather than isometric. I say that as someone with a degree in architecture so it's something that stands out to me immediately.\n\nAlso, have you looked at it as one color rather than the gray and black? I think it might be a bit more impactful that way.\n\n"
