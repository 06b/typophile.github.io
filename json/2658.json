How exactly does this work?   \n   \nLet's say a large corporate customer wants a specific type family for 200 CPUs, but doesn't want to shell out for a full-family, 200-CPU license. Can they hire a type designer to design a 'similar' face for a flat fee and use it however they see fit on as many CPUs as they can plug in?   \n   \nAnd how long would it take to design such a similar family of type? And space it and kern it? That's \\*a lot\\* of work. Anyone know how this works?   \n   \nbj   \n   \nthis concludes this edition of WNL, wednesday night links + google links = zzzzz   \n   \nany volunteers for some more links next wednesday night? WNL is specifically designed to give typophiles something to do at work on Thursday and Friday.\n\n",
