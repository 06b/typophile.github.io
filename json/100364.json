This looks handwritten to me, but I would be so grateful if anyone could point me in the direction of a similar looking script, and if possible where to purchase/download it.\n\nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bergdorf1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420024952/http:/typophile.com/files/bergdorf1.jpg) | 102.29 KB |\n| [bergdorf2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420024952/http:/typophile.com/files/bergdorf2.jpg) | 49.86 KB |\n\n",
