Closest I was able to get was [Atrament Bold glyphs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013125028/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/atrament/std-bold/glyphs.html) which has generally matching WIAR, with the round-top A as an alt. Also [Atrament font design info](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013125028/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/atrament/).  \nAtrament does not have an N with a diagonal that intersects the right stem above the baseline. I found a font with this N although at a higher point than your image, together with a round-top A: [Rockport BF](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013125028/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/rockport-bf/).  \nDon\n\n"
