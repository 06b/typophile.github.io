Among the many uses I have for it, one of them is keeping a scrapbook of everything typographically interesting I come across. If you’d like, you can explore it here:\n\n[http://www.evernote.com/pub/mrh/typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012064103/http:/www.evernote.com/pub/mrh/typography \"http://www.evernote.com/pub/mrh/typography\")\n\nOr, you can grab the rss feed for it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012064103/http:/feeds.feedburner.com/evernotetypography).\n\nI update it on a highly irregular basis.\n\n",
