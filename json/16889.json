  "content": "What is the proper way to set things such as “VoiceXML” or “VoIP”? With other acronyms, I use true smallcaps with extra letterspacing. However, I’m not sure what to do with the lowercase letters in the middle of the acronyms. Do I set it all in smallcaps? Do I ditch the small caps and set it using both u&l?\n\nI’m redesigning my resume (a computer networking guy) as I read through Bringhurst’s book (with an interest in type). In the “Skills” area of my resume, I have a bunch of acronyms listed such as TCP/IP, BGP, HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, etc. Included in this list are the above mixed case acronyms.\n\nAny pointers would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,  \nPete\n\n [‹ Oversized quotation mark](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605054746/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16812 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Creating Titling Caps and Small Caps from Standard Roman ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605054746/http:/www.typophile.com/node/15935 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Besides, do you REALLY think that anybody who reads your résumé (besides, perhaps the editors of _The Chicago Manual of Style_) is going to have any better idea of the RIGHT way to do it?\n\n"
