Mostly I’m impressed, not just by the quantity, but with the quality and the direction it’s moving. Looks like the future is going to be open source.\n\nSome exemplary posts so far:\n\n[Garamond](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Garamond)  \n [Bembo](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Bembo)  \n [Baskerville](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Baskerville)  \n [Blackletter](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Blackletter)  \n [Futura](http://web.archive.org/wiki/Futura)  \n [X-height](http://web.archive.org/wiki/X-height)\n\nLooking forward to seeing this thing grow.\n\n",
