  "content": "Hello everyone, I have posted iterations of this design a few times, and I am a bit of a crossroads.\n\nThis is a rounded sans-serif, which there are of course many these days. I'm trying to differentiate it from the others by adding a humanist swelling of the rounded terminals. This also more directly communicates the 'routing' effect that the design is inspired by.\n\nI'm curious to hear what people think, does it add or detract from the design?\n\nI don't know that it will make a big difference when printed at 7 pt, but my thought is that it will add to the overall character of the font.\n\nAt the same time, I still like things about the earlier version better. (I haven't spent as much time on the newer one, so some of the characters are a little too dark, other may still need some redrawings)\n\nKudos to anyone else who is on here at 9:30 on a Saturday night!\n\nJeremy\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [router13.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123145426/http:/typophile.com/files/router13.jpg) | 21.99 KB |\n| [router13.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123145426/http:/typophile.com/files/router13.pdf) | 37.96 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "I think the swellings do indeed add character to the font. Somewhat reminiscent of marker writing on paper that sucks the ink up a bit.  \nI certainly like that one better then the straight stroked versions, those always seem a bit too geometrical for my taste.\n\nAnd by the way, kudos to people who are online at 9:30... it's 3:52 in the morning here.. ;) Need sleep.\n\n"
