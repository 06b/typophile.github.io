      "content": "Hi Andrej  \nThis is neat, I like it. Looks like it would be nice for headlines. Your s is really nice.  \nHere are my observations, as a not-very-accomplished type designer:\n\nAmpersand looks like there's a section missing.  \nB and G look narrow. W also looks a bit tight.  \nS could do with a couple of units more weight on the spine.  \nI find a's tail a bit on the long side.  \nm is very skinny.  \nr looks like a cut-off n.  \nI would have a straight y. x looks dark.  \nI find the curved terminals on gjt a bit tight.  \nI like your cedilla. The other diacritics look a bit close to the base glyphs.\n\nHope that's a bit useful! :)\n\n"

      "content": "IMHO, ‘a’ has potential, but it needs a little more of work. No doubt about ‘r’: it looks really weird. Ring: too little white space. Agree with Bendy about ampersand.\n\nThe linguistic note: “Cabrón”, at least in Mexico, has a lot of meanings, but certainly it is a bad word in some circles… If you call “cabrón” a very good friend, it’s ok (“mate” meaning). If you call “cabrón” your boss, you’re dead (“asshole” meaning).\n\n"

      "content": "In Spain and Portugal respectively, \"Kabron\" and \"Cabrão\" is a very insulting word. It means a guy that is doing sex with the wife of a married man. May be it means something like \"\\*\\*\\*\\*\" in English\n\nTalking about the topic, it seems to me that the lower case letters and upper case letters are two completely different typefaces.\n\nThe 'a' seems very weird. It creates a lot of space between it and the next letter, due to its tail, and you may consider doing an exception for its kerning.\n\nNow i am looking more attentively and seems to me the first example of text has an exaggerated kerning, unlike the rest of the document.\n\n"

The bowl of the R are too big comparing with the P which one should be the biggest one between the B and the R. Take care of the design, look at the top of the C and the S those terminal should be in the same way at least the same size. The top of the C is close and the G is open, you should choose one of the two and use it for all. In the s the horizontal seems too big or her spin is too small. Keep going.\n\n"
