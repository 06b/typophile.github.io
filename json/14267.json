Comments in threads are still not pushed to the feed, but we’re working on this since everyone seems to be asking for it.\n\nWhat did we fix? This feed used to only show the “handpicked” threads from the home page. Now it should give you a pretty good pulse on what is happening across the site.\n\n",
