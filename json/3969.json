  "content": "I find very interesting that Akzidenz Grotesk, a truly seminal typeface for the development of sanserif, has no known author.   \n   \nBerthold released it in 1896 (or 1898?-the date varies depending on the source, any ideas why?)   \n   \nWhat was the context in which it appeared? Robert Bringhurst in The Elements of Typographic Style relates it to the Realist movement in art, do you know of any book or article in which this is further discussed?   \n   \nAnother question for typophiles: Is the g of AG one of the firts in having a tail instead of a ring? What is the origin of that transformation?   \n   \nThanks a lot\n\n",
