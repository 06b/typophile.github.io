  "content": "Hi all!  \nI recently made a visit to a used/old book store. By the way, we have a word in portuguese for these special stores, that sell old and used books: alfarrabista. Does English have a special word for this?Other them second-hand bookseller or antiquarian?\n\nI found some old pages from a catalogue with some typefaces and ornaments. I made a digitalisation of some to share with the “commutity”...  \nEnjoy\n\nAntónio Fonseca\n\nPS- As soon as I get more free time I will digitalise the rest...\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [alfarrabista1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211630/http:/typophile.com/files/alfarrabista1.jpg) | 406.44 KB |\n\n [‹ Typophile search](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211630/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41636 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Question mark forms ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203211630/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41548 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
