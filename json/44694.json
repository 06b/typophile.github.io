Can anyone help?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Imagem 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20130118043054/http:/typophile.com/files/Imagem%201.png) | 146.26 KB |\n\n",

It resembles Neon that someone re-drew as a Prisma-style font. I thought someone once described a way to fake this look in Illustrator with some sort of outline/offset technique, but I have no other ideas, other than check freebies at Dafont.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
