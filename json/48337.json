      "content": "Up until sometime in the mid-90s, Adobe had the dandiest little catalogues they would send you with nearly every product or font you bought. You'd have the type, a few lines, and most important of all, the package number -- only if you have the package number can you quickly find the folder you want on Font Folio. Then, for some reason nobody could ever figure out, they revised them to delete the package numbers, making them almost useless. Then they stopped printing them at all. In those days too they had the Font & Function magazine, which came out quarterly and was available to practically every registered customer.\n\nAdobe can unquestionably afford to make these products again, and they certainly sold a lot more fonts in those days. They made it _so much easier_ to find a type or just browse and get interested in a type. Lots of corporate customers who had little interest in type bought type because of Font & Function. I find these resources infinitely more valuable than pdfs.\n\n"
