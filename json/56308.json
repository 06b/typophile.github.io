  "content": "I’m confused by the way Fontlab handles kerning classes in the OT kern feature. After I generate kern and select the kern feature in the OT menu no list of class definitions appears in the lower box. If I use “Import Fontlab Classes” the class definitions appear in the box, but when I compile the OT code I get this warning: “[WARNING] Glyph class @NSGothic1L-Ultra redefined [/Users/jpad/Documents/design/fonts/FontLab\\_settings/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea 26]”\n\nI have not unchecked “Add all glyph classes to Opentype feature definition code”. What’s going on here?\n\n",
