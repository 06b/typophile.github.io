A few, such as Adobe’s, allow you to modify the original font, as long as it’s for your internal use and you’re not redistributing it. (Note: check the license itself for details.)\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

I think it’s often safest to say ’most’ - there are some pretty kooky EULAs out there.\n\nYip, and I’ve got one of them. It’s pretty rare, but Ross Mills and I decided to restrict the use of my new font, [Restraint](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203121241/http:/www.bantjes.com/index.php?id=174), in that for the basic licensing you can’t use it as a major or sole element for logos, major ad campaigns or items for sale ... altered or unaltered. I was really torn about this, because as a designer I recognize how jarring that seems, but ultimately he convinced me. P22 also has similar restrictions on some (all?) of their fonts.\n\nHowever, to make things more confusing, with Restraint, the issue is surrounding its use, so if it \\_wasn’t\\_ an identity, then we would have no problem with someone modifying it in e.g. Illustrator for a poster or invitation or whatever.\n\n-marian\n\n"
