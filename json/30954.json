The openness of the characters and their proportions makes it an ideal typeface for use in small print. The clarity of classic sans serif faces ( [Frutiger](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230108/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frutiger) and [Univers](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230108/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Univers)) and the humanistic characteristics of old styles ( [Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230108/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Garamond) and [Granjon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230108/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Granjon)) were the inspiration for this contemporary design that is equally at home in a headline or a body of text. The FF Kievit family includes six weights, true italics, old style figures and small caps -- everything necessary for even the most demanding typography.\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Kievit at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230108/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=FF%20Kievit)  \n [FF Kievit fonts at FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414230108/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/kievit)\n\n",
