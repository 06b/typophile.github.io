After continuing doing logo roughs I noticed that unless there is a very obvious graphic device that says “travel company” the name will always invoke that lawyer/accountant aesthetic. I suppose a lot of the descriptive elements about the nature of the company will be communicated through the implementation. By _slick_ I mean minimal graphic styling with careful consideration of the chosen copy, stock and finished techniques with a strong emphasis on high quality (descriptive) photography.\n\nPerhaps I should include a tagline at this stage to help?\n\n"

Cheers\n\n@bobbybobo — As mentioned above the name itself does carry a stigma of law-firm, etc so I’m not that worried about that at the moment. I will take your advice on colour and post up some colour variations soon.\n\nThe swash _r_ at the beginning had a countering swash coming from the stroke on the _d_ which I took out because I felt it wasn’t working. Below is a sample of it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081210105322im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture_1_3631.png)\n\nI will take your point on the weight irregularities (this was my main reason for posting here) as I am fairly new to designing type I couldn’t quite pick out what it was. I work with two other colleagues on identity work, we each present our own unique ideas to the client and this was my idea. The two others use graphic elements so I thought I’d try using solely type.\n\n"

Joining the ‘W’ and ‘Y’ creates unusual emphasis on that character combination which is not something I want to point out. Due the the quite chunky serifs the space where the letters join looks crowded and I would have to counter that by tracking the rest of the letters closer together which I feel is going in the wrong direction.\n\n@schrockwell — I have looked at the shortened version before and felt that the company is relatively new and shortening the name will further mask the actual name of the company. It’s not something I’m ruling out though. Using this version the swash on the ampersand also creates unusual prominence to the ‘W’ while alienating the ‘E’. In general, as a rule, I’m trying not to kern everything close together. As substantial as the letters are, I want to keep a lightness to them also.\n\nAs always appreciate the comments. Thanks\n\n"
