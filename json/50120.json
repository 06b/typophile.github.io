  "content": "Hi guys,\n\nNever asked for a font ID before, but to be honest I have no idea how else to find this out. While in St. Prex, Switzerland, we visited a gallery which had this poster outside. The typeface is beautiful! I'd love to know what it is - can anyone help?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101123150044im_/http:/typophile.com/files/andi_id_1_4281.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101123150044im_/http:/typophile.com/files/andi_id_2_5559.jpg)\n\nThanks in advance - sorry if it's something really obvious. Both me and my girlfriend thought it looked familiar, but couldn't place it.\n\nAndi [[semibad](http://web.archive.org/web/20101123150044/http:/www.semibad.com/)]\n\n",
