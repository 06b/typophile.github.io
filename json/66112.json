  "content": "From a Microsoft typography site:  \n [TERMINALS  \nare not what you think they are. They are a particular kind of curved stroke. They are not even curved strokes that end. They are certainly not strokes that end in serifs.  \nThe most sensible terminal is a tail (see above). But the part of a C before it hits the arm (see above) is a terminal. Strokes at an edge seem to be eligible for 'terminal status'. The part of an S after the spine and before it hits an arm is a terminal. The ear on a g is a terminal.  \n A swash, (like those with which, by extending the serifs, ITC ruined Bookman), is a terminal. A loop, as that which wraps round the counter of a Baskerville g, is a terminal. A link, as that which joins the two parts of a g, is sometimes a terminal.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015110107/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/glossary/ch4.htm)\n\nHuh? I thought terminals described the handling of the ends of strokes. Is the link between bowls of a lowercase /g/ really a terminal?\n\n",

      "content": "_Is the link between bowls of a lowercase /g/ really a terminal?_\n\nThe description cited refers to the ‘ear’ of the g, not the connection between the bowls. The ear is the bit that sticks off the top right.\n\nI disagree with the terminology as used on the MS site. The ear of the g is most often, well, an ear, not a terminal. It doesn't terminate anything; it is its own thing (in certain styles of g, the ear does form a terminal, i.e. if the top of the bowl flows into the ear independently of the right side of the bowl, in which case the ear forms the terminal of that stroke, but in most styles of g the ear is an appendage stroke, not a stroke terminal).\n\nI would say that a terminal is the termination of a stroke, and hence a terminal can take many different forms. There are ball terminals and spike terminals and curled terminals and blunt terminals and, yes, serifed terminals. What determines that something is a terminal is that it ends a stroke. This is the only criterion by which you can determine, in a given situation, whether something constitutes a terminal or something else, e.g. an appendage. Structurally, a terminal is part of the stroke, i.e. something that if the stroke were drawn would be a continuation of the movement of the stroke, not a new stroke (a blunt terminal, of course, is a non-continuation of the stroke). From this it follows that serifs are sometimes terminals and sometimes not: it depends how the serif is constructed.\n\nFrom this it follows, of course, that in type terminals are parachirographic constructs. It only makes sense to talk about terminals in the context of a stroke model of letter description (which does not necessarily imply a stroke model of letter making). If there are no strokes, there are no terminals.\n\n"
