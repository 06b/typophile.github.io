  "content": "St. Luke’s gallery at 1715 Q Street NW in DC is closing up and a lot of great items are being sold via an estate-style sale. There are a lot of great prints, including three excellent strikings of Piranesi’s _Carceri_ series. Oil paintings from the late renaissance through the early nineteenth century are also on sale, along with all of the antique furniture and silver. Most of what’s on sale is conservative ”hotel art,” but if you like that sort of thing, this is a chance to get some of the original prints.\n\n [‹ Macworld Live Feed](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108180215/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30470 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Luxury font collection ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080108180215/http:/www.typophile.com/node/30533 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
