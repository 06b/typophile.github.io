I did some tests though and it doesn't save file size, so I guess it doesn't matter much. Except that a lot of people have told me my web images have to be 72 dpi.   \nThat's all the post is about. Nothing fancy!   \n   \n-b-\n\n"

Then Alessandro's post, with the comic sans reference, really threw me. I wans't sure if the content of the site was being held up for ridicule.   \n=====   \nDespite innapropriate typeface selection, scantips is a great website. Its been around for years, and is the place I point people to when they get a scanner for the first time.   \nAs someone who is often surrounded by computers, I'm regularly asked by friends, relatives etc to choose/buy/configure/mend a computer for them. Whenever this involves a scanner, I point them to scantips.com and save myself lots of explaining about resolution vs dpi etc.\n\n"

He said it's a real pain   \nin the butt.   \n   \nBest,   \nAS\n\n"
