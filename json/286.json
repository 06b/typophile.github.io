  "content": "A [schedule of events](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.typecon2003.com/programsched.cfm) has been posted on the [TypeCon2003](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.typecon2003.com/) website. 68 [speakers](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.typecon2003.com/speakers.cfm) and four days of great programming. Additional details about individual sessions will follow. We've also posted a list of [auction items](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.typecon2003.com/auction.cfm) donated so far. Our British friend [Dave Farey](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.housestylegraphics.com/) will serve as auctioneer once more, and it promises to be great fun. Some treasures await... it's also for a good cause, as all auction proceeds go to SOTA activities, such as subsidizing student admission, and keeping conference registration fees low for professionals.   \n   \nDigital Font Production 101 (Bitstream) and DFP 201 (FontLab), plus Ilene Strizver's Gourmet Typography workshop are now closed. The other [11 classes](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.typecon2003.com/workshops.cfm) are filling fast, and the conference is nearing capacity. Now is the time to [register](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020032310/http:/www.typecon2003.com/register.cfm) if you plan to join us in Minneapolis July 17-20.
