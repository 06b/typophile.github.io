  "content": "I'm asking because i don't know the answer (obviously), but does it matter which way your contours run? I have been under the impression that black contours should run clockwise while the white parts should run counterclockwise? does it really matter? i know the main thing is that the black and white contours run in opposite directions. anyhow part of my confusion comes from the diagram here:   \n [http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sudtipos.com.ar%2Fsubmitions.htm&lp=es\\_en&tt=url](http://web.archive.org/web/20050525001211/http:/babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sudtipos.com.ar%2Fsubmitions.htm&lp=es_en&tt=url)   \ni had to give you the translated version because i think it adds humor to the text, and i'm all for humor! anyhow, anyone know a \"definitive\" answer to this question?\n\n",

If they run in opposite directions, the contours don't merge, they intersect, and there's a lot of tedious clean-up.   \n   \nIt took me eight months, but I finally figured that out ;-)\n\n"
