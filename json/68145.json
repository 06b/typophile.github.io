Oddly, the E and K from [Letraset's Pump](http://web.archive.org/web/20150102093712/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/pump/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D71%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DRYTHEM%2520TRACK%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D21) seem to match, but I can't believe you'd mix and match two such similar faces like that. Maybe Blippo has alt characters I don't know about? Or maybe that's how they rolled in the 80s?\n\n"

I'm looking at an old specimen and all the characters in the sample are there.\n\nQuite often, with digitizations of old film fonts like this, when there are alternates, only one version of each character makes the cut, unfortunately.\n\n"
