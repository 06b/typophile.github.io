  "content": "Feedback please, cause I've been looking at this too long. Thanks in advance!\n\nI was asked to design a logo for an Seattle neighborhood blog to be called \"Around SODO\" - short for \"south of downtown\". It's a gritty urban hood known for a sports stadium, light industry & warehouses, Starbucks & Tully's HQ, light rail and freight rail, low-rent artists' studios, and a nightclub or two.\n\nI was going for an industrial yet eccentric, lively look. It's designed for screen resolution. I'm using grayscale so I won't be distracted by color at this stage.\n\nI have tried two stencil fonts for the letters SODO, one angular, one circular. I've tried angular and round fonts for \"around\" - lower case for informality. The graphics suggest travelin' around or city blocks, buildings, train tracks.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150316232926im_/http:/typophile.com/files/around-sodo-logo-ideas1_4145.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "No disrespect, but I've got to mention that someone has misinformed you about the origin of the neighborhood name. SODO is short for \"South of the Dome,\" not \"South of Downtown.\" The name was contrived by boosters of the warehouse district south of the since-demolished Kingdome Stadium. Although Starbucks Headquarters is definitely within SODO, the Showbox Theater is in downtown Seattle right across the street from Pike Place Market, which is miles north of the SODO area.\n\n"
