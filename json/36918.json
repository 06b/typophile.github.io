So of the instructors likely utilise Gerrit Noordzij's stroke theory in their approach, but that shouldn't be confused with calligraphy. I don't know very much about details of the the Hague programme, so can't speak in its favour or against it.\n\nI can, however, pretty unreservedly recommend the programme at Reading in the UK. Among other things you should note is that a remarkably high number of Reading graduates get jobs in the type business pretty immediately after graduation. Past graduates are currently employed at Adobe, Cannibal, Dalton Maag, Hoefler & Frere-Jones, House Industries, Linotype, Monotype Imaging, Porchez Typofonderie, etc., and we're interviewing a couple of the current students for a job.\n\n"

Of the 14 of us graduating this year, I think only half had ever tried making a typeface before. We have a few people just out of undergrad programs, a part-time architect, and a lot of graphic designers with with different levels of experience looking to shift our careers into type design or just add it to the mix of what we do. There's almost a thirty-year age difference between the youngest and the oldest, too.\n\n"

This reflects a strong view that typeface design is inseparable from its contexts, and that it is through these that one can best enter the discipline. In practical terms, a brief for a typeface is incomplete without some thought going into document types and genres, text modes, scales, and usage scenarios.\n\nWe are also looking for evidence of visual skills, good working practices, and the ability to sustain a long project with fluid milestones. And the ideal candidate will be a thinking designer, interested in reflecting on the process of design as much as explaining it. Age and background are no issue, so long as the typographic skills and the intellectual curiosity are there.\n\n"

      "content": "The Type & Media course at the KABK in The Hague embraces the philosophy of ‘learning by doing’, and will very much appeal to people who are looking for a practical study. A number of tutors (Petr van Blokland, Peter Verheul, Erik van Blokland, Frank Blokland) are former students of Gerrit Noordzij and his theories about stroke and contrast are utilised in the course.\n\nThe first semester is dedicated to learning the basics of type design and covers a wide variety of topics including letter sketching, Python programming, calligraphy, design philosophy, letter carving, type history and much more. The second semester is dedicated to the graduation project where students are guided individually by the tutors.\n\nThe Type & Media course is short, but very intense - students are required to attend the course for at least four days a week during the whole year. Next tot that visits to the Typo Berlin conference, Plantin Moretus museum in Antwerp, the Enschedé archive in Haarlem and other typographically interesting places are organised yearly.\n\nFormer students of the course have found jobs in the type industry, won international awards, or have published typefaces since. For instance - Artur Schmal designed Parry for OurType, Pieter van Rosmalen runs his own CakeType foundry, Andy Clymer found a position at Hoefler & Frere-Jones, Nikola Djurek designed Amalia (for OurType) and Porta (for Dutch Type Library), and Ian Party is a tutor in type design at the ECAL and runs the B&P Typefoundry. Laura Meseguer won a TDC award for Rumba, as did Christina Bee for her typeface Olga.\n\nConcerning what type of students are admitted to the course, like Gerri already wrote for his course in Reading: it’s difficult to define a typical profile. Affinity, passion, sincerity, personality and skill are all important.\n\n"

      "content": "@FeeltheKern  \nIt is hard to calculate exactly how much time is spent on calligraphic exercises during the first semester. Both Erik van Blokland and Peter Verheul cover it in their classes, but this is combined with exercises in drawing type on paper, exercises in spacing, contrast and more. These classes are not about mastering calligraphy, but about understanding the principles of type design by practicing and looking at calligraphy. I recommend looking at Gerrit Noordzij’s book ‘The Stroke’ if you want to know more about this subject. It’s widely available online, including [Amazon](http://web.archive.org/web/20150201021237/http:/www.amazon.com/Stroke-Theory-Writing-Gerrit-Noordzij/dp/0907259308) and [Typotheque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150201021237/http:/www.typotheque.com/books/the_stroke/).\n\nThese two classes combined take one day a week, and students can (voluntarily) attend Frank Blokland’s calligraphy classes as well. Considering the total amount of classes add up to four days a week, I’d say that calligraphy amounts to approx. 1/4 of the first semester. The second semester has virtually no classes in specific subjects.\n\n@Marilyn  \nNaturally, it helps when applicants have experience in designing type but it does not guarantee anything. And the same applies vice versa. Applicants need to show excellent design skills in general (a BA in a design discipine is highly recommended) with their portfolio. And next to that they need to be able to explain clearly the motivation for applying at Type & Media.\n\nPortfolios and motivations can be sent by e-mail or regular mail to Jan Willem Stas, the Type & Media coordinator. Or you can approach me (Paul van der Laan) or Erik van Blokland personally when you catch either one of us somewhere.\n\nVisiting the KABK Open Day on 26 January 2008 is highly recommended too.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>Paul, how large a written component is there in the Hague programme? At Reading, in addition to their type design projects, MA students also produce a research dissertation and a ’reflection on practice’ that documents their design process.</cite>\n\nIn the first semester students do a project where type history is involved and for this project a paper must be written. In the second semester – where students work on their graduation projects – they are required to document (and annotate) their design process. This project book (together with additional material required for the examinaton) must be presented at the graduation show.\n\nThat being said, I do have the impression that the course in Reading puts a higher emphasis on the written part, whereas the Type & Media course is more focusssed on the practical part of type design.\n\n"

If you leave from a town somewhere in between you will have to catch a slower train and I'm not sure how often they go an hour. So... Reading is actually well connected (same for some airports).\n\nExpenses (either tuition fee as living) are quite a lot higher in the UK than they are in the Netherlands, but it's worth it.. At least it was for me...\n\n"

The course sounds very attractive and reading through Sébastien Sanfilippo’s Weblog does make the course seem quite interesting. Hmm, I wonder if my parents will shell out cash for this.\n\nThanks Endre for starting this great thread and everyone else's input, I guess I should work on my portfolio for the rest of this semester to line up more with Typography.\n\n"
