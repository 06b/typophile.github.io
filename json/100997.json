These quirky script fonts simulate hand lettering from very different eras and are now brought into the digital age for the first time ever. A third font, [Catchwords](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421092633/http:/www.hamiltonwoodtype.com/catchwords.html) , brings a classic printshop resource into the digital designer's toolbox.\n\nDetailed information regarding these releases, including the \"Making Of The Font\" feature, can be found at the Hamilton Wood Type Foundry website: [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421092633/http:/www.hamiltonwoodtype.com/).\n\n[HWT Arabesque](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421092633/http:/www.hamiltonwoodtype.com/arabesque.html) is long lost Art Nouveau wood type from the Hamilton Collection. It evokes the excesses of Victorian design and the equally quirky 1960s Psychedelic era revival of the Victorian type styles. Many characters have a lively eccentricity that were all left true to the original design. Additional characters were designed to fill out the standard range of characters found in digital fonts. This font includes over 280 characters for full unicode support of Western and Central European Latin characters.\n\n[HWT Bon Air](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421092633/http:/www.hamiltonwoodtype.com/bonair.html) is a \"Mad Men\" era display font. It was one of a series of script typefaces cut into wood by the Hamilton Manufacturing Company for the Morgan Sign Machine Co. in the mid 20th Century. The font was issued with several alternate letters and ligatures to simulate the effect of hand lettering. Its lively strokes and odd details give it an exotic flavor suitable for advertising display work. The digital version includes all of the original alternates plus new characters to fill out a full European character set.\n\nCatchwords have always been offered alongside standard alphabets in wood type catalogs and so often appear on posters as a decorative punch that they have become part of the wood type vernacular. Words like 'The', 'And', 'To', 'For', and less common abbreviations could be inserted into a design along with decorative ornaments or stars when space was tight or to add variety in the design. [HWT Catchwords](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421092633/http:/www.hamiltonwoodtype.com/catchwords.html) features over 80 words based directly on designs offered by Hamilton and other wood type manufacturers of the 19th and early 20th Century.\n\n[Hamilton Wood Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150421092633/http:/www.hamiltonwoodtype.com/)\n\n",
