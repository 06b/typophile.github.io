I have settled for the time being on a basic two pane layout. I think it is quite good, but lately my judgement has been quite iffy.   \n   \nWhat do you think? Have you any recommendations?   \n   \nMatthew Brown\n\n",

      "content": "Matthew, I like your site, but I think you could actually \"play\" more with your typefaces. I get the feeling of \"work\" from the sans serif you have used, but I don't get \"play\" for the title \"play\". I don't get \"contact\" or \"all about me\". See what you can do, you may want to even do \"stuff\" by hand to personalize the \"about\", since it is about you. Plus I don't see much contrast. Just some things to think about.\n\n"

I also like understated use of Flash. One look at my very-much-in-need-of-an-overhaul website [www.aquatoad.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011014454/http:/www.aquatoad.com/) will confirm that.   \n   \nOn the downside, the colors arent my favorite, but they're ok. The html text (Helvetica I think, I can never remember) it dificult to read because of the tight spacing combined with grey color. Try verdana or georgia for better legibility.   \n   \nRegards,   \nRandy\n\n"
