      "content": "This is looking good! What's it for? I'm assuming text (and looking at the vertical metrics, I'm guessing books rather than newspapers)? It'd be great to have a bit more info.\n\nHere are a few comments, be sure to have salt ready.\n\nIt's great to see bdpq executed like this. If you don't mind telling, where do these come from (read, what other fonts were you looking at while making them)?\n\nI really like the \"a\" too – it's beautiful.\n\nI wonder about the terminals on the \"c\", \"f\" and \"r\" (the latter seems a bit too soft/bulbous/stubby in context). Have you tried using it on the \"s\" as well? Because with its rather long straight serifs, the \"s\" looks surprisingly hard/determined/closed in comparison. Then again, comparing with the caps (see below) maybe the \"s\" is cool, and it's that c/f/r terminal that is too soft?\n\nI'm not sure about the \"k\"; it looks beautiful by itself, but seeing it in text\\* I'm wondering if the leg might need more air.  \n\\* Assuming this is meant for text.\n\nLooking at the caps: Is it intentional that they're notably spikier/\"harder\" than the lowercase? The \"C\" looks especially Dracula-esque ;-). (It might also be leaning left a bit.)\n\nThere seems to be something slightly lopsided about the weight/contrast on the \"M\". Also, the heavy diagonal of the \"A\" might be a hair heavier than say the one on the \"N\"?\n\nThe \"Q\" is an interesting experiment! Something slightly Non-Latin-looking about it. But it doesn't quite work for my eyes yet. It has a slightly uncomfortable lean/twist, and looks kind of large; the tail may also be looping up a bit too much, almost clashing with say a following \"u\".\n\n\"T\" might be a bit wide? Also, I think your \"To\" is overkerned.\n\n\"W\" might be a bit heavy (though it might just look like that on my printout), and slightly unbalanced.\n\nBy the way, please switch off automatic ligatures in InDesign when making your samples as long as you don't have any. ;-)\n\nI'm beginning to note some interesting stylistic confluences in the Serif board. Must be something in the air. :-)  \nI'll be curious to see this progress.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Steven  \nThis is looking pretty polished already. It definitely looks friendly and useable. I love the proportions and design. There's a nice amount of space overall (because I'm currently struggling with spacing in my font!). Your a reminds me a bit of Chaparral.  \nThe two things that jump out at me are your Q and the vertical serifs. The Q I think could try a straighter southwest curve and tail. The vertical serifs on CEFGSTZs and z seem too straight to me, especially against the curves serifs of adhijklmnpqr and u. I'm not sure what the solution is, but perhaps they need to be wider and/or shorter?  \nCould W be a touch wider or Z narrower? Could the knee of k be a bit lower? I love the shape.  \nThe capitals with curves look like their sidebearings might be a bit wide.  \nThe two heavy strokes of M are not balanced, I think. L looks narrow.  \nWell done with this, it'll be really nice :)\n\n"

This is the regular weight but maybe I should make a little lighter version and make the semibold versionout of this!?\n\nI wanted to achieve a calligraphic, fresh and smooth look but on the other hand it should have a classic and not too clean apperance. Fonts I looked at were mostly Rialto, Maiola, Palatino and Dolly.\n\n\"cfr\" have pen shaped terminals and the \"s\" have a single sided serif like in venetian faces. If I would change the serif of the \"s\" and make it pen shaped like \"cfr\" the \"z\" would be the only letter that matches the spured serifs of the capitals.\n\nAnd thanx Hrant for warning me about the name Apollonia. Maybe someone has a better name for it. I am grateful for every suggestion.\n\n"

Because many people think they're watered down in terms of optical scaling. Or perhaps they were wide fonts? That reduces the x-height necessity; but your design is a bit on the narrow side. In my view 60-something percent is for normal text sizes (for a narrowish design).\n\nhhp\n\n"

But of course you'd have to believe that first. I actually do myself, but maybe not _that_ dark.
