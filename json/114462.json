  "content": "Hello fonty friends! I'm recreating some artwork provided by a client and identifying this font would be a great help. I think there are at least three - maybe four - different fonts here, but my main concern is the one for 'Debbie's\". (I'm curious about \"Hours\" too, but I can do that in another post.)\n\nI have checked Identifont, What the Font, and Bowfin Printworks (lovely site!). I also went through several other resources with no luck. A larger-resolution file is attached.\n\nThis is my first post but I'm looking forward to being a part of the community. Thank you in advance for your help!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053401im_/http:/typophile.com/files/font_check_forum_sm_4303.jpg)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Remachine Script \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053401/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [font\\_check\\_forum.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053401/http:/typophile.com/files/font_check_forum.jpg) | 1.3 MB |\n\n",
