I figure I'll offer it for free, since it's really more of a fan service than anything serious. That will also free me from the obligation to fill in all the annoying symbols and special characters. ;o) I've always wanted to release a font for free to attract some attention to my foundry, and this seems like a good PR opportunity.\n\nIf you see something that needs changing, do tell me, but make it quick. I expect to submit it within a day. I know the {B} is out of character, I'll definitely change that.\n\n",

In the latter case, if you'd list them here, I could do something about them and leave a better impression in the first place. ;o)\n\nI'm toying with the idea of pricing the font at $5, and putting up a password-protected sale that gives you the font for free if you say \"hello\" in Valyrian (which, frankly, is just a google away). That way, the target audience (Game of Thrones fans) are not discouraged by a credit card hurdle, while I might still make some money off the font later when the sale is over. ;o) Do you think that's too complicated?\n\nThe base price of $5 should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.\n\nPS: I updated the link above.

Considering you've spent more time on your commercial releases (even though you _are_ very fast) it just seems to make sense that this would probably be not as well-made, hence a poor reflection on what paying customers get. What I'm getting at is that even a free font shouldn't be too rushed.\n\nFree-versus-minimal\\_price: I used to think charging a nominal amount makes sense, but then I realized it's counter to the purpose of maximum-exposure. As for a \"Game of Thrones\" mini-barrier, I think that makes sense for a free font, but for a paid one it does seem like too much.\n\n> The base price of $5 should also clearly state that this is not the same kind of product as my $25 fonts.\n\nI think many people (in the realm of free/very\\_cheap fonts) don't pay that kind of attention. :-/ Just say it in the initial MyFonts description (which many free-font people won't even read though, but them you don't need to worry about impressing, since they very rarely buy anything - you just need them to expose your work through usage).\n\nAll that said, doing very steep introductory discounts does seem to be the go-to strategy on MyFonts:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/99369](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317231044/http:/typophile.com/node/99369 \"http://typophile.com/node/99369\")\n\nhhp\n\n"
