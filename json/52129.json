I hired myself to do the design and typesetting. As time went by, self-publishing authors in my locale who saw my books and liked the way they looked, began hiring me to produce their books, and with a track record and portfolio now, I began bidding on book production projects for historical societies and corporations. Eventually I began landing contracts with book publishing houses, though these are a result of connections I've developed over the years with people in the industry.\n\nGary\n\n"

      "content": "Two years ago, my brother published a poetrybook with a local publishing house. He asked me to design and typeset it. The publisher in question liked the design, and asked me to design more books for him.  \nI'm bascially one of his permanent designers now. It's a small publisher (a two man business), but they put out quite alot of books.  \nWho knows the work I do for him now, can provide me with more book design work for other publishers. I think this is a good way to get into it.\n\n"
