  "content": "Im designing a magazine for a school project and Im looking for a good text face to use throughout. The mag is on stylish nightlife which includes fashion, music, and trendy bars and clubs around the world. I want the face to be very clean and look fresh.   \n   \nFaces I have been playing around with include news gothic, franklin gothic, din, and monotype grotesque. Theyre all great faces and Im sure I'd do fine with any of them. I am just wondering what newer faces are out there that compare to these faces, especially as far as readability is concerned. Thanks!\n\n",

It's both a sans and a serif, though I don't know how readable it would be in a text setting.   \n   \nThe sans is quite nice, reminiscent of Gill Sans but more modern, and the Serif has a nice gothic look to it.   \n   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=priori](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213544/http:/www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=priori)\n\n"

Body & Soul was recently redesigned by Hopkins Baumann in NYC and it is using Alfon as feature text and display and I think it works great. If you can find a copy on the newsstand or in the health food store you should check it out.\n\n"

      "content": "I'd certainly love to see some long text set in Priori - it's one of those borderline text faces that needs to be seen in action to know for sure. A similar case is Emigre's \"Tribute\": when I first saw it the \"g\" raised a flag, but I had to see it in actual setting to be sure that it is indeed too problematic, especially when doubled. Borderline glyphs aren't so bad when they're in a font with many of them, but when there's one single \"spike\" it reduces the overall utility of the font with little gain in personality/focus. In the case of Priori the \"a\" seems to be such a spike to me - a little too far beyond the \"envelope\" made by the rest of the font, especially when you consider it's such a common letter.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "\\> Body & Soul   \n   \nI just checked it out. Alfon seems to work really well - better than what your (any?) website conveys. They should really use it for the whole thing, and dump that ridiculous Johnston for text. My only complaint with Alfon's Roman is that it's a bit light (or is that from their repro?), but then I realized that the whole magazine's look is light, so it's a great fit. As for the Italic, I really like it a LOT structurally -very progressive- but I do worry that it's a bit too close to the Roman for emphasis - just a bit. Great stuff overall!   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I am not doing this for anything commercial and therefore can't afford many typefaces on a student budget. I won't resort to stealing typefaces. does anyone know how someone in my postion can go about obtaining good faces for a very low price or better yet even free? I will hapilly buy the faces when I get out of school and start actually making money, instead of paying over 30 grand a year for education ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018213544im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)\n\n"
