It is probably the most elegant sans face I have seen. I wouldn't be far off the mark by saying that Optima is a sans version of Palatino. And Palatino is, with aknowledged subjectivity, the greatest serif face ever designed. It retains most of its charm in its digitized version (yes, updated charm, but still looking good), and in light of the absolute farce that is digitized Bembo and Centaur, that's saying alot.\n\nJust in case you're interested in a \\*good\\* Palatino, look no further than the version (Linotype) sold at Adobe: PalatinoLTstd.

It has arguably suffered the least from -and continues to serve well after- its \"Laser 35\" ubiquity. On the other hand, it has unfairly upstaged Aldus, its more textish sibling. Basically, its x-height is too big\\* and that limits it more to larger point sizes. Admittedly however that suits its calligraphic nature (the type of thing that looks best large... kinda like a dumb blonde though). Speaking of its calligraphic aspect, the most memorable experience I've had with Palatino is holding some sorts from a large metal size of it in my palm, and not being able to help feel \"this is wrong\"; on some level it just doesn't seem right to have such shapes carved/cast into a metal parallelepiped.\n\n\\* Which might have still made it great for really small point sizes, except its spacing isn't loose enough for that.\n\nhhp\n\n"
