  "content": "Hello, I found this vintage poster online, and I really like the font at the bottom of the poster. I tried a couple different methods to try and see if there was a font for it, but didn't find anything. I figured maybe someone has seen the font before or maybe something similar?\n\nThe link to the actual poster is below. I am also attaching a rough tracing of the font as a jpeg in case that helps.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n[http://www.enjoyart.com/library/travel\\_tourism/japanvintagetravelposters/large/Japan.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713162304/http:/www.enjoyart.com/library/travel_tourism/japanvintagetravelposters/large/Japan.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713162304im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FontTest-02_4026.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "\"Vintage\" is not very specific as to how old the poster is. But the style of the poster suggests that the lettering is part of the artwork.  \nIf you want a font that is close to the lettering I recommend [Pluto Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20140713162304/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/pluto-sans/). You will have to add the outlining effect.  \nDon\n\n"
