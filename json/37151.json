It's the first draft and some glyphs aren't that good, but here we go... ;-)\n\nComments, critics, ...\n\n",

Type needs a purpose before it can be good. Tell us how you see this type being used. If you are not sure - become more sure & then keep going. Or put it down & come back to it.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you James. I already had discovered an arabic feeling on it, but I didn't know [**Ogham**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417042023/http:/www.omniglot.com/writing/ogham.htm). It's a very interesting system... I'll look more carefully on it.\n\nThis is an old concept revisited - I think the first time I sketch something in this way was in 2003 - so, maybe it got a nice 'maturation time'.\n\nI understand when you said it's 'constructed', but I think it's 'constructed' only in the way I show it here - tape/ribbon. I'm trying to get it very fluid. Imagine it only with line, drawn by hand. Isn't it looks more fluid?\n\nGreat part of the glyphs I did with just one 'line', others I didn't found yet how to do it, but I think it has and interesting rhythm when composed... By the way, as I said, it's an experiment, and legibility isn't my priority. I'm highly interested first in concept, aesthetics and, of course, rhythm...\n\nMy first thought about the usage isn't like a font necessarily, but in 'live action', with tape over urban surfaces, like a mixture of typography/calligraphy, tags and graffiti. Something close to [**Sagmeister**](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417042023/http:/www.designboom.com/eng/interview/sagmeister.html)'s ones, but in a more 'artistic' way...\n\nWell, I'll get some ribbons to play with. ;-)\n\n"

If anyone have another way to do it, please let me know. :-)\n\nBy the way, I'm thinking about release it in 2 versions -- _ribbon_ and _sketch_ (with a calligraphic stroke) -- and both with 3 variants -- _short_, _medium_ and _long_ -- so you'll be able to compose your own rhythms... ;-)\n\n"
