I also like the grey you used for the shopping cart links; don't be afraid to work some of that in.\n\nMy only possible complaint would be that the edges of the page (on both the left and right) are not so well defined, and the eye tends to wander away a bit. But it is better than the all-centred layout of the old site.\n\n"
