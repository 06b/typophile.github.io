Also, what would be the right thing to do in this case if you like the look of Baar Sophia? Buy a license of Formata and use Sophia? The relationship between the two is not entirely clear to me anyway. I don’t have the time to compare glyphs, but that’s what I’d rather base any choices on than on the comment at dafont.\n\nBy the way, I think ‘mensch’ simply means ‘human being, person’ in German without any implications of integrity, honorability or honesty.\n\n"

      "content": "If you conclude that a font is plagiarized, compensating the designer of the original is nice but perhaps not enough, because people will see your use of the plagiarized one and you're not there to tell them what's wrong with it. The only way to mitigate using a plagiarized font is if that creates an opportunity to correct the transgression and/or raise general awareness of font plagiarism. But that seems pretty far-fetched.\n\nBasically it's tainted goods, and liking it just doesn't make using it OK. So what I would do here is buy Formata and do the modification myself (and of course not distribute my modified version). But for some people even that would be unethical (assuming the EULA does forbid any modification).\n\nIn any case I think it's worthwhile trying to get a straight answer from Lutz Baar. Especially considering it's free only for commercial use, and it does seem like the Madrid 2020 Summer Olympics bid logo uses it... What's interesting here is that the current owners of Berthold aren't at all shy about suing people... Maybe they're waiting to see whether Madrid wins the bid, which would greatly increase the value of lawsuit...\n\nhhp\n\n"

I’ve tried to match the x-heights and adjusted the spacing of Sophia:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012181417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/formataroman_3489.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131012181417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/formataitalic_5775.png)\n\nParticularly in the second image, I see a lot of similarities. Still, modifying Formata to look like Sophia does not seem to be a five-minute job, even for an experienced type designer. And for regular end users, it’s not feasible at all to do this. Maybe the only thing they can do is stay away from Sophia if they are convinced that it has come into existence in an unethical way. Or because they realise that it’s quite ugly.\n\n"
