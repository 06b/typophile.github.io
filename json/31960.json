I’m thinking ’vancity’...must be a custom hot-rod or auto dealership. Oh, wait. Camping. Huh. Must be an outdoors retailer. Wait...mortgages? Is it a lending bank? Where ever I am they believe I can? What does that mean?\n\nOH! There it is...several pages into the site:\n\n“Vancity is Canada’s largest credit union.”\n\nWhy didn’t they say that on the home page!?\n\nI’m always perplexed as to what passes for ’branding’ these days...\n\n"

      "content": "Vancity is quite well known in western Canada as a financial institution, and the confusion you faced would not apply in the market they are catering to. I could take another brand and ask the same kind of questions: Coke ... is this a drug related product.\n\nIt is a feature of the Internet that both local and international causes and products are intermixed. I would agree with you if Vancity were trying to expand their market base geographically ... even in eastern Canada they are poorly known. But they will (I expect) be trying to build market share within their existing geographic area.\n\n"
