Then I could use Beaufort® Regular as the text.\n\nI would like a little more contrast, however.\n\nI’d like a good sans serif text font to pair with Modesto Lite Expanded. I’ve tried Avenir and Neue Haas Grotesk, and I’ll try Hypatia, as suggested above. Further suggestions would be appreciated.\n\n"
