Anyone see any value here?   \n   \nI originally intended it to be a text face but obviously that won't work. Maybe a cheesy display face?   \n   \n ![mullet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414102808im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1498.jpg)\n\n",

I   \nwouldn't suggest trying to sell it, but for your own   \nuses, this would be great. the forms would really   \nbecome images of their if you used them in the right   \nway -- and, of course, for the right subject.   \n   \nsince this would not be a font to use for the purpose of   \nlegibility, you might want to funk-up the \"straight\"   \ncharacters (Uc H, I, L, T & Lc i, l, x, z). I'm not sure how   \nthese would look, but currently they look too boring in   \nthe context of this font.   \n   \ngreat link, Joe!\n\n"
