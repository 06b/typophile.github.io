A companion font, building on something good; updating rather than recreating.\n\nIt would be only new, original glyphs. There would be no ascii characters, only OT alts, and no original Cooper Black characters.\n\nI see potential legal problems. What about releasing it free (maybe a creative commons license)? How about naming?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks,  \nAaron.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418202756im_/http:/typophile.com/files/doodle_sticky_5740.jpg)\n\n",

I'm not sure about NY, but probably knockoffs like \"Cupertino\" (bundled with Corel Draw 3 [in words: three]) were available and legal there, too.\n\nIANAL, but AFAIK there will be trouble only if you use the actual name (Trademark) or some of the mathematical curve descriptions of an existing C B version. You could even add the ASCII characters if you traced them yourself.\n\nAndreas\n\n"

Still a bit wary of including all of the characters, though it would be clearly more useful to do that.\n\n@Bendy good call, I think the swashes I'd do would be more extensive, but it would be good to avoid duplicating this work.\n\nThanks,  \nAaron.\n\n"
