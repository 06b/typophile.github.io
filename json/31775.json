The pleasure of sitting and reading liner notes while listening is such a comfort, and I have learned so much about music while doing this. The sense of comfort and edification is so absent when one holds a little 5x5 CD booklet.\n\nPaul, I still remember vividly the first time I heard _Terry Riley in C_ when a friend lent me his record in 1970. Amazing how the music would have a certain mass and texture as all the musicians were momentarily making a certain set of notes, and then as soon as just one musician decided to go to the next figure, the entire personality of the music changed! Really fascinating and wonderful stuff.\n\n(For those of you who don’t know this piece, a small ensemble plays a series of figures [Is that what Riley called them? I think so.], really just a measure of notes. Each musician can start the figure whenever he/she wants, and plays it for as long as she/he feels like playing it. The rhythmic ins and outs and melodic echoes are fabulous. Probably not what you would put on to snuggle up to the Literary Lass on Nick’s album cover, though, unless she’s reading Ionesco or Apollinaire . . .)\n\n"

Which leads me to this: I just ordered a copy of Stephen Anderson’s _Remembering the Rain: The Music of Bill Evans_ and it is superb. Gentle electric guitar (Gibson), very liquid-sounding, and wonderful. Very much in the same vein as Joe Diorio’s _To Jobim with love_ of a few years ago. The Anderson CD is available direct from the publisher ( [http://www.artofliferecords.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205192835/http:/www.artofliferecords.com/ \"http://www.artofliferecords.com\")). Very, very nice for anyone who cares deeply about Bill Evans’s music.\n\nI wish I could give you guys a link for the equally fabulous Diorio disk but it’s on a very obscure Italian label (RAM RMCD4529, released 1995) and even when I was working as a music reviewer and thus had inside connections, it still took me months to actually buy and receive a copy. Maybe someone highly motivated could find it used.\n\nFinally, for any fan of Jobim’s music — in my view, the George Gershwin of Brasil — I think Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto’s _Casa_ is a must-have. It doesn’t say this in the liner notes, but the album was recorded at Jobim’s beach house, using the piano on which he composed all of his wonderful tunes. Core musicians are piano, cello and voice (female, alto) with other musicians in places on viola, percussion. Spare, swinging, open, dreamy, languid, transcendent!\n\n"

It’s the soundtrack for a Baker documentary made by Bruce Weber. What I adore about Baker is his vulnerability, hesitation, the charged spaces between the notes. Miles is always penetrating and questioning, but in a more confident and definite way. Baker leaves more room for me to enter the conversation and feel my way around in there, whereas Miles leaves me more on the sidelines watching. Does that make any sense? Evans does this, too, in spades.\n\nThe early recordings done by Baker and Mulligan out west in the early 50s are also most enjoyable.\n\nWhat a tragedy that drugs took such strangleholds on people like Baker, Bird, Anita O’Day, Evans. And yet ironically, many of the performances that we treasure were done while they were high as kites (O’Day’s performance during _Jazz on a Summer’s Day_ for example).\n\nI like that Baker manages to speak so often with a lighter touch, the way foundry Diotima sits very delicately but solidly on a page.
