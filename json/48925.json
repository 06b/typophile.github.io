But it works ok as a logo, as it's pretty much all geometrically constructed letterforms.\n\nrest of site: I haven't compared it against samples, but I get a strong vibe of Chalet, fairly heavily modified. Could be one of a number of other similar sans serifs, or (possibly) a completely custom job, though.\n\n"
