      "content": "Jackfahnestock, the original typeface dates from 1932, the company dates from 1895, so I suspect the packaging design long predates the era of digital type (the digital version of the typeface dates from 2000).\n\nIt wasn't unusual, up until the advent of the computer, for designers to use type specimen books as the basis for drawing (and I do mean by hand) a logotype. Not all logos are hatched directly from a font file.\n\nAnd thus ends my cranky old(er) man speech.\n\nThe vertical and horizontal proportions have been played with a bit, and a few details squared off (such as the leg of the R), but I still contend that it is Futura Display:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181342im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FuturaDisplay_3990.png)\n\n"
