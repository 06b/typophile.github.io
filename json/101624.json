      "content": "@farong Good spot. I think that's been about the closest I've come across. It's given me something to start from in looking for similar fonts too. Cantilever seems to be a match. Thanks!\n\n@Ryuk Ah ha! So it is! I didn't realise someone asked a similar question so recently. That's good to know, thanks. I think @farong was right in it being a customised version of—or at least heavily based on—Neutraface. It's a fantastic font.\n\nFor anyone else looking for similar alternatives:\n\n- Futura  \n- Relay  \n- Nobel  \n- Kabel\n\nAre all fairly similar geometric fonts but not quite as nice as Neutraface in my opinion. In addition, Brandon Grotesque is also very nice but a bit softer.\n\nThanks guys.\n\n"
