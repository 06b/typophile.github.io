I feel completely indulgent in my profession and in the back of my mind I honestly do think I can't wait for other people to see and use these fonts and hope they think they are as cool as I do.   \n   \nI want my fonts to inspire people.   \n   \nI don't care if they use the fonts for personal birthday party invites or cereal boxes. I want people to see the fonts in use and feel a connection to the fonts and the message being communicated to them.   \n   \nI think as an art director for many years I felt there was this 'ultimate' consumer I was designing for - straight up demographics (Female 24-37, Income . . .). Then i tried to get into their heads and invent people to design ads to and it left me very empty.   \n   \nOnce I started making type, I started having more satisfaction in my work because I felt, if every designer in the world starts using my fonts, in 10 years my porfolio is going to hit the millions. (I'm not so concerned about my portfolio these days)   \n   \nI don't need to design every ad in the world and honestly have no desire to, there are people who are better than me and really love making ads. BUT, if I can make better typefaces for designers and consumers to use and see in use, I feel I am enabling better communication with my talents instead of working up headlines with a copyrighter and doing tons of layouts through the night.   \n   \nI recently wrote in an editorial piece that I think we're living in a more typographically aware world than say 10 years ago.

      "content": "Armin, great question.   \n   \nI think the first thing to note here is that retail type design is so unlikely to provide a sufficient and steady income to most individuals that it does in fact make sense that so many people \"indulge\" in it. Some of those people make their living with custom type work (which is generally less rewarding \"spiritually\"), or in a totally different field. The net result is that the designs are very \"divergent\" in terms of utility: they are unlikely to be best-sellers, but some people will have wet dreams (personal joke intentional ;-) over some of them. It's more like Art, and some people (like me) actually have a problem with that, since I have to question how that serves other people. Designing to answer some funky personal riddle or whatever seems a bit too bourgeois for me. :-) I already have a BMW - I'm bourgeois enough!   \n   \nPersonally, when I design a font \"out of the blue\" I _try_ to make it something end-users, more than designers, _need_ - and simply hope that there are designers out there who think the same way, and want to deliver that same kind of typography to their \"users\", so they end up needing that certain kind of font. I'm not claiming that I do this because I'm a noble person or something, it's probably simply due to my nature (which is out of my hands) - I enjoy satisfying other people (although maybe only if they're \"in tune\" with me). So for example I made the Akhakalak Georgian font because I saw that the Georgian script is too wide, and wanted to give people a display face that would set narrow, like on bottle labels for their wonderful wines. And when I made Nour (Armenian) you could say I targeted even beyond what Armenian users think they need, or what they say they want: I targeted what I think Armenian typography needs now. And once in a while I run into a designer who \"gets it\" and enthusiastically pays me to get a copy of it. It's sort of like a cultural crusade.   \n   \nThe other thing that turns me on though is solving technical issues with new fonts, like pushing the limits of readability, or fighting lo-fi repro. That's the engineer in me.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Being a graphic designer, it is very clear for me who I design for: I design for my client's clients but I give them the impression that I'm designing for them (the direct clients). So I basically have two clients, or targets, I have to please. However, for type designers it does seem a bit more vague and fluctuating from one type designer to the next.   \n   \nDo you ever listen to graphic designers' opinions on what typefaces they like and why the choose one over another?

Two different instructors had differing opinions about how I should proceed. One suggested I create a hypothetical client or a design problem to solve and therefore be better able to measure the success of the project. The other instructor took the opposite view, suggesting I design it for me and let it be more of a personal expression.   \n   \n(I'd encourage any design student with the hankering for type to try it out. I'm no type designer, but that exercise has made me much more comfortable pushing type around, experimenting and questioning the norms.)   \n   \nI believe there is room for both approaches.

Of course I'm open to dilettantism.   \n   \nFor example, if I were to design a typeface for a French newspaper, I would not only educate myself about the French language and it's peculiatities, but also try to connect with that part of ME that empathizes with the bits of French culture I've experienced.   \n   \nThere is also something in designing a typeface that is about the continuation of a craft/art form.

I want to be satisfied with what I have made. If it's saleable and Adobe is willing to pick it up, so much the better. But I won't count on it.   \n   \nNow, I can easily see me getting into the state of doing a first rough prototype of some letters, and showing it around to see if there's much possibility that Adobe would pick it up. If not, I might switch to another project, unless I was particularly excited about the one I had just started.   \n   \nMy current type family started because one of Adobe's product teams complained about Adobe's then-new font bundling policy. We now only bundle fonts that Adobe owns 100%. They had wanted Futura, but now they couldn't have it, and we didn't have any other geometric sans serif they could use.   \n   \nThat got me to thinking that it was interesting that there were no geometric sans faces that Adobe owned outright. Although I've done a couple of dozen families to the prototype stage or beyond over the years, I'd never tried a geometric sans serif. So I decided to give it a whirl.   \n   \nOne of the interesting things about type design is that at some point you discover that the typeface has its own \"voice\"; listening intently to that voice is a key part of type design, IMO. Certain elements or letters in the typeface may turn out to be the touchstones of the work. If you come up with something that does not go with those elements, or doesn't match well with a touchstone letter, no matter how clever or beautiful it is, it will have to go.   \n   \nSometimes the voice of the typeface turns out to be rather different than what one had in mind when the project started. For instance, my intended geometric sans works better than I had expected/intended at text sizes, and is neither strictly geometric nor even entirely sans serif, as it turns out.\\* (Though I think it has remained on track in other aspects of my self-generated design brief.)   \n   \n\\* I may not be alone in this one. I gather that Goudy Sans was the result of a foundry asking Goudy to make them a competitor to Futura.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT   \n   \nP.S. Typing with one hand is hard.\n\n"
