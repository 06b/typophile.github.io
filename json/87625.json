  "content": "Hi, guys and girls!  \nOkay, so I've come across this typeface in two separate (but related) publications and am extremely curious to know its name/s and origin.\n\nThis image is from an Anne Rice short story published in the January 1979 issue of Playboy magazine.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022072617im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Interlude_4798.jpg)\n\nAnd these images are from the dust jacket of \"The Tale of the Body Thief\", a novel by Anne Rice published in 1992.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022072617im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Anne_5584.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022072617im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tale_3880.jpg)\n\nNow, I have come across two fonts that are almost identical to this typeface: Octavian (by Brendel Informatik, 1994) and Implicit SSi (by Southern Software, 1992).  \nSo, can anybody here PLEASE help me out with more information about this typeface?\n\n",
