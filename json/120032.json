That posting is here:\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/119579](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317111926/http:/typophile.com/node/119579 \"http://typophile.com/node/119579\")\n\nMy difficulty with selection of Hebrew typeface is a good deal greater, since the only Hebrew typeface I already own is \"Adobe Hebrew\". So, it's harder for me to easily play around with different typeface choices.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestions, please?\n\nThanks!\n\n",

(If not Iowan, then Adobe Jenson Pro in Semi-Bold; regardless, some sturdy humanist serif typeface.) Again, primary difficulty I have with selecting Hebrew typefaces, is simply that I don't have many (besides \"Adobe Hebrew\") to play with... Appreciate any advice you might have. Thanks.\n\n"

It looks too much like Hadasaa, but misses the design subtleties. Letters like 'Alef' and 'Pe' are too dark and not carefully designed.\n\n"
