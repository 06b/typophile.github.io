      "content": "Hi Christopher,\n\nit depends:  \npsi is a Greek character ( [U03A8](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/u+03A8) for uppercase), so it is included in _every_ font with Greek language support.\n\nThen, it could be used as a symbol in mathematical typesetting. There are a couple of codepoints, depending on its application: [U1D7A7](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d7a7), [U1D6BF](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d6bf), [U167A7](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d7a7), [U1D76D](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d76d), [U1D733](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d733), [U1D6F9](http://web.archive.org/web/20141012212049/http:/www.decodeunicode.org/de/u+1d6f9).\n\nSpecial fonts like Cambria Math will likely contain these glyphs.  \nF\n\n"
