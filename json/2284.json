Anbody go see movies? ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018143802im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \nI've seen some amazing type treatments lately, yet still, way too much Impact and Trajan.   \n   \nAnybody know of some good archives of old Movie Posters? New ones?   \n   \ntwo right away are movieposters.com and allposters.com.   \n   \nAnybody have any good stories about movie logotype creation or funny usage examples ?e.g. Scarface = Palatino.   \n   \nPost some stuff here. I'm going to note some good and poor examples that I see on my next visit to the video store.   \n   \n   \nThis movie isn't out yet, but here's an example of a great opportunity missed, or maybe an inentional movie poster non-sequitir?   \n   \nThe treatment didn't work for me.   \n   \n ![fear.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018143802im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/2168.jpg)\n\n",
