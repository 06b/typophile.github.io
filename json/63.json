But let's just say that if Jonathan Hoefler hadn't grabbed the typography.com domain name eight years ago, we could have saved a lot of money.\"   \n   \nAs part of the deal, Microsoft acquired all assets associated with Typophile, including the highly popular Typophile Forums, which feature over 120 original typefaces that Microsoft plans to bundle with their next release of Microsoft Windows XP   \n   \nAlthough financial details of the transaction are undisclosed, Typophile founders Jared Benson and Joseph Pemberton were last seen switching over to PCs and purchasing homes in the Bay Area.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Spa\\_karengoes.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712155108/http:/typophile.com/files/Spa_karengoes_0.jpg) | 246.76 KB |\n\n",
