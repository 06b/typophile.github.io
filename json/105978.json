      "content": "Perhaps our typophiles are stumped because the logo is extensively edited. About all I can offer are a couple of thoughts on origin of the base font.  \nThis is a thickened version of measured designs that can trace their lineage to Trafton, designed by Howard Trafton and cast by Bauer in1933; Coronet designed by R. H. Middleton for Ludlow in 1937; and Stylescript designed by Sol Hess in 1940 for the Lanston Monotype Company. Harold's Fonts has digitized Stylescrpt as [Swizzle Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20150113021526/http:/www.fontbros.com/families/swizzle-script/styles/regular/?code=identifont).
