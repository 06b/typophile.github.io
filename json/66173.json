Такође и украјинска и српска :)\n\nWell... hm... don't have good explanation. :P  \nTo be honest, we have a little messy character set, don't have standard one.\n\nBut, yeah, we have Cyrillic characters for [Qitray](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015061503/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/tdf/qiltray/) and [Horrorama](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015061503/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/tdf/horrorama/) only so far.\n\nIt's the question of time and decision in that moment - but we'll gonna include Cyrillic in some of our upcoming fonts.\n\nb  \nd\n\n"
