  "content": "Normally I wouldn't really consider using a \"slab\" serif for text but it seems to me that Nexus Mix is a very good one.\n\nIt's for a 30-some page guide, not sure what it'll be set in yet, but I suspect either 11 or 12.\n\nAnyone ever used it (Mix) for text? I don't own it yet so I cannot try it and the serif out except for the specimens they provide on the 'net.\n\nThanks,\n\nPierre-Luc\n\n",
