They highlighted (of course) Emigre, House, Hoefler, etc. but it was still nice to see some recognition of the \"new classics\". They also confirmed what's been the subject of much debate here, which is that it's rare to find a free font with the character quality, full character set, kerning pairs, etc. that make a font beautiful and truly usable.   \n   \nNot that all licensed fonts are great either...\n\n"
