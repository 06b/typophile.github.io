If I’m right, the first desktop publishing and WYSIWYG apps were Apple only. It became an industry standard, and continued to be, maybe because Windows (and others systems too) just haven’t offered anything that made people change their minds. I’m sure some (older) people around here will tell you the whole story, because they saw it happen.\n\nYou’ll find a lot of type designers are Win-based, though.\n\n"

In the past decade, PC’s have caught up and they offer the same programs.\n\nIf you are a designer and you want to be inspired, then Mac’s are the way to go. It’s the difference between a Chevy Cavalier and a Honda S2000. You want to get where you are going with style.\n\nIt’s a subculture thing- sticking it to THE MAN (Bill Gates and the corporate world).\n\nI was raised on a Mac, but when I graduated college I had to go with PC because I was poor. I learned all I could about the PC’s and built the best system possible (it cost me $650, not including monitor). A Mac with the same speed and power would have been 3-times the money. To get around the aesthetics I purchased a metallic-silver case for my computer.\n\nAs Grayson said, PC’s aren’t as user-friendly, but once you get over the hump they are good systems and much cheaper to buy and upgrade. There is also more options in the market for specific parts (for example: AMD vs Intel processors drives the price down and the competition makes the product better).\n\nFor the most part, if you build PC’s correctly you dont have problems. I have never had a system crash. I have had Mac’s crash on me.\n\nThere are easy ways around the PC inconveniences. If you have a strong anti-virus program and a router, you don’t have to put much thought into computer protection. If you use Firefox you don’t worry about pop-ups. If you run Spybot you don’t worry about spyware. I don’t know why you would be missing a DLL, but if you are you go to Google and type in the name and download a new one from the Microsoft website.\n\nI can now use all of the extra money I would spend on a Mac and buy fonts!!!\n\n"

I was a Windows user since Windows 2 (still have the discs), then got Window 3.11, Win95-98 but then worked with an ad agency and actually got to use one of these computers that every Windows user is raised to hate. Turned out it wasn’t hate, it was envy.\n\nAt that time it was OS 7 and I liked the way I could ’just work’ all the hassle was taken off of my shoulder, I could just work - and get coffee when the bitch froze on me, mostly while doing “Layouts” in Freehand (yes I know) and comps in Photoshop.\n\nAlso being a Mac only studio I found that Macs are a hell of a lot cheaper compared to what you get. My costs on virus protection, anti spyware protection and the necessary RAM additions almost went to zero.\n\nIf you have an IT department at your service you can rather safely use Windows. If you’re willing to become a security expert, you probably can too.\n\nEven with a “lesser powered” G5 you can bust the gigahertz myth quite quickly, run a rendering application or a depth correction on a 32Bit float image. Instant gratification.\n\nYou need to work? You’re serious about the quality of the output? You don’t want to worry about the ins and outs of your system to fight and keep it running? No use for a bimonthly re-install? Get a Mac.\n\nIt’s not just about the style. It’s what enables me to work. Apple is a creative company and thinks like creative people. Microsoft is a business company and thinks like business people.\n\nOh and with a new Mac you get a lot of apps for free that are 1. actually useful and 2. they actually work.\n\n@ [paul d hunt](http://web.archive.org/web/20080929202827/http:/typophile.com/user/7006): Are you on Mac OS 9?

Even so I don’t find it neccessary to say bad things about the Mac, yet it amazes me the way certain kinds of Mac users still habitually poo-poo Windows\\*, and worse—-Windows users. C’mon. Its unwise to judge a book by its cover.\n\n\\* this is due in part to the old, now-debunked myth that Microsoft copied Apple’s interface. Not true. Both Windows and the Mac OS were designed by the researchers who developed all that stuff at Xerox Palo Alto Research Labs back in the early 19080’s. Some of those people went to work for Apple and some went to Microsoft.\n\n_My biggest problem with Macs though are their users._\n\nThis is what I’m on about :^)\n\nBoth Win and Mac crash. _All_ computers crash, minis, palmtops, notebooks, mainframes, AS400’s, you name it. Windows machines tend to have more compatability problems than Macs because the hardware components come from different manufacturers. I’m fortunate in being technical enuff to firgure out how to put my own PC hardware together, and that has allowed me to find the right combination that works perfectly with Windows 2000. With all the Win 2K service packs installed my Windows box rarely crashes—-about once every 2 months. Seriously. It is possible, but you have to get the hadware exactly right. I’ve tried Win XP and found Win 2000 more stable and reliable, and less resource-hungry, so it runs faster on the same hardware.\n\nMacs are an easier choice because hardware compatibility and glitches generally are not an issue.\n\n_Macs “just do what you want them to do and get out of the way”_\n\nSome people want and need that, others are more technically-minded and want more involvement, and benefit from it.\n\n_There is so much bullshit in Windows that is totally foreign to Mac users._\n\nStop painting it black. Windows offers more options and ways of making the same things happen, the same functionality served up six different ways. It isn’t bullshit, just different. That stuff is only foreign to Mac users who aren’t familiar with Windows.\n\n_I don’t know how I put up with all the hardware problems, the virus problems, the crashes..._\n\nYou got saddled with a bad machine. I don’t have virus problems, hardware problems or frequent crashes.\n\n_...the horrible interfaces, the convoluted settings and preferences and the missing DLL’s. The spyware, the aliased-ugly-as-hell text, the horribly hideous and unpolished aesthetics. Windows XP is just no where near as good as OS 10.1, 10.2 , .3, and .4._\n\nDon’t you think you’re overstating it? I agree Windows is more complex, and the interface is geeky non-design, but I can live with that because the rest of it makes more sense to me than Mac OS’s.\n\nNote: so far I haven’t tried to denigrate the Mac OSX interface by saying, “That jelly stuff is a wank.” I only mention that now because I do see it that way, but I make a point of not saying so publicly. That would be insulting to Mac users.\n\n_Also, seriously - aliased text is so ———- horrible_\n\nYou mean text rendered without aliasing? Things have changed a lot since you last looked (guessing). Anti-aliased text rendering has been standard in Windows since 2000. You could get for Win 98 too with a free utility.\n\n_Seriously though, PCs and Macs will preform about the same when similarly configured. Either would be fine for design._\n\nExactly.\n\n_Macs are so sexy though, and you know how designers are with their well thought out and sexy fashion, furnishings, and accessories._\n\nDefinitely. A tradition for fine arts artists has always been The Art of Living. You make your life an ongoing work of art. The money I save by buying PCs instead of Macs I spend on antique furniture, which means more to me than a stupid computer. Computers are only tools, and they grow old so fast we replace them often, so spending top dollar on them seems pointless.\n\nNo offense, and best reagards to all,  \nj a m e s\n\n"

Inertia: it’s been that way for so long (remember when Apple was a market leader?), so new designers follow suit.\n2. Total design: Apple’s tight control over all aspects allows for more a integrated design and consistency, which appeals to our mindset.\n3. Industry: because of the above 2 reasons, I still encounter vendors, printers, publications that are Mac-only shops.\n\nFor me personally, I have experience on both Windows (since Win 95) and vastly prefer Apple’s OS. Particularly OS X. My wife, former Windows-only user and non-tech lover, now agrees completely since she was forced to use our old G4 for a web project for a month. I build my own PCs, and they’re much better for gaming and cheaper to build, but that flexibility and backwards compatibility comes with much greater complexity.

Tiger, on the other hand, is an onion of increasing complexity, but never uninteresting. And if there is a word for it, it is dynamic (in the engineer’s fluid sense of the word).\n\nThe trick with saving money on a Mac is to watch how Apple is responding to the changing technology and buy used machines that were at their peak (and recognized as such) but still at the cusp of what is needed in the here and now. I buy my machines from an institution where they actually are well maintained.

And don’t get me started about that alien Linux stuff. :)\n\nBut I’m a font developer, not a graphic designer, and I use Windows because it is simply a better platform for font development and testing: there are more tools available on this platform for doing my job. I’ve known a lot of graphic designers who are Windows users, often despite being trained on Macs in design school. Often, they switched to Windows when starting their own studios simply because the hardware was so much cheaper. Sometime in the mid-90s, Adobe’s sales of Windows versions of their design software overtook their traditionally stronger Mac sales, and from the workflow perspective there seems to be very little to distinguish the two platforms for design work.\n\nMicrosoft’s commitment to internationalisation seems far more impressive than Apple’s. Given that internationalisation is just about the only growth sector in the font market, this is very important to me. Apple, kind of bizarrely, was one of the first companies involved in the early years of Unicode, and yet they only recently got around to supporting Unicode in a reasonable way. And then there’s that AAT font format, which is difficult to develop for — sometimes prohibitively so — and is only supported in a small number of applications on this platform with such a tiny share of the global computing market.\n\nYes, the Apple hardware is good, but then it should be at that price. High-end Wintel hardware is good too. There’s a lot of cheap and less good Wintel hardware around, though, built with lower quality components, so a lot of the bad reputation comes from this. If Apple had licensed clone manufacturing, as they nearly did just before Job’s return, then you would have seen the same kind of quality divergence in machines running Mac OS.\n\n"

Most Mac users use them because they work as expected, hardly ever screw up, streamline your workflow and overall are an enjoyable experience. The Mac vs Windows debate is old and will never go away. Both platforms have strengths and weaknesses. I have worked on Windows since 3.1, Mac OS since system 6 and even an SGI here and there. I have always come back to or had a Mac because I simply prefer the way I can work, play, organize my life, share my photos, movies, music etc. I won’t say one is better than the other.\n\nThey are just different. I love X11 which works flawlessly for me, I love OS X and with my new MacBook Pro I can dual boot Windows or OS X both natively. Sure OS X is a lot of eye candy but it also has a lot of power.

The unix functionality, automation and overall performance is exceptional and preferred by many.\n\nAs for the single button mouse (Which is a dying breed) the original concept was one button is easier for the end user. You always had the option to install a multi button mouse and the Mighty Mouse shows apples embracement of this.\n\nAs per price. Take the portables. Price a Windows laptop with everything that the Powerbook line and now MacBook line have standard and you will see that there is little to no difference in price other than the windows laptop may cost you more.

As a designer, there were several things that attracted me personally, such as the high resolution black on white display (most computers back then had green or amber on black screens or chunky day-glow color), the easy mouse interface, the bitmap display (most other computers had character-based displays), and multiple proportional fonts (and the whole wysiwyg thing).\n\nThen the LaserWriter and PostScript came along and the whole desktop publishing thing hit. MS-DOS had a bigger market share than the Mac even then, but the Mac was so much better suited to doing design work (and its simplicity also appealed to designers), that the Mac dominated the graphics and publishing market for years. This early lead is why Macs are still popular today with designers in spite of the fact that Macs and PCs are more or less equally suited to the work. Macs are not as dominant in publishing and design as they once were, but there is still the perception that they are best suited for the job and easier to deal with. They still dominate the high end, where they easily pay for themselves, while Windows dominates the low end, where overhead costs are more critical.\n\nI’ve observed (and sometimes participated in) this stupid debate for over twenty years. I got tired of it a long, long time ago. Macs are still around and don’t appear to be going away anytime soon. Same for Windows PCs. I’ve come to the conclusion that behind this argument is a frustration on both sides with the fact that everyone isn’t running one common operating system. If only we were all running the same OS then all our problems would be solved. We could all use the same peripherals, the same programs, make the same kind of files and share them. But wait—we already can use the same peripherals, the same programs, make the same kind of files and share them. And we already have (at least) one universal platform: the internet. On the internet, who knows or even cares what kind of computer or what operating system you are using?\n\nThe Mac/PC debate has for most practical purposes been irrelevant for quite a while now, It’s long past time we stop beating this poor dead horse and get on with life.\n\n"

Inherent in a mac (either the monitors, or the os, I’m not sure though I’d guess the OS) is a much more specific intention to have color represented correctly. This is partially because macs have been more closely bundled together. Thus, there was more assurance that what was on the screen vs what would print.\n\n2. Fewer steps in OS which is the reason they runner on ’slower’ processors and get more kick from their ram. (part of the reason people like to claim they are ’faster’) \\*\\* this has also been given as a reason for why they are good in sound recording environments\n\n3. Able to open, edit, and save either os or windows files\n\n4. I ’think’ the newer macs also have native support for RAW files from newer digital cameras (can someone confirm this?)\n\nReasons why they are NOT better  \n1. faster (this is a matter of the speed of the processor, ram, etc.) if you were to compare efficiency, the yes, macs would be better\n\n2. Quiter, sure macs like to sell systems without fans, but you could likewise rip the fans out of your pc and acheive the same result. The HD on the mac at work is super loud and would drown out a case fan anyway.\n\n3. More stable, they are neither more nor less stable in my opinion. I’ve good and bad systems from both sides, although osx is less of a virus/trojan target than pc’s because it is such a small percentage of the market. I would argue that since windows has taken so much heat for being unstable that the systems they have put in place to save your work in the event of a crash makes them somewhat more stable.\n\nI look forward to your comments/additions.\n\n"
