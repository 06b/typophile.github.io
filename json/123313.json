(I don't mean I can't stand Minion, although it's true it doesn't work for my purposes.) I mean I can't stand that I cannot choose my own default font preference (which happens to be Centaur) for whenever I open a new InDesign file. Or can I? And I just cannot find out how to? Thanks for any pointers.\n\n",
