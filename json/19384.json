I'm quite lazy and have exhausted trying to figure it out on my own. Thanks for any help!\n\n-S\n\n",

He gets black and white images of the flower/butterfly/feather, which were colored afterwards.\n\nI guess there are more simple ways to achieve a similar effect.\n\nCan't find the link where I read this though :(\n\nedit: ah, there it is: [http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160614/http:/www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html \"http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22837.html\")\n\n"

I don't have the recipe right yet and was dragging and dropping colours onto my gradient mesh. It just became a gradient mess! :P If I make a circle do I colour it a radial gradient and then apply the gradient mesh? I need help!\n\nThanks so much!\n\n"

      "content": "sushi whisker,\n\nAfter drawing the shape add the gradient mesh. Then you cold start by coloring all the edges with one colour, then add/change colours as needed. You also might need to add occasional mesh point. That quick one was done with 4 x 4 mesh and just three colours from the default pallette. I moved the points around a bit, too.\n\nTransparency of the elements is 70%.\n\nThe middle bit has 9 mm feather in the edges and a basic radial gradient. It's also transparent (70%) and on top of everything.\n\nHope this helps, good luck!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160614im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mesh.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160614im_/http:/typophile.com/files/radial.jpg)\n\n"
