The result is a space-saving but very legible typeface.\n\nTen years after FF Dax was created, Reichel revised the forms as FF Daxline, designed to be more readable variation for text use.\n\n**External Links**  \n [FF Dax at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052836/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Dax)  \n [FF Dax at FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052836/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/dax)  \n [FF Daxline at FontShop](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052836/http:/www.fontshop.com/search/?q=FF%20Daxline)  \n [FF Daxline at FontFont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052836/http:/www.fontfont.com/fonts/daxline)\n\n",
