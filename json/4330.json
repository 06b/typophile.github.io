The price is affordable, plus it counts towards your purchase of FontLab when you're ready to move up.   \n   \nTypeTool incorporates all the features you need to create Type 1 and TrueType fonts from scratch. FontLab is much richer in features, but someone else like Adam Twardoch could elaborate better than I can... A big difference is the ability to create OpenType fonts.\n\n"

But whats up with Opentype fonts - cant TypeTool make these?   \n   \nIm doing my glyphs in Illustrator so I dont really need advanced tools for drawing inside FontLab/Typetool. I need features to actually \"make a font\" but thats fully possible with Typetool if I understand you right?   \n   \nWhat about building weights automatically - I know there\n\n"

      "content": "I may not have this right, but I'm pretty sure TypeTool lacks the capability to create OpenType fonts nor build multiple weights.   \n   \nGo to the [TypeTool site](http://web.archive.org/web/20120111121256/http:/www.fontlab.com/html/typetool.html) and download the demo (ver. 2) and the manual. This would probably be the best way to find out if it has the features you're looking for. I tried a search on this site, but couldn't find exactly the answers you're looking for. You may try posting your questions in the \"build\" section.\n\n"
