      "content": "Cześć Ewelina,  \nwelcome to Typophile!\n\nObviously, both styles are hand-lettered.  \nFor ‘Kajko I Kokosz’, you might find something similar at these sites dedicated to comic lettering fonts:  \n [Blambot](http://web.archive.org/web/20130630065514/http:/www.blambot.com/fonts.shtml)  \n [Comicraft](http://web.archive.org/web/20130630065514/http:/www.comicraft.com/fonts/)/ [Comic Book Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130630065514/http:/www.comicbookfonts.com/fonts)  \nFor example, [Boogers](http://web.archive.org/web/20130630065514/http:/www.blambot.com/font_boogers.shtml) is not that different.\n\n‘Festiwal Czarownic’ is more difficult. It looks a bit like an exaggerated [Pivo](http://web.archive.org/web/20130630065514/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-72-pivo).  \nF\n\n"
