  "content": "I've been quite interested in the idea of creating a couple of fonts for a while now, but although I'm a skilled graphic designer, (and therefore good with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Quark) when it comes to software for creating fonts I'm really not sure where to start.\n\nA few years ago I did briefly have access to a copy of Fontographer, which at the time was a real standard for this kind of software. Is this still the case or should I be looking at getting another program? What is the best software for creating fonts now?\n\nAll tips, hints and recommendations will be appreciated.\n\n",
