I see work-arounds on the web for getting it to work in XP, but maybe it’s time to upgrade.\n\nI don’t have the circa-$1,000 for a new copy, does anyone know where I can get a legal copy at a VERY good price?\n\nTIA  \nbimjim\n\n [‹ liga vs. calt](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002520/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39473 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Robofab Glyph to UFO ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002520/http:/www.typophile.com/node/39492 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

This is because it is in the users’ best interest to keep their serial number private — so that others cannot spot it, write it down and then use it to upgrade or serialize an illegal copy of their own.\n\nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"
