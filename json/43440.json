(The poster is actually talking about a graphic design portfolio, and that is eminently within the mandate of this site and this section).\n\nTo the original question, my brain works poorly in metric, but what you want to do is to build a book that is large enough to show your largest sample, and to provide appealing whitespace around other items. Your paper should feel lush and solid, not flimsy, and a cover should be strong enough to hold it all together so it doesn't get damaged if you have to leave it with a potential client/employer.\n\n"
