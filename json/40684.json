  "content": "Hey everybody. :)\n\nA friend asked me to design a logo for his about-to-open firm. They’re not in a rush, they have no money to spend and I’m a lazy unemployed unexperienced college graduate, so that was a match made in heaven if there ever was one (that’s an exaggeration, I’m just madly trying to practice my english).  \nSince I’m a typophile, my primary focus was, of course, the type. So what I’m looking for, here, is mostly any advice/tip/suggestion you nice folks might have to share regarding the type I designed for their logo and the kerning.\n\nIf you’re curious as to what they do, that’s a tough one... basicly, they are five people with different backgrounds (three engineers, one industrial designer and one marketeer) who plan to develop projects in different areas together and then get them to whoever might be interested in using them. (It’s tough enough to explain even in portuguese, let alone in another language...)\n\nThey know it’s quite a risky adventure, but they seem to be OK with that; so much so that they risk it more by using an english name (which, when read in portuguese, sounds something like a meaningless “oontee”). So much so that they don’t even mind asking ME to do their identity!\n\nAbout the kerning: I kerned it a bit on the loose side to improve legibility and also because kerning these forms (which I’m really pleased with, I must say) tightly is kind of difficult.\n\nAbout the symbol: basicly it’s a mix of the inequation symbol (two of them, actually) – which represents the fact that they’re not equal to anything else – and that little drawing we make when couting votes, for example (you know, “||||” with a diagonal line over it, representing five votes – look at the symbol at a 90º angle and you’ll see what I’m talking about).\n\nWithout further ado (but with a bit of fear)...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612162359im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/newScreenshot_27_4912.jpg)\n\nAny comments regarding the widths of the letters and the strokes are also welcome.\n\nruD\n\n [‹ Thin Slab Serif & Stencil font-Editorial](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612162359/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40753 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sans serif to go with Adobe Jenson? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080612162359/http:/www.typophile.com/node/40823 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Although the dot on an “i” is often that high in a text face, it feels a bit awkward in a logo. I’d maybe drop it 1/3 of the distance to the top of the “i” stroke.\n\nVisually, the space between the u and the n is less than the others, I think. Either increase it or tighten the others.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "Once you drop the dot on the i (a good idea) the gray mark needs repositioning (and perhaps even some scaling) — even now it’s positioned a bit too high in relation to the lettering. I also think that the two =’s need some work on the left side. The four oblique ends there cause a lot of unrest. On the right side this effect wouldn’t harm.\n\nHope I have been clear enough ; )\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

      "content": "I think that there might be a difference in weight between the characters? Or so it seems, optically. ’U’ and ’N’ are quite heavy, then comes ’t’, which seems a little lighter, and then ’i’ and ’e’, which are even more light to my eyes. I don’t know if this is what you wanted. If not, a little tweaking here and there wouldn’t hurt. :)  \nI think it makes it a bit restless, so to speak, and a little more uniformity might make the whole mark more harmonious.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks, everyone!\n\nI perfectly see what everyone means about the kerning and weights...  \nWhat makes this hard is that I’m using upper and lowercase forms together, which makes it difficult to kern and to make the weights match. We all know that kerning uppercase letters is quite different from kerning lowercase and there’s always some kind of adjustment to make to the weights when mixing small caps with lowercase... so I think that’s where most of this trouble comes from. So, with that in mind, does anyone else still have anything to say about those two problems? This really was hard for me (lots of tweaking was involved, I’m a bit of a perfectionist, and an inexperienced one, too), so more input will be appreciated. :)\n\nMeanwhile, regarding the dot on the lc I... I don’t think I can drop it. It really is what makes the lc I form most recognizable, and this is a tough word for some portuguese people to read; I don’t think I’ll make it even harder on them. But I’ll try it again later, thank you for the tip. :)  \nNow about the height of the dot... actually, it comes from the mark. If you look closely, you’ll see that everything is aligned: the bottom of the last horizontal line on the mark is aligned with the baseline of the lettering; the bottom of the second horizontal line is in line with the x-height; and the dot on the I is perfectly in line with the first horizontal line. That was how I got to the size of the mark and how it related to the lettering. I’m still looking at the mark for some improvement, but I thought the left side (those oblique ends Bert mentioned) gave it some charm and made it a bit more dynamic. Adding obliques on the right side instead (I did try it, before) made it too busy, because it clashed much more with the large oblique line... but even so, Bert, do you think the mark should be bigger or smaller? I didn’t understand what you meant.\n\nThanks!  \nruD\n\n"

I believe it’s much better, don’t you?\n\nOh, and I dropped the dot on the I to align with the white space between the = on the top of the mark. It’s a bit too close, but I guess it is a bit better than having it that far away as I did. There were also other minor adjustments.\n\nThank you! :)\n\n"
