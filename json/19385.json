  "content": "Hi guys!\n\nI have to do a redesign of Tschichold The new typography as a school assignment but im fresh out of ideas! The new cover should have an “edge” (meaning that it should be based on a really clever idea) but still illustrate the content of the book.\n\nI’m thinking about doing something that doesn’t apply to Tchicholds teaching at all but still illustrates it well... but I’m not sure if thats the right way to go. Do you guys have any suggestions (go wild!)?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ A friend for Lexon](http://web.archive.org/web/20071103084006/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19371 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help!

If it weren’t a book of theory on typography you could do this more readily, however the fact that it specifically discusses what he thinks are ideals to be used in typography you might have to bite the bullet.\n\n"
