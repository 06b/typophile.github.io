      "content": "Paul, what I'm about to say might not relate directly with your problem, but may lead you to another possible solution.\n\nMy specific problem was in Quark 6, with an .otf font that covered Western and Central European Latin (no Greek or Cyrillic). The supported codepages selected were Latin 1, Latin 2: Eastern Europe, Turkish and Windows Baltic.  \nAs you probably know, Quark 6 only supports Western characters in OpenType PS (.otf) fonts, nonetheless I was getting CE characters when typing Western. After some fiddling, I found out that adding Greek to the supported codepages would fix the problem.\n\nHere's [Adam Twardoch](http://web.archive.org/web/20100831010406/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Adam%2520Twardoch)'s explanation:  \n_There is a bizarre bug in the Adobe font driver (ATM or the one built into Mac OS X) with respect to the \"Windows Greek codepage\" flag. If a font is flagged as \"Roman\" + \"CE\", then ATM thinks that the primary codepage of the font is CE, if the font is flagged as \"Roman\" + \"Cyrillic\", then ATM thinks that the primary codepage is Cyrillic, but if the font is flagged as \"Roman\" + \"CE\" + \"Greek\" or \"Roman\" + \"Cyrillic\" + \"Greek\", then ATM thinks that the primary codepage of the font is Roman. QuarkXPress only likes fonts that the system says the primary codepage is Roman. So in short, it may be help to activate the \"Windows Greek\" codepage flag._\n\n"
