The PostScript versions of both fonts appear to use the same “easy-to-use numbering system” in the font names.\n\nCuriously, the [Adobe OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153820/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1198.html) version of Helvetica Neue doesn’t seem to have numbers in the font names, while the [Linotype OpenType](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153820/http:/www.linotype.com/88565/neuehelveticafamilyvaluepack-compilation.html) version does.\n\nI’m writing a style guide, and I’m trying to figure out which of these fonts (if any) are interchangeable. Thanks for your help.\n\nIf you have any additional insights into differences between the two, or why this confusing situation exists, I’d love to know.\n\nP.S. I originally posted this question on [Ask Metafilter](http://web.archive.org/web/20080705153820/http:/ask.metafilter.com/68665/Helvetica-Neue-Neue-Helvetica), and was advised to ask again here.\n\n [‹ O.D.G.
