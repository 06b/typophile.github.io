Originally published in 1991, it has been revised four times, with the latest edition published in September, 2006. This fourth edition contains 32,000 samples of fonts from 90 international [type foundries](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/typophile.com/wiki/foundries). It is widely considered the most comprehensive type reference guide currently in print. In addition to type samples, FontBook also contains historical footnotes (such as the type designer's name and typeface's date of creation) and cross-references to fonts of similar style.\n\n**Discussion:**  \n [The Next FontBook](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/typophile.com/node/10440)  \n [Is FontShop's new FontBook 2006 an objective reference work?](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/typophile.com/node/28415)\n\n**External Links:**  \n [Official Site](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/www.fontbook.com/)  \n [FontBook at FontShop.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/www.fontshop.com/products/fontbook/)  \n [FontBook on Flickr](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/www.flickr.com/search/?q=fontbook)  \n [Greg Storey on FontBook](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/flaunt.php)  \n [Khoi Vinh Interview with Stephen Coles on FontBook](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0726_one_book_to_.php)  \n [FontBook reviews](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017023041/http:/www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/feb08a/)\n\n",
