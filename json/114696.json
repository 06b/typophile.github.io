Univers was always more neutral in my opinion. It still has character, but it doesn't have such distinct letters as Helvetica does (a, R, S). I always recognize Univers by its /a but I don't think I would recognize it otherwise.

At the same time though I couldn't really say what's perfectly neutral. I agree with donshottype's comment: \"Some similar fonts, such as Myriad have picked up baggage. For many people Myriad now says Apple.\" Myriad has always been a face without much of an identity for me, but I can see how people become so familiar with a brand that a typeface suddenly says a lot more than perhaps it initially intended. For me Helvetica and Arial are at least culturally not at all neutral. We recognize both immediately and it comes with a lot of historical baggage. Arial is also the default typeface of the city I live in so Arial tends to become even less neutral for me.\n\nBut can you guys clarify what you think of when considering neutrality in typefaces? hamest mentioned he's looking for a typeface that is \"free from political, social and cultural connotations\". I think faces like Helvetica are not that, but perhaps an unpopular Helvetica no one is familiar with would be. I don't really understand how faces like Helvetica and especially Akzidenz Grotesk pop up here though. What I think of when considering \"neutrality\" and \"skeletal\" is a typeface stripped down from the essentials. Not a geometric typeface, but a clean grotesque. No spurs. As I mentioned Univers is quite neutral to me. I don't find Folio neutral at all because of those strange counters. I like it, but it's far from neutral. So perhaps you reason neutrality differently?\n\n"

My take is that Miedinger was primarily concerned with logical consistency and esthetic purity (which may be the same thing), not neutrality in the sense of being unintrusive.\n\n(Univers has a similar thing going, and has the distinctive thing where bolder cuts have more contrast than most grotesques. Avenir, which of course is not a grot, is more \"neutral\" in the unobtrusive sense to my eye. Myriad is of course close to a copy of it.)\n\n"

I can see how you can argue that Helvetica has a certain neutrality or clinical look, but that's different from the kind of neutrality (skeletal) we're after. Strip Helvetica's character down and you have a neutral typeface. Get rid of the vertical leg in /R and the curvature from the bowl to the spine in /a for starters.\n\n"

That's very different from neutrality, even if averaging techniques may be applied to eventually get to a form which may be perceived as neutral. The output of these averaging techniques depend on the input and since the input isn't necessarily neutral, you can't expect the outcome to be. To get to neutrality you need human eyes and rationality. If all typefaces are like circles and true neutrality is like a triangle, then by taking the average of all those circles you will never get to a triangle. It will give insights into the common ground of typefaces which will probably make it easier to create a neutral skeleton because it restricts the area it can live in, but the averaging technique is just a tool and is not a showcase of neutrality.\n\nLike froo said: \"With this method, you only get the set of common elements, a blurred area\"\n\n"
