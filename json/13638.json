The tag line Freelance Graphic Designer leads me to believe that I need to speak with someone named Sevex. If that is not your intention, you may try a variant such as Freelance Graphic Design, without the er.\n\n"

The top half of the E could be improved by increasing it, it looks as if it is leaning back, this will also address the kerning at EV. The V is definitely a problem since a potential viewer would not have any reference and would conclude it is a U I think you will have to abandon your skeleton and work with a more conventional form. Overall the construction has problems with an uneven colour especially dark at the centre of the X and Es and while EVEX are all monoline the S is light at the centre. The symbol is working best for me as per the left hand column.  \nTim\n\n"

This is good - making the complicated simple is a designer’s core business. The friendly colours work as well; they warm up the hard lines.\n\nThe name and the type are something else, though. It might be my cultural background, but Sevex has a very harsh ring to me. It sounds latin to me, a word I would associate with a roman warrior or a very synthetic compound. The type doesn’t soften this harshness - although it is somewhat rounded, the letters are too skinny to make this felt.\n\nSo if this were a choir, the different singers are very much out of tune.\n\nIn what you write I feel you are very attached to the name - for it’s history as a nickname. But an Internetnick is very, very different from a graphic design business.
