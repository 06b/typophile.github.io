      "content": "The test really should be can you spot Arial from the \"original\" since at least one of the logos (National) is clearly not Helvetica as can be seen in the treatment of the lowercase 'a' which has a different tail for bold and black weights than normal weight. In the case of National the type of tail is switched. It's a Grotesque variant, but not an official Helvetica. The author should have stuck to a list of companies where the use of Helvetica in the logos had been vetted like in the Wikipedia entry: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123062928/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica\").\n\nAs to the history of Arial, Wikipedia has a pretty good entry as well: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123062928/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial\"). The articles linked in the footnotes reference good sources from what I can tell.\n\nI'm not sure where the myth Microsoft didn't want to pay royalties for Helvetica stems from but it's pretty ludicrous when you consider that the Microsoft logo is actually Helvetica minus the tweaked 'o' and the custom kerning (Why wasn't that one on the test). Furthermore, Microsoft doesn't own Arial, Monotype does and Microsoft licenses the font from them.\n\nAs some may have noticed that if Arial was almost an exact clone, people should be scoring much lower. If you used say Nimbus Sans or Swiss 721 I doubt many would be able to score so high. Granted, Arial is a Helvetica substitute because of the competition between IBM/Monotype vs Xerox/Linotype in the printer market in the early 80s.\n\nLetters: 'a', 'c', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'j', 'r', 's', 't' and 'y' have strokes that end in a slant in Arial, while in Helvetica they end on the horizontal or perpendicular; however, it can be hard to discern the slanted start or end stroke on the letters: 'f', 'g', 'j' and 'y' at smaller sizes.\n\n"

Indeed, they don't own it, I should have said they popularized it. But the royalty issue is still an issue. Obviously Arial was cheaper from Monotype than Helvetica was through Linotype. And the fact that Microsoft use it for their own logo doesn't really have anything to do with the fonts they package with their software. Licensing a font for a logo and for a software package vary greatly in price.\n\nI think the issue is that Microsoft picked the cheaper font to license thinking no one would know the difference. Obviously we all know the difference and the differences in the design of Arial are seemingly arbitrary.\n\n———————————————————-  \n [Read Between the Leading podcast](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123062928/http:/rbtl.us/) | [Pixelspread](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123062928/http:/pixelspread.com/)\n\n"

It just seems like the only answer. Why would you select a typeface with the exact same widths and spacing of one of the most popular typefaces in the world instead of just selecting that popular typeface?\n\nThere were other options, similar typefaces like Univers or even Monotype's Grotesque, but of course those don't share the same metrics as Helvetica.\n\nAnd it's not like Arial is the only example of this. [Segoe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123062928/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe) is a pretty recent example of Microsoft purchasing a Frutiger clone from Monotype. In this case it seems like an example of Monotype (who now owns Linotype) not willing to sell the Frutiger trademark so selling a knock off typeface instead.\n\nIf you can find any real information about why Microsoft really did select Arial, I'd love to see it.

In essence, backwards compatibility allows some flexibility in design, provided that the technical metrics are unchanged.\n\nAlso note that sliding-scale economics in licensing means that a wealthy firm such as Microsoft might be asked to pay more than the going rate. I am not saying this is applicable, but its reasonable to think that licensing on such a large scale may have involved negotiation. In other words, Linotype may have thought they had Microsoft by the short & curlies, and subsequently upset Microsoft in the board room.\n\nI believe that Bill Gates once advocated the philosophy that power resides with those who control the underlying property.

Microsoft was already involved in a production relationship with Monotype -- there were Monotype staff at Microsoft doing the TT hinting -- and Arial needs to be seen as part of a package with Times New Roman and Courier New.\n\nI also don't think Microsoft thought 'no one would know the difference' between Arial and Helvetica; rather, the difference simply didn't matter to Microsoft. They had a technical requirement for a sans serif core font: that it match Helvetica metrics such that documents created in Windows with Arial could be printed from a printer that used Helvetica.\n\n_Segoe is a pretty recent example of Microsoft purchasing a Frutiger clone from Monotype. In this case it seems like an example of Monotype (who now owns Linotype) not willing to sell the Frutiger trademark so selling a knock off typeface instead._\n\nAt the time Segoe was developed, Monotype did not yet own Linotype. Far from Linotype being unwilling to license the Frutiger trademark, they had already licensed 'Frutiger Linotype' to Microsoft as a core font for the MS Reader. There really isn't a good explanation for Segoe if it is seen from the perspective of Microsoft looking for something that resembled Frutiger, because they already had a license for Frutiger. So clearly that perspective is erroneous. What MS were looking for, and what they had commissioned Monotype to produce, was a new UI font. I suspect the technical spec for this font was a lot more detailed than the design spec, which was probably pretty vague, e.g. ‘clean, modern’. And Monotype delivered what is either a deliberate Frutiger clone or something that by chance, from seeking to meet the technical and design briefs, turned out to be so much like Frutiger as to appear a clone to most people.\n\nHaving had some experience of delivering fonts for bundling with major software, and knowing how software development cycles work, I suspect there was a point at which MS either had to accept Segoe or throw a wrench in the entire Vista development schedule.\n\n"
