With its wide and stylish upper case it might work well for small sizes. The lower case of Clearview would probably work better though, at small sizes.   \n   \nI don't know if Amplitude's traps would help render on TV, but you might check this out.   \n   \nI am partial to Christian Schwartz's work - Simian text and Amplitude because it mangages to look stylish without being weird. Locator is there too. (The display of both Simian and Locator are too odd in my opinion for regular use.)   \n   \nCNN's US nightly news (10 eastern) uses Meta successfully, and the News Hour on PBS has used Optima for years and it looks very classy. I guess is a lot in how the type will be used, and the mood you want to convey.\n\n"

Compare for example their g's the descender is much closer to the bowl on Tiresias and would close up more quickly as you go to small sizes, no?   \n   \nI don't know how hinting etc applies to TV, and this might be a critical factor in choosing.   \n   \nBy the way, does it have to be a sans? For example PMN Caecilia, with sturdy serifs should work.   \n   \nOh I just remembered - check out the new Monitor at [www.ourtype.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20141030072229/http:/www.ourtype.com/) - really nice and from the name probably designed for the screen.\n\n"

Slab or wedge serifs are cool though - experiment.   \n   \n5: For static screens, gaussian blur the end screen by \"0.3\" in Photoshop: this will help with flickering.   \n   \n6: Be careful of red type, especially if its highly saturated. View your designs on a television or a broadcast monitor to be sure.   \n   \n7: This is where people may disagree with me: Be wary of chunky fonts at smaller sizes, they can appear to fill in a little, much like print on newspaper.\n\n"
