Specifically in relation to New Zealand which is where i live, can the cultural diversity which contributes to New Zealands identity be expressed in a display typeface?\n\nDoes Anyone know of typefaces that were designed with a similar intent? Are there typefaces that were intended to reflect the cultural masses and were succeful or failed?\n\ni dont know if i explained that very well but i would love some feedback.  \nCheers\n\n [‹ Hebrew and English side-by-side in InDesign](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122060925/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48382 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Sewing & Embroidery Software ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122060925/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16116 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Although they were technically correct, many Persian customers complained. “When will true Urdu fonts become available reflecting Persian culture?”\n\nI was surprized. I was told repeatedly that there is a sttylistic difference between Arabic and Urdu, reflecting not only in art, music, architecture, food, clothes, even in accent in speaking, choice of words, and of course language.\n\nI saw that Urdu and other languages needed a lot of cultural reseach to produce successful type designs.\n\n"

The Nazis tried to establish blackletter designs as the national face of Germany (but weren’t especially consistent about it. Neither group ever really settled on any particular face, although the Swiss modernists did narrow things down to Akzidenz/Univers/Helvetica. And I don’t think that either one was especially successful at trying to reflect their culture with those styles.\n\nConsider your own situation: how does one typeface reconcile traditionalist Maori, white New Zealanders, and the Maori that live in-between the two?\n\nYou should probably read Tschichold’s writing about sans type in _The New Typography_ and his later attacks on modernist monoculture (some appear in the appendices of Ruari McLean’s books about Tschichold.).\n\n"

And good luck with that.\n\nIf you get distracted by overt ethnic signifiers, such as those that appear in some of Joseph Churchward’s faces, you will get embroiled in touchy debates over authenticity and appropriation. That kind of face lacks range and is marginal at best, so tying your agenda to its cute banality will fail to address the mainstream of typography.\n\nTo move forward, you will have to overcome internationalism at home, and rise on the international stage.  \nFor instance, the _Sunday Star Times_ (in which the article on Kris appeared) was designed by foreigners, using foreign typefaces. That’s a frequent occurence in the newspaper business, everywhere.  \nBut then, when New Zealand publishers have been persuaded that using their own art directors and designers, and Sowersby fonts, won’t put them out of business, the question is, how much do his faces reflect or express local culture, and how much are they the product of an international type culture? It’s irrelevant.

Judging is an entirely subjective act and so the winning entry is based on the judges’ criteria - unless we know the criteria, there is no way to say why one design was chosen over another. And besides, wouldn’t you have picked the typeface that changed with the weather, too?! :)\n\nIronically, Locator is being used to represent the city at this website: [http://mspmoretolife.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081122060925/http:/mspmoretolife.com/ \"http://mspmoretolife.com\") and Bryant was used for the Minneapolis Convention & Visitors Association to again represent Minneapolis. So, sometimes the local talent is good enough.\n\nTo get back to the original question, I would say a designer can try to create a typeface to represent a city/culture/etc., but that is only intention on the designer’s part. The culture has to adopt the typeface as its own, and then it can be seen as a reflection, but it doesn’t happen the other way around... as the Metro Letters contest clearly showed.\n\n"

It happens collectively as a body of work. You can look at Johnston, Gill and Tankard and begin to see an Englishness but what do you say of Caslon? In many years and many design attempts, a cultures look may develop, but that can morph into something else. In today’s internet world, cultures overlap, mix, and breed quickly and there is more crossover than ever possible before. Today, you have a young New Zealander in Kris Sowersby, who works with an American in Christian Schwarts for a German named Erik Spiekermann to extend his Meta. At the same time, a Japanese named Akira Kobayashi draws an extension of Herman Zapf’s typeface shortly after working on Adrian Frutiger’s typeface.  \nCulture is no-longer tidy and compartmental.

There is nothing objective about cultural identity, so it will be very difficult to isolate cultural markers, and unless you incorporate what Nick above refers to as ethnic signifiers - that is, already existing symbols of the groups in question, and build them into the typeface in some way - then the question boils down to if the attempt to associate a given typeface with one culture or a variety of cultures becomes successful or not. This does not depend on the typeface itself, but upon the arguments that human actors (politicians/designers/cultural representatives/etc) attach to that typeface. Unless you make it some kind of totem-pole style typeface, it’s a social process based upon the acceptance of arguments alone.\n\nExample: huge nation-wide campaign involving the design of a typeface that \\*is said to\\* express the nation’s multiple cultures. If the public accepts this then the typeface takes on that role and \\*becomes\\* the expression of this multiplicity. Before this acceptance it wasn’t the expression of the nation’s cultural multiplicity. A table is not a table until people starts identifying that wooden structure (or other material) as such.\n\n"

After all (and please excuse me for getting a bit academic here, after all I am a social scientist by profession), social reality (e.g. interaction/communication between humans) is socially contructed. But once constructed there is no reason not to treat it as real. So if there is anyone currently typing an anti-post-modernist rebuttal against me, you can stop typing now... :)\n\nBut there is nothing manipulatory in what I mean is going on. Of course there can be, but it is not necessary. Typography is really a good example. Take the letter A. There is nothing about that shape of ink on a piece of what we call paper that forces humans to identify is as an A - were it not for the fact that humans by convention have agreed that it is an A and that it symbolises one of the sounds that humans utter when they try to communicate. Thus, giving that shape of ink the meaning of representing said sound (in its variations) enables humans to communicate without opening their mouths. That’s what I mean by socially constructed. It’s a collective understanding, it’s shared knowledge. But it is so only by virtue of humans having ’agreed’ upon it. The sound in question could just as easily have been represented by another symbol. Just as the meaning of words evolve over time.\n\nPerhaps I am stating the obvious here, but I just kept on writing by pure habit. :)\n\nPS.

Any human activity such as typeface design reflects something of the culture in which it occurs. In the case of several different cultures interacting one approach is to find the common denominator between them i.e. simplification. The typography of El Lissitzky and the Bauhaus reflects a wish to distill new design concepts out of the old Europe, transcending cultural differences.\n\nThe hybrid approach is another way of going about it. Mix design elements from different cultures existing in a given society. I guess that is what you have in mind? Roman letters with Maori-inspired spirals for serifs is one obvious example (I do not know if this has been done). The trouble with this approach is that it often - but not always - leads to kitsch- there are innumerable examples of Latin alphabets twisted and tweaked to look like Chinese, Arabic, Cyrillic, Hebrew or other scripts. You see those in some movie or book titles and travel posters to provide a cheap exotic look.\n\nA more subtle approach may be possible, and it requires sensitivity and creativity, but this has to be worked out carefully: people are very conservative when it comes to changes in type design, and the basics of legibility have to be always considered. Also there will always be those who will try to view such a project in terms of their own political agenda, but that is unavoidable.\n\n"

Certainly, minorities are more represented now in mainstream media than they were in the past, here, and I expect in New Zealand too. That’s progress, but what comes next? How do we get more of the diversity representing themselves?\n\nWith respect to type, what bearing does studying whether a typeface can reflect national culture have on whether the type designs of a nation are used in its own media, which, by any measure, is the most direct way that type can represent culture?\n\nSo Lindsay, why not ask, Can a Kiwi student design a typeface for a New Zealand publication/ad campaign/corporate identity?— because _you_ are the culture, not them, the “cultural masses”.\n\nA company identity, like that for Black Grace, shows that narrowing the focus to specific documents for a specific client can work very well, providing a solid raison d’être and functional environment for a typeface.

I’m trying to relate to where this student is coming from, and his/her attitude of social conscience.\n\nOK, my first post was a bit indie-foundry-centric, but I was thinking more of the study part of the project, not the type design part of it.\n\nIf Lindsay is to make real progress, it won’t be by getting bogged down in something where many people have commented on “the difficulty ... finding a single accurate cultural representation.”\n\nI’m suggesting an alternative.  \nInstead of working on refining the appropriation of ethnic signifiers, so one can do a really professional job of nailing the “cultural masses”, like Alt Group, why not represent oneself? Everyone is a product of their own culture, so if you’re true to yourself, your work will be an authentic representation of your culture.\n\nThere are no easy answers, because all the cultural groups we’re member of overlap. If the Euro kids have tribal tats...\n\n"

I don’t know if there is something inherently fascist in that style but for my mind the association is a real thing and when I see something similar I find it disgusting. </cite>  \n…while I find it thoroughly wonderful. Fascism, for better or worse, has been part of our culture, and you should be able to discern what gives value and what vilifies it. Especially as an Italian.\n\n<cite> Since most of the world wasn’t familiar with blackletter they switched to roman. </cite>  \nI seem to recall they substituted it with Futura (see the book “Blackletter and National Identity” by Peter Bain and Paul Shaw), whose part of inherent legibility as a text face is highly disputable (especially its lowercase). I suspect many blackletter styles would actually be more usable, especially the more simplified.  \nAn example of what I was saying about Fascism, applied to Nazism: in many ways, Italian Fascism left good building blocks of heritage, as it may happen with dictatorial regimes. Nazism did some good things, but the choice over lettering was esasperated by the ever-repeating idea of Hebrew prosecution. I seem to recall they dropped blackletter styles by saying they were of “jewish heritage” or something like that, after they have been part of their culture for ages.\n\nYes, definitely culture is not “individual”, but it neither appears to me “determined by the mass”…  \nI found a book about Louis Dollot which spoke of this juxtaposition: individual culture and mass culture. I don’t know if in English exists. It should be titled “Culture individuelle et culture de masse”, and it’s from 1974 (my Italian edition is from 1976).\n\n"
