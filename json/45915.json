Not a perfect match, but definitely close.\n\nThe most info I found about Placard was that “the Placard Condensed font family is based on drawings received from Germany” (from [its page on fonts.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205015218/http:/www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=205300)).  \nIf anyone has any more info on the face, I’d be curious to hear it.\n\n"
