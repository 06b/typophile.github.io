  "content": "Hello,\n\nI am looking for a ttf font which has at least some resemblance to \"Arno pro caption\". It doesnt need to be very close!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110212131442im_/http:/typophile.com/files/trans1x1_6439.gif)\n\nOf course a free font would be best (because I need it only once) but I would be willing to pay for one if no other option.\n\nWhy ttf? Because I want to export a document from OpenOffice into pdf (Open Office creates very solid, linked PDFs) and OpenOffice doesnt support otf in pdf.\n\nThank you very much for any ideas\n\nPS.  \nI tried uploading an image of the font ( [http://www.itcfonts.com/Assets/images/trans1x1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20110212131442/http:/www.itcfonts.com/Assets/images/trans1x1.gif \"http://www.itcfonts.com/Assets/images/trans1x1.gif\")) but didnt succeed.\n\n",
