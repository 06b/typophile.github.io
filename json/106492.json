What do you guys think? Is the composition balanced? Is this too busy? Your suggestions & constructive criticism would be much appreciated!\n\nIt's inspired by this quote... \"Wealth is of the heart and mind, not the pocket\" by Pharrell.\n\nThanks,  \n- Joseph  \n [www.josephle.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419081521/http:/www.josephle.net/ \"www.josephle.net\")\n\n",
