Minchas Shai - Shai L'Morah  \n2. Eliyahu achur - Gra - ArtScroll  \n3. R' Zalman Henna or Hanau - Chabad USA\n\nThere appears to be a contextual view, based upon the Magen Avrahom (based upon the Radak, R' David Kimchi).\n\nApparently, the view of the Magen Avraham is most accurate, with the other 3 views simply modifying or adding to the rules of the MA.\n\nHence, automatic shva-na placement will be based upon the MA, with 3 alternative versions.\n\n"
