I see quite a bit of elegant playfulness in your work, which makes me want to see a bit of that in the branding of your site as well.\n\n"

The lovely work speaks for itself.\n\nAs a concession to convention, and bearing in mind that potential customers might not be as sensitive or artistic as you are, perhaps a bit less white space ... If you had a nice logo, almost like a chop stamp on a Chinese watercolour in the top corner, it would not detract from your wonderful designs or compete with them. Then some distinction between your details and the menu list of your work would be good. Perhaps even highlighting the relevant description from the list, by means of colour or tabbing would make the navigation easier.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821080044im_/http:/typophile.com/files/highlight_5403.png)\n\nAlso, the usual threats at the bottom about copyright, copying, stealing your or your clients posessions would be good ;-)\n\n"

I'd love to see the site design itself reflect the sensibilities you've shown in the print work.\n\nThe links on the left weren't too clear as links to individual projects. I'd design a simple stark homepage from which to direct the viewer to thumbnails to see larger work or put the thumbnails on the homepage. Perhaps take advantage of the simplicity of lightbox technology to highlight the work.\n\nThis outfit, [group94](http://web.archive.org/web/20130821080044/http:/www.group94.com/) does some of the best portfolio sites for creatives I've ever come across.

It would take a lifetime to figure out the tangential effect fonts have on everyone. Which is why I go with the majority vote if there is one. Anyway, thanks!\n\n"

I agree with Sharon, I like that the work is upfront, no flash and that it's easy to see. Maybe you could include examples of some of the detailing? That would be nice as well. Another thing, maybe you could condensed all the logos you've done into one heading. Might look like less work, but will come across tidier I think.\n\n"

The problem with that is, as far as I know, it only works on a handful of browsers yet. So it's still good advice to stick with the usual suspects in terms of fonts.  \nYou know you can specify an array of fonts in CSS? So you could always specify Lucida Grande, plus some other sans to fall back on in case Lucida isn't installed.  \nMaybe also look into the new MS Clearview fonts (Calibri, Consolas, Constantia, Cambria, etc.) as options, they're quite nice for screen reading.\n\nBtw, that nav.png doesn't seem to work. :-(\n\n"

I suspect this is not intentional, but perhaps there is some rational that I don't perceive. (BTW, if you change it to make the items display uniformly, I strongly prefer showing the items without a box around them.)\n\nI also have a suggestion for you: implement a tag for each of your menu entries so that when the cursor is over an item, a tag pops-up with a repeat of the information you currently show below the item after you actually click on the link. This will allow the viewer to decide if the item is one that interests him or her.  \n&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_When going from_ A to Z,  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_I often end up_ At Oz.\n\n"
