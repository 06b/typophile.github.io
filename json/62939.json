Good idea I see what you mean by a monoline that would be better and would be a good font to own since most of my illustrations are in this style.\n\nAnyone have a suggestion for a nice, not terribly expensive monoline script? I need a very pretty one...I have Coquette, I don't like handsome...I need something that is very special and goes with my illustration style.\n\n"

Is there a monoline or almost monoline font that is otherwise fancy? It needs to feel sort of 1800s and/or victorian like the illustration does... ornate and decorative and feminine...like a sketch for a victorian illustration.\n\nIf I didn't think I would have to use it over and over I might just edit the Edwardian to be a monoline, but that is not practical for many pieces over time.\n\n"
