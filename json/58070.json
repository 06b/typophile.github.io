  "content": "I'm working on some DVD packaging, but I'm sort of at a loss about what typeface captures the right spirit in the body text.\n\nI'm thinking it needs to be really matter-of-fact, not too fancy but not clean either. Something that isn't going to be noticed too much, basically, but has a sort of slapped together, engineer-designed feel -- Clarendon came to mind, but I associate this too much with Starbucks & REI, and I don't like it for body copy.\n\nHere's the trailer for the movie -- [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCv9KUYbLCs](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021002541/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCv9KUYbLCs \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCv9KUYbLCs\")\n\nSuggestions? Thanks!\n\n",
