  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm not actually writing a bachelor thesis about typography but I do want it to look nice, and above all easy to read.\n\nWhat do you think about Merriweather set at 10 / 16 with an appropriate column width. [http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070903/http:/www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather \"http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather\")\n\nAlso I'm looking for a cool sans-serif font that combines well with Merriweather for the chapter titles. I might use all caps. Any ideas?\n\nThank,\n\nTim\n\n",

      "content": "Is this for screen or print? Your \"10/16\" makes me think it's the latter.\n\nMerriweather is heavily optimized for onscreen text - its x-height is pretty massive. In print such proportions are suited for very small text - nothing close to sizes good for extended reading. Plus it doesn't have an Italic (at least not yet).\n\nTrying to think of typefaces in that genre... Maybe one of these:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/person/Dieter\\_Hofrichter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414070903/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/Dieter_Hofrichter/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/person/Dieter\\_Hofrichter/\")\n\nhhp\n\n"

It may not look as it should; in fact, it probably won't.\n\nAlso, it is a design commissioned by Google; they paid rock-bottom prices to the designers so I would not want to depend upon their quality.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Hrant and George,\n\nIt's for print. Despite the large x-height I thought it might work, but I guess it's off the table now. Also I must have overlooked the fact that there are no italics. (wich is a problem)\n\nI'm really fond of your suggestions Hrant, but since I'am a 'poor student' I can't afford to buy nice fonts for my thesis. I will remember the foundry for commercial jobs though.\n\nI think Merriweather is a great font, you can see it's designed with love and care. Do you know any free (or really cheap) alternatives that have the same friendly, modern, serif style quality as Merriweather?\n\nTim\n\n"
