Check it out on the tails:   \n   \n [http://www.atlanta.is/default.asp?sType=Images&sAction=Gallery-View](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022114006/http:/www.atlanta.is/default.asp?sType=Images&sAction=Gallery-View)   \n   \nI guess it's partly explained by the fact that it seems to be an Icelandic company - you know, viking helmet... One cool thing is that the logo is skewed to fit the tail depending on which side it's on. But what the hell is that dot?!   \n   \nhhp\n\n",
