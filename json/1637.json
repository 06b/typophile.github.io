      "content": "Jared, I think you may have gotten as close as we can get to this one. I agree Trafton has many very similar features, but my guess is that it may have been a style model for this Trans Cal logo artwork. In other words, I think the reason we have had such a hard time with this is that it is not a font at all. (I know these are sometimes 'famous last words', but I just don't think this looks like any font I've seen except House Industries [\"Fabulous\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113020349/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg5.html) (at the bottom of the page), which is also rather close to this. Trafton image follows (also from the Script Guide, and note that the letters do not connect -- something it's hard to tell from sample books): ![Trafton Sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20141113020349im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/18625.gif)\n\n"
