I'm creating a marketing campaign for a art exhibition in which I've used Futura BT extra black condensed for the main title and I need a body text font to compliment it in the brochure and leaflets.\n\nI'm looking for a highly leigable serif font any suggestions? I've dabbled with Scala but I'm not sure if the balance is right.\n\nThanks guys\n\n",
