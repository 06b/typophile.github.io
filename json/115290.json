I really love Salvo Serif, with its round O and in general very open round counters: [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/salvoserif/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714124617/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/salvoserif/ \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/salvoserif/\")\n\nHowever, its italics are really just oblique:\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714124617im_/http:/i.imgur.com/l0jaoIB.png)\n\nDoes anyone know of a similar font with true italics?\n\n",
