      "content": "Todd - Kudos for crafting something special for this craft-related job.   \n   \nA few things you might look at:   \n   \n\\* the connectors coming off the u, d and l seem too different from each other. The 'itti' works nicely because the connectors are uniform.   \n   \n\\* You might omit the connection between the 'p' and the 'i' and also consider omitting the connector between the d and l.   \n   \n\\* the g on the middle design is sweet, but the other g fits in better.   \n   \n\\* You might look at the inconsistent height of the ascenders on the 'ddl'   \n   \n\\* if your ascenders, descenders looped, it might look more...more homespun.   \n   \n\\* The initial cap 'C' looks too large in relation to the 'K'   \n   \n\\* Can any knitting tools be incorporated...can the descenders become loose thread?   \n   \nhope this helps. good luck.   \n   \na few fonts that might work if the client suggests revisions -- P22 has a Needlepoint font, Dave Bastian has a font called Noodle Script, and My Fonts sells Coquette by Mark Simonson.   \n   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "It took me a while to get back to this logo, but by sorting and absorbing   \nall the comments above Ive come up with these three variations. Its actually   \nmore of a progression.   \nThe first one: is similar to the originals except thicker, more yarn-like,   \nand I removed the connector on the p. The second: I started to make the   \nconnectors and shape of the n's and u more uniform while leaving the varying   \nheights of the d's and l alone. I also added some breathing room. Third: I   \njust finished making the connectors and heights more uniform. What do you   \nthink?

I'm also wondering if the 'l' could somehow be further differentiated, only a little mind you, with a tiny loop or curve or even a little flick? I like the new weight also. Perhaps the only thing that I see, and that says a lot ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20051125083809im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif), is the 'C' reads a bit as a 'G' because of the way it connects to the 'u'. ???\n\n"

Im going to take a look and see how other script fonts finish their C's.   \nIll work on trying out some variations on the l and tt. Ill post the results. Keep m coming though.\n\n"
