Ditto ITC Franklin Gothic. Can we persuade you to add OSFs?\n\n"

I’m still a little unsure how I want to proceed about furthering the design; it may just be a sandbox for me to play with multiple masters, OpenType, and so on for a few years until I know what I’m doing and the font can be released.\n\n"
