Massimo Vignelli’s fabulous spencerian logo is back, and has been manipulated into some gorgeous new packaging.

I’m not sure that at a glance this tells you anything at all about where the shopper has been, especially not for people who aren’t ’in the know’ about the new packaging. It’s conceptually and visually elegant, and I’m glad to see the Optima-esque logo (blahhhh) replaced, but I’m not convinced it works as a re-brand.\n\n"

It seems to fit with the company’s decision to dump everything but the Saks Fifth Avenue stores and focus on selling luxury.\n\n"

And yet, I remember seeing somewhere an example of a similar treatment of the logotype of the popular apéritif, St.Raphaël. The whole thing using bits and pieces of the logo, reassembled in a random order, looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I think it worked fine, though. The visual message was loud and clear; it screamed ’St.Rapha’!\n\n"

      "content": "With a company like Saks I think something like this works because they are depending upon everyone wanting to be a part of the so-called ’in’ crowd and anyone in the ’in’ crowd would know. It could, perhaps, also be likened to retail where they don’t use price tags, because as you know, if you have to ask, you can’t afford it.\n\nSeriously, I do like it. It seems very eighties which is oh so very aughties. I love black and white and I really am happy to see them using a script again.\n\n"

I must say, I like the Saks remake better....\n\n"
