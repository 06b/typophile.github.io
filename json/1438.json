Nothing serious though, it's just a bit confusing.   \n   \nI second your opinion about 25.006, but I'm worried   \nthat those kind of designs are too detailed for a T-shirt:   \npeople would need to get far too close for comfort to   \nbe able to decipher the text, and they don't make that   \nmuch sense when seen from afar.   \nNot every brilliant idea translates well to a T-shirt.\n\n"
