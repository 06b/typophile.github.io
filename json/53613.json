The tree on the cover reminds me of the little scribbles I make in my notebook. I couldn't find a picture of the back cover, but it has similar swirls around the edges.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629012522im_/http:/typophile.com/files/3willows%20cover_3496.jpg)\n\nI also found this book, The Joy Luck Club. The title is so familiar, but I've never read it. I love the cover. I like the color scheme and the simple design...I think it has a sort of Asian feel to it. It is simple and elegant and I like it, and even though stacking type is a type crime I love how the author's name makes the cover asymmetrical.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130629012522im_/http:/typophile.com/files/joy%20luck_4577.jpg)\n\n",
