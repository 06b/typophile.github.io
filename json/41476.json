Does anybody know where these fonts have their origins? I do know that in old versions of AutoCad there were strokefonts, but maybe anybody knows if there is a program that used this specific font?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nThijs.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [HS-785HB.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20080204034739/http:/typophile.com/files/HS-785HB.pdf) | 572.15 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Sphere Macro geometric sans - ITC Avant Garde Gothic {Marc O}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080204034739/http:/typophile.com/node/41542 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Gault Millau serif logo - Engravers {Marten F} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080204034739/http:/typophile.com/node/41527 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
