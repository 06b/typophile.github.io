It works in InDesign, Photoshop, etc. The name of the font is there, but when I select the text & font name, the text goes blank.   \nI created the font in FontLab.   \nOther fonts I've created are working just fine in these recently acquired Abode software products...   \n   \nvery strange...   \nany thoughts are appreciated...   \n   \nthanks!   \namy\n\n",

You can do it with a Utility like [Font Finagler](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823100609/http:/homepage.mac.com/mdouma46/fontfinagler/). This is pretty much required if you want to develope and test fonts on OS X anyway. Changing the font name during testing each time you make a new version (the font name, not the file name) can help, too.\n\n"
