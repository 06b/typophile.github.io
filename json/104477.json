A region in the middle of the font is extremely stretched to create vertical strokes -- angled for the s -- and what was probably a ball terminal on the a is amputated.  \nDon't know if its worth seeking out the precise victim of this surgery.  \nEasy to see version of your image:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140828215411im_/http:/typophile.com/files/StretchCut_3527.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
