To give you an idea of content, check out trini scene.com, trini pulse.com and island vibes.com (again, no spaces in the names). I am looking for something nice, to put as the site logo, to make Tshirts and to use as a logo for watermarking images. We’re just stumped here and I understand this is an excellent community where typography is concerned, so any help would be much appreciated.\n\nP.S The reason I put the URLS with no spaces is because I don’t want anyone to happen to find this post, want to keep it secret ;)\n\n",
