  "content": "First of all, I discovered this web site by chance a few days ago, and realized what an immense and fascinating world this is! I think in another life I would like to study font design. I am redesigning a logo for a small law firm (mine). I don't want to use one of those heavy and distasteful fonts that law firms use, especially I don't want anything encased in one of those horrible squares that law firms tend to use to show that they are \"reliable, trust-worthy and institutional\". Since the name I chose for the law firm is one single, made-up word that could have more than one meaning, I decided to focus entirely on the font, and leave the corporate identity up to the evocative effect of the name. The logo is just going to be the corporate name, blue font. I like sans fonts, and I hate everything that is not plain and essential. So, I was thinking of using Futura, but the results of an internal poll (family and friends in the corporate world) seemed to point toward something with less of an edge and more \"comfy\" - such as Gill Sans. Someone suggested Century Gothic, saying that given the firm's very unusual name and the fact that none of the letters is emphasized (all LC except for the first letter of the name) it's a cool effect. Any thoughts on this would be really appreciated!\n\n",

I know you said you like sans fonts, but if there were two doors each with a lawyer name on it, I have more implicit trust in a guy whose name looks [traditional](http://web.archive.org/web/20150119233354/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/hightower/) and [sophisticated](http://web.archive.org/web/20150119233354/https:/monokrom.no/fonts/satyr) rather than edgy and easy-going.

The personality of the firm is very informal, practically oriented \"let's sit down and talk business\", which does not mean tasteless, though.  \nWith regard to sans, this [http://www.linklaters.com/pages/index.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20150119233354/http:/www.linklaters.com/pages/index.aspx \"http://www.linklaters.com/pages/index.aspx\") is one of the most famous law firms for business law, yet they use it.

However, it seems to me that - especially in the corporate / business world, nowadays - there are various degrees of stiffness / casualness. Take the VC world, for example, attorneys don't even wear a suit, sometimes. I try to put myself into the client's shoes - not wondering if they like the logo, in that you are right - but wondering what kind of gut-feeling they would get from it. What I would like to communicate is dinamic, flexible, unpretentious and down to earth, and business minded. Having said that, those were my first attemps, but based on the general poll here (quite negative on the whole sans serif), I think I am going to try some different fonts...\n\n"

That’s even worse than “like.” They have to be able to articulate their thoughts or you, and they, are making uninformed decisions.\n\n“_What **I** would like to communicate is dinamic, flexible, unpretentious and down to earth, and business minded_.”  \nIrrelevant. Ask the client what **they** want to communicate, to whom, and to what end. Write this down, and get them to sign-off on it as a formal starting point. Go from there, and when you present your concepts, clearly state you have based your decisions on the criteria they signed-off on. If they throw in a few more things, you say “_I can do that, however, that was not something we discussed previously, as seen on this document (show them their signature). In order to revisit this, it will take me X hours, and cost an addition $X_. How would you like to proceed?” As lawyers, they should respect this. If not, they are hypocrites, and probably going to be a lousy client.\n\nAnd just out of curiosity, what is the budget for this job? Do the lawyers work for free? As high priced professionals, their asking someone to work for free is flat out disrespectful (and again, hypocritical). Not to mention how working for free undermines the integrity of the profession, while simultaneously jeopardizing the livelihood of other designers.\n\nBefore you talk budget, ask them what their hourly rate is. That will provide you with an excellent segue.\n\n"

My point is to gauge (define) gut feelings before making decisions based on them.\n\n“_And refusing to help people who have trouble expressing their gut feelings is ungracious and unproductive_.”  \nAlso agree. As professionals I believe we have an obligation to do our best to (empower others to) make informed decisions that go beyond the subjective.\n\nI am presently doing design work for my struggling farm friends in exchange for vegetables. And I am constantly helping them make objective decisions regarding their communication strategies. In many instances, what seems simple, obvious, and boring them, may in fact be a selling point. For example, a blight-resistant tomato, a new type of compost, a new tool that makes weeding easier &c. They have “feelings” about what they want to communicate, or accomplish, for example, attract more CSA (community shared agriculture) members. Thats where the designer comes in. I provide them with strategies to do so which often go far beyond their gut or unarticulated feelings, and they freely and graciously acknowledge this every time.\n\nI believe you and I are on the same page.\n\n"
