      "content": "You can use kerning in a dynamic text field but only in Flash 8 for PC. Still there is no way of having kerning in input text. So in a flash font tester one has to separate input text and display text (with kerning). See my [example](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203231930/http:/www.fonts.info/flashtest/flashtyper.html).\n\nRalf\n\n[http://www.fonts.info](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203231930/http:/www.fonts.info/ \"http://www.fonts.info\")\n\n"

However, this is the fix I'm using just now:\n\nFirstly, make sure:  \n- You have an input TextField created  \n- You have setup a TextFormat object with 'kerning' set to true and 'letterSpacing' set to, for example, -1.\n\nThen use the following code:\n\n`\nmyTextField.onChanged = function():Void {\nmyTextField.setTextFormat( theTextFormat )\n}\n`\n\nI hope that helps. If I've missed something and it's actually not a fix, please let me know!\n\nEdit: I just realised this thread's more than a year old :D\n\n"
