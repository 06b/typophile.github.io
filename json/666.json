  "content": "For those interested, my good friend Justin Bakse has just released a handy application named Ligature Counter. In short, you can paste text into the application and get results for both letter frequency and letter combo frequency. Very nice for analyzing text, thinking about frequent letterforms or working out some new ligatures. The application is free and web based.   \nTake it for a spin here:   \n [http://www.volcanokit.com/volcanokit2/ligCounter/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106161408/http:/www.volcanokit.com/volcanokit2/ligCounter/)   \n   \n   \nMany thanks to Justin for making this for me (and then making it free for everyone) and Hrant for planting the initial idea in my head for such a thing.   \n   \nBest,   \nEric O.\n\n",

      "content": "This is a very handy little thing. Thank you. Is there any chance of modifying it to analyse Unicode text? I have extensive corpi of ancient Greek and Biblical Hebrew, and would love to develop some frequency data.   \n   \nHere's something derived from the current implementation that might be useful for people want to compare the relative space efficiency of different fonts. The string of letters below represents the frequency of each in English as sampled from a text of 34,643 words (most of the books of Genesis, Exodus and Numbers in the New International Version (UK spelling)). I also sampled from shorter versions of the text to confirm that the frequency was similar or identical in texts of any significant length (10,000+ words). The benefit of comparing fonts using this string, rather than simply comparing alphabet length, should be obvious.   \n   \nBelow the string are the relative letter frequencies (actual number of occurences in the sampled text divided by 100 and rounded to the nearest whole number (except q, which is rounded up to 1 from .3)). Remove line breaks for best results after pasting into your app of choice.   \n   \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa   \naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbcccccccc   \nccccccccccccccccdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd   \nddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   \neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   \neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   \neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee   \neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff   \nfffffffgggggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   \nhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   \nhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiii   \niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii   \niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijjkkkkkkkkkklllllllllllllll   \nlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllmmmmm   \nmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn   \nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn   \nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooo   \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopppppppp   \npppppppppppqrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr   \nrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrssss   \nssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss   \nsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssttttttttttttttttt   \ntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt   \ntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt   \nttttttttttttttuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuvv   \nvvvvvvvvvvvvwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwxyyyyyy   \nyyyyyyyyyyyyyz   \n   \na 121   \nb 21   \nc 24   \nd 68   \ne 186   \nf 37   \ng 28   \nh 101   \ni 87   \nj 2   \nk 10   \nl 60   \nm 39   \nn 91   \no 117   \np 19   \nq 1   \nr 84   \ns 87   \nt 131   \nu 34   \nv 14   \nw 31   \nx 1   \ny 29   \nz 1\n\n"

You can also do this by having a straight string of the 26 letters where each is scaled horizontally by its [relative] frequency.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
