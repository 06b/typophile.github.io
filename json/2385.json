  "content": "What's that so-called \"Soft Hyphen\" in slot 173 of the Windows codepage? It's 00AD in Unicode. It shows up in the MyFonts tables, as well as the Windows CharacterMap, but it behaves very funny in Word and WordPad, whether I enter it using the Alt-zero method or I do a copy-paste from the CharacterMap. Is it supposed to appear/disappear like that? And sometimes turn into two hyphens?! Where's the \"hard\" hyphen? The regular one breaks too. Is there one that doesn't?   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

      "content": "That makes sense - it does only appear when it's end-of-line. I guess the point is to manually guide the hyphenation routine. The only little mystery is why Word _sometimes_ subs two hyphens for it...   \n   \nAnd why is it missing from the MacRoman codepage? Doesn't Quark and stuff have bunches of different spaces and hyphens for textflow customization?   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
