      "content": "There is no “right order,” but of course there are better orders than others...\n\nI would advise putting ’sups’, ’numr’ and the like ahead of ’onum’. The way you have it there, you (probably) would have to make both default and oldstyle numbers as input to ’numr’ etc. which is just cluttering up your code. For similar reasons, you might want to have ’ordn’ before ’smcp’.\n\nYou probably want ’numr’ and ’dnom’ ahead of ’frac’. (If you have arbitrary fractions in ’frac’ you can use a lookup from ’numr’.)\n\nI think you’d want ’hist’ before ’liga’ (depending on what’s actually in there).\n\n"
