There are several alternatives in that thread.

It’s a slab version of their sans, which was called [Antenna](http://web.archive.org/web/20141024022428/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/antenna_normal/) last time I checked (which is a great name - i hope it sticks). The sans is also used by Poz, Popular Mechanics, and another publication or two, and has the extensive range of weights and widths one would expect from Font Bureau, but as far as I know the slab is exclusive to AARP, at least for the time being.\n\n"

      "content": "I appreciate your feedback. Antenna has a lot of differences (Antenna lowercase \"l\" is curved at the bottom, not in Boomer for instance. Also the Os (Q,C, G. etc.) in Antenna are not round, they are a square-round (hard to describe, but they are weird and i really don't like them!). Antenna feels extended, although it may just be that O shape.\n\nAny other suggestions?\n\n"
