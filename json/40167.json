  "content": "Font Software Tutor Required\n\nWe are looking for a font software tutor to provide tuition in one of the main software packages such as Fontlab.\n\nWe would like to design a font and have a very strong idea on how it should look but are not very competent with the various technical rules of font design or the use of the software.\n\nWe are both students based in London and can pay around £6 per hour for the tuition. We are flexible in terms of the tuition time and place.\n\nPlease contact us if you can help.\n\n [‹ Type trends and predictions for 2008!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030821/http:/typophile.com/node/40491 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Borges Titulo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030821/http:/typophile.com/node/40498 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
