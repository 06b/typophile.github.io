Can anyone suggest a closer match.\n\nI have convinced the client into using the font, now I have to deliver a digital version of this rare sample, so I would greatly appreciate any ideas. It is a beautiful font and is definitely markedly different from Helvetica for example.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [StandardFont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017232724/http:/typophile.com/files/StandardFont.jpg) | 294.47 KB |\n\n",
