  "content": "Hello typophiles!\n\nI was at first a little hesitant about asking about this in the fear of perhaps not being relevant enough. I've decided, however, that I'll at least give it a try anyway.\n\nAlrighty, my situation. I'm currently writing an assignment paper about typography: Its history throughout the centuries, notable persons, font faces, Movable Type, ligatures, and so on. So far I've come through it with all my limbs intact, although my sleeping routine might've been affected a little--it's been a good ride, though!\n\nThe paper. The place where I live isn't exactly known for typographic literacy, so I kind of look at my paper as an exclamation mark... a statement, of sorts. The problem is that the exclamation mark is missing its dot, it feels not quite finished yet. So I thought I'd pose the question:\n\nHow does the future of typography look?\n\nIt's been rather easy to research the past, information being relatively easy to obtain and all, and the current is a piece of cake, but I find it's hard to imagine how it's going to develop. I've covered in my paper how typography currenty works on the internet and on various devices, which, to me, seems quite futuristic already (although it has numerous limitations).\n\nWhen I think of the future, holographic displays and such comes to mind, but it doesn't say so much about typography. I can imagine that Sans-Serif fonts probably will become way more popular (in some areas in Europe it's become normal to use them in print, for example), but I also see fonts perhaps becoming more sofisticated or more/less imaginative, but in what fashion I cannot seem to get my head around.\n\nSo, if I could get a few moments from your time, I'd really appreciate it if you scribbled down what you think about the future of typography. Thanks!\n\n",

I think there's a lot of potential to get a much more natural effect, using contextual alternates, than has so far been achieved, so I'd like to take a crack at that.\n\n2.

I think the major upsurges (in terms of idealism) were from 1455 to 1501, the major investigations at the beginning of the 20th century (both in regard to traditionalism and modernism), and in the 1990s (as a consequence of the unlicensing of font formats).\n\nOther than than that it has been merely technological transitions (which have not been insignificant—but seem other than what you are looking for). In terms of \"holographic displays,\" and similar such multi-media stuff; I'm not sure how much this actually has to do with typography so much as something else (and we have gone through that time and time again). Typography is what it is. There may be occasional questioning as to what it is in an idealogical sense, but ultimately it is what it is. We just keep coming back to the fundamentals.\n\nGerald  \n [http://BielerPrss.blogspot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20120418090111/http:/bielerprss.blogspot.com/ \"http://BielerPrss.blogspot.com\")\n\n"

There are plenty of new and interesting developments in typography to come, but the type industry itself and publishers and readers seem almost wholly opposed to innovation. People like you for example. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to want to hit the nails firmly back into the wood before they've even popped up.\n\nIn general, people are terrified of change and the very idea of change. I am not, and it gets me into trouble.\n\nThat makes me very happy. To upend conservatism, or at least try to.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

It's like the person in the late 1800s who said they should close the patent office because there was nothing left to invent.\n\nThere will always be progress, as long as a product is used. The only way typography can die is if reading dies, and that isn't likely to happen before someone invents mental telepathy (and who knows, maybe that will require fonts as well.)\n\n"

There’s going to be a greater demand for fonts with five weights, three widths, and supports for every possible Latin language, Cyrillic, Chinese, and probably Arabic. On a somewhat related note, the “great designers” of the future will no longer be the high-minded hotshots in New York and Basel, they’ll Dubai-based geniuses who can effectively communicate across cultures.\n\nThe comfortable threads of nostalgia and historicism that are running through American design will cool off and popular type designs will be more detached from the past, but I’m not sure how long it will be before consumers have a hopeful outlook on the future and designers will tire of appropriation.\n\nAt some point in the more-distant future there will be another revolution in reproduction technology when information can be blasted right into our brains, but I doubt that any of us is going to produce an accurate prediction about what that will do to type.\n\n"

      "content": "Firstly, I see the long tail showing up in typography, as in everywhere else. This means more interesting and varied forms. I wouldn't be surprised if horizontal stress gains some popularity.  \nNow, let's look at the current favorite of the serifed C fonts: Constantia. Based upon this, we should see a rise in wedge serifs and diagonal stress, the later prediction also supported by its incorporation in the highly scientifically designed NPS Rawlinson, which is an old style font. While the wedge serif will probably fade, I believe the diagonal stress will stick around, but it won't be old style, as advancements in technology allow for much greater line contrast, which typographers will take advantage of. We'll also see more open and larger counters, as seen in Constantia and Clearview.  \nGiven the advancements in screen resolution and the increasing use of electronic paper, humanist sans serif fonts will dominate the sans. I can say with certainty that there will be at least one highly popular sans with a diagonal stress. Now, the fonts that I think will have the most influence are Calibri, Clearview, Optima (Nova), and the font designed by the guy who defended my inquiry about sans in the book font thread (his novelty and rejection of orthodoxy make me feel that he will be an innovator). Now, I don't have the specifics of Clearview or the unnamed typeface on hand, so I'll talk about Calibri and Optima. As duel use becomes more crucial (remember, electronic paper behaves like paper), typographers will try to make more almost-serif fonts, a popular example of which is Optima. This meens we'll see more flaring, with the first, furtive attempts being based upon Optima. Eventually, the serif/sans distinction will be a continuum. Calibri will have the influence of familiarity, making it the basis people will use when thinking about a sans for long enough to influence the majority of sans at least slightly. Now, the most distinctive part of Calibri is its rounded corners and ends. This tells me will go in the opposite direction from how they were at their height and become softer. Now, these two trends could combine in such a way that the lines will flare into a rounded end, which would look slightly reminiscent of a ball terminal.\n\n"

If you are looking 100 years ahead -- or even 50 -- it would be silly to expect OpenType to still be the format. PostScript has lasted 15 years. Hot metal lasted about 70 years. Photocomp around 40 years. The technology from the time of hot metal through photocomp caused certain changes in type because the economic emphasis was on selling the machines that set type, not the type itself. Typography (the type design part of it) was a servant to those machines.\n\nThe computer changed that. Now, for a period, anyone can produce type. But OpenType changes the software requirements considerably; if OpenType goes a certain way, it may again take a large foundry to economically produce fonts.\n\nBut that is very short term. Consider this. In 50 years, or 100 years, or however far into the future you want to project, we will still be communicating, at least in part, with the written word. And you can type faster than you can write longhand, and speak faster than you can write longhand. Therefore, type will be around. In what form will depend on where technology takes us.\n\n"

ITC fonts were so exciting, I remember waiting for releases (via Linotype), looking back, I cringe… Only time really tells what stands out and breaks out of its time period.  \nFont formats come and go… got any type 3 fonts? or NimbusQ? or Letrafonts? Or Fonts with Typestyler? All these formats came out around the time of Postscript, who cares or needs most of these others? Font formats will only be adopted when they are soo much better than what is standard at any time, which is why you will see postscript fonts linger around for a long time, because OT fonts need to be far more compelling for users to be willing to purchase them, over an already purchased PS font. Only a fool would buy an OT font that has no more functionality than a PS font, as it would be redundant.  \nPaper will carry on, the ultimate archive, we still have Gutenberg Holy Bibles, but we can only guess how he produced them, as his instruments and technology are long gone. In his life, he was a failure, financially, but to me, quite an evangelist!\n\nInk on paper adds the permanence, and quality that the publisher intends, while at the moment (we have been waiting for decades) screen resolutions are roughly the same as before the computer revolution.  \nI believe signs will be a strong outlet for typography, which bodes well for headline fonts. Print will keep fighting, with costs continuing to decrease (mature technology plus competition from internet and far ranging competitors) and automation increasing. Niche market magazines (check B&N) will increase. Catalogs. More range of printed material but fewer copies printed, which will be good for typography in general.  \nFonts and font ownership seem to be going back to metal type years. Agfa seems to own everything, through consolidation (Agfa (Compugraphic), Monotype, Linotype, ITC, and Letraset(I think). And there are lots of smaller and regional boutique font companies. And who can forget Adobe?  \nThe Truth shall set you free\n\n"

The contrast of page design in a scribal pre-literate community vs an industrial community vs the individualist communities of the web. Just be mindful to not get too high-minded.

Users are requires to apply multiple layers. Alpha channels in a font format will be a new way to alter weight. Currently I can only adjust weight by reducing stem width, crude dots, light traps, stripes &c. Picture a counterless art deco display fonts like Baby Teeth, Parkitechture, Misirlou. Now imagine the O, instead of being solid, having a gradient so the centre is transparent. Picture a boringsans lowercase b. The stem width is uniform. Where bowl meets stem, the lines gradually fade to near transparent. Picture a spraypaint font that looks like real spraypaint. How about a \"lipstick on a mirror\" font with variable transparency? Now imagine how shitty/unconvincing those effects would look using current font technology.\n\nAssignable colours: Currently, fonts have one assignable colour. To assign multiple colours, I have to create separate font layers. No fun to make, no fun to use. Assignable colours could work with CSS to make headline fonts which correspond with a web site's colour scheme.\n\nHue and value shifts: Currently, a designer can assign a wood texture to a font and it'll looks like letters cut out of wood. But what about a hillybilly-style font with planks and nails? Each plank would have a fake woodgrain effect and self shadowing where the planks overlap. Maybe I'd like to make a cheesy 70's airbrush chrome effect font? To make something like that where the designer can apply a colour to a material, I need to be able to assign hue and value shifts.\n\nZ plane: I would like to be able to assign three dimensional attributes to glyph? Visual displays aren't going to be flat forever so why not support 3d geometry in a font format? Imagine Frankfurter if it were really 3D and appearing to hover 3cm off your monitor. Face recognizing fake 3D desktops are probably only a few years away. Currently, designers can loft their own text but as a font designer, I want to be able to shape each letter precisely in three dimensions.\n\nPseudorandomization: Currently, I have to use OpenType ligatures to create a pseudorandom effect. That system doesn't allow tracking because the spacing font each ligature is fixed. Other systems can be used to create a pseudorandom effects but none are turned on by default in Adobe apps so it's unlikely that designers will use them.\n\nDesigning fonts with current TTF/OTF tech is like being an designer whose only tools are black construction paper and a pair of scissors. There are a lot of possibilities but after a decade of cutting shapes with black paper and scissors I'm pining for different art supplies. I'm primarily thinking of features that would improve display fonts. If you think new font capabilities wouldn't improve text fonts as well then try using your imagination. It seems like new fonts formats are created to support existing font ideas instead of giving us tools we can use to create something totally new.\n\nYeah, I know about Photofonts, no thx. I want vectors and I want it to be fully supported by default. Either the future of typography will involve some of the above or it'll involve me going completely nuts.\n\n"
