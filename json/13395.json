With this new upgrade, all wiki links that need content are marked with a red w. For those of you who have been waiting for an excuse to write new content, the little red w's will point you in the right direction.\n\n[TypoWiki](http://web.archive.org/wiki) links can be found throughout Typophile. Anywhere a typophile wants to add a wiki link, whether in the forums or in the Uppercase Blogs s/he simply needs to add brackets like this [[TypoWiki]].\n\n",
