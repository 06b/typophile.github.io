  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nI’m going to design some storybooks for kids and teenagers, does anybody knows good references? I would like to know font suggestions too. I’ve noticed, at least here in my country, that many books of this kind uses fonts like Garamond set in 12pt or more, and I would like to avoid this.\n\nThanks,\n\n",

      "content": "Once upon a time.. Just kiddin\n\nI made a Kids magazine time ago. I can give you these tips.  \n1.- use a one-column layout. kids gets losed in multiple columns…  \n2.- use a geometric font (i like Futura, have a lot of weights). why geometric?, becouse the ‘a’ and ‘g’ glyps. Some kids can’t recognize or get confused with the shapes of different fonts.  \n3.- Use font in large size: 12 and up…  \n4.- Most important: BE CAREFULL, even more than other designs. Kids believe everything you publish, so take a time to check everything.  \n5.- EVEN most important: HAVE FUN. (i miss a lot that magazine)\n\nHope it helps\n\n"

      "content": "I don’t agree about the advice to use geometric fonts. Elsewhere on typophile people have said that there is no evidence that children have more trouble with a two storied a and g. I think this is just a persistent myth.\n\nThe ‘have fun’ advice sounds great though!\n\n"
