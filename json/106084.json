To make that shape you'd need to make two copies of the letter and manually connect the points on one to the equivalent points on the other to create the diagonal extrusion.\n\n"

For some reason or another I saw the example as a flat shadow with a line pattern.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418162810im_/http:/www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/TYPOHILE_T_lineshadow.jpg)\n\nMust have seen the Op's post before my 3rd cup of coffee...\n\n"

I'm not say it can't be done as you say but take a closer look at the diagonal lines in the Op's sample. There are several different sections each having the diagonal lines on different angles. Can that be accomplished by 3d extrusion of the text, perhaps I'll try it later. But, I think it was hand rendered via guides and all ...and not extruded.\n\nIn my below sample I overlayed text and traced the areas I wanted to fill as I mentioned earlier. All the diagonal lines are evenly spaced and of the same angle because it is a pattern, but the shadow effect seems to get lost especially on the crossbar of the G...\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418162810im_/http:/www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/typophile_crosshatch.jpg)\n\n...one way or another I'll have mastered this crosshatching technique by the end of this weekend ...GRRR!!!\n\n"
