  "content": "I just completed the MA Typo/Graphic Studies at LCC in London. My final project was about the use of blackletter in Mexico. I explored the possible reasons for its use, historical facts, and the shapes and tendencies of Mexican blackletters. From the photographic research performed in Mexico I found patterns and deviations in Mexican blackletters. Then I deconstructed each signage, ending up with more than 1500 individual characters. I removed the letters from its context and colour, transforming the colourful typographic elements of the original signs into black silhouettes. Afterwards I overlaid all characters of each letter in order to appreciate the most popular shapes, line strokes, elements and ornaments. The result is an X-Ray look-alike alphabet, that conveys the essence of Mexican blackletters.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [0 Portada.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/0%20Portada.jpg) | 181.39 KB |\n| [4 interior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/4%20interior.jpg) | 122.5 KB |\n| [7 interior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/7%20interior.jpg) | 141.56 KB |\n| [8 interior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/8%20interior.jpg) | 213.66 KB |\n| [9 interior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/9%20interior.jpg) | 140.52 KB |\n| [10 interior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/10%20interior.jpg) | 124.72 KB |\n| [11 interior.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/typophile.com/files/11%20interior.jpg) | 133.89 KB |\n\n",

Each city has a different characteristic that unifies the scripts that writers employ. Less now with the cross polinization of the internet, but nonetheless, the roots are still there,\n\nAs for the Cholo/Mexican American/Cailifornia style of graffiti, Handselecta is working with an artist named Mike Giant from Albequerque, New Mexico, who is very influenced by this lettering style in his artwork. [http://www.handselecta.com/fonts\\_hsgiant\\_so.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/www.handselecta.com/fonts_hsgiant_so.html \"http://www.handselecta.com/fonts\\_hsgiant\\_so.html\") [http://www.mikegiant.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213/http:/www.mikegiant.com/ \"http://www.mikegiant.com/\")\n\nMy understanding (please fill in any of the blanks or fuzzy facts if anyone knows) is that most of the early printing presses in Colonial Mexico were stocked with Dutch blackletter types, because of the political link between the royal families of Spain and the Netherlands. These printing types are the basis for what has become most of the vernacular blackletter that we find handlettered in this culture. It is ingrained in the culture and was adopted by the gangs of LA as early as the 30's according to Chaz's article, pre-spray paint and was executed in brush, or as Chaz conjectures, possibly the daubers of shoe-shine boys\n\nAnother interesting iteration is the pichacao style of graffiti form Brazil, which is also a square-ish blackletter style executed with small rollers as opposed to spray paint.\n\nAttached is a cholo handstyle by Mike Giant, taken from his blog:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213im_/http:/typophile.com/files/header.gif)\n\nAnd here is a pretty good example of pichacao by Os Gemeos of Sao Paulo\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124004213im_/http:/typophile.com/files/gemeos.jpg)\n\nSorry, for opening it up to subject matter outside of Mexico, hope this is relevant to you.\n\nBest,  \nChristian\n\n"

Is from my book.\n\nAmerica was discovered in 1492 and by 1521, Hernan Cortes, on behalf of the Spanish crown, conquered Mexico, establishing the Colony of New Spain.  \nThe first printing press in the American continent was found in Mexico in 1538, by means of Juan de Zumárraga, first bishop of Mexico, and Jakob Kronberger (known as Jacobo Cromberger), the most important printer in Seville at the time, who, been of German origin, was the founder one of the first printing presses in Seville around the beginning of the 1500’s.  \nJacobo Comberger supplied all the materials and tools, such as press, movable types, ink and paper and sent one of his closest technicians, Italian Giovanni Paoli (known as Juan Pablos) to be in charge of setting up and run the first printing press in the New World.  \nIn 1544 the fist printed book in America was published: Doctrina Breve by Fray Juan de Zumárraga, which was set in Rotunda blackletter, proving that movable types of blackletter where taken to Mexico.\n\nChristian,  \nplease don’t apologize.

This is a heavy but rounder letterform than Textura.\n\n“Rotunda was created at the beginning of the 14th century in Italy. It became very popular as a round gothic type, and its use extended for centuries. It is believed to be a transitional letterform from blackletter to roman.  \nThe top and bottom ends of the stems no longer have the diamond shape that is present in Textura. The character a is double-storied with the lower part kept very small; the o is curved on the top right and bottom left, but remains broken on the bottom right and top left. In general, the shape of the letters is rounder and therefore more legible than in its predecessor.”  \n(From my book too.)\n\n"
