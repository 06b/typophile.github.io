Doesn’t make me want to go to the concert, or if I were already at the concert, buy the poster as a memento.\n\nThose photos of Paul look so stock photography.\n\nWatch your alignments with different elements. Also, I would make the quote from “The End” ragged left instead of ragged right.\n\n"

It’s hard to know if I am seeing the real color you intend of course… Photos-wise I think I like the blue backgrounds best. Any chance they could all be blue? In terms of layout the U bothers me a little because the bowl of the ‘u’ isn’t as plain as the openings in the other letters. Maybe the photo could blend into the background a bit towards the edge. Actually. Did you try black letters ( or deep grey ) & a white background? That might be sweet. What about breaking the thing into 4 rectangles like this:\n\nP A\n\nU L\n\nThat’s what occurs to me at first.\n\n"

I really like the blue background thing so I replaced the top and bottom photo backgrounds - the masking is down and dirty right now - nothing like masking hair! I like the white with black text - but unfortunately the suits seem to think that we have to get our moneys worth out of the ink we use - so white space here is generally a no no. We shall see. Perhaps Dans idea is the answer to this although in my mind it gets a little busy - you never know…  \n [adverts](http://web.archive.org/web/20060522104543/http:/pages.sbcglobal.net/pbc1313/temp/temporary.html)  \nthanks and  \npeace\n\n"

The picture in the U looks stretched horizontally and the quote doesn’t appear to have a relationship with anything else, maybe by removing the picture in the U and using the counter for the quote it will tie in.
