This sample is from a font ID request I received, and I am almost positive I have this font, and I think it’s an old design. I am sure I have at least seen it somewhere, but none of my Guides or font searches have found it. this may have been a freebie from the web, but I just can’t remember any details, and it’s driving me crazy.\n\nDoes anyone recognize this?\n\nThanks for your help,  \n- Mike\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905130616im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/OSantoDaime_3434.png)\n\n [‹ \"newFUNKtion\" type ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905130616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43257 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Times- or Times New Roman-alike font (but different in small v letter) ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905130616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43255 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
