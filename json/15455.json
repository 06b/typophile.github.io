I was clearing out my downloads folder and came a pdf specimen from [Australian Faces.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123094936/http:/www.australianfaces.com/) (To download, click on the Beauchamp link under the 'new' heading)\n\nIt looks surprisingly like the wonderful Mantinia from [The Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123094936/http:/www.fontbureau.com/), with a badly modified B and G.
