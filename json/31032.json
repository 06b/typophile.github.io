I would not, however, be surprised to see governments and businesses standardize on XPS due to the percieved simplicity of using only Microsoft standards and because the built in DRM system will make it harder for employees to leak documents. I know that people in the military/intelligence fields will love being able to lock down printing and taking screenshots to a single workstation within an entire enterprise without using resorting to trusted Solaris.\n\n"

If all XPS does is force competitors to move further beyond the static document model and drives innovation is this space then that’s a good thing, no?\n\n"

If it forces PDF to get better, great. But I see it mainly as a way for MS to lock people into using their stuff.\n\n"

XPS, I feel, won’t be a big thing because PDF workflows in print shops and graphic companies have been virtually standardised. It’s a file format that is ubiquitous, and while often (in Government and other instances) there is not even the question of cross-compatibility, the presence of the Mac in the graphic sector does command it. ODF is an open standard for a human- and machine-readable document, which I would truly love.\n\n<cite><br>\nI too think competition is good but the best product does not always succeed.

The MARS project will be bringing (a bit) more XML into PDF, but I really hope to see ODF as even an option to export to. Hopefully, we will get a format out of this that is open, crossplaftorm, editable by hand and secure, since I don’t trust propietary DRM either (see cases of Fairplay and current encryption schemes in PDF). But more than often, we will see a pretty good starting position and an iron marketing strategy give Microsoft the upper hand.\n\n"

This isn’t very clear from their web site. I’ll talk to them about it.\n\n\\>I’m also very interested to know if XPS will be integrated into mac office\n\nI saw some blog entries related to that, but again nothing official\n\n\\>and if the ‘c’ fonts will ship with mac office too.\n\nObviously that would seem sensible, but sorry nothing official. :-)\n\n\\>Is there a plan to ship ‘c’ fonts for mac in any shape or form…license them to Apple or Adobe maybe?!!\n\nSorry I can’t talk about that. But we’re always interested in talking to people about licensing and we’re open to any ideas. An example is this one...
