This is kind of a bummer for me, because I don't want to buy the product and then have to pay to upgrade it a few months later. Oh well!   \n   \nMore to the point: new TYPO! I'm excited! Especially about the Preissig article. Storm has recently issued their typefaces as OpenType fonts (including the Czech type library and their versions of Preissig Antikva and Preissig 1918), for those who didn't know.\n\n"
