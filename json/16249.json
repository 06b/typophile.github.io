I have found Duchamp, Mondrian, man Ray vids but I am looking for more relevant 20th C designers and design movements. I would love to find anything on Constructivism, de Stijl, Bauhaus, Modernism, Swiss school. Anybody have anything you could point me to?\n\n [‹ akzidenz grotesk - looking for a match](http://web.archive.org/web/20071022075811/http:/typophile.com/node/16203 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Gangster Font? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071022075811/http:/typophile.com/node/16207 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I don’t know if they are available on DVD or not though. It would be nice if they were.
