It is the older, but lesser known sibling of [Cooper Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414171443/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cooper%20Black). Cooper was a student of [Frederic W. Goudy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414171443/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Frederic%20W.%20Goudy), and is evident in the very organic forms visible in Cooper's types.\n\n",
