      "content": "Ah, so it is apparently in English. In French, there is no accent unless it's in past tense. Actually, now that I look at that link, it's only used as an adjective in English and describes things that are _researched and well chosen_. Thus explaining the past tense translation.\n\nEither way, nice font :)\n\n"
