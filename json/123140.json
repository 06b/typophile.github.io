But that's probably more [Egiziano](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Egiziano).  \nSo more Egyptienne alternatives: [Giza](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza) (FiveFive is possibly the closest for this family), [Cowboy Rodeo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/cowboy-rodeo), [Antique 6](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/antique-six), [Egiziano Classic](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olegiziano-classic), [Belizio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/belizio), [Slab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/hwt/hwt-slab), [Gold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/gold), [Lockup](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/lockup), [Hoosegow](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/hoosegow), [Aldogizio](http://web.archive.org/web/20150214073336/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/tegetype/Aldogizio)\n\n"
