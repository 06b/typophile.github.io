      "content": "I like the crown and the 'co', but in the context of 'Schreiber Picture' they feel odd and out of place. The name and the 'co' are going in opposite directions right now. Honestly, I'd push the name in the more ornate direction, to make it more memorable and unique. If you stick with the sans serif, I don't like the noisy outlines on 'Schreiber PIcture' and I agree with Dan that it's too tight. Go smaller and more loose. That may solve the problem.\n\nWhat exactly does the company do?\n\nAlso, how does this logo work on a white background? Or is the black box part of the logo?\n\n"
