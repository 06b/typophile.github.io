      "content": "Even if you don't have a conscience, why would you want to \"nearly\" duplicate someone else's font?  \nThe troubling line is \"How much of a change in form ...\". This gives the impression that you are trying to see how much you can get away with. If you truly are a designer, you would want to create YOUR OWN design. Come up with your own concept for a typeface and do it from scratch. Is it a lot of work? Yes. Will you make a lot of money from it? No. One of the reasons is that there are thieves out in the world who would steal someone else's design, do minimal work, and call it their own.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not disagreeing with any of the other comments in the slightest. I would point out however, that there are free-as-in-beer as well as free-as-in-GPL fonts that you can use as a base font. For example, the license for the Vera family specifically allows modification. Keep in mind, that you would need to look at the license carefully to see if it will accomodate what you want to do. Really this discussion is relating to the possibility that you might want to distribute your work to other people.  \nI think that it's fairly obvious that it is sometimes easier to work off of an existing font, even if everything will be changed by the time the font is released. For example, it might be usefull to use a font like Vera Sans when making a font that looks much different. The type designer could print and test functional specimens while only parts of the typeface were complete.  \nThe best way to do this is to have a base font that is completely your own, then you can be 100% sure that everything is legal. Personally,I would never work off of a font that wasn't kosher because you could never be sure that there wasn't some sort of hidden identifier somewhere.\n\n"

Shakespeare, like many other great artists, based his work on the works of others. The truely great can do so without feeling a need to hide it.  \nKeep in mind, I'm not ignorant of contemporary licensing issues...  \nThere is a fine line between a revivalist and a rip-off artist. Some of the 20th century's most successfull type designers have simply staken out a claim to old letterforms.  \nAs previously mentioned, redraw everything you want people to use.\n\n"

Indeed, we are all beholden to our forebears, and by mining the past we can make contemporary design statements which lead us into the future.\n\nBut... You can't reuse someone else's font software code as a base for your own code. The data in font files is copyright protected. Drawing a new Bodoni or Baskerville is very different from opening an existing Bodoni or Baskerville font file, tweaking a couple of points here or there, and saving the file with a different name.\n\nI should never have mentioned Shakespeare.

Keep in mind that this only applies to Open Source fonts, not commercial ones.\n\nIf you want to modify a commercial font, the right thing to do is to contact the original foundry/designer first. Some designers allows modifications to create custom branding fonts, some charge a little extra money to allowing the modifications, some others don't.  \nAlways ask the original designers first.\n\n"
