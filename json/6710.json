You might slightly move the white \"T\" counter to the left a very small quantity and move your name a tiny amount to the right to make the tail of the \"T\" a bit longer.   \nI definitely prefer the second version. The T, C, and D might need to be a bit bolder or perhaps have a dot or even an underscore below each of those 3 letters.   \n   \nYasou,   \n   \nChrisL\n\n"

Like your work is clean and sans needless embellishements.   \n   \nWhat is not working for me is the type treatment. I can't read that big line of letters no matter what is bold and regular.   \n   \nI would go with a less bitmappy treatment and us a nice humanist or geometric sans. Have christos tsolerides be bigger than design perhaps.   \n   \nAnd I don't think the size relation between the mark and type is working. I would not try and line up the type with the 'entrance' to the mark, get them more balances out in size. I could even see the mark going to the right of the type, almost like a book-end or period.   \n   \nJust some thoughts ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023123654im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

If this is to be used in the country of its (the name) origin perhaps it is less of an issue.\n\n"

You are both right and actually exactely this question were on my mind yesterday when Peter said that he doesn't know my work. Thank you all again and i have to say i am honnoured to have such an interest from almost all the typophiles whose work i admire.   \n   \nI wish that soon i will be ready to give you some feedback.   \n   \nchristos\n\n"

On the contrary your reaction shows that you care and i deeply appreciate it.   \n   \nI like the idea of \"X\" but i am thinking if this is negative, since X meaning prohibition.   \n   \n   \nchristos   \n   \nP.S. Just a question -out of subject- that i am going to ask to \"General Discussions\" board too. I am searching for an MA course in Typography or in graphic design. The problem is that i cannot quit ny job in Thessaloniki so i have to attent it from distance (internet or post). Of course it has to be in english. So, if you know anything please do let me know.\n\n"

This logo is not only frigid, but awkward - just the opposite of your fabulous poster work. Scrap it and start over is my amateur opinion.   \n   \nBy the way, it is possible for someone with great artistic 'chops' like you to do spare and clean stuff with flair - not that you have to for this logo.
