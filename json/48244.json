      "content": "I love it!\n\nI'm not sure how you were specifically inspired by Victor Jara, although both faces have a great Latino feel to them. I particularly love the all caps redonda.\n\nI am noticing in the lower case redonda that some of the letters with long, straight lines (like d, h, j) feel darker than the short, round letters (o, m, n). I'm not sure there's much you can do about that—I think it just happens because they have a longer line of uninterrupted pixels. It doesn't bother me too much. Overall, they are both beautiful and legible.\n\nWill it be available to buy?\n\nAnalisa\n\n"

It's only the name.\n\nAbout the long lines they are a little bit darker, but not enough to change the structure.\n\nAnd yes, will be available on september in latinotype foundry.\n\njko\n\n"
