I can.\n\nI recently became interested in the typeface used in the first edition of Moby Dick (which, since it was the British version, was just called “The Whale”). I found some scans online of the [title pages here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090703000603/http:/historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=683&Lot_No=57563&type=&ic=) (nice, large images). Also see the smaller image I’ve posted.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090703000603im_/http:/typophile.com/files/leviathan_4242.jpg)\n\nThis typeface is remarkably like Century. I’d ID it as such, except Century was designed around 1900 by Moris Fuller Benton at ATF, and this face was in use fifty years earlier.\n\nAny sage wisdom on this would be much appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",
