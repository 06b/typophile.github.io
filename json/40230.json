But basically, yes, a screen was used to photograph a continuous-tone image and [prepare it for the printing process](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203231432/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone). Whereas the term [raster](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203231432/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) has to do with imaging on a video screen or computer monitor.\n\nIn the third example, perhaps there was some work done by hand.\n\n"

What does this mean, and is there any other process of doing it without that insane machine :O.\n\nAlso, why is the online software program called [The Rasterbator](http://web.archive.org/web/20120203231432/http:/homokaasu.org/rasterbator/) if you still get kinda the same effects as the images attached?\n\nThanks Ricardo.

I wasn't clear, sorry: the effects of both processes are indeed the same, or sufficiently similar. I was just splitting hairs to point out the different origins and uses of both methods: one from the print world, the other from the television/onscreen world.\n\nNot sure what the ads from the German company are for, or if they used the term \"raster\" for both print and screen.\n\nNeat fact I found out last night: \"raster\" comes from the Latin word rastrum, which means \"rake,\" as in: \"Screen images are made up of a pattern of several hundred parallel lines created by an electron beam 'raking' the screen from top to bottom at a speed of about one sixtieth of a second.\" (from _The Mac Designer's Handbook_, 1992 edition, by Alastair Campbell.)\n\n"

The sheets were adhesive-backed translucent film with halftone patterns printed on them in various sizes. They were used by illustrators and comic book artists a lot. You could cut out shapes with an X-acto knife and burnish it onto the art board, for instance. In the sheep illustration, it appears that several pattern sheets were overlaid at slightly different angles to get a moir√© effect and shading.\n\n"
