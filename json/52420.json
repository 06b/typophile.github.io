I’m surprised I couldn’t find much interest for them within the typographic community. Has anyone entertained the thought of creating the CAPTCHA puzzle with found letterforms? I think it would be quite beautiful. A tag search for “oneletter” on flickr will reveal the amount of variety that could be used to fool the bots and still make it easy on the eye. I don’t know much about the technical capabilities, but my guess is that with enough creativity in photography by a dedicated public, we can defeat technology. Then again, I should never underestimate those like Google.\n\n [‹ Font embedding in Adobe (Macromedia) Director](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208232628/http:/typophile.com/node/51809 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Helvetica in the news ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208232628/http:/typophile.com/node/52394 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It’s a difficult challenge because the computer programs can be right less than 5% of the time to make money for the spammers, while we want people to able to recognize them close to 100% of the time. We’ve written a few papers about our work:\n\n[http://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla\\_chi05.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208232628/http:/research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_chi05.pdf \"http://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla\\_chi05.pdf\")  \n [http://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla\\_hip05.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208232628/http:/research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_hip05.pdf \"http://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla\\_hip05.pdf\")  \n [http://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla\\_ceas05.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208232628/http:/research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla_ceas05.pdf \"http://research.microsoft.com/~kumarc/pubs/chellapilla\\_ceas05.pdf\")\n\nCheers, Kevin\n\n"
