  "content": "Hello all.\n\nI am looking for feedback on my résumé. I stuck entirely with Warnock Pro, relying on caps and italics to build hierarchy rather than bold weights.\n\nDo you think there is enough contrast to point out the different sections? Is there too much info? Do the old style figures fit? Yes or no on italic ampersands?\n\nAny and all feedback is most appreciated.\n\nThanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [resume.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422211530/http:/typophile.com/files/resume_2.pdf) | 72.52 KB |\n| [resume2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150422211530/http:/typophile.com/files/resume2.pdf) | 78.87 KB |\n\n",

Your portfolio should demonstrate the latter and the former would make a better conversation.\n\nAnd I agree with Craig's comments.\n\n"

      "content": "Thank you Craig and Tiffany, very helpful comments all around.\n\nI separated the wheat from the chaff and ended up with much more space, as a result, I've opted for a different layout. (Resume2 above)\n\nAs far as the font choice, do you think using a serif is too plain/boring/stuffy? I wanted to challenge myself to use a serif, particularly because I wanted to attempt a hierarchy without bold type, and I feel like a serif will help the résumé stand out. I like Warnock because it has a contemporary feel that other serifs I own do not. Can anyone speak to this more specifically?\n\nThanks again.\n\n"
