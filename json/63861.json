  "content": "Hi there Typophiles.\n\nSo, here's the situation: I'm putting together an invitation for a Real estate Company for prospective sellers offering a free market appraisal or house valuation. The company in question is very well established (over 200 years) and a bit posh.\n\nI'm looking for a nice script font which is traditional and a bit posh without being old-fashioned or screaming wedding (Edwardian Script, Balmoral). Legibility is very important and I would prefer if the caps wernt too fancy.\n\nAny suggestions much appreciated\n\n",
