  "content": "Hi\n\nI have made some fonts for a client, had them hinted and produced as TTF by third party, and am now having them tested for use in MS Office by another third party. Earlier in the process, we tested the (not final) fonts for embedding in MS Office, and it worked out fine then. Since then, the fonts have been hinted and I have added a DSIG-table to make MS Office recognize them as OpenType fonts (the OpenType features were also in the test-fonts, but not the DSIG-table).  \nAnd now, the fonts will not embed, or rather, the will embed but not show up on the end users screen.  \nThe third party testing the font for MS Office suggests it's because MS Office will not embed fonts that it recognizes as OpenType, and we should therefore make some \"Office-versions\" of the fonts with no OpenType-features and therefore for example tabular lining numerals as default.  \nThis makes good sense to me as long as MS Office really doesn't embed fonts with OpenType features, but is it really so? It seems odd, and a leap way back in time.\n\nI'm looking forward to hear your insights.\n\n",

The hinting doesn't seem to be the issue either, so now we're testing if it might be the actual name, though it doesn't seem to any dobbelgänger out there.\n\n"
