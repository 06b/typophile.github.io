That way it might be easier for the client to use the logo (fewer different files/formats), and I wouldn’t have to worry a lot about the thing being scaled wrong or whathaveyou.\n\nSo if I have a logo that’s based on a (commercial) font which I’ve customized in Illustrator, and I make this into a font again, is this technically a legal problem?\n\nAlso, is there anything else I’m forgetting that might make this a bad idea to offer to the client?\n\n",

It doesn’t sound anything like you distributing a custom version of that font — rather, you supply the _image_ in the form of a font. I don’t see how that would differ from giving them an EPS or PDF version.\n\nIt would get slightly complicated if they asked for the customized font, to use for advertising or other graphic work.\n\nThe few fonts I made (for internal use only!!) use an OpenType feature to change “JW” into my own logo :-) as a sort of easter egg.\n\n"

Thanks for sharing your thoughts Theunis – my gut feeling was telling me the same, but hey you never know.\n\n<cite>“It would get slightly complicated if they asked for the customized font, to use for advertising or other graphic work.”</cite>  \nIt couldn’t get complicated really, as there is no customized font – there is only a logo customized from the font (i.e. the tweaks are in Illustrator, not inside the font). That is a bit impractical, but at least this way I’m fine as per the EULA.\n\n"
