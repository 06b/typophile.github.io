  "content": "I'm trying to id the typeface used in the Spokesman-Review newspaper in 1893. It's still (roughly) the same logo we use today, but I think it may actually have been a real type and not a one-off drawing like many others. Thoughts?\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017110159im_/http:/i.imgur.com/swIBdf0.png)\n\n",

However if you look at the first two E's their verticals meet the lower horizontals differently at the inner corner - at a curve in the first one but a sharp 90 degrees in the second...hmm.\n\n"
