  "content": "My favorite typeface is Futura. The Futura typeface was created by Paul Renner in 1928. He worked for seven years on its development. Futura is an important type face because it was the first sans-serif font to be widely accepted and used. The Futura font created displayed the core of the Bauhaus ideology: strictly geometric outline, lacking any embellishments and just barely conforming to the historical shapes of letters. The resulting blend of geometric consistency and aesthetic awkwardness may be disputable, but it was at least something quite new, and therefore impressive, at that time. Although at the present time, people are much more accustomed to the look of Futura and similar fonts, the inborn radicalism of the font still shows through.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131207090354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/futura%20font%20ex_5562.jpg)\n\nI like Futura because of it's geometric characteristics. The initial design was achieved with the use of a compass and a straightedge, with the circle, square, and triangle as basic building blocks. The strokes are of almost even width and are low in contrast. My favorite letter of the Futura typeface is the letter O, capital. The Futura capital O is as close to a perfect circle as possible. I love using it, and other characters, as ornamentation on projects.\n\nMore info: The Futura font family was originally published in Light, Medium, Bold, and Bold Oblique fonts in 1928. Light Oblique, Demibold, and Demibold Oblique fonts were later released in 1930. Book font wass released in 1932, and Book Oblique font was released in 1939. Extra Bold font was designed by Edwin W. Shaar in 1952. Extra Bold Italic font was designed in 1955 by Edwin W. Shaar and Tommy Thompson. The original Futura design also included small capitals and the old-style figures, which were dropped from the original metal issue of the type.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131207090354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FuturaPoster_3464.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131207090354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/futura-poster_5347.gif)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131207090354im_/http:/typophile.com/files/print2_1_4777.jpg)\n\n",
