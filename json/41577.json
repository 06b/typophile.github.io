  "content": "Today at [Reading](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033712/http:/typophile.com/wiki/University%20of%20Reading), we had the first part of a series of seminars looking at typeface legibility. In it we presented two papers and discussed them, the first one being [Kevin Larson](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033712/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Kevin%20Larson)'s [\"The Science of Word Recognition\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033712/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx) and the second being \"ClearType sub-pixel text rendering: Preference, legibility and reading performance\" by Sheedy, et al. The Sheedy paper is the one that sparked my interest. In it 5 legibility studies on CT are discussed and if I understand correctly, the results have thus far been inconclusive as to whether legibility is improved with the aid of CT technology. However there was 1 study that asked subjects to self-rate factors of comfort of reading. It occurred to me that comfort may actually be a more important factor to consider than legibility or speed when speaking of reading. It seems less important to me to discuss whether people _can_ read something as opposed to do they _want to_ read something based on the degree of comfort or discomfort created by the type. Of course, there are some situations (such as highway signage) where legibility and speed of reading is important, but I believe that in a majority of situations these factors are less important. When focusing on the factor of comfort, the problem as it seems to me, is that it may appear to be a soft target when compared to legibility/reading speed. I have heard talk of studies that are looking at the effects of patterns created by type and certain patterns actually creating discomfort, even at the level of causing stress and fits in the reader. Personally, I think that this aspect of reading is the more interesting one. If any of you have opinions or can shed more light on this topic, I would love to hear what more can be said in regards to the comfort or discomfort caused by type.\n\n",

I guess you haven't been interested in those threads.\n\n'Ease of reading' is the 1960's definition of [readability](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033712/http:/typophile.com/wiki/readability) that I cite in the typowiki. I have repeatedly proposed in these threads that decline in comprehension with time, or speed with time, or both, be used to measure mental fatigue. Eye fatigue is probably another matter.\n\nI am reading more about this now, but am about to travel. I'll post more when I get the chance.\n\n"

      "content": "I think that reading comfort is important because it breaking through a readers comfort zones can be a great way to manipulate them. For example, if the _Harry Potter_ novels had been set in Eureka Serif and not whatever traditional Aldine they were set in, it would have fought against the warm fuzzies feelings Rowling uses to pull readers into her story. But in books that come at a reader from a deeper or more radical perspective, it can be useful to deliberately use something unexpected; good examples would be Octavia Butler’s novel _Parable of the Talents_ and Warren Ellis’ _Crooked Little Vein_, both set in modern faces (Didones IIRC) that keep the reader from settling in effortlessly. Of course one has to be careful not to go too far; I’ve gone through a book about the Bauhaus set entirely in Futura and wanted to kill the designer by the end.\n\nThis approach is not limited to books, of course. If a signmaker passes over Arial/Helvetica for Meta, the most generic sign suddenly becomes a lot more eyecatching, especially if there’s a **g** in there somewhere. The NYT article on ClearviewHWY noted that ATT became much more successful at spreading its message after a switch to ClearviewHWY. At the Dallas/Fort Worth airport I noticed people staring at the letters in the signage, just taking in how good whatever typeface it was really looked; good luck pulling that off with Helvetica.\n\nAt the end of the day it all comes down to remembering to break Typographic rules now and then.\n\n"

I don't think that the comfort i'm referring to here is the same as legibility. I think something can be perfectly legible and may yet be uncomfortable, but I could be wrong. Maybe what I'm interested in boils down to personal preferences, as what is comfortable for one person may not be for another. In relating to CT, I think it's great to have a tuning tool that allows the user to tune the rendering to their greatest degree of comfortable reading. The studies I cited above show that there is not a significant difference in legibility for differing levels of CT adjustment, but they do show that there is a clear preference by users for certain settings over others. It would be interesting to try to find out what unconcsious factors affect making decisions about what type readers find more or less comfortable.  \nIn regards to the studies written about by Sheedy, they were funded by Microsoft. My understanding is that Microsoft's goal is to make the reading experience of reading on screen as comfortable as reading on paper. The fact is referred to that people often prefer to print out documents rather than to read them on screen. I doubt that printed documents are _that much more_ legible than screen documents. I think this is due to the fact that it's simply more comfortable to read the printed document than the on-screen version.\n\n_I guess you haven’t been interested in those threads_\n\nI used to read them, but found that they often get bogged down quite rapidly. I guess I should expect the same here.\n\n"

Too often, readability threads get into pißing contests that become more about opinion clashes of the posters than just helpful discussion.  \nI think that reading comfort, as you describe it, is different than the typically cited number of eye movement regressions definition of readability. What Paul is talking about is more the social science way of seeing preference of reading rather than the physiology measure of eye movements. That is not to say that there may be some degree of correlation between the two. What the correlation means, however, is still a matter of opinion. For me, there is great value in examining the user preference angle. I do feel it is a moving target by demographics or specific intended audience.

      "content": "Paul, I think things become bogged down because we assume that everyone has a basic undestanding of what legibility and readibility are. And to a great extent we do. When we cannot read something because of how the characters are formed we say the writing is illegible, and when we cannot navigate a text because of how it is set or layed out we say the text is unreadable.\n\nThe problem arises when science introduces measures — like frequency of regressive saccades, or reading speed — to precisely gauge these largely lived-experiential matters. Science tends to use metrics that don't fully encapsulate the reality it tries to investigate.\n\nThe solution is to not generalize data about small differences in the frequency of regressive saccades or small differences in words per minute to bald statements about large issues. That a serif type performs better than a sans across a wider range of trackings is not necessarily a statement about relative legibility. It might just mean that sans serif types are more sensitive to bad spacing.\n\nYou ask about the importance of comfort relative to legibility. To me they are countervailing pressures. Legibility is a basic requirement, so should be fully understood. Comfort a human need that promotes the engagement a text seeks.\n\n"

All other measures -- speed, comfort, pleasure -- are meaningful only relative to comprehension, because if one hasn't taken in what the text contains (which is not necessarily the same thing as understanding the text, which depending on the nature of the text may take years) then everything else is worthless. We read in order to comprehend text; everything else -- the pleasure or pain the text gives us, the things we do with the information therein -- is secondary. One can go further: comprehension is reading, reading is comprehension. If you read without comprehending, you are not really reading, you are just going through the mechanics, when what matters is the result. Most discussion of readability focuses on the mechanics, rather than on the result.\n\nI want people to be able to read comfortably because, as Peter says, comfort is a human need. So in other words I want people to comprehend text while in a comfortable state. There are other human needs that can be typographically addessed: aesthetic pleasure, cultural connectivity, a sense of both history and progress. Unfortunately, the most common experimental measure, relative to comprehension, is none of these things, it is speed. Capital makes speed a virtue, because 'time is money'. But speed is not a human need.\n\n"

Sans vs. serif, that sort of thing. The goal was to find out what best gets readers deep enough into the text to respond to the \"call to action\" in an advertisement, which appears well into the copy, if not at the end, urging them to call now or clip the coupon.\n\nThe sense in which a comprehension of advertising copy may become actionable is similar to whether the ideas in a novel \"stick\" with the reader, because it's one thing to comprehend the grammar, another to get what writer is saying, something else to be moved by the writing, and something else again to read words that change your life -- whether it's buying something new or changing your political viewpoint.\n\nType can do all that.\n\n"

He has identified a narrow range of frequencies which cause discomfort (or may trigger worse effects, such as epileptic fits).

I am very interested in reading science, but I don't really expect it to be practically useful to typeface design. I think it might be able to explain the _why_ of some things, which interests me, and one of the things I would like it to explain is that extraordinary facility with which humans read. That's worth knowing because it would tell us something about what we are. I'm not sure that it is worth knowing that test subjects read X typeface fractionally faster than Y typeface in document setting A. If I think about everything that makes typography compelling, delightful, significant, that kind of information barely registers. Indeed, the factors that might influence a typographer to use typeface Y instead of typeface X, despite the demonstrated readability advantage of the latter, are all more interesting than that advantage.\n\n"

Or maybe they should be throttled to the text. Can't speed through the bold sans serif of your copy of \"Critique of Judgment\"? Good! Kant deserves the time that that printing demands!

ClearType figures out which sub-pixels should be turned on ignoring color, and then tries to diffuse the perception of color. The different forms are using different degrees of color filtering. At one extreme is nearly unfiltered text, which is very sharp, but very colorful. At the other extreme is a grayscale, which has no color but is less sharp. This is not a traditional grayscale as it doesn’t use a box filter, but a rectangular filter. The default form of ClearType that we’ve been using is the middle selection of the five options.\n\nUnfortunately it’s very difficult to show these differences in print as they are dependent on LCD subpixels. The best way to see the differences between these text samples is onscreen using MS Reader. Three of these options are now available as tuning preferences in WPF.\n\nCheers, Kevin\n\n"

Our goal shouldn’t be to develop a marketing/advertising literature, but to understand what makes a good (legible, readable, comfortable, pleasant, and engaging) reading experience.\n\nPeter makes a very interesting point when he points out that the metrics that scientists use like reading speed, comprehension, eye movements, distance threshold, and preference don’t precisely match our intuitive understanding of a good reading experience. And the Sheedy study didn’t detect reading speed or distance threshold differences between the five versions of ClearType, but did find that version 1 had a higher preference with the 10 point text and version 2 had a higher preference with the 12 point text. People are able to see and prefer differences between the ClearType versions, but they didn’t result in measurable performance differences. In several other studies researchers were able to measure both reading speed and preference differences between ClearType and black & white rendering.\n\nMy intuition is that there is a (complicated) relationship between reading performance measures and a good reading experience. Of course I could be wrong. There is much still to be discovered, and new measures likely need to be developed. At ATypI 2006 and in Typo Magazine I talked about one measure we developed looking at affect and measuring the corrugator (frowning) muscle. At ATypI 2007 I talked about research into measuring eye fatigue – this work will hopefully appear in Eye Magazine.\n\n"

      "content": "_the results of typography’s affect on comprehension and retention._\n\nRight Steve, retention is the concept.\n\nRelated to that is re-reading.  \nI often reread text, for varying reasons. It could be a software manual, and that makes it painful. However, I'll also reread a passage that explains a new idea perfectly with a clever turn of phrase, just to enjoy the writing. I read several parts of [Understanding Web Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820033712/http:/www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingwebdesign) by Jeffry Zeldman more than once, especially the section _The Sustainable Circle of Self-Respect,_ man that guy can write, and I share his sentiments. If you find writing that puts your own thoughts or feelings into words, the clarity is worth wondering at. At the other end of the spectrum, I'll usually skip bits of novels I find boring. When reading _The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time,_ a novel written in the person of an autistic child with a penchant for maths, I must confess I didn't read a single one of the paragraphs containing mathematical formulae, which the author had tried so hard to integrate into the story.\n\n"

      "content": "Paul, to go back to the begining I wonder if you or the other participants of the Reading seminar are aware that my 2004 Thessaloniki presentation “Lateral Interference, Response Bias, Computation Costs and Cue Value: Perceptual Processing Touchstones for Typedesign and Typography; or Why Strategic Construction, a Well-Motivated Contrast Scheme and ‘Space Craft’ Still Matter,\" was a direct response to Kevin’s “The Science of Word Recognition?” Both were printed in the Czech design magazine _Typo_ along with papers by Mary Dyson and Hran Papazian.\n\nEssentially the paper questions the “science” of the “science of word recognition.” and in doing so draws inspiration from Ole Lund’s Reading PhD on legibility studies.\n\nMy focus was and is neither legibility studies _per se_ nor human measures testing, but perceptual processing in reading, that is perceptual mechanics. It is meant to address the typographer or type designer's pre-understanding of what they are manipulating in the context of their making.\n\n"

Because I am thinking about Urbana these days I thought I would suggest that one reason Urbana works as well as it does is that it has a nice balance of soft & sharp shapes. It is neither soft and amorphous nor does it sparkle. Getting a nice balance between these is one aspect of comfort.\n\nGot other variables that contribute to comfort?\n\n"

Is there a German word for \"decipherable\"? In English, it seems to me the word \"legible\", in ordinary usage, is interchangeable with \"decipherable\". Meaning a series of glyphs large enough and detailed enough so as to be able to distinguish one glyph from another.\n\n"

For these two poor typography conditions the solution is quite clear: high contrast (black/white) and larger text than is used on the Eye magazine website.\n\n"
