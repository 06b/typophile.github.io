It does make me wonder about what I think though; which is a pleasant challenge. So far I am not sure.\n\nThe main thing I would encourage you to do is to think in terms of what the space between letters needs. The serif treatments need not be literally consistent to work. There are old & new fonts where this is so. Look at the a s and l (el) in  \n [Amalia](http://web.archive.org/web/20120801233454/http:/www.ourtype.be/). There are 5 different approaches to the serifs. And yet to my eye each is working optically. You can tell this is true better from a print out than in the flash preview.\n\nI would also watch out for details that may sparkle and catch the eye a bit too much. It might be that the bases of those serifs do that. Or not. But I wonder.\n\nIn any event I will have a proper look soon.\n\n"

E.g. that the serifs on the minuscles are not as distracting as I thought they would be (they definitely were on the \"display\" sizes to me; on display sizes on the other hand such decoration, standing-out is desirable). They work really well!  \nAs I said, it's the serifs I like about the font very much, and I see how they are the core of your experiment/development. On the other hand, while one could notice the discrepancy of the V,W,Us compared to the other capitals in the first version published, I'd give it a try the other way round: Would it be bold to suggest a trial of having the top serifs of the first vertical stem (or the only one) of any capital to be more symmetric (i.e. slightly more protruding to the right), transferring the minuscle-like characteristics only to the second vertical stem? (This came to my mind as two letters felt \"wrong\" to me: I and H; interestingly not so much L).\n\nI've got two-three more observations, but they are in the detail, and so I will shut up: it's a \"first peek not ready for crit yet\" after all :-)\n\n"
