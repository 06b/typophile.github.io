If all you _really_ want is the fonts, look for version 6: the Draw program was a total disaster (prone to crash when you went to save a file, making it a big waste of time), so it ought to be dirt cheap. If you also want to use the program, either version 9 or 10 is a good bet, both in terms of reliability and cost. And I doubt you’ll beat an eBay price (if you’re patient) anywhere: right now, there are upgrade versions (you don’t need a serial number to access the font folders on the CDs) going for less than $20.00.\n\n"
