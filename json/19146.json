Basically I’ve no idea how anyone else makes their test pages and am just curious as to whether there could be a better way. And I print no-where near 40 pages, but again this is just display. I did some searches and couldnt find any literature on this. Would be nice to put together a master indesign doc I could use.\n\n [‹ Fonts that typify a decade](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908103140/http:/typophile.com/node/19024 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Get a Euri the Euro t-shirt ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908103140/http:/typophile.com/node/19155 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "For testing all digraphs, rather than the majority of those that will appear in western languages, try the [random all-digraph psuedotext](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908103140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/9339). But I wouldn’t rely on it too heavily, because its letter distribution makes it look quite different from real text. Its main benefit is probably to find oddball kern problems such as ’qj’.\n\nMore immediately useful, I think, would be a text devoid of kern pairs, but still representing all letters and most high-frequency digraphs. That would let you focus on getting the side bearings right before diving in too deeply to tweaking the individual kern pairs - having lots of kerns to make up for poor basic fit is the classic mark of an amateur type release, and was certainly a problem in my first couple of tries in spacing my ATF Century Catalogue (see [IKern vs Adobe InDesign's optical kerning](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908103140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/10317) and [bouma of space craft](http://web.archive.org/web/20080908103140/http:/www.typophile.com/node/10191) for a more discussion from around that time).\n\n"
