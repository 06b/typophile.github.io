I don't think it's completely necessary to round the ends of the strokes.   \n   \nThe only thing that slightly bugs me is that there are some inconsistencies in the skinny stroke weights and the skinny strokes in general are a little bit too heavy.   \n   \nThose aren't huge issues, but may be something to fix when you have time.\n\n"
