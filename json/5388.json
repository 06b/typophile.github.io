  "content": "This is a project I am working on for a Chrsitan ministry . . . WOW is an acronym for Words Of Wisdom--a weekly editorial that is biblically based and designed to be encouraging and motivational.   \n   \nThe top logo is the original logo, the bottom two are revised editions I have created. I was originally asked to stay within the same concept of the original logo -- the client is now wondering if the concept is outdated and is open to new ideas . . .   \n   \nAny input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022211048im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39447.gif)\n\n",

I don't think I like this, since it shows incompletion, as if he still struggles to get out.\n\n"
