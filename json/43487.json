I've been searching the net frantically for a typeface/font version of Bodoni Flair but can't seem to find one. Would anyone happen to know where I could purchase this file in the electronic form?\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225214701im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bodoni_flair_5096.jpg)\n\n",

As does [Perla](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225214701/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ALT0000144). Hmm, and [Bodoni Classic Swashes](http://web.archive.org/web/20150225214701/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/wiescher/bodoni_classic_swashes/). But nothing exactly the same...of which I am aware.\n\n"
