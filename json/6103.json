There   \nhas been a reluctance here, though, to provide info to anyone who might possibly be   \ntrying to duplicate currency or credit/debit cards � for obvious reasons.   \n   \nI emphasize the word _possibly_, because that doesn't appear to be your agenda at   \nall � but ya never know ...   \n   \nI'm surprised that nobody else has suggested fonts that might meet your objective.   \nCheck out some of the [Test Pilot Collective](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110033546/http:/www.myfonts.com/browse/foundry/testpilot/?idtype=foundry&itemsperpage=55&resultcount=55&page=1) offerings for an OCR clinical look.\n\n"
