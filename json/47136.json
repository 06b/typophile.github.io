You do not need to use a geometric sans with a geometric mark, use the factor of juxtaposition to help the elements of type and the graphic elements to complement each other... trust me. Do not use the gradient version of the camel, use the version in the first examples that you gave us. By the way, great graphic mark... good job.\n\n"

Something like Futura Light, Kabel Light, Gotham Light, or Proxima Nova Light - with a nice round ’O’ and ’G’. But, since you obviously want a tightly kerned serif typeface, go with what you’ve got. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

So you have a symbol that is very geometric, sharp angels and straight lines. So you either need something that mimics that style or something that complements it. Just a regular everyday serif font isn’t going to serve this symbol well. It needs a strong type to mirror it’s strong build.\n\ncourtney\n\n"
