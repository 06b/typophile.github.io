For some reason I cannot find a variant with the alternate one-storied /g -- its default /g is double-storied. The superior and inferior /g, on the other hand, _is_ one-storied. It strikes me as odd if the designer purposely selected an inferior /g and scaled & moved it into position ... But perhaps he did. Or perhaps there is a version of Adelle with this alternate as a selectable option.\n\n"

(As well as a number of ever-so-slightly differences.)\n\nI guess their webmeister searched for a webfont similar to their identity font and came up with this. Good job -- but now I don't have any suggestions left.\n\n"
