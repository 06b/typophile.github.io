  "content": "We have a book in where the designer chose Bembo as the text font. This book has a spattering of Turkish words; both the dotted and undoted i are used. Language tags were NOT used by either author or editor.\n\nNow an obvious design solution for this sort of text is to use a font like Sabon, where not using the fi ligature causes no problem. Set everything without fi & ffi ligatures, no need to sort between Turkish & English. But that's not how current designers think; she picked Bembo.\n\nBembo without ligatures doesn't really solve the problem for Turkish; the terminal of the \"f\" half blots out the dot on the \"i\". You would have to positive kern the \"i\" quite a bit to make the dot clear, and the resulting space would give rise to a different confusion.\n\nFor Bembo anyway, it isn't that hard to make a special fi ligature where the dot over the \"i\" rides a bit lower, and the terminal of the \"f\" doesn't swoop down quite so far. The dot on the \"i\" clearly shows, so we can have a \"f\\_i.dotted\" and a regular \"f\" and undotted i, which solves the problem nicely, visually. The only wrinkle is that with the sequence fii, the dots on the two i's wouldn't be quite the same height.\n\nThe author or editor will have to mark affected words in proof & we can make the switch.\n\nWhat I wonder though, is whether or not this will appear odd to anyone who regularly reads Turkish -- will it still be seen as an error, or \"unfortunate\"?\n\nTIA\n\nCharles\n\n",

      "content": "Well, my Bembo has been pretty heavily modified. When we were still running repro --early-mid 1990s, I took a look at a couple of books, one a fine-print book from Steinhour press, one an old Penguin paperback from college days, & got a feel for the range of how Bembo printed in metal. First thing you noticed is that whoever made the PostScript Type 1 (3?) font shortened all the ascenders & descenders. Second thing you noticed was the contrast of the letters was all wrong when printed offset. So our Bembo got one large adjustment when we were running repro, and a second adjustment when DTP became prominant.\n\nI don't know how to post a picture here. I can easily make a PDF, but most sites only allow you to post a gif or jpeg. Dunno how to do that with type.\n\nAnyway, I suppose the taller ascenders would help with your solution, but also allow my proposed solution. I guess to give an answer you'd have to <cite>see</cite> it.\n\nCharles\n\n"

      "content": "Hi guys,\n\nthere are some occasions where the sequence fii becomes important. for example the turkish word fiil ( [http://www.pratiksozluk.com/sozluk.php?word=fiil&dictionary=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021222116/http:/www.pratiksozluk.com/sozluk.php?word=fiil&dictionary=1 \"http://www.pratiksozluk.com/sozluk.php?word=fiil&dictionary=1\")) could be used in the mentioned text and it would be very unhappy for your eye, if the two i-dots differ in there height. It would look like an error. Maybe it could work, if you only modify the stem/terminal of the f, so you won't have two different versions of the dotted i. I also want to mention that the ligature of f and the dotted i is looking like the combination of f and the undotted i for the the turkish eyes. The best solution however would be to use a different typeface, if possible ;-)\n\nderya  \np.s. sorry for the bad english.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021222116im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Bild2_4486.jpg)\n\n"

But I hear you --if two i's appear together, they better have the same height dots. The difference in height is so small that it can't be noticed between different words, only if next to each other. I can fix that, too.\n\nThe Bembo Book you show gives back some of the needed weight & contrast reduction, but it lost something, too.\n\nIn my world, the comp only gets to set the font the designer picks.\n\n"

However, this would have resulted in a lot of breakage in the reuse of type, as the \"beard\" of the arm and the tittle are awfully close.\n\nTherefore, an f\\_i ligature was designed, with the arm of the \"f\" covering the position where the tittle might be, so it didn't look as if it was missing, just obscured.\n\nExcept, the tittle was relatively low, and the arm had to bend way down to hide its supposed position, and that looked odd.\n\nTherefore, the tittle was moved up, to make the f\\_i ligature more convincing.\n\nJust a theory.\n\n"
