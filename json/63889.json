In the opinion of its designer, glossy magazines have been boring us with the same type families for years, with only a small group of fonts being used to denote refinement and sophistication.\n\nThe philosophy behind ’Lavigne’ is to achieve the high contrast and other refinements observed in classic ’modern serif’ typefaces, without borrowing too much from history. Accordingly, the main source of inspiration, was careful observation of pointed-pen calligraphy and sketching.  \n’Lavigne’ is planned as an ambitious family with 2 main divisions, Display and Text. The range will cover every type-hierarchy required in modern magazine design.\n\nThe six distinct styles in the Display version are published in OpenType format, featuring small caps and four sets of numbers (proportional old style, tabular old style, proportional lining and tabular lining), as well as matching currency symbols.\n\n[http://www.re-type.com/fonts/fonts-lavigne.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103122703/http:/www.re-type.com/fonts/fonts-lavigne.html \"http://www.re-type.com/fonts/fonts-lavigne.html\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103122703im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lavigne-newsletter3_6344.png)\n\n",
