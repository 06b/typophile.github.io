Do you know other movements, designers, typographers or graphic artist that were influenced by Aztec culture?\n\nthank you very much in advance\n\ni.\n\n",

I like that Josef Albers was interested in Pre-Columbian civilizations; I’ll look forward to find any relation with the Aztecs.\n\nIt’s a shame that can’t go to the ATypI conferences; I’m from Mexico City but this year I’m studding abroad, why they didn’t do one year ago or in one year time ;(\n\n"

      "content": "Correction: the right name is Gabriel Martínez Meave. Maybe you are confusing him with Gabriel García Márquez, the well known Colombian writer. By the way, García Márquez has a Mexican son who happens to be a graphic designer and type designer, [Gonzalo García Barcha](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913065103/http:/www.gonzalogarciabarcha.com/gallery.asp?gallery_id=3337), but he’s more interested in colonial era. Gonzalo has Mexican Motifs, a dingbat font who includes some pre-hispanic icons, though.\n\nAbout the question: I think the biggest Aztec influence in graphic design is in Mexican designers. Since nineteenth century, Mexican people has thought that Aztec past is the most authentic source for “mexicanity” (a desperate attempt for erasing the Spaniard, _conquistador_ roots). Because of this, a lot of artists have identified themselves with Aztec world (Diego Rivera, Jesús de la Helguera, José Obregón, José Clemente Orozco…). A book about this: Enrique Florescano, _Imágenes de la patria_, Mexico, Taurus, 2006.\n\nAt little scale, the same is for Mexican graphic designers. It is not my specialty, but as far as I know, graphic designers outside Mexico are/were not much interested in Aztecs. But certainly you could write to Gabriel Martínez Meave: I am sure he can tell better than me. You can find his e-mail address at kimeratype.com.mx\n\n"

It was a time of searching some kind of national style as a Modern interpretation of \"folklority\". Designers used motivs taken from polish and ethnic minorities' (eg. Huculs) art, and blended them with mesoamerican details to get stronger feeling of antiquity or tribality.  \nThis eclectic style, half avant-garde, half decorative, transformed before the ww2 into a government style.  \nThe best example of the style's flavour is \"Seasons\", a painting by Zofia Stryjeńska:  \n [http://www.culture.pl/pl/culture/artykuly/wy\\_wy\\_stryjenska\\_poznan](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913065103/http:/www.culture.pl/pl/culture/artykuly/wy_wy_stryjenska_poznan)\n\n"

A kind of exquisite brutalism was the signature style of the national identity. If you want a much more figurative example look at the Ciudad Universitaria original buildings like the Central Library or the Dean's Tower.\n\nI think that the strongest influence lies on the people's taste. Take blackletter as an example, it is not prehispanic but it has this brutal and exquisite character which made it popular in México.\n\nAlso take a look into Gabriel's personal site [http://www.meave.org/Site/intro.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913065103/http:/www.meave.org/Site/intro.html \"http://www.meave.org/Site/intro.html\")\n\nPaco Calderon, the cartoonist, who is also very talented has some strips representing the institutional style of architecture I talked about:  \n [1](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913065103/http:/pacocalderon.net/modules/myalbum/photo.php?lid=2133), [2](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913065103/http:/pacocalderon.net/modules/myalbum/photo.php?lid=1385), [3](http://web.archive.org/web/20120913065103/http:/pacocalderon.net/modules/myalbum/photo.php?lid=2117&cid=117).\n\nHéctor\n\n"
