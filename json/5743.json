I made blank white squares/rectangles to block off parts of the top serifs and most of the foot serifs. I think this is how it was done.   \n ![One of a Kind sim](http://web.archive.org/web/20050816105255im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/41336.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Doug, The reason I picked Modern was the very long tail on the 'a', but I can see Bodoni is also very similar. It is the sort of font that T-26 or maybe Psy-Ops could have, but I couldn't find one. I like the simple approaches for making 'one of a kind' titles, and blocking out parts of letters is easier than modifying letter outlines, or designing a new font.   \n   \nSometimes it's even easier than finding an obscure font that might not exist.\n\n"
