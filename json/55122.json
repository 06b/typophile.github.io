It's nearing completion so I've started playing with a few ideas for a logo.\n\nIt's based on the shape of a photographer's loupe and I'm aiming for a professional look.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109011614im_/http:/typophile.com/files/loupe%20500px_6706.jpg)\n\nany feedback or ideas?\n\ncheers\n\nPaul\n\n",

      "content": "I don't like the colors, specifically the choice of green. The white separator between two parts of the mark looks strange; I'd rather keep the mark either fully 3D or 2D. The text needs to be kerned, but I guess you are not at this stage yet. Also the choice of type is a \"Web 2.0\" cliche, though depending on your marketing strategy you may actually need that.\n\nThe overall impression of the logo is quite good though. It looks decent and it is memorable. Just needs few tweaks IMO.\n\n"
