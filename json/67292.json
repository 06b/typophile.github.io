      "content": "The first edition of this book was a private project of the notary Dr. Guggenheim of Frankfurt a.M. For the German text a very early stage version of the later called \"Jessen Schrift\" was used. The Hebrew letters for text setting are from the Frankfurter Druckerei J. Kaufmann (no Klingspordesigns, a compromise). The Hebrew titles are made by Berthold Wolpe (woodcutter). Max Dorn does the book design. The musical notes are probably made by a son of Rudolf Koch, Paul Koch. The illustrations are made by Fritz Kredel (woodcut) and are hand colored. The book binding versions were done by Dorothea Freise. I think all persions belong to the Koch-Kreis. The price for the paper-bound version was 60 RM (a lot of money in 1928) and could be ordered directly from Dr. Guggenheim.\n\nThe known and popular second release from 1960 used a new layout with the typeface Palatino.\n\nThere are a loot of literature available of Rudolf Koch - I think, he is the most commented and documented type designer of Germany.\n\nIf you like to know more you have to read German books about him. Have a look to [http://www.zvab.com/refineQuickSearch.do?anyWords=%22Rudolf+Koch%22+%2BK...](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823072104/http:/www.zvab.com/refineQuickSearch.do?anyWords=%22Rudolf+Koch%22+%2BKlingspor&lastXDays=-1&submit=Suchen \"http://www.zvab.com/refineQuickSearch.do?anyWords=%22Rudolf+Koch%22+%2BKlingspor&lastXDays=-1&submit=Suchen\")\n\n"

      "content": "The relatively-recent English-language monograph [Rudolf Koch: Letter, Designer, Teacher](http://web.archive.org/web/20130823072104/http:/www.amazon.com/Rudolf-Koch-Letterer-Designer-Teacher/dp/1584560134/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265893696&sr=8-7) is quite OK, too. I certainly enjoyed reading it, and finally bought a copy a few months ago. On Amazon.com right now, you can get a copy for less than $20. The author translated a number of texts from German to English himself.\n\nOther excellent English-language sources are the Rudolf Koch chapter in _Letters of Credit,_ as well as the two _Fleuron_ articles that touch on his work… an article about Karl Klingspor, and another about Koch's work itself. Both _Fleuron_ articles were written while he was still alive. But I doubt that either of them covers work like the Haggadah.\n\n"
