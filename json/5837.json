Using a sans serif face for \"forge\" may create some contrast between the 2 words. Also, tightening up the space between the \"e\" and the \"l\" will definately help. NIce logo overall though.\n\n"

The weight structure of it is quite different from p, perhaps use same way to built them. (oblique axis of e compared to vertical axis of p). Dots of the i are little too close.   \n   \nAnd Forge will be indeed better in a Sans, perhaps better little more far from the bottom of the baseline of the ellipsis word.\n\n"

      "content": "The stress is different. Perhaps change the 'p' to the same stress as the others, narrow up the 'e'. Another thought... perhaps you forego the separation of the letters in \"forge\" also. Simplify the design by placing the word forge (together, but still spaced a bit) to the right of the descender on the 'p'. --- And, what if the dot over the 'i' was more of a lozenge shape?? Too much??\n\n"

We'll have to wait and see how the client takes them - such as a a non serif for \\*forge\\*. It looks better to me, maybe not to him.   \n  \nBTW   \nAny suggestions for sans?   \n  \nI know I am beyond the very small budget at this point but I am still working to make it better within the constraints I am facing. It is ironic (no pun intended) that such a high-end market wouldnï¿½t want to pay for more design time.   \n   \nAlso, I realized after reading A.Schibono's comment more clearly, I should state that minus Matrix, the type is custom. If anyone knows of similar faces I would be interested as I am thinking of extending the style. It might be too eighties, but hey, the eighties have a certain class. ( Maybe its just Matrix )   \n   \nI will post more images soon.\n\n"
