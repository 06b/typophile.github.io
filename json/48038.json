      "content": "Lining Gothic No. 544 already appears in the 1906 catalog, so I went back to the first collective specimen book of ATF (1895). It looks like it is a slight reworking of Lining Gothic No. 44 in that book, which means the font was around before ATF was formed in 1892. You'd have to look at individual specimen books from the foundries that formed ATF to go back further in the history of this typeface, but I doubt you would find who drew it. Most of those early gothics are anonymous. I can scan the specimen page for you if you like.  \nJuliet\n\n"
