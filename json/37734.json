      "content": "I was looking at some old Photo-Lettering Catalogs, where I think they call this style 'obround'(notice the oblong counter of the 'o'). Many of those types had a tailed 't', but some had tail-less alternate characters, so that suggests that this is consistent with a 60's - 70's advertising look. It was the 'r' that seemed harder to match, and I don't think I saw anything identical to this sample -- not too surprising, considering that the samples in these books are just a few words, and not alphabet showings in most cases.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
