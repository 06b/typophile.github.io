In some ways, those typefaces with a bent towards the humanist are feminine and those that are bent towards geometric are masculine. Oh wait, what about grotesk. Perhaps Grotesk can fall in between, switch hitters so-to-speak depending upon how they are used. But then again all three styles could be either or depending upon how they are used. And what of typefaces like Meta?   \n   \nMetro, Gill, Parisine (Clair) --\\> More Feminine   \nFutura, Gotham,\n\n"
