During our meetings we talk most of the time about advertising and design. We are going to get a bit bigger (4 persons right now) and I came up with the suggestion to make us a logotype.\n\nThe one who started the club is a new member of this community. He tried ones to design the logotype and ask members here for help. But it didn't went very well.\n\nAs we're all students in the club we don't have much money, and none of the other members are willing to spend money to get this done. So I smashed my piggy bank and found 20 dollars which I'm using to this task.\n\nI don't have a credit card so I'll give the money to our chairman who will transfer the money via PayPal or something similar.\n\nIf you're interested, please post your email address here or email me at: [illogical\\_squirrel@yahoo.se](mailto:illogical_squirrel@yahoo.se)\n\nI will give you all the facts about the club via email, if that's okay.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nTed Damion\n\n",
