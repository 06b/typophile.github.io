Personally, I think this can turn into an easy solution to make things look “custom,” when it probably would look better to just leave it as normal characters. A lot of fashion/lifestyle mags have used this over the past few years, many in a cheap and lazy way, so tread with caution.\n\n"

The slanted A can work really well at the beginning of a word, but when designers put it in the middle of a word following a letter like L or H, it seems likely a deadly weapon in the hands of a child. Like I said, you have to be careful with it, and we’ve all seen examples of Avant-Garde Alternates in recent years where people used it inappropriately. I work largely in the action sports industry, so I’ve seen such horrible usages of it I want to punch blindly at the air.\n\n"

      "content": "Richard — I should mention I’ve seen some really awesome usages of Avant-Garde with alternates. Very few. It really depends on the word. If you’ve seen Helvetica, the movie, several people point out its solidness, how it lives in a defined space. Almost any letter combination will work. Avant-Garde is the complete opposite — it only works for the right word. Most type sellers and foundries have type testing apps on their site, so try your word(s) out before you buy.\n\n"

I fully agree with you, ive seen words written in avant garde, and been amazed at how beautiful they look, and also the opposite.. i must say tho, i dont think ive seen a word look better in Avant garde than ’avant garde’..\n\n"
