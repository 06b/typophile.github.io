I'm also curious about the \"Sydney Symphony\" logo in the top left corner and the yellow text \"and the Sydney Symphony\" if they could be ID'ed as well, but \"The Whitlams\" is the most important.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202114250im_/http:/typophile.com/files/whitlams_5478.JPG)\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can give! :D\n\n",
