Beyond that answer, it's a matter of suiting the type to the project and the design for the project. There are a million + ways to go, and as Stephen said, for that people would need to know more about the project and the design ideas.\n\n"

They are not something you reconstruct just like that, especially that is not allowed to that and it is not simple to do it, and especially to do it right.\n\nLet's start with this, what feel, what effect you want to generate with?

      "content": "Hi Easton,\n\nas you might know, [Arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Arial) is a rip-off of [Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Helvetica), with cloned metrics. Its entire raison d'être is a morally questionable one: avoiding license fees (further reading: [The Scourge of Arial](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/www.ms-studio.com/articles.html) by [Mark Simonson](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mark%2520Simonson)). The only advantages that Arial acually might have over Helvetica – a huge character set and good screen rendering – is probably irrelevant for your project. Hence, I’d say the best Arial for print is a Helvetica. Which one? Well, opinions do vary. [Neue Helvetica](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neue%2520Helvetica) is cleaner, more consistent across the weights. Some prefer the classic Helvetica, just because of its quirks. [Others, again, praise the URW digitization](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/node/55088#comment-330962).\n\nTimes Ten has [oldstyle figures](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/oldstyle%2520figures) and [small caps](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/small%2520caps), which makes it a more versatile and dapper choice than the system TNR. More information in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/node/42524).\n\nCourier might be the hardest nut. The digital versions of both [Courier](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Courier) and [Courier New](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Courier%2520New) don’t perform very well in print (nor on screen), to say the least. There are so many good alternatives – if you really want to go with a typewriter/monospace for ‘extended texts and poetry’.\n\nHaving said that, it is not clear to me if you are looking for the best versions of Arial/Times/Courier that actually go by those names, or rather for good alternatives from the same genres. If the latter is the case, have a look at [Stephen’s lists](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/):  \n [Times Alternatives](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/times_new_roman/)  \n [Helvetica Alternatives](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/helvetica/)  \n [Typewriter](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/typewriter/) and [Monospaced](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201055847/http:/www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/monospaced/) faces\n\nHope this helps.  \nF\n\n"
