I then paste the letters in fontographer, select and keep only the desired shapes that built one layer of the final font.I think it is what you call the same square, but without great result. I assume that when fontographer generate a font, it looses some presicion in keeping the outline as it is in the original .fog document. (???)\n\n"

      "content": "I understand how you're working and it appears to be a good solution, it's a shame it doesn't works...   \nWhat I wanted to say is you can also define your layers in illustrator, keep only the desired shapes on each layer as you already do, and after draw a fixed-size square (only outline) around each letter and import all that in fontographer, one layer after one. You have then to delete this square in the .fog.   \nGive it a try if you want... (If you can understand my frenchspoken english J )\n\n"
