On the previous page there is one called \"Warlord\" and another called \"Wigwam\" that also have similar characteristics. The obvious digital fonts I know, like P.T. Barnum, Wanted and Playbill are not the same.   \n   \nWhat is the source of the image? Does it possibly come from before the 1990's?\n\n"
