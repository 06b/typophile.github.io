The earliest \"probable influence\" I can find in my collection is an undated (but probably early 30s) version of \"abc of Lettering\" by Carl Holmes. This is called a \"moderne\" style and, with the exception of the truncation of the bottom strokes on the 3 and 5, the letterforms pretty much match an alphabet on page 21.\n\n"
