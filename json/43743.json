  "content": "Hi,  \nMy instructor is having students find body copies and headlines that work to produce some works in the class. I really like the serif fonts used in the body and titles of \"W\" Magazine but I just can’t figure out what they are. I don’t think they are the same font either. Every time I get close on a font finder, it’s still not quite right. They remind me of Bembo, and searches I came up with were Hoeffler Text or versions of garamond but, I just dont think they are quite right. I am also wondering exactly what the san serif font they use in the inside is for body and subheads.\n\nI’m just so frusterated in this search. If anyone could help me, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n",
