It seemed like a fitting last word on what a messy and complex discussion that question started.\n\nI think [Dan Reynolds](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124160929/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Dan%20Reynolds) got beat up, more than a little unfairly, simply for being a representative of The Man (albeit a pretty low-level representative of a pretty lowercase The Man, but that's how it goes).

Anyone licensing the type will not be affected by it but those not licensing the type will automatically be violating the EULA whether they received a copy of it with their illegally acquired font software or not.\n\nWhile it has been said by an amazingly jovial head of a huge foundry that he doesn't \"bother with those people that illegally download because they wouldn't license anyway\", if his hand were forced I'd imagine that adding some sort of activation code to his fonts wouldn't be a stretch.

For most foundries, font bundling by the oligarchs -- Microsoft, Adobe, and Apple -- is the questionable practice which is most detrimental to their business. For two reasons. First, as Capthaddock observes:\n\n\"they just accumulate the fonts that have gotten bundled with software over the years, sharing them with customers, printers, and other design firms as needed.\"\n\nThis practice has become established for all fonts, not just \"free\" bundled fonts. Meta as shareware.\n\nSecondly, of course, by providing most of the fonts most people need, bundling marginalizes the retail font market.\n\n\"The type industry\" is not, as one contributor at FontLeech seems to think, monolithic. Although we do all get together and sing from the same book for typefests such as TypeCon and ATypI, the interests of the independent foundries are not the same as those of the software oligarchs, who call the tune.\n\n"

This has always been the case and will remain true, even in the digital age.\n\n– people who have no money will find ways to get on prated versions, no matter how much the data is protected. This has always been the case, even before the internet. And frankly, a school kid downloading stuff he could never have afforded to buy in the first place is not costing anybody money. Some student or third-world-small-scale-designer designer who maybe couldn't have afforded the Meta family in the first place, also is NOT costing FSI money. God, LET those people use pirated versions, it's just sharing wealth. In he end, the wealth probably WILL come back to you.\n\n- Brand image, personal sympathy and identification,quality, service becom more imporant than ever, asurdly at a time when most bigger companies try to save money in these areas. You don't steal mp3s from a band you really like, beacuse you want them to make a living of their art. I guess you'd have less compunction downloading a Madonna song, but most people I know would never ever hurt a band they «know» and like. You don't steal from a friends house. Along the same lines you don't use pirated fonts from people you like. It's that easy. What we need isn't paranoia, as this hasn't kept piracy at bay since the 70s... but rather, as strange as that sounds, a feeling of trust and friendship. The digital availability of music, video and font will either demand an Orwellian DRM-System, and I'm very concerned that such systems will in the long term absolutely hurt the system at large. Maybe I'm wrong here. People actually use iTunes and the iPod... and seem to have verylittle problem with the fact that Big Brother is controlling their iTunes-bought music for them. On tghe other hand, we have a chance that companies just effing trust their customers and engage in a dialogue and simply ask nicely for their money. I think, in the end, they will earn MORE that way. Large comapnies such as Adobe and Lino and even FSI shoul work at becoming approachable, personal virtually smaller-feeling and more personal firms. They need faces. Smaller companies, such as Thirstype, already have the personal touch, and frankly, I think they have not that much to worry about.\n\nHD Schellnack\n\n"

Franklin gothic for headlines. And I have a real problem stopping myself using gill-sans at the moment._\n\nUnivers is a nice clean serif font. I also like Gill-Sans (I'm very traditional). Plantin is an interesting font for sub-heads.\n\nAs for the serif variety, I tend to go with Garamond. Simple, and it's a treat to set.\n\ni'm so traditional. for a really bold heading i usually go with about 27px georgia (pretty much only if it's black on white...doesn't look right in any other colors...). otherwise for body work i'm generally stuck on verdana/helvetica/geneva/etc...\n\nPlaying Identify the font???  \nYe Gods, and I thought us programmer were geeks! That totally takes the biscuit!\n\nI've been using Univers a bit recently. It's kind of a relaxed Frutiger... or something\n\nI like simple, clean sans serifs, like Univers (oh my favouraite for years now) Helvetica (and neue), Frutiger, Swiss, Simplex, Din. I always seem to end up with Univers somehow.\n\nOne of my favorite fonts is Century Gothic. It's very clean and it looks professional. I use it for tons of my designs. There is another new and cool font that I just started to use. It's Kabel EF. I used it for a logo design and I think it was a good choice.

Just look at Garamond (I know, not exactly comparable, but easier to use to make a point) or Bodoni. ITC Garamond isn't really a Garamond. Neither are many other fonts with \"Garamond\" in their name. Since your average designer doesn't know this, he might get the wrong idea about what actually makes a font good and legible.\n\nMany graphic designers think that legibility is quite pliable (\"I'm what makes typography legible or illegible, not the font's design…\").\n\nTo confound matters, you have the problem of bad interpretation. Bauer Bodoni was probably the most legible metal Bodoni book face. But the digital Bauer Bodoni only works in display, despite what so many designers think. If they would use their eyes, they would see that the digital version just doesn't live up to its forbearer.

They are not the ones causing me headaches. So many people have taken KR files right off my website, installed them and then made money off them. How? Would you believe that the most common group of offenders that I have had in the last two years (let me know if this surprises you, it did me!) ... digital machine embroiders! Try a yahoo search for 'machine embroidery fonts' or the same on eBay. I've had to send Cease & Desist letters along with a demand for payment too many times. It's not just the big boys like Adobe or big (another 'get this moment') scrapbooking font sites either. Many other 'my office is in my living room' types like me are seriously up against a wall here. I can happily say though, I have had many people settle right up, be responsible, pay what is owed me, went back to using the file again and started to make money for themselves again. You have no idea, or do you? - just how many of these offenders think that taking down the money-maker (designs made SOLELY by a KR file) should make me happy - and place them no longer responsible. You don't want me to get into the threats, some even personal - and the unwillingness to take responsibility for their actions.\n\n(Check the 'royalties and licensing' forum for my other post)\n\nFor me, the simple and clear-cut here issue is - if you're making money off the file, then so should I.\n\nMy favorite 'lines' from the past ....No I didn't - I didn't do it - oh, you have proof - bad me - watch the items for sale disappear from their site or store and they think they are done - or here, let me send you a note asking how much licenses are and then when I don't hear back from the person I check their site later down the road and I see, you guessed it, a bunch of items made for sale made solely from my file - for approximately 2yrs. now -or- what happened today - a woman I have been trying to make settle up - for a problem she created - took down her old site..put a new one up... shoots me a note I guess trying to look all legal n'such saying \"I don't have anything of yours' on my site\" - well duh lady..you took down that one - the problem didn't go away simply because you changed domain names!\n\nIt's amazing how much info/proof one can get just by using 'internet archives'- also called 'time machines.'\n\n"
