Always.\n\nIs there a less ridiculous place you could put Larry's name? I find it really irritating since I have no clue who he. And, unless he's the commissioner of NBA salaries, I don't care.\n\n"

      "content": "I think the basketball from the old logo adds a lot. The new logo, without it, looks a bit bland.\n\nI think Larry's name needs to be integrated better into the overall design. Right now it looks sprinkled on top, like an afterthought, and a bit detached from everything under it.\n\nI agree that the vertically stretched letters are much stronger. The horizontal stretching is gratuitous and looks kind of comical.\n\nI just went and looked at the website, wondering what the application of the graphic was. Given the utilitarian and plain formatting of the rest of the site, I think it actually works pretty well.\n\nIf it were me, I would put \"Larry Coon's\" inside of the \"plinth\", stretched across the entire width, with stars, and reintroduce the basketball behind, I might make it an orangy basketball color instead of grey just to add a bit of pop to it.\n\nNot a fan of your last try with the red ball. It's going to leave a huge amount of white space at the top of the page to no benefit.\n\n"
