Now is a great time to join our Font of the Month Club with a shopping visit of $99 or more — many fonts are on sale and you’re contributing to a good cause. Help offer sanctuary to another unwanted, mistreated or neglected tiger, cougar, lynx, or bobcat with your purchase of Chank Fonts here:  \n [http://www.chank.com/fonts\\_all.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074914/http:/www.chank.com/fonts_all.php \"http://www.chank.com/fonts\\_all.php\")\n\nNEW COOL FONT RELEASES  \nDinkle, a set of handwriting fonts by a professional artist:  \n [http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5574](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074914/http:/www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5574 \"http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5574\")\n\nChippewa Falls, a swashy old-fashioned retro display font:  \n [http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5569](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074914/http:/www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5569 \"http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5569\")\n\nGreatest Hits Fontpak, new OpenType versions of my most popular fonts:  \n [http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5567](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074914/http:/www.chank.com/font_detail.php?sku=5567 \"http://www.chank.com/font\\_detail.php?sku=5567\")\n\nFREE FONT: WUNDERBACH!  \nIt’s been a while since I’ve been impressed by a submission to our Free Font archive. So the flow has been a bit slow. But this month I’m happy to introduce a new Free Font from a friend in France. It’s graffiti. It’s stencil. It’s European. Pick it up here:  \n [http://www.chank.com/freefont\\_detail.php?sku=1096](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074914/http:/www.chank.com/freefont_detail.php?sku=1096 \"http://www.chank.com/freefont\\_detail.php?sku=1096\")\n\nHOW NOW?  \nI’m so excited to be a guest speaker at the HOW Design Conference this year. My presentations are sponsored by Extensis, who can help with font management solutions. Best of all, the conference is happenin’ in Vegas. Hubba hubba. Sign up for Early Bird rates now...  \n [http://www.howconference.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608074914/http:/www.howconference.com/ \"http://www.howconference.com/\")\n\n",
