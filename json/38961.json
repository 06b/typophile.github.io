This has resulted in a huge increase in the available typefaces. Probably more bad type than good, but still more good stuff than we would have had in the “old days”. Type designers and foundries can take chances that they wouldn’t have when bringing commercial typefaces to market cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n"

John Dreyfus wrote an interesting book on the subject. Also I could tell you many things about both but this audience, I fear, would fall asleep.\n\nFilm only offered “scaled small caps”, as opposed to “redrawn small caps”. Film fonts offered ligature, tied character and swash “POVERTY”. And you guessed it, poverty sucks.\n\nDigitally speaking the first to reclaim those territories was Lanston under my direction. Followed by major digital foundries such as Adobe and English Monotype who called them expert fonts. I considered and treated all of our customers as experts, for the most part they were.\n\nI have worked extensively producing both hot metal type and digital offerings. From that experience I can say nothing is more enjoyable that working with hot metal. Anyone who says otherwise is fooling themselves. Or not very good at it.\n\nThere are many things I can say about digital type. One is that the good thing about digital type is that anyone one can do it, the bad thing about digital type is that anyone can do it.\n\nNot too impressive.\n\nAlso the photo boys figured that they could overlap type. They did it because they could, not because it was a “good thing to do”. Those same kind of handlings creep into digital types. Stay away from rubber type.\n\nThe one feature of letterpress, never addressed by film, and ignored, not to mentioned not allowed to function in font formats is “optical scaling”. This issue has been discussed over and over in this forum. I have tried to talk Hrant into activily. I am not sure what he is doing. Maybe someone should ask him.\n\nGiampa\n\nGerald\n\n"

For pantograph cut faces some required different drawings for each size, others drawing for two or three sizes depending on whether the face was text or not.\n\nI should point out that some “hand cut faces” were photo sized and only had one drawing for all sizes. These were recent developments. They sometimes used transfer types stuck on the end of a steel bar, and sometimes then etched to the surface giving a small relief of the image.\n\nOptical scaled hand cut punches used also only one drawing. The optical scaling was performed on the fly by a very skilled craftsman. This work was natural and usually superior to other methods.\n\nWe accomplished optical scaling with digital type when applications allowed type three fonts.\n\ngiampa\n\n"

Thanks for your feedback.\n\n**Giampa** , I appreciate your point about digital type’s scalability as a further extension of what we first saw done with film (and the good and bad that come with that. Also, **sii** , thanks for bringing clay into the discussion.\n\nI wonder if anyone has experienced any _unexpected_ positives or negatives of working with digital type? In the “Helvetica” film, someone — was it Massimo Vignelli or Erik Spiekermann? — makes the point that all the computer can do is help you work faster, but not better. The quality of the design is up to the designer, not the computer, the font file format, or the application. Certainly, every designer I know bemoans the abundance of low-quality work out there (it’s never _ours_, right?), but at the same time, the desktop publishing/designing phenomenon has brought huge numbers of people into the field, increasing its visibility in popular culture in turn.\n\nI mean, there’s an unexpected positive right there: _Non-type designers know what fonts are._ (This is a positive because explaining your job to a non-designers is easier than ever.) Can you imagine anyone producing a film about a typeface 50 years ago?\n\n"

I think that typographic knowledge and practise was strong in the hot metal days, but waned considerably with the introduction of the phototype systems, and reached rock bottom a few years after the Mac became popular.

If you weren’t experienced, you could really screw up and way over- or undershoot your mark. It was crazy expensive if you had to do it over. You then got galleys which you’d lay in and hope they fit. Then you had to do the whole thing over again with repro. Wax, thinner, T-squares, triangles, acetate, X-acto knives, etc etc. All those bloody tools.\n\nDigital type enables you to try out a bunch of different fonts in your design, print them out and compare, using actual copy.\n\nFurthermore, for anyone who remembers hand letterspacing display type, I don’t think I need to say more. Not to mention having to cut the galleys apart line by line in order to wrap the type around a photo. Etc, etc, etc.\n\n"

It was dreadful.\n\nWhat I think is so impressive about modern digital typography is:\n\na. sharpness. There has never been an era in typography where the type was so sharp. Anything optical, anything mechanical, was subject to softening factors... paper, ink, lenses, film, etc. Now it’s razor-sharp all the time, and I appreciate that.\n\nb. accessibility. Though there is, as Patty points out above, a lot of really lousy design out there, there is more good design than ever before. The tools provide precision to those who know how to use it. I argue that there has never been a better tool for fine typography than Adobe Illustrator. I routinely work in Illustrator with my cursor key movement set to 0.0001 in. That, to me, is worth the price of several decades of training and practice in typography. I love to tweak things so they really fit.\n\nc. I also don’t miss the X-Acto knives, the Rapidograph pens, nor the triangles (which were never square anyway).\n\nBrian\n\n"

Anything optical, anything mechanical, was subject to softening factors... paper, ink, lenses, film, etc. Now it’s razor-sharp all the time, and I appreciate that.”\n\nI am not sure about razor sharp, “lots of low rez out there”. Also many early faces, by big foundries, compromised outlines to optimize low rez. That is certainly a minus.\n\nFilm had serious problems, if changes had to be made, and the job was high quality, the entire text would be run through again. Reason: the chemicals deteriorated. Reproducing a “deterioration” was not an option.\n\nAnother complaint about digital type is that they are not “points and Picas”. Digital fonts are based on low rez screens.\n\nAlso digital type, at least as you all know it, is restricted in outline units, not to be confused with fit units. Ikarus was far superior.\n\nAnother thing to think about is that film fonts were more often than not digital. ITC, Letraset, Berthold made good use of digital font outlines produced on Ikarus software.\n\nSo it may not be so much the digital aspect, but more so the output device. Also what is so sharp about screen fonts?\n\nRather a newsprint letterpress proof.\n\nAnd last but not least I do not agree typography is better, or that there is more products that are better than the past. If you removed digital reproductions of hot metal faces you would be in a negative balance.\n\nPercentage wise, at least in America, it would be hard to beat hot metal in the twenties for both craftsmanship and design. And while there was less type to work with, they were at least worthy, for the most part, of looking at. Look at the ATF catalogue and tell me if you disagree. The typography was excellent.
