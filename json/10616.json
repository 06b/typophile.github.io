      "content": "If you're talking about 4 fonts only that are B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4?\n\nThese are Filmotype fonts that were given letters & numbers by VGC when they pirated a substantial number of them. Their original names were attached by someone going through a dictionary and just picking arbitrary words for Filmotype fonts that were initially just letters and numbers also. When and where I haven't the vaguest idea. But for Typositor operators there was always a haphazard list that you had to find out which was which when you bought from VGC.\n\nB-1 = Galaxy  \nB-2 = Gable  \nB-3 = Garfield  \nB-4 = Gamma\n\nThere is a complete listing of the VGC letter/numbers = Filmotype names in the Babel Press Type Index which I am still trying to print.  \nI have found out that (digital) printers want to print so fast that the quality goes down. So far, I have been unable to get this straight.\n\n"

I'm pretty sure they're different than the series of typefaces mentioned by philippedada. I too would like to know their history, and how close they come to challenging Univers's dominance.\n\n"
