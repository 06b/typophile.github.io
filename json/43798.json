  "content": "Hi - I hope someone can help with my problem here. Although I am not new to InDesign, I'm new to style sheets, but have found them very easy to use. I'm working on a magazine and have all my style sheets set up for headline, body, etc. I've inserted 8 new pages and on the first new inserted one, I imported my .doc and went to apply my styles and none of them apply correctly. In fact, not even close - they all look like my subhead when I apply them. The style does not have a + after it, so it thinks it's totally applied. When I open the style, it says it's 47 pt, etc., but the type is still 14 pt, etc. The styles are fine on the pages I created previously. Can anyone tell me what's going on? Thanks in advance for your help.\n\n",
