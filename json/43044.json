The head of our local AIGA chapter even gave away a Helvetica poster to the first person who could produce something from their pocket with Helvetica on it — it took about 5 seconds for a winner to pop up.\n\nMy non-designer friend I saw it with liked the interviews, particularly with the more cantankerous designers like Massimo Vignelli and Erik Spiekermann, but felt the ending kind of fell apart. I’d have to agree with that. I was expecting something more poignant at the end, and it kind of fell flat. There was this build-up to show Helvetica as a microcosm of 20th century western thinking, but it never came full circle.\n\n"

Well, first of all, the disc-like forms refer to the idea of formats: Blu-ray, vinyl, etc. Secondly, we liked the idea of Helvetica as a typeface spiralling out of control, or revolving almost like a planet, or a dark sun, or a universe in itself. We also thought that the spiral-like disc would refer to rays, radiation, etc., underlining the idea of Blu-ray._\n\nBut most of all, we really wanted to show the typeface in a sort of deconstructed type specimen. We thought it would be interesting to show the typeface, without actually showing it. As you see, the forms shown on the sleeve are not recognizable as letters, but you can still notice the shapes that are characteristic for Helvetica.” helveticafilm.com/blu.html\n\nYeah, ok pal.

I know this piece from those days. I am trying to remember if it were done by Ken Hiebert, Peter Megert, or Eddy Byrd. We were all very Gerstner “Designing Programmes” conscious in those days so this is no surprise to see. My guess would be that it was a Hiebert design since he was a Basle guy. He was one of my professors and I worked for him part time in the mid-sixties. Peter was a Mueller-Brockmann apprentice and came to Westinghouse in 1968. He was my boss while I was there. I am having trouble remembering who actually designed this piece and hope you can come up with the correct name? Fred Troller is another possibility but I doubt if it was him.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

If you know them, have seen one of their exhibits/lectures, or have followed their designs over the last decade, you’ll get it. If not, you might not. I don’t think that text is BS, and I was the one who asked them to let us include it on the site. I like it.\n\nAnd Chris, I don’t have any further info on that Westinghouse brochure, unfortunately. It’s great work, though.\n\nIn response to the comment that started this thread: we’ve all got our own opinions of what a documentary about type could or should be. <cite>Helvetica</cite> just happened to be mine. The film had its world premiere a year ago, and if someone had been reading the press and blogs about it for the past year and then just watched it now for the first time, who knows what they’d be expecting. And veteran designers will have different opinions than students, or non-designers, etc.\n\nIf anyone has their own ideas about how a film about type should be made, by all means pick up a camera and make it. And I’m not saying that as a challenge to criticism... I’m not saying “put up or shut up.” I just really want to see more films about design, as a viewer! That’s the reason I made <cite>Helvetica</cite>, to be able to watch the film I had in my head. Other people have different points of view, and I’d like to see those on the screen. Filmmaking should be a conversation, not a declaration, and in terms of design films there are still plenty more issues and people that we can focus on (no pun intended).\n\nCheers,\n\n-Gary\n\n"
