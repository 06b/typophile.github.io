I wouldn't have said it was a misquote unless I believed it and had good reason for doing so.\n\nHere's the whole story:\n\nWhen asked about his favorite font, Shantanu said that Warnock was an amazing series of fonts. When the reporter looked confused (didn't recognize the name), Shantanu asked if he was familiar with our founder John Warnock. In the fact-checking stage, we clarified that Shantanu's favorite font is Warnock Pro but did not get into its origins.\n\nThe reporter likely deduced from the name of the fonts, and then Shantanu's reference to John, that John created the fonts. This of course is not the case, and Shantanu didn't say so.\n\nBut given that it was a positive story, and a very logical misunderstanding (not a willful or sloppy mistake), Adobe PR didn't feel it was necessary to follow up with a request for correction.  \nHowever, they'll be sure to be more precise if the question arises again.\n\nIt's actually kind of cool that Shantanu is familiar with Warnock Pro - it's not one of our standard corporate typefaces (which are Myriad and Minion).\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

And the fact that the font was referred to as ‘Warnock fonts’ and not ‘Warnock Pro’ suggested that the PR handlers were out of the room, or had less grasp of Adobe fonts than the boss.\n\nHaving said that, in 100 or 150 years, in type history books, Dr Warnock will likely be more closely associated with the Adobe originals library than the individual designers. In much the same way as Stanley Morrison is associated with the Monotype revivals. Sadly many in-house designers, even the best of them, will be at best a footnote.\n\nBut it’s not all doom-and-gloom. One of the things that makes the font biz special is that the individual designers are credited – every school kid knows who made Comic Sans, Verdana and Myriad, but what name do you associate with Mac OS X, Windows Vista, Photoshop CS3? Probably someone who contributed little if any code to the product.\n\nFinally the conspiracy theories that have sprung up around Tom’s reply show why the PR folks often feel it’s better not to correct obvious errors.\n\nFinally, finally, how about Adobe in Seattle - birthplace of PageMaker and InDesign and home to Tom Phinney - it may not be as huge-mungus, but it's still important.\n\n"
