  "content": "G'day Philers,\n\nI'm working on a logotype for Quakers Australia in part by customizing an exisiting typeface. I'm trying to make it gentler and finer.\n\nFirstly: Is it OK to customize letterforms this much? Am I treading in murky water licensing/copyright wise?\n\nSecondly: What do you think of the changes? does it look strange? do the thin strokes look like they belong with the thicks? Is there anything that really clangs? Should I abandon my efforts and go with the original typeface?  \nNote: This is not a stand-alone word-mark, it has a device to go with it, so it doesn't so much need to be strong in that sense.\n\nSorry my questions aren't more intelligent, I guess I am looking for first impressions, state the obvious kind of stuff, I am not experienced at this by any means. Any help would be greatly appreciated,  \nthankyou\n\n[here it is](http://web.archive.org/web/20131024052958/http:/home.iprimus.com.au/nkgross/quakers_2.png)\n\n--N\n\n",
