Is there a way to get permission to make modifications? Does anyone have any insight to this? I've pasted the applicable parts of the EULA below.\n\n4.2 No Modifications. Except as permitted in Section 14.7, you may not modify, adapt or translate the Software. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Software except to the extent you may be expressly permitted under applicable law to decompile only in order to achieve interoperability with the Software.\n\n14.7. Font Software. If the Software includes font software --\n\n14.7.1 You may use the font software with the Software on Computers as described in Section 2 and output the font software to any output device(s) connected to such Computer(s).\n\n14.7.2 If the Permitted Number of Computers is five or fewer, you may download the font software to the memory (hard disk or RAM) of one output device connected to at least one of such Computers for the purpose of having the font software remain resident in such output device, and of one additional such output device for every multiple of five represented by the Permitted Number of Computers.\n\n14.7.3 You may take a copy of the font(s) you have used for a particular file to a commercial printer or other service bureau, and such service bureau may use the font(s) to process your file, provided such service bureau has a valid license to use that particular font software.\n\n14.7.4 You may convert and install the font software into another format for use in other environments, subject to the following conditions: A computer on which the converted font software is used or installed will be considered as one of your Permitted Number of Computers. Use of the font software you have converted will be pursuant to all the terms and conditions of this agreement. Such converted font software may be used only for your own customary internal business or personal use and may not be distributed or transferred for any purpose, except in accordance with Section 4.4 of this agreement.\n\n14.7.5 You may embed copies of the font software into your electronic documents for the purpose of printing and viewing the document. If the font software you are embedding is identified as \"licensed for editable embedding\" on Adobe’s website at [http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124161049/http:/www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html \"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html\"), you may also embed copies of that font software for the additional purpose of editing your electronic documents. No other embedding rights are implied or permitted under this license.\n\n",

In the interim:\n\nQuestion #11 from the [Adobe Font FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124161049/http:/store.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/pdfs/FontFAQ.pdf) found on [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124161049/http:/store.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/main.html) page.\n\n11. Can I customize a font using font manipulation software?  \nYou are allowed to use font manipulation software to modify the font software to produce “derivatives” of fonts licensed from Adobe, as long as you use the derivatives in accordance with the same licensing terms that accompany the original fonts. For example, you can use Macromedia Fontographer or Pyrus FontLab to customize an Adobe Font for individual usage, but you are not permitted to distribute, sell, or give away, the derivative work, and the derivative work counts as one of the permitted number of uses.\n\n"

      "content": "Hello Highlander\n\n\\>Is there somewhere at Adobe that will do the work?\n\nI think you answer your own question there - most foundries invite custom work and glyph modifications to their products, as long as they are the ones who are doing such work and getting paid for it, and the customer has provided some kind of rationale in their commission to have the product modified. Adobe is not likely to be an exception to this.\n\nHave you tried posting your question directly to their [forum?](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124161049/http:/www.adobeforums.com/cgi/webx?13@@.eea5b3a)\n\n"

      "content": "\\> I think the EULA and the FAQ between them say it all.\n\nMy guess is that the contradictions between FAQ and EULA are due to the FAQ reflecting an old version of the EULA. Tom do you have pointers to Adobe's legacy font EULA's? The earliest I can find using WayBack is 2002 and it seems to prohibit mods.\n\nThe language in the FAQ feels a bit antiquated, and I think the FAQ is difficult to find on the Adobe site. If I had to give advice to a graphic designer at my company I'd have to advise them not to modify any Adobe fonts, despite the FAQ.\n\nSi\n\n"
