I had stumbled upon his website a while back; what I didn’t know was that this was the same author of [TypeStyle: How to Choose & Use Type on a Personal Computer](http://web.archive.org/web/20080501183051/http:/www.will-harris.com/store-h/typestyle.html).\n\nI hate to get nitpicky, but his website doesn’t seem to be a companion to that book, whereas the ones listed above are meant as an online complement, if you will, to each book.\n\n"
