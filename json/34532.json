You can get the vector image to look exactly like te sketch if you’d like. with fewer than four clicks. The nice thing is, of course, that the image can then be enlarged to any size you like without any resolution issues.\n\n"

If the command line isn’t your thing, there is a java based GUI available for potrace that will output SVGs. I haven’t used it, so I can’t vouch for its user friendliness. The GUI called [delineate](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011042610/http:/delineate.sourceforge.net/).\n\nThat being said, the drawing is a little hairy for auto-trace. If you want it to look sketchy, you would be better off using a high res bitmap. If you want a clean, smoothed out vector version you would probably be better off tracing it by hand in Illustrator/Vector software of your choice.\n\n"
