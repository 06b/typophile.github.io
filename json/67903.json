I donâ€™t know if this of any help for you, but Jack Usine aka Jules Vernacular from SMeltery has done typefaces that look like they were inspired by similar idiosyncratic French lettering sources, see his [Sans Merci](http://web.archive.org/web/20100304071740/http:/www.smeltery.net/fonts/sans-merci), for example.\n\n"
