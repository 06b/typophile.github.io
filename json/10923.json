The six fonts scheduled for a march release (Kofika, Zarza, Polara, Exboy, Weirdiac and Moneyca Boulevard) will find a new home in a few days. For now, I'm doing my best to find not a font, but a COMPANY name that's not taken and that's at least a bit catchy... plus a new domain name.   \nNames, names, names...   \nwatch this space or look up soon at MyFonts.com   \n   \n ![moneyca boulevard medium](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712145623im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/860.gif)   \n ![zarza lite](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712145623im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/861.gif)   \n ![kofika bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20140712145623im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/72/862.gif)\n\n"
