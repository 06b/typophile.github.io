      "content": "I have been looking at \"I Love Lucy\" sites on the web and I have seen at least three different representations of the show title. Remember that this show was on TV originally in 1951, about 35 years before digital fonts. Most of the marketing since then has been using whatever they could find that was similar. For example, one product that I saw had a type style that looked a lot like [Kaufmann](http://web.archive.org/web/20150313144831/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/kaufmann/bold/testdrive.html?s=I%20Love%20Lucy&p=48), which was a metal type from 1936 that has been digitized. That one at least is believable as a possible model for the show's lettering.   \n   \nWhat does the one you want to match look like? Please post an image.\n\n"
