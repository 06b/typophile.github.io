      "content": "Ale - This is your finest and most mature work yet.   \n   \nI'm impressed that you've managed to work decent-sized   \naccents into a face with a pretty large x-height, although it   \ncould be a problem at smaller sizes (hard to tell on-screen   \nwhat 9 pt. would look like).   \n   \nI also dig the alt characters, but I don't quite buy the 'e'   \nfor the roman yet. Needs more balance somehow.   \n   \nThe stroke contrast is nice. Overall, it's a clean sans with   \nthe organic feel of the pen. Very lovely.   \n   \nI like the italic best - let's see more of it.   \n   \nP.S. Very sneaky with the   \npropaganda-laced specimen   \ntext. I'm with you.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks guys for the comments. I will try to work the e and complete the italics but I really want to finish the regular at first.   \nThe alt e, g and a are included in the regular but because it was a start for the furure italic.   \n(I dont know if its the right way but its my process) I think that italic its more practical to design after have all the roman glyph completed. (sorry my poor english)   \n   \nKen: was a font called Latina one of the winners of the contest? and..there are not a House Industries font called Latina too? (I cant remember now).   \n   \nAnyway Latina could be changed and.. what is the name you imagine for this font? (not only a question for Ken ![:)](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414231804im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"

It looks like it's geometrically centered, but it needs to be optically centered.   \n   \nPaul\n\n"

They should turn it to Bullet. And Garage to New Global.   \n   \nAnyway a more critical analysis from you maybe I expected.   \n   \nSorry for my english and good weekend.   \n   \nPS. Why americans and europeans asociate Latino with hot and excite? Argentinians are different than chilenos, peruanos, uruguayos? I think the hot latinoamericans are only the brazilians and the caribeans...just a doubt\n\n"
