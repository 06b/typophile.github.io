      "content": "New typefaces! GOTHAM and GOTHAM CONDENSED   \n   \n I'm delighted to introduce the first of many new typefaces   \n designed exclusively for The Hoefler Type Foundry by Tobias   \n Frere-Jones:   \n   \n [http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham](http://web.archive.org/web/20100329014254/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/gotham)   \n   \n A native New Yorker, Tobias celebrates his return to the city   \n with GOTHAM, a new family of sans serifs in regular and   \n condensed. Gotham takes both its name and its inspiration   \n from a type of public lettering common to New York -- these   \n are the plainspoken alphabets of shop windows and billboards,   \n rendered in paint, plaster, neon, glass and steel, which every   \n designer has admired at one time or another.   \n   \n   \nSpecial Offer!   \n   \n Right now, get Gotham Condensed for less than half price when   \n you buy Gotham:   \n   \n [http://www.typography.com/catalog/gothamcondensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20100329014254/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/gothamcondensed)   \n   \n   \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n   \nFinal Days -- Save $100 on Hoefler Text & Hoefler Titling   \n   \n Time's running out on our special offer on Hoefler Text and   \n Hoefler Titling.
