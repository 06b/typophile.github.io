That seems odd, but understandable. Has anyone read anything which they’ve bookmarked which explains the conversion process and/or how it looks?\n\nUpdate: I am aware of the [Digital Text Platform](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205034456/http:/dtp.amazon.com/mn/signin) area on Amazon.\n\n [‹ Need recommendation for script font](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205034456/http:/typophile.com/node/47353 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Darden Studio and Pampa Type updates ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081205034456/http:/typophile.com/node/48476 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
