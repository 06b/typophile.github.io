  "content": "Since I started using the OpenType version of the   \nNeutraface family in InDesign _(this is what digital   \ntypography always was meant to be, although the   \nOpenType features of Neutraface are VERY basic   \nunfortunately)_ I constantly need to switch back to   \nthe PostScript version when I want to work in   \nother software.   \n   \nFor example for a congress book I'm currently   \ndesigning, the cover is done in Adobe Illustrator 10   \n(no support for OpenType), but the book itself is   \nin Adobe InDesign 2 (OpenType supported). I   \ncan activate only one version at the time in ATM,   \nbecause it sees them as conflicting duplicates   \n(quite logical IMO). So when I want to switch   \nsoftware, I have to deactivate and remove one   \nversion of the fonts and then import the other   \nversion. This is a bit tedious.   \n   \nDoes anyone know a more elegant way for doing   \nthis? (And please don't give me any \"try designing   \nyour cover in InDesign too\" nonse, smartypants!)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20070125112234im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif)\n\n",

I think its about time other programs start implementing OT. Professional Open Type is a wonderful thing, and yeah, I find myself working more and more with InDesign because of this, even with jobs I might have done in FH before.\n\n"

The client came back to me and asked for a .dxf file of the logo for output on a CAD system. Fortunately, I had both the OT and PS version of the font, but had to revert to using an Expert font to get the old style figures. Good thing I didn't need to match the tracking and kerning exactly. Matching the Optical kerning and Optical margin alignment from InDesign in Illustrator would be tedious.   \n   \nI agree with Yves though, for single pages of closely integrated text and illustration, I still prefer Illustrator.\n\n"

They have the same glyphs, but the \"pro\" version is condensed into like 6 files, AFAIK.\n\n"

The thing is, that for that iteration of the Logo and address, I designed a slightly different format. (Boxes on plots are soooooo graphically interesting) I needed the type to be type, and not outlines of type. Although, I did convert it to outlines before exporting to .dxf, so maybe my initial surmise was moot. Thank you Chris for reminding me of that feature.   \n   \nI too look forwards to having more parity in Illustrator with InDesign. Last I heard, it was going to be late Fall before the release, but that was not from a source that Iï¿½d bank on.\n\n"
