It seems closest to [House Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109060928/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=23&subpage=viewfonts) from the Sign Painter package.\n\nYou might expect it to be in some of the Bluemlein Scripts that Alejandro Paul has been reviving for Veer, but it’s not any that I have collected, as far as I can tell.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
