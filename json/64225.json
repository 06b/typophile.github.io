The sum of these two \"blank\" spaces is the talus. It's not a common term, but \"internal leading\" is cumbersome and potentially confusing.\n\nAlso, it's smart to leave a greater proportion of the talus on top, because ascenders are much more frequent than descenders, hence benefit from the greater room to breathe.\n\nhhp\n\n"
