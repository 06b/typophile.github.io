(along with universe and rotis:!)\n\ni noticed so many times new roman fonts out there, the europe version, SF, PS, CE, times(mac), and times ten!  \nso im confused which is the best for the magazine to stick to, i see the differences in shape, but what does all the initials stand for, and whats the easiest for people to read in the mag? (its a business mag, with a 3C. grid)\n\nand which one should i stick to, im using mac, and it has times and the times new roman, and im getting them to buy old style figures and small caps in.\n\nany advice or recommendation?\n\nthanks alot!!\n\n",

For a business magazine I would want to use one that has at least the CE character set so that names of international businesses and people can be set correctly.\n\nBut have you considered leaving the Times area completely? Times is initially, (and to me, primarily) a newspaper face, and a magazine can develop a much more polished and professional look by choosing a less common face (I would stay in the serif faces).\n\nAsk about new faces here and you will get dozens of great suggestions.\n\n"

      "content": "You live and learn. At any rate, you live.  \nDouglas Adams\n\nI agree with Don McCahill. Personally, I HATE Times New Roman (any variation, thereof). It is boring, overused, and should be trashed immediately. I never ever ever use it, nor would consider using it. There are so many new beautiful fonts out there to suit whatever style you want, so why use something as bland as Times New Roman?\n\nJust my opinion, of course, but Optima or Palatino are elegant beautiful, yet sophisticated fonts that could be suitable for a business-focused magazinen. Otherwise, Baskerville or Verdana or even Helvetica would be preferable. You didn't mention whether the magazine was an online zine or hard copy print, but even still, anything beats Times. Of course, you're limited to web-safe fonts if the magazine is only online.\n\nAlso, is your magazine a business magazine in the subject of science/medicine? Or is it classical business magazine? Or is it geared to IT and Technology? Or to marketing for children? These are some things to consider.\n\nI'd check out linotype's homepage and see what they have to offer.\n\n"

      "content": "<cite>but a question for now, about ligatures</cite>\n\nThey usually have ‘fi’ and ‘f **l** ’, not ‘ft’. These two were included in extended ASCII codepages, [at least on the Mac](http://web.archive.org/web/20140902080213/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman).  \nAnd they are the most essential ones. If you stick with Times, you won’t need a lot of fancy ligatures. Take a look at its letterforms: ‘ft’ is not a problem, and ‘ff’ doesn’t clash either.\n\nThe Times alternative [Lido by František Štorm](http://web.archive.org/web/20140902080213/http:/www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-73-lido-stf-commercial-licence) hasn’t more than ‘fi’ and ‘fl’ either.\n\nMinion Pro has some more: fi, fl, ft, ff, ffi, fb, ffb, ffh, ffk, fft, fh, fj, ffj, fk, to mention only those with ‘f’.  \nBut that’s due to the fact that its f drop reaches out quite far to the right. You don’t have that problem with Times. Only use ligatures (i.e., in body text) when they solve problems – a lot of people really dislike scrolled ‘st’ and ‘ct’ ligatures!\n\n"

      "content": "I often use Aldine 721 (Bitstream's version of Plantin) instead of Times New Roman, especially when printing stuff in the office environment or on laser printers. The vast majority of people do not notice that it is a different typeface, but Aldine 721 has a slightly darker, more pleasant color.\n\nAlso note that Windows Vista ships with a greatly expanded version of Times New Roman. The design of some diacritic character has been improved, many new characters have been added. The font has 3300 glyphs and covers all of European and Vietnamese Latin letters, European and Asian Cyrillic letters, monotonic and polytonic Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, an abundance of phonetic symbols as well as combining diacritics. For multilingual typesetting, this offers a reasonable candidate. I've heard that Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac will also include those fonts so they will be available on the Mac sooner or later.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam\n\n"

The sheer quantity of documents I see that use Helvetica Bold headers/titling and Times Roman body copy is truly mind-numbing.\n\nHaving said that, you can make Times a LITTLE more interesting...the Roman Small Caps face is nicely done, I use it often in lieu of italic Times, a cut which I despise. I mean, I REALLY dislike Times Italic.\n\nAlso, I see few people use it, but Times Extra Bold is actually a nice display face.\n\n"

I agree with you, the Bitstream versions are usually fine, and in a few cases, I too prefer them to the \"originals\" such as they are. I'm not sure I'd vote for Aldine 721 over Plantin, but I WOULD vote for Aldine 401 instead of Bembo, for the same reasons you mention--the color is darker and more even, making it more useable in a standard office environment.\n\nI am told by someone that has the face though, that the new OT revision of Bembo--Bembo Book--takes care of these issues and is far superior to the Bembo/Aldine we've grown accustomed to the past 20 years.\n\n"

Should work (for the standard ligatures like ‘fi’ and ‘fl’) with non-OT fonts aswell.\n\nTake care: in some languages, ligatures are not always allowed. In German for example, there can be a ‘fl’ ligature in ‘fliegen’ (to fly) but not in ‘aufliegen’ (to [over]lie).\n\nFor other cases, you could use the find and replace function.\n\n"
