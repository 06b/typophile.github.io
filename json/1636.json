Where'd it go?   \n   \nIf it can't be found, then can you provide a link to the Typophile 50 faces. I think Pill was included.   \n   \nDo the sections archive automatically, or only the threads?   \n   \nThanks   \nRandy\n\n [‹ Clich](http://web.archive.org/web/20080310054715/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1643 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Get Gill Sans Free ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080310054715/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1599 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

We have good   \nintentions of making those archives available in the future.   \n   \n(The forum software has a built-in 'archive' feature, which   \nsimply marks posts past a certain age, but all of these will   \nstill be available online. There is material from 2001,   \nthat I mentioned, that is archived offline.)   \n   \nAs an aside, our current sponsors and your membership   \nmoney should prevent us from being in that position again.   \n   \nYou can see Christian's Origin, Raisin Nut Text and Pill Gothic   \nin the [Typophile Fifty Gallery](http://web.archive.org/web/20080310054715/http:/www.typophile.com/gallery/). His are some of the first in there.\n\n"
