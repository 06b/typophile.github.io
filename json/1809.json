  "content": "Hi everyone   \n   \nI'm working on a logo for my new site, oakandelm.org .. The name doesn't have much meaning to it, I just thought it was cool.. So why not a cool logo with some meaning? I've been messing around with different ways of interpreting a tree trunk. For my type, I chose 'Knockout' because it resembles the kind of type I think of when I hear \" wood type \"   \n   \nAny comments / suggestions would be greatly appreciated!   \n   \n-Drew   \n ![logo concepts](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419210217im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19252.gif)\n\n",

I like that one best.   \n   \nsuggestions:   \n   \n\\* maybe a less tall, condensed version of Knockout?   \n\\* play with the ampersand, both in weight and design.   \n\\* look at the structure of the two trees and see if you   \ncan somehow harmoniously tie them together.   \n\\* look at the leaves of the two trees and see if there's   \nsome distinction or connection.   \n\\* check out some more woodtype for inspiration, too.   \nI think we had some good Woodtype links posted here,   \nbut I can't remember exactly where.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "I really like the core concept here. I agree with both bj and drew about searching out some alternative type specimens. I also second bj's motion to really examine the relationship between the Oak and Elm trees (i.e. bark, leaves, etc.). Currently, it looks like you have one of the same issues I had a couple of months ago when I was designing my logo\n\n"
