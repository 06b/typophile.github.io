The main body font is Arial.\n\nAfter shuffling through a lot of types I have converged to [FF Din Medium](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134715/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-din/medium/). It has clean and precise geometrical feel to it, which is exactly what’s needed (the “real-time or ..” header):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/din-1_5154.png)\n&nbsp;\n\nI was very happy with the result, but then I woke up the next morning and the lowercase L felt wrong. Too playful and distracting, especially in a longer text. So now I made two alternative versions, which I think fix this problem, and I am now stuck deciding between them :)\n\nFirst is a pseudo small caps. 16pt R in medium followed by the rest in 12pt bold:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/din-3_3900.png)\n&nbsp;\n\nSecond one simply has the lowercase L straightened up:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20090515134715im_/http:/typophile.com/files/din-2_4956.png)\n&nbsp;\n\nSo .. which one ?\n\n",
