  "content": "Hey everybody,\n\nI’ve been searching for a while if there is a font from the example i’ve attached. This is a photo from a book with an old ad for CBS which says ha ha ha (maybe familiar to some of you). It’s probably the same font used for the cacharel logo. I love these letterforms. I do know it’s not one from the bodoni family, and some people say it has a lubalin vibe to it.\n\nthanks in advance for your replies,\n\nThijs.\n\nexample can be found at: [http://www.thijsgadiot.nl/ha400.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060148/http:/www.thijsgadiot.nl/ha400.jpg \"http://www.thijsgadiot.nl/ha400.jpg\")\n\n [‹ \"Triple Distil\" gothic from whiskey bottle label](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060148/http:/typophile.com/node/19257 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) Cargo Magazine cover headline face - ESPN Gothic {Siung Tjia} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605060148/http:/typophile.com/node/19247 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
