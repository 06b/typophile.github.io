Maybe the shear was done manually?\n\nThere is an oblique version available of the, imho, superior typeface, [Russell Square](http://web.archive.org/web/20110316053838/http:/www.linotype.com/12998/russellsquareromanoblique-font.html?PHPSESSID=34b93dae0d6ad41803fadb6bbab93932) that you might like to look at as well.\n\n"

Its a matter of compromising between the jagged iciness and compressed negative spaces-- and a superior font.\n\nI do know about Russel Square-- but thanks-- it is better but not quite right for this project. I've looked through tons of display fonts and couldn't find anything else close. May be just a matter of modifying an existing font for this purpose.\n\nThanks for the tips!\n\n"
