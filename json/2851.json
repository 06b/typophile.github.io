  "content": "After following the Cyrillic Small Caps thread below, I got   \nto wondering about OT support between applications.   \nFor instance, Illustrator CS supports Stylistic Alternates   \nwhile InDesign CS doesn't. (they can be manually added   \nvia the glyph pallete but it tends to be clunky compared   \nto the ease with which Illustrator CS can do it)   \n   \nAny thoughts?\n\n [‹ FontLab&#39;s Bitfonter for pixelfonts designers..?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203051/http:/www.typophile.com/node/1098 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Cyrillic/Russian Small Caps in InDesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080113203051/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2826 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "Different groups with Adobe are responsible for defining the feature set of their apps. The \\<salt\\> feature is something of a peculiarity as it may be implemented with GSUB type 1 lookups (one-to-one) or type 3 lookups (one-to-one-of-many). Apparently the InDesign team decided not to support the feature at all until they are able to support the type 3 lookup, while the Illustrator team decided to provide support by treating the first enumerated glyph of a type 3 lookup as if it were a type 1 lookup. So Illustrator provides partial support for the \\<salt\\> feature (so, by the way, does InDesign Middle East).\n\n"
