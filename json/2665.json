It is derived from the motif of a rising sun, one of the best known icons of Japan. The mark is drawn in a modern way, is reflected in the red sun on the tail of the aircraft, and is set on a creamy parchment colored background reminiscent of handmade Japanese paper.\"\n\n"

The crane is nice, reminds me too much of the basic idea behind the Lufthansa logo, which is better executed. The new logo looks terrible, like a twisted piece of sweets (we have a kind of laquorice here that looks similar).   \n   \nAnd gradients aren't only a major technical problem they also look like s\\*\\*\\*. It's the return of the 80s Corel Draw look, ladies and gentlemen...\n\n"

I think it happens so often nowadays and the explanations are usually so vague that you could apply them to just about anything. My problem is that they're trying to elevate this design to some other realm, I mean, \"...derived from the motif of the rising sun...The mark is drawn in a modern way...,\" are they serious? Like HD said, it looks like a candy cane.\n\n"

I digress, I met one of the designers of the Japanese Zero when I was 15, his name was Dr.Akira Okya he was born on one of the most northern islands of Japan and the people from this Island tend to be very tall, he was 6'7\" or 6'9\". One of the requirements of a designer of that period was they had to try out their own inventions. So he was stuffed into the back of a Zero and taken on its maiden voyage. He said it was the scarest ride of his life.\n\n"
