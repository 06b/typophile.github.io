  "content": "Anyone here use Speedball pens for drawing up drafts? I just got a 24-nib set, new-in-box, off Ebay and am really excited to try ’em out. I was totally in the dark about the Speedball thing, knowing only vaguely about the world of “nibs.” No idea about the whole practice of Roman and sans-serif lettering with this funky old ink-pen. Must be my age— born under the sign of Nixon...\n\nAnyway, I’d also be interested to know what other sorts of hand-drawing or other handicrafts people do when designing type, besides, you know, sketching with a pencil on a pad of paper. (One of my favorite activities in a “document design” class I teach in my department is having students design a letterform with Sculpey.)\n\n- Jay\n\n [‹ Stupid question?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821193713/http:/www.typophile.com/node/6580 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Nebiolo rights ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821193713/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19359 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I would love to gety hold of the oval set which would be the most useful for me in type design. The flats are better for more contrasty faces than I tend to do. Use good ink though, anything too watery will blot and spread too easily.\n\nChrisL\n\nPS: I was born under the sign of Roosevelt :-)\n\n"
