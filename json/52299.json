However, the line set in Lucida Sans Unicode (5.00) swallowed the brackets **and** the ‘N’ in ‘No’ … scary! No problems in Firefox.\n\nAfter emptying the system font cache (you can do that with [FEX](http://web.archive.org/web/20140312045435/http:/typophile.com/wiki/FontExplorer%20X)), Safari has no problems either:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140312045435im_/http:/typophile.com/files/lucida_6018.png)\n  \nThe dingbats are just there to check whether the correct fonts are loaded.  \nF \n"

There's a version tailored for each version of OS X.\n\nWhat you have is a corrupt font cache, it happens sometimes and a clean-out and restart is all it takes to fix.\n\nGood luck and happy hunting!\n\n"
