Some fonts even use one form in regular style, but the other form in italic.\n\nMy question is simply, do these two different forms of the letter have names? I’m sure they must, and I need to know for a report I’m writing, but Googling for anything where one of the key words is a single letter is nearly impossible.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015202117im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/letter-a_5735.gif)\n\n [‹ \"Why will Johnny no longer want to read?\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015202117/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32774 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [What is the connection between blackletter and violent / extreme culture ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081015202117/http:/www.typophile.com/node/28919 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
