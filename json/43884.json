For some reason forums often tend to be ripe with egos and spiteful people. Maybe it's the anonymity.\n\nSo anyway, yesterday I expressed my 'sympathy' for Typophile. I'm not blowing my own trumpet (it was only about £7 after all). I just want to know if I can now plop the little shield top-left onto my avatar. I didn't get any email confirmation other than the PayPal receipt. I don't want to be rude. Can I just leave it there forever? It was a once-off payment.\n\n",
