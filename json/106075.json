Would like to find something with just a little bit more contrast in the way of Timmonium, but not that much contrast, and proportions like the sample. Maybe it does not exist and a custom type is required.\n\n"

I'd noticed the more contrasted /E crossbar but I've decided to stay focused on this /M pointy centre vertex.  \nMay be considering [Knockout HTF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140825204149/http:/www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview) is worth of interest even if you'd have to mainly rework /R leg and /M centre vertex.
