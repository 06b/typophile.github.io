I really want to find this font or one similiar to it, to use on my wedding announcement. Does anyone have any suggestions? I am not really a font expert, I just saw this type treatment and fell in love with it, and I think it would be perfect my a wedding announcement.\n\nI would appreciate if you had any suggestions for a similiar font, or any other typeface that would be great on a wedding announcement!\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nbrice\n\n",
