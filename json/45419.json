  "content": "hello all, i have a litho print problem and was wondering whether someone on here can help... and so you know from the off i am from a digital background with minimal Litho experience.\n\nAnyway, Ive designed a CMYK image with black background (c100 m100 y100 k100) and various coloured layers in photoshop that use several different blend options (colour dodge/linear dodge/linear colour). However (and unlike digital print) Ive since been told by our Artworker that the black will be printed 4 times making it really thick/slow drying/shiny etc.. so ive tried dropping back the background black to C10 M0 Y0 K100 - making it a dark grey but printer friendly colour. The trouble is now that the overall colour has lost all its vibrancy since it was dependent on the Black for the Blend Layers to work.\n\nDoes any one have any thoughts, tips, ideas or directions that id find useful at this point? I dont want to sacrifice the lovely black colour for a dark grey colour if i can help it.\n\nthanks.\n\n [‹ Fonts for my magazine](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907054847/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45530 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Attention all musicians attending TypeCon2008 Buffalo! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907054847/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45135 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Provided fastdrying (UV), highintensity inks are used (Toyo — Japanese inks to be brighter), you might achieve something close to what you want.  \nDo some tests with different rich blacks and your effects. Flatten and sample the darker areas with the pipet in the Proofsimulation of PhotoShop. Or make PDF’s and check in Acrobat for TIC-limits.\n\nAnother suggestion: use a glossy laminate or varnish to finish it off.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

Im just after a solid black background but with the sae level of saturation on the colours... something im not sure now might be possible :(\n\nAnyway, Ive provided two cropped images from the file im working on which hopefully demonstrate my predicament. The first image being the original with solid black, while the second is the black background set to C10 M0 Y0 K100 - big difference in my opinion.\n\nOne - [http://imgplace.com/image/view/a66ac6354132fa92437cfc47302e5ff1](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907054847/http:/imgplace.com/image/view/a66ac6354132fa92437cfc47302e5ff1 \"http://imgplace.com/image/view/a66ac6354132fa92437cfc47302e5ff1\")\n\nTwo - [http://imgplace.com/image/view/0cbe5f78c279f274d248e6e081dfc067](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907054847/http:/imgplace.com/image/view/0cbe5f78c279f274d248e6e081dfc067 \"http://imgplace.com/image/view/0cbe5f78c279f274d248e6e081dfc067\")\n\nthanks again bert.\n\n"

Depending on your print spec, you could run the whole job with your 100% K/10% C then hit the black again with a % of the K. This, naturally, depends on the press your job is being output on.\n\nI’ve just sent a job to print, a flooded black A1 poster, thats going through twice, to get the denseness right, 5 days drying imo, and the it needs to be folded!! :S\n\n\\_\\_  \nRez\n\n"

I think what you’re seeing just happens to be Photoshop’s on-screen reaction to your CMYK values and these won’t be reproduced when you print.\n\nI also think you need to Google “rich black” too. Full 100% on all four colours is only ever used for registration and other marks. You’d never print that.\n\nEssentially though your screen isn’t adequate to accurately proof your composition as its gamut will be different to that of the CMYK process. Downloading the colour profile of the output device might help, but the only way to judge it would be to have a chromalin or digital proof made.\n\n"

If you are using a quality printer - you can make a black that has a value of 280 total. That is about the highest range a printer can get away with. Most commercial printers want way less than that - and one even told me for a richer black all he’d give me was 10c 100k — it was awful.\n\nThanks for photoshop - most artist don’t realize they are using a 75c 68m 67y 90k breakdown.\n\nOne artist in NY would have us use 25c 90m 70y 100k as his standard.\n\nI am trying to understand why the black would be printed 4 times. If they are on a press that can handle 4 colors, those get printed at the same time - if they are on a press that is one color - then each color would be printed separately - but not black 4xs.\n\nI’ll pass this on to a person I trust when it comes to printing, and see if he has any input for you.\n\n"

If i flatten the image then thats still the grey version with \\<100% CMYK.\n\nIll just have to play with the image to try and make the grey look as good as it can, i guess.\n\nOne crazy/long-winded option which i was going to try was to flatten the whole image bar the background black, then add a drop shadow of 0 distance to the top image so it adds a black\\>white gradient over the whole image whilst retaining the blend modes. Then layer that over a cutout of the black background - the cutout would be that of the top layer with a inner shadow into white. the idea being that the graduation will allow the top image to retain its Black undertone colours whilta the background still has the C10% K100 setting. id oubt it’ll work but its worth a shot..\n\n"

Maybe not as rich a black as what appears on your screen, but black nonetheless. I’m wondering if your monitor isn’t calibrated well, which may be causing black (K100) in photoshop showing up much lighter than your rich black (C100 M100 Y100 K100).\n\nThe thing about the black being printed four times makes no sense. Doing a double strike of a color is common, but four times doesn’t sound right.\n\n"

      "content": "I’m back. Okay, I sent this on to hubby, who has more years in printing then most of us have lived. Here is what he wrote back (I hope this helps)  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \nI have several questions I would like answered—  \nYou say you are printing this on a litho press. Is this a single color press or a 4 color press (does the press print one color per pass or all four colors in one pass.).  \nDo you know the name, make of the press?\n\nAll printers and all presses are not created equal.\n\nI assume you have prepared this as a photshop CMYK image and created your colors (including those that require black  \nform the photshop palette. You have created a background black form the palette using 100% of yellow, 100 magenta, 100 % cyan and 100% black. This is equal to 400% of color.\n\nMulti color, (4 or more color presses), Offset (litho) presses cannot print this in one pass. the ink will not trap properly nor dry properly. Most good printers can print up to 320%-340% of color in small areas and up to 320% in large areas. Most printers will ask for no more  \nthan 280% of color in any one color, although they can print more using good high quality inks and paper and have a good pressman.\n\nAn understanding of trapping on multi color presses. When printing wet colors over each other the inks have to trap similar in oil painting so they do not blend into each other and destroy the integrity of the color. For example if you print 100% magenta over 100% yellow if the ink traps properly (the magenta stays on top of the yellow as the ink dries then you get a nice bright red. If the ink does not trap properly and the yellow ink starts to mix in with the magenta ink as it dries the final color will come out more orange looking than a bright red depending on how poorly it trapped. and the drying process will be slowed down.\n\nHow to get a good deep black. there is more than one black, (warm black vs. cold black) I assume you want a nice deep cool black with as much gloss as possible. Today’s modern ink companies do not make a good process black ink. This has to do with the lack of petroleum based lamp black pigments in the market place. Todays inks are manufactured with environmental friendly pigments which do not yield the density necessary to make a good rich black in a single pass of black ink. There are several ways to achieve what you are looking for.\n\nOne way is to prepare the black area with the following color percentages. 100% Black, 78% cyan, 64% magenta, 63% yellow. This equals 305% of color. This will yield you a good deep dark black if you are on a modern offset (litho) press with a good pressman.\n\nThe other way to achieve an even better black is to print the black a 2 hit of black but still over the yellow, magenta and cyan.  \nI would recommend the following. 50% yellow, 50% magenta 65% cyan 90% black, and then 100% black.\n\nAre you printing this on a gloss coated paper or a regular offset sheet? If you are not using a coated gloss sheet but rather a plain vellum finish offset sheet then I would recommend the 2 hits of black to achieve what you are looking for.\n\nAl\n\n"

      "content": "Hi there. Black again, huh? When making black backgrounds (we are talking about solid blacks) either in photoshop or whatever, to be printed as four color process (or cmyk if you will) make a rich black. The best I have seen is 32c 22m 22y 100k.  \nWhen doing artwork in photoshop that requires trapping (you will judge if it needs trapping) : make the trapping yourself. Preview at 100% size and look to see if something goes wrong; some small type or hairline can go nots. Remember: it is not that the printer did not used a program to trap the CT files (tifs, jpgs, psds, even the gifs that some people use from time to time), the thing is: I have heard of prepress workflows that trap CTs (such as Artwork systems, Nexus - from Belgium, very good), but in the praxis it DOES NOT WORK! They say it does and that I have to protest and turn my face the other way.  \nAS for line work, 1 bit tifs, vector, trapping works anywhere, assuming that the rip has a trapping application.\n\nTo put it simple, if the image is a CT (continuous tone) then you trap it if it requires. If not, the printer will take care of it. Graphic designer don’t have to worry about trapping issues that much. In illustrator there is a overprint setting, i think by defaut, that make objects overprint, and if you are not aware (i think you can check a option on preferencies to show the overprints) is a problem sometimes. If there is way to proof things before going to press, do it.\n\nJackie, sorry for your loss.\n\nCheers\n\nAndré\n\n"

Every time they try to string me up — the explanations are to precise and worth more than their printers! So another battle won, hopefully, I won’t lose the war....\n\nAnd André — too many printers are no longer paying attention. In the case of the one I haven’t mentioned, they reduced their prices to my client - and put all trapping, color corrections, etc. in their hands.

The problem sometimes is that the printing companies start relying in the technology and hire unexperienced operators (which lowers the paychecks for the whole...).\n\nI suggest you check you artwork carefully, while doing it. Say, your cover will be in photoshop, then you take care of trapping it, flat it and save as tif or psd eps if you want to keep the vector info with the file. When it is mix, tifs (don’t use jpgs, they work but funny stuff happens) and text and vector, make sure the images are flat tifs. Sometimes there are transparencies issues on pdfs, just check’em carefully before submitting to the printer. And pray when you safe. :-)\n\n"

When i do take the black back (c10 m0 y0 k100) it loses all the colour definition - see the 2 examples i posted. I guess ill go ahead and do what i said above and wait and see what they say.
