  "content": "i would like to hire you to create a logo/logotype for my web design company, “moscarda” sometimes i abbreviate it to “mdc” for moscarda design collective, but i think i just want the logo to say “moscarda”. however, if you have any creative ideas for “mdc” feel free to show me those too.\n\nas far as style goes, i like much of the typography from the futurists, dada, avantgarde. i’d love it if it could look like something from a propaganda poster. other kinds of logotypes i like are hand-drawn, not calligraphy, but more unique. it is important that no two characters are identical.\n\none idea i had, that i would love to see, is a fingerprint logo, with letters hidden inside the fingerprint. i understand if this is too complicated. other than the possible fingerprint, i don’t want any other graphics in the logo, just letters.\n\ni will paypal the one i like best $100 in exchange for a hi-resolution file. if i see really great work, i can pay a lot more, but this is a forum post, so my expectations arent that high.\n\n",
