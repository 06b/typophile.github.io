And there were a couple of typestyles for the Selectric, such as Bookface Academic and Diplomat, which even resembled serif typefaces.\n\nI'm not sure that they're equalled by any monospaced typeface currently available, since now that proportional spacing is easy, monospaced typefaces are intended to look like typewriter faces so as to contrast with normal typefaces.\n\nEDIT: There may be some choices out there.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-fantabular/medium/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714052303/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-fantabular/medium/)  \nresembles Diplomat;\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/alix-fb/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714052303/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/alix-fb/)  \nresembles Prestige Elite;\n\nLucida Typewriter seems to be worth consideration as well.\n\nEDIT: Oops! In going through MyFonts, I ended up finding two Nick already mentioned!\n\nThis one didn't turn up in my search:\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/century-schoolbook-monospaced-10058/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140714052303/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-schoolbook/century-schoolbook-monospaced-10058/)\n\nbut while the glyphs look all right, there appears to be too much spacing between the letters to make it a good choice.\n\n"
