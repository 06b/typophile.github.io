Thanks in advance for any assistance you may be able to give.\n\nI’m working on a (student) project where I’ll be creating a small exhibition  \nspace describing some aspects of Maroc.\n\nWhile I will have some arabic text (for atmosphere), this exhibit would be  \ngeared to the English speaker, so I’ll need an English-langage typeface to  \ndeliver my information.\n\nI’ll be discussing primarily the people and crafts of the country — and not  \nthe showcardianism of Bogey’s Casablanca, et al.\n\nAny suggestions for type that might have some interesting features but  \nremain readable? A touch of the arabesque without being campy?\n\nThanks again.\n\n [‹ Books on typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006111017/http:/typophile.com/node/17925 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Extra Light Humanist Sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006111017/http:/typophile.com/node/17917 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
