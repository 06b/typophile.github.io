      "content": "Jost Hochuli's \"Designing Books\" is a great tool for book design, with lot of visual examples by the author himself and other designers. Highly recommended. Hochuli also wrote \"Detail in Typography\", more type/paragraph oriented, but very useful indeed for a seriuos approach to editorial design. Both published by Hyphen Press. And Jan Tschichold's classical \"The Form of the Book\", a more theoretical, but essential collection.\n\n"
