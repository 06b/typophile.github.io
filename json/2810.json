I'm still confused.   \n   \nI have a font with six weights:   \nStratum-Thin   \nStratum-Light   \nStratum-Regular   \nStratum-Medium   \nStratum-Bold   \nStratum-Black   \n   \nHow do I make them appear under one menu name   \nand also be completely cross platform compatible?   \n   \nI know I need to style link them but...   \nI'm unclear as how to do it.   \n   \nI've studied Brioso Pro and Warnock Pro   \nbut I've only come up dry. I understand   \nFDK is at work but it should be possible   \nwith FL right?   \n   \nAny help would be great appreciated.   \n   \nBest,   \nEric O.\n\n",

The info in the 'Basic set of font names' window should be entered as usual. (I.e., with four weights per family.) This has always worked in Photoshop, InDesign, etc. for me.\n\n"

It works fine but   \nI wonder how this would work in a more   \nin depth family with say 20 variations?   \n   \nMy fonts all show up with the specified   \nnames and organize themselves in the   \nmenus nicely. I should add that the   \nthird window \"Additional OpenType Names\"   \nis pretty important and seems to be part   \nof the OpenType naming puzzle. Again,   \nI followed Adam's instructions for this   \nwindow and everything is working fine.   \n   \nI hope this makes some sense...   \n   \nI would love to hear how others do this.\n\n"
