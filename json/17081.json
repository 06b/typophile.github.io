  "content": "I am currently working on a new businesscard and envelope. All criticism is much appreciated.\n\nThe businesscard was created by pattern cutting tools l purchased at a secondhand shop, using them as a cheap alternative to die cutting. The front has a braile type texture created by piercing from behind[jpeg3]\n\nMy envelope is based on WW2 Dazzle patterns, with the inside incorporating a font l created. The font was developed from patterns found inside envelopes and pay slips, designed to hide/distort content.\n\nThanks.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bcard 1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107225736/http:/typophile.com/files/bcard%201.jpg) | 79.75 KB |\n| [bcard 2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107225736/http:/typophile.com/files/bcard%202.jpg) | 89.56 KB |\n| [bcard 3.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107225736/http:/typophile.com/files/bcard%203.jpg) | 87.12 KB |\n| [envelope front.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107225736/http:/typophile.com/files/envelope%20front.jpg) | 105.27 KB |\n| [envelope back.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107225736/http:/typophile.com/files/envelope%20back.jpg) | 114.22 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Well, if this is meant to be a set, I don't see much relationship between the envelope and the business card. So I will look at them separately, then.\n\nThat said, I LOVE the technique on the card! A tad bit time consuming to do by hand, though. Would be very cool to do a laser die-cit, but I understand cost restraints. (I'm guessing this is a personal self-promotion item?) The kerning on the smaller white type seems awfully tight, but that might just be because I can't see it up close.\n\nThe envelope also is quite dynamic in a very different way than the card. While the card is subtle, the envelope is energetic. Nice added touch to have a message on the inside... BUT usually when you open a piece of mail, don't you run a blade through the edge? The recipient might never see your message, as they wouldn't necessarily open the flap that way.\n\n"

      "content": "It is meant to be a set, hopefully my letterhead and compliment slip will bring everything together, if not l may have to re-work the card or envelope. I have a very tight budget, so die cutting is out of the question.\n\nI was initially stuck on the concept for my card, and after experimenting with my new found tools l created the card. What l liked about it was the subtlety, with my name being somewhat concealed/hidden. I have attempted to carry the idea of 'hidden' through to the envelope design, using a variant on a camoflage pattern[Royal Navy colour pantones]. But this has the opposite effect in the context of an envelope, making it standout.\n\nThe disruptive typeface may not be seen. Most people l have asked tear open their envelopes, but l run the risk of my greeting meassage being missed.\n\nthanks.\n\n"

[Wausau Paper has a good overview worth consulting](http://web.archive.org/web/20131107225736/http:/www.wausaupapers.com/Resources/ten.aspx). Nothing's worse than making a great envelope only to have the USPS reject it -- believe me, it's happened.\n\n"

      "content": "I think the concept of 'hidden' (while it applies to the design of both objects) needs to be more obviously connected between the two.\n\nI would be intrigued by a similar use of the hole-punching on the envelope. Perhaps just a small monogram of your initials in the return address area (matching the style of the card) that shows a hint of dark paper inside a light envelope (or vice versa... dark envelope -- like the card -- showing a light letterhead through).\n\nJust a thought. I'm all for matchy-matchy sets when it comes to stationery systems. Maybe that's a bit boring to you, but I find it strengthens the impact of the concept if everything is closely unified.\n\n"

I have no knowledge of British or European mail standards, so I didn't comment on that aspect.\n\nIt's always good advice to check with the local postal service when designing mail, especially for business use.\n\n(Though, in reality, my experience with the USPS has been **fabulous** when it comes to delivering unique 'mail art' that doesn't conform to standards, even internationally. This is _not_ the same for bulk business mail though, where the rules are much stricter.)\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the link to the site. The envelope guidelines seem very restrictive, but l have seen mail art in the LA based Arkitip magazine, so l assume they are leanient to some extent. The envelope will be mainly used in the UK, so l cannot see any problems as any stamp marks are situated at the top of the envelope.\n\nI also like coherent stationary, l will have to look at my work afresh tomorrow evening and see what l think. Thanks for the advice,  \nl am now off down the pub for a pint of guiness, yumyum.\n\n"
