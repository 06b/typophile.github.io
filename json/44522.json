  "content": "Dear all wizards of typography!  \nI'm working on an exhibition on witchcraft and magic. And I'm looking for a typeface that gives some sort of magic/occult connotations. The closest thing yet is maybe [Fakir](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417074109/http:/www.vllg.com/Underware/Fakir/mudTyper+Weights/) by Underware but I'm looking for something a bit more legible and not necesarily inspired by blackletter. Any suggestions?\n\n",

The interviewer here seems determinately confused, but Bill’s comments are studied and sometimes even informative.\n\n[http://freemantv.liber.us/2008/01/25/bill-whitcomb-interview/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417074109/http:/freemantv.liber.us/2008/01/25/bill-whitcomb-interview/ \"http://freemantv.liber.us/2008/01/25/bill-whitcomb-interview/\")\n\nYou might find this interesting.
