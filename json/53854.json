  "content": "You corrupted one of the fonts, Microsoft Sans Serif, Tahoma and tahoma bold. You deleted Micross.ttf, Tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf except the font Courier New. If you're deleting Courier New, an undefined character will show when Vietnam character isn't defined, like an O with horn, shows up the font Courier New rather than Microsoft Sans Serif. You deleted tahoma. Pronouncing the word tahoma will be good. Why not reinstall the micross.ttf, tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf? So why not add Kerning pairs like TA, FA, AV, PA, LT, into Microsoft Sans Serif? Tahoma already had kerning pairs. And why not add some kerning pairs like AW, WA, VA, TA, FA, Aw, Ay, AY, etc. to Gulim? How add some kerning pairs like AW, AV, TA, PA, WA, VA, YA, AY, Ay, Av, Ta, Tc, To, Te, etc. to Batang? And how add some kerning like AV, AW, AY, AT, TA, to Lucida Grande? And add all kerning pairs to Lucida Sans Unicode? Segoe UI had kerning pairs. Both Tahoma and Verdana has kerning and Microsoft Sans Serif has no kerning pairs. You can download the fonts that start with Tahoma. Code 2000 also includes 239 kerning pairs. You can download Code 2000 from the website. And you noticed Microsoft Sans Serif was to include the Oi.\n\nPlease give me the font files for micross.ttf, tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf so you can convert these to Tux Typing files!\n\n",

      "content": "You have the Microsoft Sans Serif font file and a corrupt Tahoma font file, then deleted the fonts.\n\nBut you don't see any Abkhasian. If you copy and paste a letter like Ghe stroke, Zhe descender, Shha, Schwa, Barred O, it will change the font to Courier New. If you use ctrl backspace, the letter couldn't be changed. If you install Microsoft Sans Serif, the font looks good if you copy Pe middle hook or any Abkhasian letter, the font will change to Microsoft Sans Serif. If you delete the font then restart the computer, Microsoft Sans Serif will be unaccessible. If you copy the character, the font changed to a glyph named '.notdef', which is also in FontCreator 5.6 Glyph Postscript lists. If you copy a letter like O with horn, capital Schwa, U caron, u dieresis macron, A caron, A circumflex hook, Combining hook, then the font will change to Courier New, then press Ctrl+Backspace, the glyph will be changed to a glyph named '.notdef' and another .notdef glyph will appear. If you copy a Hebrew letter, the font is changed to Courier New. If you press Ctrl+Backspace, a .notdef glyph will be shown but the font shouldn't change for the Hebrew letters to your own font.\n\nIt's why the PS name whitecircle wasn't in the FontCreator PS name list. It's why the name whitecircle will become available in the list, like this:\n\nUdieresis  \nUgrave  \nugrave  \nunderscore  \nv  \nV  \nw  \nW  \nwhitecircle\n\nIt's how the PS Names like uni\\_2120, uni\\_212F, uni\\_2137, uni\\_2136 will become available in FontCreator's PS names. But how the PS name smallscriptl will become available in FontCreator? You ask Erwin Denissen to make  \nuni\\_2120 uni\\_212F uni\\_2137 uni\\_2136 smallscriptl uni\\_2223 uni\\_2228 uni\\_2227 uni\\_22BB \\_2566 \\_2567 \\_2568 \\_2569 \\_256a \\_256b \\_256c uni\\_25C7 become available by replacing Bitstream's glyph table with Custom Bitstream's glyph table. You ask Erwin Denissen to make uni\\_301A uni\\_301B uni\\_EFBF uni\\_EFC0 uni\\_EFC1 uni\\_EFC2 uni\\_EFC3 uni\\_EFC4 uni\\_EFC5 uni\\_EFC6 uni\\_EFC7 uni\\_EFC8 uni\\_EFC9 uni\\_EFCA uni\\_EFCB uni\\_EFCC uni\\_EFCD uni\\_EFCE uni\\_EFCF uni\\_EFD0 uni\\_EFD1 uni\\_EFD2 uni\\_EFD3 uni\\_EFD4 to become available in Custom Bitstream's glyph table.

You think the simple glyph Scaron contains 2 contours and 89 points. If you delete the caron, then it will change to a letter S. If you delete the 68 points then use Copmlete Composites, Scaron will become a composite glyph. The other glyph Racute has 69 points and 3 contours. The other glyph odblacute has 4 contours and 70 points. If you delete the whole glyph and use Complete Composites, then the glyph changes from simple to composite. You think the ŃńŇň were simple. Delete the letter and use Complete Composites to complete the selected 4 glyphs: ŃńŇň. These are in Unicode and encoded as Latin Extended-A Unicode block. You think the 8 glyphs ĒēĖėĘęĚě were simple. Click the letter then use the Delete button to delete the E letter and use Complete Composites.\n\nCopy and paste this to Nimbus Mono if your font is like Courier:  \n2-7-3-9-2-2-5-2-4-4\n\nYou think the 4 greek letters ζξρυ also have serifs. 4 greek letters ζξρυ from Courier New doesn't, but Free Mono still has serifs.\n\n"
