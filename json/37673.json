The idea is based on different elements like corners which I can copy/paiste and hereby quickly create a new type-expression. The basic idea is inspired by things created in the Bauhaus periods and other who work systematic and so on...\n\nI'm curious to hear what other typedesigners have of comments and if there is anything I should look into - while doing this type, that could help me in skipping steps (due to I'm new in typedesigning).\n\nHope to from all of you designere.\n\nHave great day.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017191538im_/http:/typophile.com/files/O_5043.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Jakob, am a student too :)\n\nOf course you can develop a whole typeface out of this image just by cutting and pasting various elements. And while designing this typeface(specific) you don't even need to keep the rules in your mind.  \nI made a similar typeface in a day while attending a conference in Mumbai last year. I took rail ticket window as an inspiration and built a complete face out of that. I posted it on the Typophile also. Though I didn't get much time to work on the design further, Its incomplete.\n\n[Here is the link to the original thread.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017191538/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31629)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017191538im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Inspiration_4952_5332.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017191538im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Untitled-1%20copy_5877_5225.jpg)\n\n"
