I wonder if anyone can point me in the direction of an authoritative source that a friend can use in an argument.\n\nThe argument is between US and UK style, I think.\n\nTom\n\n",

      "content": "Deja-vu. Here is an old post from a \"research questions\" discussion thread from a type facebook group I have. If you'd like to join you can find me at facebook.com/readthetype. The group is \"invisible\" to give people a little more privacy.\n\n**1. Downstyle**\n\nDown style means capitalizing only the first word and proper nouns, typically applied to titles. For example:\n\nThis is a title in down style — Microsoft Word calls this \"sentence case\"\n\nThis Is A Title In Up Style — Microsoft Word Calls This \"Title Case\"\n\nHere is a paragraph set in up style:\n\nDon't You Find This Annoying To Read? Imagine An Entire Book Written This Way. I Highly Doubt That You Would Finish It, Unless Of Course you Were Some Sort Of Typographic Masochist. Perhaps There Is Something Written In Robert Brownjohn's Book Sex And Typography About Typographic Masochism. I Think I Have Made My Point.\n\nHere is the same paragraph set in down style:\n\nDon't you find this annoying to read? Imagine an entire book written this way. I highly doubt that you would finish it, Unless of course you were some sort of typographic masochist. Perhaps there is something written in Robert Brownjohn's book Sex and Typography about typographic masochism. I think I have made my point.\n\nNotice how the the beginning of sentences, the title of the book, it's author and the personal pronoun \"I\" are more salient?\n\nTypographic convention, and I stress the word \\*convention\\*, gives us the following reasons why down style is preferable to up style.\n\na) 80% of the time words appear set in lowercase letters resulting in a more familiar word shape (bouma).\n\nb) Proper nouns like Your Name get a little more prominence and stand out as the proper nouns that they are.\n\nc) It leaves less chance for a title that breaks on to two lines to be misinterpreted as two separate titles.\n\nd) You don't have to play the \"should I capitalize of, it, and, or, the &c ?\" game.\n\nThere may be others that I am not aware of. I do know however from my time working with bilingual government clients that down style is a common convention used in French.\n\nIn cLOsIng, tHIS ArTIcLe aBoUT MiXed CASe MigHt hAVe sOmEthINg TO sAy:\n\nBEsNer, dErEk (1989).

Your second example is closer to proper title case (_aka_ headline style).\n\nProper headline and title writing in upstyle follows rules for which words get capitalized. Generally, prepositions and articles do not get capitalized. Style guides will vary on a few details. Some of the \"rules\" are admittedly arbitrary and not logically rigorous.\n\nBut generally, it has less to do with length of word and more to do with function. Thus, your second example would usually have the _is_ capitalized by most editors I know: \"This Is a Sample of Title Case.\"\n\n"
