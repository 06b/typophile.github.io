Looking for someone with solid publication experience and an online portfolio that my client and I can review.\n\nFailing that, I’d be interested in the names of Dutch business magazines whose art director/photo editors I could contact for referrals.\n\nThanks,\n\nMarc\n\n [‹ Ugar-huh?](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202144602/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29247 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Quark vs InDesign ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202144602/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13349 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Really worth checking out; he’s a very accommodating, resourceful guy into the bargain.\n\n"
