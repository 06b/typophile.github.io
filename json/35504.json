Seriously, I am curious about your IDing methods, if you care to share them. I can tell you that I primarily use either books and catalogs (guided by some memory of where I think I saw something before), or my Font ID Guides, or if all else fails, scanning through categories on font web sites.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
