Of course it’s available at our one and only Vend-O-Matic!\n\nGet it here: [http://www.fontdiner.com/silver.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204090922/http:/www.fontdiner.com/silver.html \"http://www.fontdiner.com/silver.html\")\n\nIf that weren’t enough I know you’re all wondering just what have we been up to these days?\n\nWell, we’ve actually been working on a ton of great new fonts you can only get from the Font Bros!\n\nThe first is perhaps the finest Bamboo font ever created! It’s called Bamboozle and we created it together with famous tiki artist and sculptor Squid! It looks like real bamboo because it’s made from real bamboo! Really! Check out Bamboozle here: [http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=SIDE-BAMB](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204090922/http:/www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=SIDE-BAMB \"http://www.fontbros.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?preadd=action&key=SIDE-BAMB\")\n\nA little tropical for you blood?\n\nWell, we know you handwritten script fans are gonna love the new fonts we created with Crystal Kluge of the Tart Workshop! We joined up with Minnesota’s finest calligrapher to create some of the prettiest script fonts in the Midwest! Check ’em out at: [http://www.fontbros.com/tartworkshop.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204090922/http:/www.fontbros.com/tartworkshop.php \"http://www.fontbros.com/tartworkshop.php\")\n\nSo, what ELSE have you been up to then?\n\nWe’re glad you asked . . .\n\nAfter two years of exhaustive research, the Font Diner has acquired the Filmotype photo film alphabet collection and will begin digitizing and releasing these wonderful gems of 1950s lettering as digital fonts in the coming months!\n\nOriginally sold in the 1950s, the Filmotype was a simple manually operated photo typesetting machine (the iMac of the 1950s) and it used 2-inch filmstrips with a library of over 500 amazing display alphabets so the user could set headlines on photo paper or film. Filmotype eventually went on to become Alphatype until the Mac came along in 1984 and POOF! No more photo typesetting!\n\nWe’re pleased as punch and we can’t wait to bring more of the finest retro fonts to your computer! No need to hold back, come stop by and stay a spell!\n\n[http://www.fontdiner.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20081204090922/http:/www.fontdiner.com/ \"http://www.fontdiner.com\")\n\nWarmly,  \nStuart :D\n\n",
