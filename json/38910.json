Something like scaling down the capitals and then exterpolate them maybe? Is there any way to optimize this task or do i have to draw them from zero?\n\nAs a beginer, any expert help or tips on this would be greatly apreciated.\n\nThanks in advance  \nRegards\n\n",

This will make you do some work with round letters (C, G, O, Q for sure), but will give a better overall balance.\n\nThe weight increase I used in Fontographer was 9 units, but FontLab seems to require less. Don't forget to move them back up to the baseline (half the \"embolding\" value), and rework the left & right sidebearings. And don't forget to \"remove overlap.\"\n\nThat's the start, now clean them up.\n\nP.S. \"serviceable\" meant I could get away with them in about a 10-point setting, in running text. The most common reason I made them up was to get a set of italic small caps. Sizing there is relatively easy; match existing roman small caps. If you're starting with the roman, size the \"new\" small cap \"x\" just a bit taller than the lower-case \"x\". I let the size change when \"embolding,\" so the final size comparison has to wait till you've done that. Now check things with an \"E.\" If both the \"X\" and \"E\" look right, most of the alphabet should feel right, so highlight all & have at it.\n\n"

A set of small caps just a bit larger than \"regular\" or x-height small caps would be about ideal.\n\nTruth to tell, I try to avoid small caps for subheads, because of my belief that the correct letterspacing of them (and the attendant word spacing) varies with how many words there are. Frequently, the number of words in subheads varies considerably, authors just don't think of all the problems they give us designers ;-).\n\nSmall caps can work quite well in running heads, sometime they too vary considerably in length, but there are far fewer chapters than subheads.\n\nI'm not sure how a designer that favors cap-small cap in display would feel; I confess that design leaves me cold, but maybe that's just saying it doesn't fit my temperment and meager skill -- I rely mainly on space and color when I design.\n\n"

I suspect that many type designers make them to look good in a caps-with-small-caps setting, or to match a paragraph of caps-with-small-caps against a paragraph of upper and lower case, in a specimen. But that's not how they are generally used.\n\nI have recently discovered another reason for bigger small caps -- Cyrillic. Because the lower case Cyrillic (especially in Russian) has the look of small caps, with capital letterforms and few extenders, it's necessary to bump up the size of the small caps in a typeface to get adequate differentiation.\n\n"

In my method, the width gain is all in the stem weight, which works pretty well perhaps because of the kind of proportions my uppercase letters seem to have. One of the first stages of the process is to make a mask of the caps scaled to the smallcap height that will serve as a guide to the _internal_ width of the smallcaps. As Charles notes, you may be more pleased if this scaling is non-uniform: scaling the width less than the height if you want relatively squarer smallcaps from relatively narrower uppercase letters. My uppercase letters tend to be pretty wide, so I've not found this kind of adjustment necessary in most designs.\n\n"

      "content": "_but shouldn´t that space be larger in the small caps since they´re steams are bolder?_\n\nAgain, much depends on the design of your original uppercase letters and also, of course, on the height of your smallcaps. My typical smallcaps are noticeably taller than the lowercase x-height, but with the same vertical stem weight at the lowercase letters (usually based on the width of the lowercase i stem). With these sorts of proportions, and the typical width of my uppercase letters, this approach produces the kind of smallcaps I find most useful. Optically, it means that the smallcap text is a touch lighter and more open in appearance than lowercase, which I think is a benefit, especially since naïve users cannot be relied upon to letterspace smallcaps. If any of these variables are different, then the scaling factor used to develop what I think of as the width-guide should be adjusted.\n\nA good test of the width-guide is the smallcap O. If one has a very round, Garamondish uppercase O, then a non-uniform width-guide -- i.e. one in which the uppercase is scaled less horizontally than vertically to determine the interior widths -- could easily result in a smallcap O that is too wide. Here is Constantia, showing the proportional relationship of uppercase, smallcaps and lowercase, with the smallcaps derived from the uppercase using a uniform width guide. I wouldn't want the smallcap O getting any wider than this.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140810024833im_/http:/typophile.com/files/HHhOOo_4674.gif)\n\nBill: _deriving the proportions of the small caps with one uniform rule throughout the alphabet isn’t the only way, and perhaps for some designs not even the best way._\n\nTrue, but if the regularised approach produces an unfortunate result for one of the smallcap letters it may also be an indication that something is wrong with the uppercase.\n\nBy the way, not everyone starts with the uppercase. When designing Cambria, Jelle Bosma started with the smallcaps and then designed the uppercase. I suspect this might be his usual procedure.\n\nPS.

Yes, many of them are based on the same shapes as the uppercase forms, but the very fact that they need to proportionally harmonise with some lowercase letters that are differentiated from the uppercase letters requires them to assume a different set of proportions. It is helpful to bear in mind that Cyrillic was a unicameral (uncial) alphabet for a lot longer than either Latin or Greek, and that its conversion into a bicameral alphabet happened relatively suddenly. So what you see in the lowercase alphabet are not 'smallcaps', but uncial letters writ small, while the uppercase represent the same uncial letters writ large. This is a very different evolutionary path than that which produced smallcaps from uppercase letters (brilliantly explored in Margaret Smith's essay 'The Pre-history of \"Small Caps\": from All Caps to Smaller Capitals to Small Caps', in volume 22 of the _Journal of the Printing Historical Society_ (UK)). The term smallcaps presumes the pre-existence of uppercase letters; the division of an uncial script into a bicameral alphabet is a different process. When the bicameral alphabet introduces foreign letterforms not native to the preceding uncial script, as the Petrine reform of Cyrillic did, then the proportions of the two cases of letters adapt to their new partners, and lose the relationship that they might have had to each other. This, of course, makes true Cyrillic smallcaps possible.\n\n"

I had hoped my little note in parentheses would make that clear.  \nHowever, I believe it is not senseless to study the proportional relations between cyrillic uppercase and lowercase, and even relate that to latin small caps. For example, the reason why the в (lowercase ve) is proportionally wider in the lowercase (see the above illustration) is certainly the same as the reason why a latin small cap B would be made relatively wider than letters with only one counter.\n\n"

So this is a very good example of what I am talking about. Yes, the reasons why в proportionally wider in the lowercase than in the uppercase is related to the reason why a smallcap B is proportionally wider than the uppercase, but the precise width of the в is determined relative to other lowercase letters, most importantly а, not relative to the uppercase. This explains why an actual Cyrillic smallcap В might well have a different proportional relationship to the uppercase than the lowercase has. These comments are based on a lot of experience designing Cyrillic types. Smallcaps can be derived systematically from uppercase letters, but lowercase letters need to be designed independently, proportionally relative to each other. So this is why I think it is a mistake to look at the particular proportions of lowercase Cyrillic letters as something that can be related to smallcaps, because I think these proportions involve other influences.\n\nA good experiment would be to apply your approach to typefaces that include Cyrillic smallcaps, so you can show a three-way relationship.

I wanted to know in which way the proportions <cite>within</cite> the uppercase differ from the proportions <cite>within</cite> the lowercase. That's also what my above diagram is about, isn't it? The diagram is supposed to visualise the relation between the intra-uppercase proportions and the intra-lowercase proportions.\n\n"

I think it is a mistake to regard them as reduced versions of their uppercase counterparts, just as it would be a mistake to regard the uppercase letters as big versions of the lowercase.\n\nI understand your diagram, but what I am saying is that it misses the input from the other lowercase letters. This input is important, especially in the case of an Cyrillic designed to harmonise with an existing Latin design in which several key letters are inherited from the Latin (thanks to Peter the Great!). It also misses the cumulative input derived for iterations of the lowercase design, i.e. not just the influence of lowercase-distinct architecture in some letters, but the influence of the cumulative design decisions about lowercase letters.\n\nI design the Cyrillic lowercase and the uppercase largely independently -- as independently as the Latin lowercase and uppercase --, and unlike smallcaps the proportions of lowercase letters are not derived from uppercase. Within the set of letters that share similar uppercase and lowercase architecture, the same kind of proportional awareness is important _within the individual cases_. For instance, the variation of internal width in the sequence инпџцшщ is similar to that in the sequence ИНПЏЦШЩ, but they are arrived at independently, checking lowercase against lowercase and uppercase against uppercase.\n\n"

Scale down: Actions\\>Contour\\>Scale  \n2. Add weight: Actions\\>Effects\\>Bold  \nIn either of these, you may add slightly more to the x axis.\n\nFor serif fonts, cutting, pasting, and dragging can also be useful methods.\n\nA good way to see what's working is to compare, in the Metrics window, those letters that are basically the same in all three cases, C, O, S, V, W, X.\n\nIt's also a good idea to test your small caps, in a piece of text in InDesign or Quark, against a typeface of similar style.  \nTry it in a piece of text with \"U.S.\" or similar ambiguous acronyms, and with all-small-cap lead-ins to text paragraphs.\n\nIn page layout applications, you can get a feel for the transformation required by making faux small caps using scaling and stroking.\n\n"

The way many people (including myself) like to make smallcaps these days is quite a bit higher than that, which makes confusion with the lc moot.
