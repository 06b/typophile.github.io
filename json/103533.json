A [Bodoni Condensed Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004601/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/bodoni-rr-black-condensed) might work as well.\n\n"

      "content": "This was a typeface known as \"Roman\" which was popular during the third quarter of the 19th century. Note the extreme thick-thin contrast like Didot or Bodoni. Also note the huge pointed-wedge shaped beaks on E, G, L, T & S and mini unbracketed serifs. Foundry terminology varied but Roman Extra Condensed Italic, or Roman Elongated Slope would fit. Here is a condensed version, with no slope, from Bruce Foundry 1869.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004601im_/http:/typophile.com/files/RomanCond@Bruce1869p55_3914.jpg)\n  \nAFAIK \"Roman\" is not digitized in a precise match to your image.  \nDon \n"

I won't duplicate the references.  \nA few more: Matthew Carter's [Elephant Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004601/http:/www.linotype.com/899985/Regular-product.html/) is a well designed presentation of a design that is somewhere between Thororowgood and the font that formed the basis for your image. Somewhat similar is Monotype's 1931 design for [Falstaff](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004601/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/falstaff/). Berthold's 1860 design, [Normand BQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004601/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/normande-bq/) includes a condensed version and an italic version but not a condesnsed italic. There is also a Bitstream version of Normande.  \nDon\n\n"

MyFonts does not sell it and the website [http://www.woodentypefonts.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150402004601/http:/www.woodentypefonts.com/ \"http://www.woodentypefonts.com/\"), which used to sell it, merely has a notice in Russian that the website is suspended. Perhaps someone has current info on the foundry?  \nDon \n"
