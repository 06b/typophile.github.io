      "content": "Well, looking at the wobbles, I would get some practice with the bézier tools first. I do not mean to offend you of course, but it seems you haven't worked with béziers very often, hence they look wobbly. It really takes some practice to get it right. I could suggest [Leslie Cabarga's book 'Logo, Font & Lettering Bible'](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417170927/http:/www.amazon.com/Logo-Font-Lettering-Bible-Comprehensive/dp/1581804369), which has some very easy to understand explanations on how to work with béziers. Things like; minimize the amount of nodes or keeping bézier handles straight as much as possible (i.e. horizontal and vertical), etc. I think it's about US$20, so that's not too bad.\n\nLooking at your PDF, I think you probably have too many nodes, and also nodes with only one bézier handle. It's impossible to get smooth curves this way.\n\nBriem's site is also a nice source indeed, which also discusses béziers a bit I think. If you search google on bézier curves you will probably find more handy tips and tutorials.\n\n"

Although I have the paperback version, which has quite a nice matte black cover with white type. But indeed, the information is good. Especially if you don't know a lot about the subject yet.\n\nCheng's _Designing Type_ is a good book, although it is more a thurough analysation of different typefaces and their glyphs. Not really on how to design type. Not that that is really a problem, though. :)\n\n"
