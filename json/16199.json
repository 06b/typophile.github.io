The mag is mostly about architecture, though there is some art in it as well.\n\nThe name of the mag is “studio” and this is the second issue, hence the need for a great type for the 2.\n\nI don’t have a preference between serifs and sans serifs. I want something bold, but not screaming; serious, but not boring and definitely not distressed/destroyed.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nmacgirl\n\n",

But then, just out of curiosity, I checked the forum and there were lots of replies… this is Typophile after all.\n\nI like the Mercano Empire Regular, but for some reason I keep wishing the 2 to be “fatter” instead of “taller”, though only slightly. Maybe I can play around with it in Photoshop and see what I get. Or if you have another suggestion that is similar to that but “fatter”, please let me know.\n\nI considered the Roman numerals option, but I discarded it almost immediately as it would make the mag look unnecessarily “old” and kind of traditional. A giant “normal” 2 (in the tradition of Russian book cover designs) would deliver the message without being gimmicky. Castellar is gorgeous though.\n\nI really liked Tiffany Heavy, though I’m concerned that the little curvy parts might clash with the otherwise “regular” layout. I’ll try that one as well.\n\nThe “hourglass” two is very cool, but I can’t use it… :( It reminds me too much of the Godfather font… I don’t know why, it just does. It looks really cool, though.\n\nthanks for your help,  \nmacgirl.\n\n"
