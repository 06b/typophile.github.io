      "content": "Eric:   \nThis post was stuck rolling around in my head for a week. I may have an answer.   \n   \nHere's what works for me:   \n   \nin the preview window (Shift-Option-Cmd-m)   \n   \nMake sure you've got a preview text file selected by clicking on the ellipsis in the upper right corner. FL has a preview string text file chosen by default, but you can choose another file if you wish.   \n   \nThen move to the left, and pick a word from the arrow-up or down list.   \n   \nHere's the important part: Now, move the pointer to the preview pane itself, and click. This 'tells' the application that you want to do something in the pane. Only after resetting the cursor will the Cmd-page up and down commands work. Otherwise you're left wondering why doesn't this work?   \n   \nJoe VanDerBos   \n [http://www.joevanderbos.com/type/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108222726/http:/www.joevanderbos.com/type/)\n\n"
