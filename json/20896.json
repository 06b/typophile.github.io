  "content": "I met with someone from this publication recently, and I “may” work there. Just doing some research, and I have these 7 samples here. I have a feeling that a few are duplicates, just different weights/styles. I am not so keen as to be able to identify as most of you can, so, why not take advantage of this generous service. I have uploaded each one as a different file, so I would appreciate it if you include the number of the sample you are identifying in your response. Thanks much.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/1_8.gif) | 58.33 KB |\n| [2.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/2_11.gif) | 34.37 KB |\n| [3.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/3_1.gif) | 92.07 KB |\n| [4.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/4_3.gif) | 18.77 KB |\n| [5.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/5_3.gif) | 88.95 KB |\n| [6.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/6_4.gif) | 69.34 KB |\n| [7.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/typophile.com/files/7_2.gif) | 7.34 KB |\n\n [‹ Classic \"I Want You For U.S. Army\" Uncle Sam recruitment poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20897 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Searching for Shakespeare\" sans serif book title - Foundry Sterling {Yves} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071102154155/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20890 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
