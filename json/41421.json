Books like _Thinking With Type_ where images and footnotes are popping out all over the place, creating a series of segues that make it impossible to just focus and read the text, drive me nuts.\n\nBut I also know a lot of designers who look on such books in the same way Scientologists see _Dianetics_. In a field where people are visually inclined, a little nutty, and “learning disabilities” like ADHD and dyslexia abound, it’s probably good that there are alternatives to books by Robert Bringhurst and Harry Carter.\n\n"

I’m having trouble describing this but it felt - to me - very disrespectful of books as objects. Then they shot the interior pages from weird angles, cropped and such. Again, disrespectful to the designers and totally useless as a resource. I wrote to complain which means they will never give me an award again (not that they do anyway since I let my membership go).\n\n"

The advice within ranges from good to questionable — but that’s not the real problem. It’s set in 11pt Perpetua. Now, the 11pt size of most faces is easy to read. Perpetua, however, is so tiny within its em-square that at 11 pts it’s comparable to 9pt Times New Roman. Even at 11 pts, Perpetua is positively anemic. All in all, extremely difficult to read for any length of time.\n\n"

      "content": "Steve, the trend toward sans serif types in design books may be a reaction to the many badly-rendered digital serif types available. I know that when letterpress types were adapted for phototype, no consideration was given to the natural ink spread that occurred when the metal pressed the ink onto the paper. Also, the largest available sizes were used to create the negatives, and as we know these sizes of metal type are considerably different than the smaller text sizes. The result was type with rather pronounced contrast, anemic and not at all pleasant to read.\n\nUnfortunately, in the early days of Postscript, most digital foundries used the same misguided tactic. Many of these fonts were actually digitized from the phototype negatives. Of course, designers (as opposed to technicians) know that digital Centaur looks nothing like the original metal version. The readability problem is compounded when white, coated, glossy paper is used — the stock of choice for photography-heavy art books. In such a situation, relatively mono-weight sans serif types that come in a variety of weights (to compensate for the smaller sizes looking too thin) are a much better choice than many popular serif types.\n\nThankfully most type designers now understand this issue, and are producing text-sized serif type with reduced contrast and more weight. And thankfully, also, book designers have ceased to set their work in Linotype Didot and Bauer Bodoni.\n\nHowever, for continuous reading — novels, long articles — nothing beats a well-judged serif printed on off-white or ivory-colored paper. This is why you will rarely see a novel set in a sans serif type.\n\n"

      "content": "Skipping over the design of these books, what bothers me are the ones I think of as prescriptive — “you gotta do it this way to get a good book.” Dowding comes to mind, as well as some still living (& hence unnamed).\n\nThe kind I like are descriptive. Rich Hendel’s book is this kind. But my personal favorite is <cite>Art of the Printed Book 1455-1055</cite> by Blumenthal, Morgan & Godine. Once you learn to look through the peculiarities of time, place & technology, it is wonderfully instructive.\n\n"

That said, however, I think it’s the trend to sans serif types for body text in design books.\n\nJust pulling a handful of such books from one of the shelves in my studio ...\n\nLook no further than Karen Cheng’s _Designing Type_ or Jan V. White’s _Designing for magazines,_ 2nd ed. Timothy Samara’s _Publication Design Workbook_ is another offender. That much the sadder because they’re good books as far as their subject matter goes. On the other hand, Rich Hendel’s _On Book Design_ and Jost Hochuli and Robin Kinross’s _Designing books: practice and theory_ practice what they preach.\n\nAs cool as sans serifs look—I’d still like to find a project on which I’d be willing to use Optima as my body face—my eyes get tired more quickly than with serif type. I’ve read as much. Interestingly, there’s someone on the Freelance Publishing maillist (of the Yahoo Group of the same name) who, if I understand correctly, is making the case that all this about sans serif being tougher on the eyes is a fallacy.\n\nPity the designer who would sacrifice readability for cool.\n\n"

For instance, there are several books about oil painting that I’ve read that were awesome at describing both the theory, technique and application of the craft in a way that made it seem as if Mr. Rembrandt were right there in the room instructing me.\n\nI have a hard time believing that the same couldn’t be made of a design book that makes it feel like Paul Rand or Saul Bass were there teaching me.\n\nI feel that a serious and technical critique of a work from start to finish really helps create a discerning eye. The majority of design books just throw out a bunch of designs with a generic caption, and never bother telling us just what it is about a particular design that is so dang noteworthy to be put in a book that I’m shelling out my hard earned clams on.\n\n"
