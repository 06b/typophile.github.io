  "content": "Hello,   \n   \nHello, I am new to this group and need some help!   \n   \nMy problem is that I am using a font within a dynamic text field in Flash. This setting means that I can't reduce the letterspacing within the programme and I need the letterspacing to be very tight. To get around this problem, I am going to create a variant of the typeface that I am using which has the reduced letterspacing encoded.   \n   \nI don't want to have to alter kerning pairs, but actually want to keep the original kerning of the typeface and reduce the spacing across the board - to emulate what programmes like Photoshop and Flash do, but in the font.   \n   \nIs this possible to do? Which programme should i use? Any advice would be great.   \n   \nThanks in advance   \nWill\n\n",

Select all characters first, then do Set Metrics, check \"Right sidebearing\" and \"Selected Characters\" and under \"What to do\" choose \"Decrease\" with an appropriate value in em units. (An em unit is one thousanth of an em usually.)   \n   \nIn FontLab, you can do the same thing using Tools \\> Transform... \\> Metrics \\> Adjust metrics, checking the box that says \"Apply to whole font.\"\n\n"
