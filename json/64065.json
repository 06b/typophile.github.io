Unfortunately, Typophile resets the post time after an edit which bumps things out of order. :(\n\nKnowing what you're trying to accomplish... one might recommend that you print the background in the darkest PMS gray you can find... then print the type in Black and drop a spot gloss varnish on the black type.\n\n"

      "content": "UV and matte lamination is done 'offline' after the sheet is printed. Most of the time this is a protective cover. They basically apply it off a roll to cover the entire press sheet. I've not heard of printing on that after it's been applied but it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nThere is also an 'aqueous coating' (matte or gloss) that is used as a protective cover over the sheet. This protects the ink from scuffs. Most magazine covers have either an aqueous coating or lamination applied. This keeps the ink between copies from rubbing together during transport. If they don't do this micro vibrations in the bundles will rub the ink off in spots like sand paper.\n\nA dull varnish shouldn't produce a velvet feel if you have a stock with a smooth finish.\n\n"

      "content": "Note that you will get two subtly different effects depending upon whether you choose to put down matte lamination and then print spot gloss varnish on top, or whether you put down gloss lamination and then a spot matte varnish on top.\n\nFor a black-on-black type treatment, what you describe will probably give the results you're after.\n\nBut when working with photos, for instance, I've found that matte lamination kills the color in a way that the gloss varnish can never bring back. Whereas the opposite approach will maintain richness and still yield a nice effect (although the matte varnish over gloss lam will never have quite the same velvet surface as matte lam).\n\nAlso, is your printer really talking about a lamination, or does he mean an aqueous coating? Laminations can have a tendency to cause curl (because it's a plastic coating) if the back isn't somehow balanced out and if the humidity of the shop doesn't match your world. A publisher I worked with used to have a heck of a time with certain book covers curling during different times of the year.\n\n"
