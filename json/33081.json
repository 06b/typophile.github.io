  "content": "Dear Design Forum,\n\nMe and my partner are designing a logo for a school project - a magazine/newspaper for Israeli and Palestinian youth (ages 9-14) called \"Windows\" (Chalonot / Shababik).  \nWe came up with this logo treatment, and we're wondering about the Arabic - is it readable as the Hebrew (which is quite distinguished)?  \nAlso any other comments are welcome.\n\nThank you!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [shababik.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131123072439/http:/typophile.com/files/shababik.gif) | 12.38 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Since I don't read Hebrew I can't attest to the <cite>relative</cite> legibility between the two scripts\\*, but the Arabic itself is plenty legible. The only potential problem (which the Hebrew probably has too) is the possible confusion with the circles; you might try making them different - maybe make the Arabic ones diamonds. A bigger problem however is how the logo will look without color, since you're relying on that heavily for legibility.\n\n\\* Which probably is only of academic interest however.\n\nBTW:  \n [http://typophile.com/node/32423](http://web.archive.org/web/20131123072439/http:/typophile.com/node/32423 \"http://typophile.com/node/32423\")\n\nhhp\n\n"
