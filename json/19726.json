      "content": "I have checked into that font, and discovered the reason it has the odd characteristic of working as a text font, but continuing to look good at larger sizes is a lot of detail went into it. Not sure what is meant by that, but maybe someone can elaborate.\n\nYou probably will have to settle for a seperate text and display font if you go the free route. For free stuff, Manfred Klein at the TypOasis is probably your best bet. Unfortunately there aren't samples, and there are thousands. I don't have time to go through it all, but feel free to check my [Manfred site](http://web.archive.org/web/20140315060023/http:/www.fontplay.com/mk.htm) for samples of some of my favorites.\n\n"
