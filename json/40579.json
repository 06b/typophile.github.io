      "content": "Mmm, lovely! Thanks for sharing Sharon. Very beautiful.\n\nAnother photographer I know makes flower-themed art prints using a direct positive exposure technique as follows: grab a large sheet of Agfachrome (formerly Cibachrome) color positive photographic paper, and lay flowers and such-like on top. Flattened flowers work better, and you can of course enhance their contact with the paper by laying a sheet of clear glass on top to press them closer against the surface. Expose the composition with a white light source—-whatever temperature Agfachrome paper likes for white balance. Develop the “print” in the normal chemical process, and you end up with a one-off art print. The colors of the flowers and stems and leaves is transferred in the same way exposure to a transparency transfers colors via the direct positive process. Areas directly exposed to the white light come up white :^)\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
