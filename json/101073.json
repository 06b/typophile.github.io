Second is simply \"very Eurostile\" to me.  \nYou can have a look to [Ray Larabie Typodermic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typodermic) fonts, [FontFabric Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Fontfabric) (some more including freebies [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/fontfabric.com/category/all-fonts)), [Test Pilot Collective](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Test_Pilot_Collective) and [Identikal](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/Identikal_Collection). My favorite at this moment is [Carl Crossgrove Biome](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/Biome).  \nMy 2 cent now. Using this kind of fonts is visually risky. They're surely cheesy and appealing, love them at first sight but they're far from being timeless, you can get tired of them very quickly.\n\n"

I like your viewpoint in that these fonts are cheesy but appealing and that we can rapidly tire of them as opposed to those that are timeless. I agree with you regarding Biome and the Pro Semi Bold looks fantastic.\n\nThe project I'm working on entails a logo for a hiking tour/guide who currently has a standard logo. The one I'm looking to design is one for a weekend hike taking place, which will not be used for long-term. Some shirts, brochures, water bottles, and keepsakes will be made for the special occasion.\n\nIt will read \"higher\" (upper case/lower case to be determined) and I was looking for inspiration.  \nI came across this backpack at [Eddie Bauer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022085416/http:/s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/EddieBauer/EB12IA_0231792_300C1?qlt=90,0&op_sharpen=1&resMode=bicub&maskUse=norm&rgn=0,0,0,0&align=0,-1) as the color caught my eye. The logo seems clean and to the point. My guess is they're using Helvetica, possibly?\n\nThe logo at the top of the pack and the name at the bottom of the pack as well, are the ones I'm looking at. I'm interested in possibly using a type similar to this. I'm going to look at the glyphs on the fonts you've linked to and see how the letters may look.\n\nThanks!\n\n"
