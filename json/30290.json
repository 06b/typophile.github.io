  "content": "Hello all,\n\nMy registration for Typophile FINALLY kicked in after 2 weeks (and 1 day) of waiting for my activation e-mail. So, I'm celebrating by requesting the name of a font, if at all possible. :-P\n\nThis is an unusual request - many people on here are asking for typefaces used in magazines, films, etc. ... the typeface I'm looking for comes from a game. As the name implies, and as you're probably wondering when I'm going to get around what I'm actually asking for, the font used in the dialogue bubbles in \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" for Nintendo 64 (the good old days).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/greatdeku_3866.jpg)\n\nThis is just a sample... other (more complete) examples are:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/zelda1_3698.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/zeldasecond18_5494.jpg)\n\n(Please note: this font is used for both Nintendo 64 games...Ocarina of Time as well as Majora's Mask.) The most prominent feature, to me at least, is the way the exclamation mark seems to be curved/slanted slightly...also the roundness of the font is noticeable...\n\nI've been wondering this for ages, and I do apologize for the lengthy post. Any help/guidance would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!  \n-BT7\n\n",

It seems to be a modulated sans-serif, along the lines of the much-discussed [Beorcana](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075740/http:/beorcana.com/welcome.html). I checked out [Optima](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075740/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/optima), as well as Amira, Amerigo, and others on MyFonts, to no avail. [Renova EF](http://web.archive.org/web/20150223075740/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/renova) is the closest match I've found so far, but it was designed in 2006. The font used on the Wii's menus has yet to be identified as well, so maybe Nintendo gets all their typefaces from one, midly obscure source.\n\n"

It's very possible this font has only ever existed as single character bitmaps created for the game.\n\nThere were quite a few N64 games they released that had unique typefaces I'd never seen before (e.g. there was a great script in Mario Kart 64) or since.\n\n"

I'm not sure why...Beorcana actually looks fairly close.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the font or the fact that I've been playing these two games since they first came out that the font is so strikingly reminiscent of some other font ...\n\nThanks for all your help so far!  \n-BT7\n\n"
