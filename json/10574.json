The same structure that is in the .ttf font was placed in the \"sfnt\" resource of the Mac TrueType font, along with some other pieces of data.   \n   \nMac OS X introduced data-fork Mac TrueType fonts (.dfont) which was a repackaged form of resource-fork Mac TrueType fonts known from Mac OS 7 and later. Indeed, both sorts of Mac TrueType fonts include the same pieces of data that are included in Windows TrueType fonts (.ttf).   \n   \nHowever, Mac OS X data-fork Mac TrueType fonts (.dfont) are closer related to Mac OS Classic resource-fork Mac TrueType fonts than to Windows TrueType fonts (.ttf).   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"

It can be controlled in FontLab Preferences / TrueType / Use following codepage to build cmap(1,0) table. By default, it's set to Mac OS Roman which is fine for most fonts so you don't need to change anything. Also, make sure that your font's metrics and naming are compatible with the recommendations:   \n   \n [http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mview=0&ID\\_Message=4356](http://web.archive.org/web/20111222215529/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=4356)   \n [http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mview=0&ID\\_Message=2843](http://web.archive.org/web/20111222215529/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2843)   \n [http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get\\_message&mview=0&ID\\_Message=3065](http://web.archive.org/web/20111222215529/http:/groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=3065)   \n   \nRegards,   \nAdam\n\n"
