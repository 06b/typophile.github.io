I apologize for the quality, it was the best I could do given the relative scarcity of surviving material within reach.\n\n1. SovietBookText.jpg: typical body text face found in virtually every Soviet textbook, also used in newspapers, other official publications.\n\n2. GOST1.jpg: Title block on state standards/specs documents.\n\n3. GOST2.jpg: Alternate title block on state standards/specs documents.\n\n4. PravdaRadio.jpg: used in text boxes in Pravda, in this case the extensive TV and radio schedule.\n\n5. PravdaMasthead.jpg: The (in)famous Pravda masthead, still used at the tabloid successor, pravda.ru; same typeface was also used for Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda); have never seen it anywhere else, but was wondering if an entire typeface character set was ever developed.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [SovietBookText.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160956/http:/typophile.com/files/SovietBookText.jpg) | 304.57 KB |\n| [GOST1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160956/http:/typophile.com/files/GOST1.jpg) | 88.35 KB |\n| [GOST2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160956/http:/typophile.com/files/GOST2.jpg) | 96.9 KB |\n| [PravdaRadio.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160956/http:/typophile.com/files/PravdaRadio.jpg) | 301.2 KB |\n| [PravdaMasthead.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228160956/http:/typophile.com/files/PravdaMasthead.jpg) | 641.43 KB |\n\n",

Berthold face from around 1900 called Lateinisch which was even more similar, including the serif at the top of the A. Probably it's a cyrillic adaptation of that style.\n\nI've seen Art Nouveau faces similar to the Pravda masthead, but I think it was probably custom.\n\nHey, look! Oprah is mentioned! Are you sure this is authentic? (Just kidding.)\n\n"
