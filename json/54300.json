I want to update my logo, but I'm stuck in choosing a type that will suit our icon. the type we were using before is in the Myriad family, but now it looks a bit soft to me, I want something a bit bolder but not to strong any suggestions? oh by the way the new revision i did I used Univers. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nPeace.  \nElias Tercero\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [sbs\\_new.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020045929/http:/typophile.com/files/sbs_new.jpg) | 40.07 KB |\n\n",
