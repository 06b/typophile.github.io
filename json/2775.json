With a canvass 170 pixels wide, and 410 pixels high, create a typographical representation of yourself. It can include as many details as you wish, for example, real name, nickname, website, email, height, weight, eye colour, age, date of birth, and so on. This will be ongoing, so there wont be any kind of deadline.   \n   \nSubmissions   \nIt couldnt be easier, create your image, save it as a jpg, if in photoshop, save at 100% quality. Then email the jpg to [email] [Type@lethaldosage.net](mailto:Type@lethaldosage.net)[/email]. Make sure you include in the email, your name, the email address you wish displayed, if any, and your website name, and URL.   \n   \n [http://lethaldosage.net/type](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111030123/http:/lethaldosage.net/type)   \n   \nIf any of the mods feel this is spam, or in the wrong forum, feel free to move it, i couldnt work out where to put it.\n\n",
