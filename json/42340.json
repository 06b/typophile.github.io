  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am picking out a geometric sans serif for a website. It needs to be similar to Futura but it also needs to be softer than Futura.\n\nWhat are the differences in feel between Futura, [Graphicus DT Regular](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311183554/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/graphicus-dt/regular/charmap.html), and [Print Clearly Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20150311183554/http:/www.bvfonts.com/fonts/details.php?id=45)?\n\nI really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance!!\n\n",

      "content": "Graphicus DT appears very similar to Futura; it seems to be a tad wider and the A,M,W are flattened on the top and bottom whereas in Futura they have points. Also, the j has a slight curve at the bottom instead of just a straight line, and the descender on the g is less harshly geometric and more open. Print Clearly is narrower than Futura and appears to have a rounded stroke. Also, the I, J, and 1 have serifs to make them more distinguishable. I'm not an expert, but I hope that helps.\n\n"
