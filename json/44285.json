  "content": "Hi everyone, this is my first post here, I’m not a professional graphic designer, but I made this logo for myself. I read a couple of other posts and I really liked how you guys critique and make suggestions so I wanted to know how bad my logo is, or who knows maybe it’s not that bad. I have already made business cards with this logo, however it’s on a black background. I wish I had known about this forum before I committed to this logo, but who knows, if you guys help me make it a real logo, I’ll make a new batch of business cards. Thanks you for taking the time to view my post.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/avila_business_card_updated%20copy_5438.jpg)\n\n [‹ Photographer Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44451 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logotype for fashion label ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44477 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "The A and V shapes are quite nice, but the text knocked out of the extended crossbar is problematic. It looks like an afterthought. The font does not, in any way, compliment the logo, and it’s not kerned properly or placed thoughtfully. The thin outlines and colors don’t really add anything aesthetically, so I’d just stick to black and white without any outlines.\n\nI suggest you take the text out of the black bar, and put the word Avila above the line, and “Video and Editing” below. Also, please, don’t use a plus sign, use an ampersand or write out the word. I’d start by looking at fonts like [Panorama](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/panorama-sg/light/) or [Avant Garde Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-avant-garde-gothic/book/) or even something Bauhaus-y and fun like [Reflex.](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359/http:/sudtipos.com/fonts/44)\n\n"

However I did consider what Eileen said about the text on the crossbar being problematic, especially after I removed it. Then I went even further as to remove the crossbar completely, and this is what I came up with.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logos_6108.jpg)\n\n"

Spend some time looking around at the size relationship between logo and logotype. Barnes and Noble has some great logo books.\n\nI’m guessing you’re actually designing a business card here, not a company identity, but this scale can’t work for every application like an identity really needs to.\n\n"

Seems like “Avila Videography” or even “Avila Video” would be a much stronger name.\n\nAnyhoo, good luck! You’re on the right track. :)\n\n—-  \neeblet.com\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions once again. I am trying to create an identity, not just business cards, but it probably looks like that because of the size of the last update. I didn’t have much trouble deciding whether to take out the “Editing” or not, but it looked weird having the two words in separate rows. I just think it looked like a list, so I put both words in one single row. I put a stronger orange on “Videography” and fixed the kerning. The white background version is for paperwork i.e. letterheads, contracts. The black background version is for business cards, promotional items, and website. I’m very happy with this last update, it looks much cleaner and solid than the first.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907002359im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/for%20typo_4252.jpg)\n\n"
