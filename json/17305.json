At night he studied drawing and letter design, and bought engraving tools and taught himself type cutting. The foundry encouraged his efforts and in 1882 he joined the [Marder Luse Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123052331/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Marder%20Luse%20Foundry) in Chicago where he cut Spinner Script and Spinner Script No. 2, and some sizes of Inclined Program. He cut a minion size map font for the Illinois Type Foundry, and eventually started the Graham type foundry, primarily cutting borders and ornaments, which were highly successful.\n\n",
