Apparently they had a concept of fonts as a form of computer virus.   \n   \nSo they created a ton of fonts, some really quite nice and original and named them absolutely vulgar names is Swedish so all the hip NYC art directors were specing out fonts names after genetalia etc . . .   \n   \nFunky? I'd say . . .   \n   \n:D\n\n"

They don't feel like they're getting a square meal!\"   \n(Every time! I'm proud of myself for still never ruining the joke by answering for her.)   \n   \nJohn, what are some of the names (or should I just not ask?)\n\n"
