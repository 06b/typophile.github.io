      "content": "Easy to make but clumsy in appearance -- IMHO these letters are a product of too much DIY font making. Start with a nice Didone and infest it with ball terminals, ball swashes and balls on crossbars--we see H, I suspect A was also hit. For some reason the \"designer\" missed the beak on C and the crossbar on E. Perhaps it is available as a \"free\" font, and could be located by searching the ornamented categories. If nothing turns up, the lettering could be called \"Ballpox.\" Perhaps I am too harsh, I can see it as a descriptive title for a story about a closet -- all those balls resemble hooks for hanging clothes.  \nDon\n\n"

I could not find the font on all the usual free font sites, admittedly it could fall under any number or categories - it's such (poor) font.\n\nEach to their own I suppose, but it's not my cup of tea either!\n\n"
