Now that the merger is complete, please be kind to [Macromedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20060504203213/http:/www.macromedia.com/).\n\nFireworks is 100x better than ImageReady. So make sure you know which limb to amputate before the anesthesiologist arrives.\n\nOh, and in case it wasn’t clear, Golive is teh suk. Dreamweaver is the good one… Chop accordingly.\n\nKeep Photoshop for photo editing and Fireworks for web production. You put the PHOTO in Photoshop, now don’t make it EVERYTHINGshop.\n\nDon’t try to turn SWF into a giant PDF engine. PDF is cool and SWF is cool, but for different reasons. If the twain meet, just make sure it’s a good idea first, okay.\n\nCheers, and many happy ROIs!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/files/macrodobia.png)\n\n",
