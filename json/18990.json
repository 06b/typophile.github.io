But mostly strange shapes.\n\nHrant Papazian is an Armenian native of Lebanon, currently living in  \nLos Angeles. His perspective on written communication was formed at  \nthe crossroads of three competing visual cultures. A multimedia  \ndesigner by trade, his true love remains the black-and-white, but  \ncolorful world of non-Latin typeface design, with commissions from  \nIKEA, Unitype, UCLA, Disney, the Israel Postal Authority, and  \nLiverpool University.\n\n[http://www.montserrat.edu/galleries](http://web.archive.org/web/20100219213707/http:/www.montserrat.edu/galleries \"http://www.montserrat.edu/galleries\")\n\n\\\\\\\n\n",
