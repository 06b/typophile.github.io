  "content": "My studio is designing a number of documents for a client. The client is exhibitng at a major trade show in Europe and would like each document in a number of European languages. They will be providing us with the translations from thier European offices and we will be applying the translated copy to our layouts.   \n   \nWe are working with InDesign. Most of the translations will come back from Europe as MS Word docs.   \n   \nLanguages involved will include German, French, Spanish, Italian and Irish (Gaelic?)   \n   \nMy question(s) is what is the best option with regard to creating an accurate document. Specifically, do we need a copy of each language version of InDesign to successfuly import the word doc and retain the integrity of the copy? Or is there a translation plug in?   \n   \nObvious issues would be special characters, ligatures ...etc.   \n   \nThank you in advance for your help.\n\n",

      "content": "ALl of those languages are covered under unicode, though Gaelige coverage is spotty. Also, I'm pretty sure all of them, except Gaelige have dictionaries included in ID for hyphenation and such.   \n   \nFonts shouldn't be a problem as long as they have the required accent characters. Ligatures should sub fine if they're included in the font as well.   \n   \nThe only languages I believe the normal version of InDesign has problems with are the Middle Eastern ones that go right to left, otherwise everything should work quite well.   \n   \nCheers to Adobe for realising that people shouldn't have to pay through the nose for \"passport\" versions of ID.\n\n"
