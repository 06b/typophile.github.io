  "content": "Hello typophiles,\n\nI am doing a set of books for an Indian artist who practised between 1940’s to 1970’s, recording the events of the country through its independence, and its people in strong b/w drawings and etchings. The books are heavy on text - the main one infact runs into 40,000 words.\n\nI am looking for body text fonts that may have a ‘period’ feel about them, while being very very readable. While Mrs Eames looks like a good choice, I am debating whether it is readable enough for this amount of text. Baskerville, Garamon and Veljovic are others that I am considering.\n\nWhile on the topic, what body sans serifs would you use for a book with such extensive text.\n\nThanks in advance  \nTypefreak\n\n",
