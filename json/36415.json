Also included are the essays: _Eight Is Not Enough_ by noted typophile [Yves Peters](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Yves%20Peters) and _How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the EULA_ by typographic designer and educator [Tiffany Wardle](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Tiffany%20Wardle).\n\nContributing foundries include [Baseline Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Baseline%20Fonts), [Blue Vinyl Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Blue%20Vinyl%20Fonts), [Device Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Device%20Fonts), [E-phemera Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/E-phemera%20Fonts), [Font Brothers](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Font%20Brothers), [Handselecta](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Handselecta), [Jeremy Tankard Typography](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Jeremy%20Tankard%20Typography), [Kenn Munk](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Kenn%20Munk), [Letterhead Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Letterhead%20Fonts), [Pizzadude](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Pizzadude), [Positype](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Positype), [Process Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Process%20Type%20Foundry), [Rimmer Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Rimmer%20Type%20Foundry), [Shinntype](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Shinntype), [SparkyType](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/SparkyType), [Suitcase Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Suitcase%20Type%20Foundry), [Suomi Type Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Suomi%20Type%20Foundry), [Village](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Village), [Virus Fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Virus%20Fonts), and [Wilton Foundry](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619154303/http:/www.typophile.com/wiki/Wilton%20Foundry).\n\nAccompanying this book is a Bonus Fonts CD-ROM that contains 53 indie fonts.
