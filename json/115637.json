On the logo for Lucy's Fried Chicken by Pentagram.\n\n[Lucy's Fried Chicken](http://web.archive.org/web/20140716105015/http:/www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest/2660/).\n\nClearly may well be a custom job, or at least a customised version of an existing typeface, but I have been looking for something similar as a starting point to my own hand-lettered logo job. For inspiration purposes really!\n\nThank you.\n\n",
