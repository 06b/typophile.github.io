Recently as a project I was working on I thought it would be interesting to create a font using exclusively logo pieces. Consider this a modern day version of \"The ABCs.\" I doubt this is legal to do, but feedback would be appreciated nevertheless.   \n   \n ![spect.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017065656im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/3294.gif)\n\n",

I think you need to get permission from alot of people but - FUSE or Fontek (can't remember) someone anyway puts together sets such as this - military symbols, cartographic, commercial (visa, MC ect.) and international association logotype sets.   \n   \nThe tricky part would be in selling it - Why would any such firm or designer need these logos? whats the motivation? either they already have them as a client or they aren't needing them.\n\n"

It was more of a personal challenge to see whether or not I could replace all of the characters of the alphabet with readily identifiable trademarks.

Capitalis Pirata is pretty close, but some letters and numbers are obscure to me.   \n   \nNeedless to say that probably it's legal until you give it away for free, or as a gift with another typeface at best.\n\n"
