  "content": "Hello,\n\nI had a flash of inspiration last night and quickly sketched a new logo for my web design company “DesignBits”. I am relatively new to logo and type design though, so I am not entirely sure how to take this design to the next step. I used to work in Photoshop a lot, but people keep telling me that Illustrator is actually better for designing logos and type. What would you suggest?\n\nThe most important thing is the actual typeface though. I need a font that resembles the one I sketched on paper. Has anybody ever seen such a font anywhere?\n\nAny help is much appreciated...\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007181616im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/logo_scan_4549.jpg)\n\n[Web Design Hamburg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007181616/http:/www.designbits.de/)\n\n [‹ Steinbach Logos Revisited](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007181616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41587 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo Critique for a Carpenter's Brand ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007181616/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41516 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You do need size versatility.\n\nBut for your scratch I would suggest you draw your own logo without any font, because you’ll have to tweak it’s vectors anyway and I can see the subtleties of these letters that give it a special character.\n\nAnd it shouldn’t be too complicated. Based on your sketch. Quite squarish style with a bit “fat” strokes that look a bit pumped up.\n\nIf you know how to use Photoshop I suggest you try learning Illustrator for its similar UI. But before that read about the differences between bitmap and vector graphics to justify why you need to make it in vector based program.\n\n"

First, between the ’bits’ and the boxes they are on, and then between the boxes and the word ’design’.\n\nSecondly, do you need a gap between the blocks? It’s still reading as Bi ts.\n\nFinally, maybe try going with a small-cap face for the BITS part set at the same size as the x-height of ’design’ (which would be the default if you happen to have a true small caps version of this typeface).
