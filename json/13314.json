I think the original font this was based on is Marker Felt Wide, designed in 1992 by Pat Snyder (samples [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111041718/http:/bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg24.html) in the Script Font ID Guide). Bert’s sample has all the same earmarks, and it’s a free font. Wichita was designed in 1994 according to [Identifont’s information](http://web.archive.org/web/20051111041718/http:/www.identifont.com/show?DJ0).\n\nSo if anything, there are two ‘winners’. Take your pick.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
