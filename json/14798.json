You would be given proper credit, and would be granted limited rights to use the work for your own personal/promotional use.\n\nThanks guys!\n\n_(Please, serious professional inquiries only)_\n\n [‹ help with translating a few terms, please](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030741/http:/typophile.com/node/14727 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Blatant Plagiarism / Infringment ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080111030741/http:/typophile.com/node/13977 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
