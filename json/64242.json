  "content": "I just started working on a typeface for personal use and I want to design it work at a specific point size (11 pts to be exact). For this specific type project, it doesn't matter to me if it works at any other point or if it works in print, just on screen at 11pts.\n\nWith that in mind, how should I get started? I've been playing with UPM and different cap, x, ascender and descender heights in Fontlab but I haven't been able to settle on the right starting point. I guess my big question is, how would you get started on a project like this and what should I keep in mind to optimize a font for one really specific situation like this?\n\n",

      "content": "Andreas, as long as the dpi is fixed a  \ngiven point size maps to a specific PPEM.\n\nWindows can change the dpi (although it's very  \nrarely actually done). Can MacOS do that now?\n\n\\> set grid step to 256/11\n\n1)What about systems that assume an EM of 1000?  \nAre those safe to ignore these days?\n\n2) Since that's not a whole number, doesn't it all  \nend up looking blurry?\n\n--\n\nBTW, my view of good vertical proportions for an 11 PPEM font are:\n\nx: 7  \nascenders: 9  \ndescenders: -2  \ncaps: 8  \nlining nums: 8  \nOS\\* nums: 7\n\nIf you want a smaller x-height you can go to 6, but then I'd leave the  \nrest the same (in fact that makes the ascenders nicely longer than  \nthe descenders - a good thing).\n\n\\* No room for hybrids. :-(\n\nhhp\n\n"

It's just that on a higher-dpi display the pixels are smaller; so we're not (or rather, we shouldn't be) talking about actual height in inches. That's why it's less confusing to use \"PPEM\" instead of \"point size\".\n\nhhp\n\n"
