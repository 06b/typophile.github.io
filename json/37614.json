I’ll have to try that.\n\nAlso, thank you to you chief. I’m picking up the Disney connotations a little myself, now that you mention it. I was going more through process. They are just little scraps of paper that I have scanned in.\n\nI guess I could say that I am going for a handmade look that implies grittiness. Not excessively grungy but handmade. Photojournalism and concert photography seem to have that feeling in common.\n\nI am liking the first one that I posted and I’m trying to take that further. Maybe it’s the typeface that connotes Disney-esque.\n\nHere is another variation. I think everything works together a little better and I’m going to polish it a little more but look at it and let me know what you think.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115545im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/Picture-1_6004.gif)\n\n"

I might recommend [Mustardo](http://web.archive.org/web/20080118115545/http:/www.fountain.nu/catalogue/mustardo.asp) as an option. The C alone makes an interesting camera shape in that font and could nest the h within it as if it were the film inside.\n\nSharon\n\n"

I would print out your Base-“Buttontext”, draw the boxes around them with a pen (just like thrown down) live on paper. Scan the output and evaluate if this experiment works OR not.\n\nHappy sketching ;)\n\n"

I also believe that they are appropriate to the concept.\n\nPoms, I’m glad someone understands what I’m going for. I guess I am pretty good at drawing boxes because none of that is vector. Everything was printed out, cut up, and scanned in to make a bitmap. I think it doesn’t look “free” enough because I just took a Sharpie to the edge of the cut out.\n\nHere are some images of the same design but different variations.

Now, perhaps it’s a bit cliche, given the cut-up jerky ’in the heat of the battle’ bumpers that nearly every newsoutlet uses on TV, but I don’t think we need to eliminate the idea completely. I think it might be worth pushing your idea bit further with some more sketches. As for your last round, I think the randomness isn’t quite random enough.\n\nThat said, timd has a point that I think holds true in general for most artists...artists make art, it’s the art that really should be the main focus. As such, sometimes the best logo for an artist is a simple typeface set on one line.\n\n"

What “in the heat of the battle” bumpers are you talking about? I didn’t even think to do research on news show logotypes. I try to avoid one cliche and end up with another one.\n\nI get where you guys are coming from about a simple typeface set on one line but I honestly can’t bring myself to do it. Not only am I compelled to rebel against that but the name is just too long for one line.\n\nI will get back to the sketchbook and refine. I’ll get a new post on here in a few days but I would love to hear any other comments on this particular subject.\n\nTake care.\n\n"
