Then translate it into a typographic poster. No restrictions in regards to that. The picture had to do with robots and felt very futuristic.\n\n",

It's probably more down to 'unknown' or 'different' since examples like the new alphabet and OCR-A are horribly outdated, and the tech that required the letterforms the way they are doesn't even exist any more.\n\nIt's not really as a comment, (and I don't want to hijack your thread !) but I find it quite interesting since, well how new are those forms ? One of my lecturers for type design had once shown examples of old foundry type with almost the same abstraction, as what the OCR and New Alphabet had (although they were of course, designed that way for different reasons) So such shapes have always been around in minds, although less in use.\n\nThis all aside, it's always a safe bet to go for futuristic type, cliches are there to use and play around with. And with at least one solid 'this is the future' primer in your design, you can play around more with the other aspects of the poster, making them less strict future-like.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>I think futuristic posters can be done with any typeface\n\nThis seems to be an interesting topic. I believe two opposing forces might exist if you want to make something to convey two kinds of future. The opposition should stand between humanist and non-humanist types. Why is that? It has to do with the two generally conveyed futures of utopia and dystopia. Or, to explain better, of anarchy and autocracy.  \nWhat do I mean by this? Well, essencially, in autocratic governments it's more regular to see rigid and geometrically conceived typefaces, as well as architecture. Or at least it is that way conceived.  \nMore calligraphic or humanist types are related to decadent periods (symbolic decadence), when a more broader knowledge has been acquired about a subject, period which is bound to cease it's existence.  \nI don't know if I'm fully explaining myself, but a historical overview might turn some light on this subject.\n\nAncient Rome was definitely an autocratic government. And although typographical records for this period lacked rules, it's renaissance counterpart did, and renaissance was a period used by the catholic church to dignify itself.  \nMore callygraphic records from the mannerist and pre-mannerist periods, derived from carolingian type, are more closely related to utopias, and to 'Utopia', by Thomas Moore.\n\nOnce again, the Neoclassical/Romantic period were widely used to promote politics and governents, and didones are due to this time. But realist and expressionist types are very much more calligraphic, or perhaps less refined.\n\nHitlerian domination were recurrent with their very structural blackletter opposed for a time humanist (more concretely roman) typefaces, when art deco thrived.\n\nAnd struturalism, gestalt and bauhaus promoted a neutral, or geometric type, for international use, without personality, much to the likings of '1974'.\n\nIn the days we live, affected by today's general crisis, we once again prefer humanist types and faces, full of their own inconsistencies that themselves make type beautiful.\n\nIt therefore seems natural when imperial future calls for it, to use types related in closeness to those of the sixties, due to the prevalence of sans in light-bound systems (computers and monitors) against serifs in print, and geometrical sorts that we all relate to 'future'.  \nA big problem with typography, as well as with every other arts, is that we usually apply our own time set ideals to different times and eras, which might easily find them obsolete or erroneous. Citing Robert Bringhurst in my own words (and I don't particularly fully agree with this specific point of view, but it seems to apply for this), type doesn't evolve, it changes throughout time.\n\n"
