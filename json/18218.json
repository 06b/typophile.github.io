  "content": "Good evening.\n\nI am a first semester Design student from Mexico looking for visual reference for late 19th century types and letterform designs.\n\nI was fortunate enough to find some good listings (and samples of the most popular ones like Kismet and Nymphic) by John F. Cumming, Hermann Ihlenburg and from the Mackellar Smiths & Jordan foundry. On the latter I was particularly pleased to find this web site ( [http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/mackellar/](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204541/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/mackellar/ \"http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/mackellar/\") ) which list a good number of types featured in the “The Compact Book of Specimens”.\n\nNow my problem is that I have yet to find any sort of on-line visual reference for a lot of these, as some don’t seem to have been digitalized yet (to my knowledge). I found quite a few ’variations’ though but not much examples of the originals.\n\nSeeing as this is a good place to ask for assistance I humbly request any sort of URL with data or images of letterforms and typefaces from that period, as I will be trying to list them for part of a presentation by image example, name, year of patent and designer.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n [‹ Exposures](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204541/http:/typophile.com/node/18197 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) \"Hello World\" WorldClass Script - Bickham Script {Steven} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204541/http:/typophile.com/node/17987 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

The Cary Library at RIT has an archive of personal files of his, including sketches of unpublished work. But I don’t think any of that is online. There was also a nice article by David Pankow on Ihlenburg’s work that appeared in “The Ampersand” vol 13 number 3-4, Fall/Winter 1993-94.\n\nI don’t know if that helps any.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

      "content": "My suggestion is to use some of the font sites that allow searching by keywords, such as MyFonts.com, and use terms like ’19th century’, Art Nouveau. Victorian, Old West, Antique and see what you find. There are many designers/digitizers, like Dan Solo, Nick Curtis, Jim Spiece, [George Williams](http://web.archive.org/web/20080120204541/http:/freefonts.fateback.com/george_williams/), David Nalle and others who have mined the 19th century for many designs. The problem is that only some of them are good about documenting the sources.\n\nIf you have some good books, such as the Dover book by Ludwig Petzendorfer called ’Treasury of Authentic Art Nouveau Alphabets’, then it is usually pretty easy to correlate the fonts to their original typefaces.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
