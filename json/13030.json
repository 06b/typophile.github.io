What is the value of glyphs like the Grave, Tilde, Acute, etc. when modern typesetting tools feature glyphs like Agrave, Atilde, and Aacute?\n\nI’ve read that designing the individual “accent” glyphs for the purpose of generating all relevant “accented” glyphs is a timesaving strategy inside Fontlab. But, aside from that, why bother designing the individual “accent” glyphs at all? Does anyone really use them anymore?\n\nTyler\n\n",

Sorry for not really answering your question, but I do hope better informed people will say something.\n\nAlso, these accent glyphs are easily available from most keyboards ^`´~¨ and you don’t want to leave users wondering why it doesn’t work on your font but does on others…\n\n"
