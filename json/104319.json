According to the Novo Typo philosophy: we deliver the bricks; the designer is building the house...  \nThe characterset (basic Latin) is complete and sufficient for display use, we also added a set of arrows and even a Rupee sign. We are offering the possibility to design extra characters or customize Guru to your needs.  \nWe invite all designers to send pics with all our typefaces in use.
