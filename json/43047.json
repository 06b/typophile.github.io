It's an experiment to see if the extra traffic, this will generate, will pay off in more people buying the 'outer' weights. And yes there are lots of freeloaders and yes there are certainly people who buy Museo :-) Time will tell.\n\n"

The best model is Storm Foundry, whose pricing has always been that moderate and who owe much of their success to such a policy. Or Emigre, where complete families cost $99. Every day I admire new typefaces from boutique European foundries and then gag at their prices. They think big corporations are the cutting-edge purchasers, and they're not!

And lastly I think this face looks like the kind of thing a magazine or ad agency would be keen to get their hands on at extreme weights. I could be wrong.

In their statistics numbers (for the Starlets and Best Seller lists, etc) do they count free downloads as \"sales,\" or are only the real-sales-for-money of the two priced-fonts counted?\n\nIf the free downloads don't count in these statistics, then the release method that you've chosen has been doubly effective!

I wonder though how they count sales ... Is a font family sale counted as one? I have also had a couple of multi-user sales. Is such a sale counted as one?
