  "content": "I am to be doing my first real (like, paid even) design job. My client is wanting business cards, a letterhead and some other pre-press work done. I believe the business is multimedia.   \n   \nFor his business card, he is wanting me to use Arial, because it is clean and simple etc. I think the reason for this is he either doesn't realise there are other typefaces available to purchase, (which could lend the design a distinctive quality and hint of character) or does not want to invest.   \n   \nI am scheduled to work initially for 4 hours, by the way. (this could be a squeeze \\>\\_\\< )   \n   \nSo, I am looking to some free alternatives to Arial in the mean-time. I would even rather use Helvetica. (it's just more well crafted). I also don't think he would want to go to the extra trouble of purchasing a font considering the duration of my employment.   \n   \nAlternatives anyone? Thanks   \n   \n- Chris\n\n",

Probably part of a freeware office-type program. hmm.   \n   \nYou're right Daniel. I did do a google search, but I got discouraged by the number of results. Perhaps I should have just asked for a few comprehensive free font sites. I am quite weary of wading through million hit searches for pages with thousands of possible searchs designed to just get a hit.   \n   \nSorry, I ramble.   \n   \nMany thanks Daniel. I lost the bit of paper my typography tutor gave me with all the free type sites.   \n   \n- Chris\n\n"
