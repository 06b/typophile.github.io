I think it would be more interesting to interview Mike Parker at Font Bureau (who worked with, for, and succeeded Burke) and Akira Kobayashi (who did TG Next) and make a poster out of that.\n\nAnd stay away from the idiotic Wikipedia entry that begins “Trade Gothic is a typeface which mostly follows the Bitstream version of News Gothic…”\n\n"

      "content": "Saratyp, apologies for my earlier post! Google didn't really work for me either!\n\nIt sounds like you are required to make the poster for college?\n\nI think if the poster is to be about the typeface itself, then you can look to the typeface itself for the content of your poster. Observe the qualities of the typeface, x-height, compression etc. These graphic qualities might make for a better poster than the history of the typeface as they will work at a distance. Perhaps you could combine these with some of the sources James mentioned for some close up reading.\n\n"

Trade Gothic is a sans serif in four widths, three weights, and ten sizes, a refined and expanded linecaster version of Morris Fenton Benton's great 1908/9 series Lightline and News Gothic. Jackson and the company saw it as an 'American' answer to the 'European' sans serifs, headed by Univers.\n"
