It's designed to work at both text and display sizes -- my goal is for it to be bold and interesting at large sizes but be extremely legible at small sizes while taking up the least amount of room.\n\nI currently have seven different weights, though I am also planning on doing a set of obliques (I will probably do true italic characters as alternates, or vice-versa) as well as small caps/fractions/old-style figures/other OpenType features.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161208im_/http:/typophile.com/files/roster_3421.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [roster.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161208/http:/typophile.com/files/roster_0.pdf) | 124.65 KB |\n\n",

I particularly like the smooth curves and the ink traps.\n\nOne small thing that I noticed: the outside curve on the bottom of the upper bowl of the /g/ has a bump, particularly in the roman and medium weights. The /g/ in the heavier weights has some sharp turns just to the left of that place on the joining stem.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks riccard0! Interesting about the similarity to DIN...I was actually worried about it looking too much like Trade Gothic, but I will look into keeping it distinct from both. I really don't want to be known as the guy that makes rip-off fonts! After drawing both Roster and Normandie I noticed lots of similarities with other fonts, which I guess isn't necessarily a bad thing but I do want to make them distinct with their own stand-out characteristics.\n\nI see what you mean about the numerals -- do you recommend making them narrower? Or smaller all-together? They line up with the caps height and while I know most fonts have slightly smaller numerals I figured it worked in this case.\n\nI'll keep going on these and hopefully have a new sample up in a week or so. I didn't have as much time to work on these this week as I would have liked.\n\n"

I would advise you to compose some mock up of possible usage, print it out and see how it works.\n\n"

Are the quotation marks a touch light?—not sure about that.\n\nI think /r/ may be too wide. /2/ certainly needs narrowing.\n\nI wonder if a curved bottom to /l/ like you have needs a little overshoot—I've never thought of that before.\n\n"
