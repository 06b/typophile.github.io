      "content": "Since most people still choose a serif for text composition, the closest thing to a \"Helvetica of text faces\" is Times Roman. Times is a good, useful face that, like Helvetica, is now so ubiquitous in our visual environment it's practically invisible, and that's why you shouldn't make it your house text font.  \nHow about [ITC Stone](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015131605/http:/www.linotype.com/112295/itcstone-clan.html?gclid=CKiM462_25gCFQG7GgodwX8tcw)? The serif is dignified but not boring, and is available with small caps, old style figures, etc. There's a handsome italic, and it comes in Semibold and Bold weights.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015131605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stoneserif_4382.JPG)\n  \nThere's also a companion sans serif, which I like for text composition because it's not as rigidly geometric as many sans serifs.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015131605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stonesans_5704.JPG)\n  \nAnd if you want to get extra-friendly, there's Stone Informal, distinguished by blunted serifs, less contrast between thick and thin strokes, and a cursive-style lowercase **a** and **g** , even in the Roman.  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015131605im_/http:/typophile.com/files/stoneinformal_5967.JPG)\n\n"

Okay so the best way to go forward from here:\n\nI asked what Detail In Typography was set in because I thought it looked really great, but what do I know and Mr. Shinn says I'll get pigeon holed and I definitely do not want that to happen.\n\nI have Adobe Minion Pro (probably came with CS3 or 4) so I can definitely afford that, ITC Stone looks pretty cool and I can buy the variations individually.\n\nI'm probably going to have to wait on FF Kievit or FF Milo, seems like a good thing to bill a client for..\n\nSo the question is: what's the best way to get my hands on the licenses to better text faces? buy em' now out of (mostly empty) pocket? or wait till I get a job where the client will need a good text face and get it that way?\n\nMr. Shinn: are there any text faces that you could suggest to possibly broaden my horizon?\n\n- Scott\n\n"

      "content": "A note on ITC Stone & Sumner Stone's fonts generally:\n\nIf you're going to get ITC Stone, get it from the Stone Foundry. Be a bit thoughtful though. The sans is just a touch larger than the serif -- or maybe its the other way. The informal doesn't usually blend too well if you're using both the sans & serif. My wife designed a book using all three which worked. It had three voices, a narrative track, an expert track, and an advice to families track. Using all three successfully was uncommon enough that Sumner included it in his exhibit at the SF library.\n\nITC Stone works best at slightly larger sizes, say 11-point, and as Bill says, can be a bit spikey. It was designed when we still ran repro, shot negatives, and burned plates, so the contrast in the letterforms is fairly great.\n\nFor general text use, I like Cycles much more, again from the Stone foundry. Sumner recently lowered his prices; there are some tremendous values there. I also like Magma and SFPL. Stone print is also useful when you have to pack text into a narrow measure.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nNot to get into a pissing match with Nick, but how much you interject yourself into a design -- esp. with type choice -- depends on the text you are setting. If there is an author, their ideas and audience are paramount. If \\*you\\* want to challenge a reader, write your own book.\n\nIf it is unattributed text as in a brochure, there is likely more room for innovation in type choice.\n\n"
