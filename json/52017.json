  "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy business partner and I have come up with a new design company. This company will put emphasis on website redesign for all the businesses out there with a crummy website (large market). The redesign will echo the feel of the establishment, and be tailored on a per client basis, like it should have been done the first time. Designs will be clean, intuitive, and modern with a hand-crafted feel. NuArtisan will also handle identity, print media, and photography.\n\nWe went with the color scheme of black, white, and red as a throwback to original print medium colors, but based on a modern typeface that spans eras of type.\n\nLet me know what you think of our concept.\n\n[Austin Web Design](http://web.archive.org/web/20100723160141/http:/www.nuartisan.net/)\n\n(Aside from a concept, the logo is the only other item that has been 'fleshed out' so far)\n\nAdam\n\n",

      "content": "Quite a sophisticated logo for a primarily web company. I like it though, but it may not be appropriate.\n\nWhat I'm more interested in is: is it really possible to make business of clients that have crappy websites since they don't want to spend money on something they don't see any real potential and are present in the area just because it's trendy.\n\nI was thinking of the same business model few years ago but came up with the conclusion there may be some money but probably much more nerves and not enough persistent income.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"

I also have a sales superstar as my other half of this team.\n\nBut, we'll see how it goes.\n\nAdam\n\n"

      "content": "Don't get me wrong. I didn't want to persuade you in the opposite direction. My opinion is just that you can't really work for a long time on low budget small projects that don't give enough satisfaction. Especially because client's won't see it as something they actually REALLY need. Web medium didn't serve them so far, why would it now?\n\nAnyway. I think I missed something. If you have a good salesman, he/she'll be able to get you at least medium size projects that you can benefit from. That's why you'll probably make it. Which is good. So go for it and prove me wrong. ;)\n\nOtherwise: is there any other variation of the logo as well?  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n_Robert Koritnik_\n\n"
