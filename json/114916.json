  "content": "Hey guys, I'm a recent graduate and I've had this typeface in mind for some while now, finally got around to make some solid working prototypes of the lowercase letters. I'd like to call it sencillo, and this would be the roman or regular version of it. Any critique or feedback would be appreciated. Also I didn't take but two type classes and never really learned how to publish a typeface, was wondering if anyone had any cost effective way to do so??\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414175816im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sencillo_typeface_bw-500x297_5203.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414175816im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sencillo_typeface-500x255_4618.png)\n\n",
