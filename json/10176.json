They didn't use my entry, but the next year, they cropped out the graphic and set the headline in [one of those god awful Chinese fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054729/http:/www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=takeout&page=&nb_ppp_old=10&text=DRAGON+BOAT&nb_ppp=10&classt=alpha) that border on racist. I never even got paid for the use of my graphic.   \n   \nHmm... I don't really know where I was going with this. I guess it's good to see the use of some better brush scripts than Takeout for Asian cultural events.   \n   \n - Lex\n\n"
