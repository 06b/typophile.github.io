Since then, I usually go to your website to see what's new.  \nThe website works well, I just miss more samples of your fonts at small sizes. It will be good to see how they look on two or more paragraphs.  \nBy the way, now I'm using Andrade and Leitura in the design of a brazilian publication (I'm still working on it).\n\n"
