It's similar to Eurostile.  \nIt could be custom, but I doubt it.\n\nI've been bashing my head over this for days.  \nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Actually, most of digits and letterings for the car industry are custom. So may be it would be not so hazardous to conclude it's custom and, to me, based on Eurostile Extended Black mainly reworking counters connections.\n\n"

      "content": "> I have just discovered that Audi uses the same font for their dials.\n\nSorry but they don't look the same to me. You could easily see the differences comparing /6 counter of Alfa Romeo 4C (your second sample) and Audi RS5 one. Audi RS5's is rounder than Alfa's. But you're kind of right because as you perfectly said form the beginning, they're all very close to Eurostile Extended without definitely being it. I'm also pretty convinced you'll get no \"better\" answer than \"custom/proprietary typeface(s)\" (in the same vein as Eurostile Extended/Microgramma to me).  \nMore credit for the \"Eurostile Extended\" track: [Alfa Romeo 4c](http://web.archive.org/web/20140411212916/http:/4c.alfaromeo.com/) website is using it everywhere...\n\n"
