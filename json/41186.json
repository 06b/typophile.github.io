My tutor was talking about the fact that every letter changes, none was the same. I really can’t find anything in the library and on the internet about the designers who have done this. Please can you help me?\n\nI’m currently doing my ISTD assingment and I’m looking at graffiti right now. (maybe any suggestions about that?)\n\nThank you all!\n\n(excuse me for my poor English, I’m actually Dutch) ;)\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ We want fractions!](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221515/http:/typophile.com/node/41078 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [New Interest on Typography ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080125221515/http:/typophile.com/node/41157 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
