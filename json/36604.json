I don’t recall off-hand any instances of a serif font working well as a secondary typeface to a dominant medium-weight sans (the only ones I could imagine to recall appear in my mind to be very German) so am looking for some ideas. Any ideas are appreciated as I’m stuck in a mind-loop wanting to just use Avenir.\n\nCheers,  \nDC\n\n [‹ BorderMaker](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109100009/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36622 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Anyone know any good experimental, typographic layout designers? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071109100009/http:/www.typophile.com/node/32324 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
