Something doesn't seem entirely right.\n\nVital provides Life Services to AIDS patients. So the mark is taking the AIDS ribbon and flipping it over into a V.

Shouldn't the type, and color reflect \"care\" and \"understanding\" rather than \"corporate\" and \"cold\". I would look at other typefaces and not use all caps and I'd use a warm color. As for the ribbon why not use the accepted symbol for Aids awareness? Why do you feel you have to recreate the wheel? I bet who ever invented it in the first place would be happy to let you use it and it already has a history and an idenity.\n\n"

I don't agree with having to use the AIDS ribbon. Do all company's aimed at breast cancer have to use a pink ribbon? Or one's for teachers use an apple and books? No, it gets old and is too generic. I agree that it does pigeonhole the company, who may branch out to other things in the future and would be stuck with the ribbon sympbol. Some people may also unrightfully associate the AIDS ribbon only with the gay community and not seek the company's services.  \nI don't like the curves on the ends of some of the letters, it's not on all the letters so it kind of detracts from the overall look once you notice it.\n\n"

In spite of that, I like the mark. Perhaps the ribbons in the back could be outlines, rather than solid shapes? This will emphasize the 'V' more and play down the pretzel thing.\n\nAs for the blue, it says 'healthcare provider' to me, so that's good. But it also says 'faceless HMO'. So there's that.\n\nWhat I really don't understand is this statement: \"As for the mark, they are in a tricky position of being and AIDS services instituion but not to pigeon-hole themselves as such. Getting funding for solely AIDS is very difficult. So it’s fine balance. Hence the subversion of the AIDS ribbon.\" If their sole service is AIDS life services, how would marking them as an AIDS-only institution be putting them in a \"pigeon-hole\"? That _is_ all they do.

The lines could be just lines ( very sixties/seventies ) , or they could be ornate like on Currency or something in between. This hatching would feel warmer & would clarify the V without requiring a second color.\n\n- You could go with a second color, a green or a two blue\n\n- I wonder how an A ( the A in vitAl ) which is rounded on top would feel. I bet it would feel warmer.\n\nHere is a rough\n\n[{example}](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023121430/http:/www.eyebytes.com/vital.gif)\n\nOf course you would want the A to line up properly and I think a finer pattern would be better in the ribbon but there it is.\n\n"

      "content": "thanks for all the comments folks.\n\ndaniel: I tried again to change their mind on the color. I did talk them out of the blue, but into Blue 072u! This wasn't intentional of course. My client is 5 women who run this organizaton and during this recent meeting they grabbed my pantone book and went nuts. I thought I was doomed. But they miraculously chose the same color.\n\n72u is more of an unique color for an organization, but I am not sure it is any better than 801u. It isn't warm and perhaps even colder than the initial choice, but I guess it is earthy. They definetly want something that isn't \"the straight and narrow.\" Which is why they liked the flourescent 801 first, and why they like the indigo.\n\nGave them a few reasons as to why this may not be the way to go, but focussed on how I think this is color has a \"down emotion\" instead of something up and lively.\n\nThey did say I could recommend something else. One caveat though, the Executive Coordinator said,\"I can't stand Greens, don't like oranges or mustards, and we don't want any kind of pink.\"\n\n**So if any of you can think of something warm that isn't the above, then PLEASE let me know.**\n\nGreat ideas on the mark. And yes, they are an AIDS org but due to the rapidly evaporating AIDS funding, they need to position themselves as LIFE SERVICES for all the critically ill, with a specialty in AIDS patients I guess. So they absolutely do not want and AIDS ribbon, and that is why they were into the inverting of the AIDS ribbon concept.\n\nI told them I want to step back a bit since their deadline isn't as hard now. I am going to look into these shading ideas Eben suggested (thanks). I am also going to try and render Sim's idea as I think it is much more simple, but also more of a direct reference to the AIDS ribbon so it might not fly.\n\nI also think making it a little more 'flowy' might lighten things up a bit.\n\nNice type idea on the A.\n\nI'm going to posting my edits here in the next few days. Please stay tuned.\n\nThanks,  \nPeter.\n\n"

If there is going to be shading you might even make a small medium & large with slightly different shading to address that potential weakness in shading. Otherwise, if you are going with just one shading version - test test test.\n\nI know you want to stay away from red & pink - but - what about a cochineal? It's mexican red pink kind of color.\n\nIt does sound like they want the logo to feel like authori-tay. Indigo would be good for that. Also, the heavy contrast will look good.\n\nFlourescent 90's/emergency orange is STILL a fav of mine after all this time but I doubt they would go for it.\n\nI'm psyched to see what you come up with.\n\n"

I think if you go with verticals you will definitely need to use thicker ones - and also, I think that variable width stokes would look better - maybe even pen-like strokes with slight curves. That's what I meant by 'With difference in stroke shape that might be very cool.'. I think straight lines are not going to work.\n\nThis is going to be a really nice logo.

Right now it feels a little mechanical - It is working, but it isn't as interesting or compelling as I think it could be.\n\nI am not sure how to explain what I man - but maybe this will help. Take a dollar bill out of your pocket. Look at the side that says 'ONE' not the side with washington's portrait. Look at the Eagle in the circle on the right, To the right of it is an ornament that points to the right. See the lines that come out there? They are thicker & closer together near the eagle & they spread out & get thinner as they move away.\n\nI am suggesting that with 10 lines not 20 if you go vertically, or with 4 or 5 lines if you fallow the path of the ribbon you could shade the ribbon. I think using more than that will as you know create moire patterns.\n\nTo do it well I bet you would have to draw it by hand.\n\nI also wonder if the white lines that indicate the bends would look better if they were thicker & had thick & thin parts.\n\nProbably it would be best if I drew you what I meant, but I can't do that today.

(and I am kind of sneaking type changes under the radar at this point).\n\nI definetly will beef up the L and possibly play with rounding things a bit more (probably on the L corner).\n\nSo they liked the shading to the mark, or at least half of them did. the other half (the older ladies) thought it was too busy. I can see this. So I am going to have to achieve the same, but with less.\n\nI'll post revisions later today.\n\nYou guys have been very helpful.\n\n"
