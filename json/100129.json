  "content": "I've been looking through various fonts (primarily ones distributed by Apple), and have noticed what strikes me as an oddity but perhaps I am mistaken here.\n\nUsing Russian as an example, the regular styles of the fonts I've looked at all include 'Обычный' (or in a few cases 'Прямой') as a localized style name. This, however, appears to be invariant across faces. Shouldn't the style name agree in gender with the font name? Or is the style name considered a noun rather than an adjective?\n\nAndré\n\n",
