I’m hoping you can help this newbie!\n\nI am looking for an opentype font which is similar to Scala Sans. It must have bold versions, small caps, and old style figures. I realize that Scala has an opentype version, but the cost is prohibitive!\n\nI am using this for a publication that uses Scala, but in the next issue, I have to set many, many uncommon fractions.\n\nI’m looking at  \n [Beret](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024933/http:/www.linotype.com/91948/beret-family.html)  \nbut would love other suggestions.\n\nThank you for any help!\n\n [‹ Classy 1920's Font](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024933/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31848 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Visual distrotions in typeface, help needed ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080409024933/http:/www.typophile.com/node/31784 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
