Then I suggested graphic widening to get closer, but I know how we all hate those answers, so I was hoping someone might recognize the font.\n\nThanks, - Mike\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [gnostech.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20060821185214/http:/typophile.com/files/gnostech.gif) | 26.24 KB |\n\n",
