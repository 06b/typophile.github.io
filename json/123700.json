(read second paragraph please)\n\nI would appreciate infinitely.\n\n",

      "content": "Metric kerning relies on a typeface’s internal metric data, as determined by the typeface designer, to space letters. Optical kerning adjusts spacing based on general letter shapes. Here’s a good discussion of the two with examples, plus links to references:  \n [http://type-ed.com/2013/12/08/metrics-vs-optical/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155845/http:/type-ed.com/2013/12/08/metrics-vs-optical/ \"http://type-ed.com/2013/12/08/metrics-vs-optical/\")\n\nAlso, I found Jan Tschichold’s <cite>Treasury of Alphabets and Lettering</cite> (1932) to be a useful resource for understanding how kerning should work; his examples of uppercase and lowercase kerning are fairly straightforward. The basic principles still apply to digital type.\n\n"

The secluded provides a good explanation, gives his point of view, and causes us to provide our own discretion, but ... does not explain any independent technique to the OPTIK-KERNING button.\n\nA clear example that caught my attention is the logo of typophile (sans), can opservar the KERNING is very good, in fact I think it was done manually,  \nDoes anyone know some manual technique for correct placement KERNING on a logo to achieve similar results? (See image)\n\n[http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t566/e390781/TypophileTwitter\\_zpszbx...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317155845/http:/i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t566/e390781/TypophileTwitter_zpszbxvgfsy.png \"http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t566/e390781/TypophileTwitter\\_zpszbxvgfsy.png\")\n\nI know that the spacing is a matter of taste of the designer, but for example when writing a YELLOW word first distance is specified, then the first letter of the second are well adjusted, but all others must be set equal to have logical coherence,  \nWhat if it is done manually as you can reach a solution professional?\n\nSo the question is: Some techniques for MANUAL KERNING?  \nwords of 3 to 10 characters maximum (eg a logo, a title, a word, a header star)\n\nThis topic fascinates me a lot, but so far have found very little, hope your help me Please.\n\n"
