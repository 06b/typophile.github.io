This is the most serious of the study’s flaws, since fatal shootings of criminals occur in only a fraction of 1% of protective firearm uses nationwide.  \n———  \nBut to go in another direction, this is from Wikipedia:\n\nIn Florida, which first introduced “shall-issue” concealed carry laws, crimes committed against residents dropped markedly upon the general issuance of concealed-carry licenses, which had the unintended consequence of putting tourists in Florida driving marked rental cars at risk from criminals (since tourists may be readily presumed unarmed.) Florida responded by enacting laws prohibiting the obvious marking of rental cars. With this change, crime rates continued to fall alongside the issuance of concealed weapons licenses.  \n——————-  \nIn the end, I believe you will believe what you want to believe.  \n: )\n\n"

It is you who were not factual when you stated that FBI statistics show that more guns were used in self-defense against crime than in commiting crime.\n\nAlso you do not acknowledge your error, which makes me think you are not interested in a rational dialogue about the issue.\n\nAlso the NRA is rather notoriously biassed on these issues, so quoting them alone is not very convincing.\n\nLet us look at what Prof. Kleck actually did. He had phone surveyers ask gun owners whether they had ever used a gun in self-defense against crime. This would include waving a gun at an 8 year old child who is cutting across your lawn (trespassing). So a few cranks who are constantly waving their guns at those they imagine to be trespassers could create the large ‘self defence’ numbers Kleck reports. And it might be that a polite request would have been just as effective—and a lot more civilized—than waving a gun at someone. So it seems to me that Kleck’s numbers (from 1993!) don’t prove much of anything.\n\nThe gun control issue is not a simple one. But just quoting the NRA and ignoring problems with their supposed ‘facts’ is not going to shed any light on the issue, nor convince anybody of anything.\n\nAlso Dennis, if you act on your principle “you will believe what you want to believe,” then what is your point in posting your provocative graphics?\n\n"

Those compositions which use political, religious, or any other non-typographic texts are even more irrelevant to typographic discussions which take place on this board, (if it is possible for something to be doubly irrelevant.) Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and everyone is entitled to their art-making, but that doesn’t mean that they should bring their opinions and art to Typophile.\n\n"

Ignorance is no crime: we are all born ignorant, and we overcome it to greater or lesser degrees as we grow older. The title of this particular forum is “General Discussions,” which would seem to imply that give-and-take are the order of the day here. Persons who believe themselves to be in possession of Absolute Truth (that is, the Ignorant Militant) do not, by definition, allow much latitude for discussion: they wish to state their “considerable opinion” (thank you, William Golding) and have it affirmed, praised, perhaps even worshipped. That is **not** a discussion: it’s a sermon.\n\nPeople who think they have all the answers aren’t asking the right questions.\n\n"
