      "content": "William, it depends whether one thinks this juggernaut of warmongering can best be stopped gently or aggressively. In making this judgement one might take into account how much real effect the most recent round of US voting has had...\n\nYaron, good call posting this here. I see you've changed things around. One thing I preferred in the old one is the counter-balancing of the ordering of the languages between the main logo and the subtext; in this one I would put the Hebrew first and the Arabic second in the subtext.\n\nOtherwise though this is a nice improvement. Some suggestions:  \n1) I don't know enough about Hebrew type, but in terms of style it seems well-matched to the Arabic. The English however is too mainstream, not rigid enough; instead of Futura I'd use something like DIN, ot maybe something a little bit softer, and more contemporary, like Klavika\\*.  \n2) I would close up the gaps around the Arabic \"seen\" at the baseline - it's inappropriately unconventional this way. I think the Hebrew (and certainly the English, even if you change it to something like Klavika) is relatively conventional, no?  \n3) Considering the \"tah-marboota\" (the last letter of the first word in the Arabic) only occurs as the last letter of a word, I'd close up the wordspace, maybe even completely, or almost completely. The Hebrew and English are enjoying a nice tightness, and the Arabic could too.  \n4) By being absorbed into the Arabic \"meem\", isn't the top-left letter in the Hebrew getting lost, causing confusion? Maybe the word is clear enough thanks to context and familiarity however.  \n5) I know the Arabic font you're using in the main logo has a little bit of a readability issue, but I think you should try to use it in the subtext too - the Hebrew and English fonts are the same after all.  \n6) In the main logo, the Arabic is too strong - try shortening the ascenders.  \n7) In the subtext, the English should be a bit darker, and the wordspace greater (or maybe better: lesser in the Arabic and Hebrew).  \n8) I would right-justify the bottom two lines in the main logo (to get the two \"E\"s lined up, avoiding that distracting slight difference).\n\n\\* [http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131126113843/http:/www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html \"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html\") \\_  \nIf expense is an issue, you might get Eric to donate an EPS of your setting,  \nseeing as how it's for a good cause. But it's a great font to own too.\n\nGood luck with the effort, and I don't mean just the logo!\n\nhhp\n\n"

I think the aggressiveness that William is talking about is what, to me, makes the logo stand out. It's soaked in irony. In the U.S. especially (thanks to the media), many (ignorant) people see the Middle East as dangerous and threatening. So associating this belief with peace creates a more memorable mark. Much MUCH better than using a dove or an olive branch! ;) It's very masculine, which also sets it apart from the cliche delicate peace logos.\n\nI also agree with Nicholas - I'd love to see it spray painted on the sides of buildings and sidewalks.\n\nNice work.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> it doesn’t align in a nice way.\n\nAgreed, although alignment shouldn't be allowed to become the goal. Don't aim for perfection; not because it's unattainable, but because it's bad for you.\n\nTo me the main alignment issue is that the Arabic is too far to the right, which is exaggerated due to the descender of the \"meem\". What I would do is push the descender of the meem further out and shorten it to the bottom of the first line of Hebrew/Arabic. Going further, I'd probably move the first word in the Arabic to the left, reducing the length of overlap in the \"waaw\"-\"E\" ligation (and yes, breaking the alignment between the lefts of the \"waaw\" and \"E\").\n\n\\> the inner space of the P is not aligned with the letter.\n\nThis I don't understand.\n\n\\> i have been thinking of using different fonts for the lower part\n\nMight be a good idea, although it will be tricky to do it well.  \nFonts are like teenagers: beyond a few they become impossible to manage! :-)\n\nAnyway, I suggest focusing on the main logo first.\n\n--\n\nSomething else: I know that previously I had voiced a suspicion that merging the descender of the \"meem\" with the Yod might cause trouble, but now the Arabic and Hebrew are fully detached... That, coupled with the fact that the Hebrew and English are in such a strong embrace, I think sends a message that would echo general Arab resentment, which I'm sure is contrary to what you want.\n\nhhp\n\n"

On the other hand, most of those attempts have one serious problem or other (and in all of them the Arabic too large/dark). Number 1 is nice as an arrow, but too spread out; 2 is kind of a half-baked arrow; 3 and 5 are hard to read; 4 has great potential; 6, 7 and 8 could work, but probably not very well; 9 has potential; the rest are trying too hard, and will be pretty impossible to tame I think.\n\nNumber 4 is interesting, dynamic, edgy and balanced except for the Arabic being too strong. I would make this one work. Alternatively 9 has a more classical feel, if you don't mind the centrality of the English (and the somewhat Arabic motif of the diamond). If you go with 9 you need to make the diamond equal-sided (right now it's rectangular) by shortening the top-left and bottom-right sides or lengthening the other two sides\\*. In the former case the bottom-right is easy (just shorten the alif and lam - the first two letters in the second Arabic word) and the top-left has some room in the last letter of the Hebrew. In the latter case you can easily place a tatweel (apparently a better term than kashida) after the \"seen\" but I'm not sure how best to lengthen the first word of the Hebrew (maybe by over-shooting the last letter outside the diamond, which might actually be a nice match to the Arabic \"meem\" which is already doing that).\n\n\\* Or a combination of both.\n\nAll that said, are you sure you want to give up on your previous attempts?\n\n\\> with the English and Hebrew words for core at the core.\n\nNo concern for the Arabic? You could at least wonder  \nout loud which of the two Arabic words is the \"core\".\n\nIn fact in 14 the Arabic reads out of order.\n\n\\> I just worry that it might be too complex\n\nSounds familiar. :-)\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "\\>which of the two Arabic words\n\nI assumed it was the bottom right, which puts it not as much at the core, which is a weakness in the design; I don't know how much.\n\nThe English words are appropriate because the English and then the Americans have been key power players over the past century, along with the Arabs and the Jews. And all three will have to play a part to create peace--may it come soon.\n\nHrant, I do think simplicity is generally a virtue in logos. You disagree?\n\n"

My wild guess is it's because they have something to gain (at the expense of others). The Jews are Arabs are the two protagonists here, the ones with life, land and dignity to worry about (as much as the West plays favorites so heavily). The reason to have English in the logo is mostly due to the fact that it's currently the lingua franca of the world.\n\nSimplicity: I think it has a role to play, but too often it becomes a goal in its own right, harming the actual effectiveness of things. More than something you read, a logo is a shape you observe and memorize. In this case for example it might make great sense to have the English carry the burden of legibility while getting the Hebrew and Arabic to make the logo attractive and memorable. This happens to be something 9 does very well.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Also with your comment about the others being hard to 'tame' I think we are of the same mind on this. There is a problem about the English in 9 not quite working visually.
