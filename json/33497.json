I suggested a few, she came back with\n\nFreebooter - [http://www.dafont.com/freebooter-script.font](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013222312/http:/www.dafont.com/freebooter-script.font \"http://www.dafont.com/freebooter-script.font\")\n\nI want to suggest to her a more professional version of this. This feels pretty cheap.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n",
