Monday's Guardian might not be on the same stock.  \nThere is also the claustrophobic feel of a massive x height with too little leading.

A bit like Cartier, eh?  \nPerhaps the serifs could have been a bit narrower, in the headline fonts, for a slightly closer fit, given the tightness of the layouts and the small wordspace.\n\nI find the G2 section is too small in size. There is a problem that with the smaller formats and the larger pictures, the fancy colors and light weights, that the paper loses gravitas. This is particularly evident when you have one story dominating a page and it's got a big stock photo -- that ain't news! Looks more like a cheap magazine: but that is something that the facility to put big colour pictures everywhere sucks you into, and unique to the Guardian.\n\nThe big double-page photo spread every day is brilliant.\n\nOverall, I am still concerned that a serious anti-establishment paper should carry some clout. The Guardian was big and tough, but now it is proud to leave behind that daunting presence (as charged by focus groups, no doubt) to be friendlier -- smaller, prettier. I have the same problem with the little Independent and its frilly Century heads. Easy to discount.\n\nPlease tell me I'm wrong, and that these toy dogs barking at the powers that be will not be contemptuously kicked aside.\n\n"

In fact, what's happened with newspaper design in the years since the Guardian's previous makeover is really quite amazing, now that so many papers have comissioned their own typefaces.\n\n"

If we concede that the design can be improved then two obstructions have to be overcome time is the major constricting factor, closely followed by cost – the market share for newspapers has been reduced by newer, more instant, cheaper and generally easier\\* media.\n\n\\*By easier, I mean why bother reading a newspaper when a man or woman in a suit will read it for you in the corner of your living room.\n\nThe technologies involved in newspaper production – printing (colour, inks), layout software, paper manufacture etc. have all improved in terms of speed and quality and this is clearly the case compared to a decade ago.\n\nNewspaper's budgets are mainly allocated to the content (the reporting) and production. Since even media barons cannot expand time, cost is the only area that can be squeezed, so, for example, there is a limit to the amount of non-printed space, the remaining number of employees have to be able to produce the product.\n\nTo sum up, if the paper is to survive, it cannot afford to lose its loyal readers, who want the content and will not pay (much) more, and the consumables and wage bill keep a constant then something has to give and that casualty is design. I don't envy anyone trying to redesign a newspaper within these constraints.\n\nTim\n\n"
