'But the truth is that when we look at   \nanother person, we are only looking for defects.   \nWe try to discover his wicked side because we want him   \nto be worse than us. We never forgive him when he hurts   \nus because we do not believe that we would ever be   \nforgiven. We manage to wound him with harsh words,   \ndeclaring that we are telling the truth, when all we are   \ndoing is trying to hide it from ourselves.   \nWe pretend that we are important so that no one else   \nwill see how fragile we are. That is why whenever you   \njudge your brother, be aware that you are the one   \nwho is on trial.'\n\n"
