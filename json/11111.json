The only other letter to double in Spanish is the \"r\" - but that doesn't get its own slot for some reason - maybe because the double-el is (or at least can be) pronounced quite differently that just two els. The third very common letter-pair in Spanish is the \"ch\" (which normally gets its own slot in most dictionaries and such, I believe), and that also has its own sound, but maybe doesn't get an alphabetic slot because it's made up of two different letters? Language is like women.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

I have already started using the font on my webpage and in my flash applications, but I would like to see it used more. However, I would not like to see it go the way of some of my flash games which have (for want of a better word) been stolen and used on other sites without my permission (I have learnt to safe-guard my flash work, but fonts are not so easy).   \nComments welcome.   \nMatthew Brown\n\n"
