(I don't use \"anti-Semitic\" here because Arabs are Semites too. BTW, Hitler _was_ anti-Semitic: he hated Arabs too.)   \n   \n\\>\\> \"vast jewish conspiracy\"   \n   \nI wouldn't call it that.   \n1) It's not that vast. Armin for example hasn't been given \"The Talk\", apparently - but he's from Mexico.   \n2) \"Conspiracy\" seems to me to mean there is intent to hurt others. In this case I think there isn't. But the duplicity is still there. As with any form of propaganda. And everybody does it. It's just more offensive when the people doing it are the ones already in power.   \n   \nIt's not a matter of respecting a symbol (like you say, they don't deserve any such emotions), it's a matter of respecting your fellow people, and cultures - of not beating them to a pulp when they're already lying unconscious on the ground. \"Pressing need\"? To salvage the Swastika, not really. To salvage blackletter, a little bit, yes, although nothing like the pressing need to curb the modern-day Nazis - and I don't mean those impotent neo-Nazis, I mean the Axis of Evil: US, Israel, Turkey. That's proof right there that religion isn't the root of the problem, since the three major religions of the world are apparently united against humane living! :-/   \n   \nSo I'm not saying that the Jews should let go of the Swastika while others continue using it against them (as William pointed out - even though the Nazis are gone while Israel is currently messing up the Middle East - so it's different), I'm saying that there has to be less greed -and more honesty- in using it. We don't want another Holocaust, so back off - it's pretty simple. The world doesn't want you dead, they just want to live happy lives themselves - don't be paranoid to point of becoming Hitler yourselves.   \n   \n--   \n   \nDavid, Matha doesn't want to answer you question - get over it. If you think a person can't have a rational discussion about the Swastika without having read those books, show us why.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
