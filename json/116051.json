  "content": "I'm working on a template for an InDesign document that will use a lot of footnotes, and I'm having an issue getting the OpenType superscript feature to actually work. I'm using InDesign CS6, and the typeface is Nimbus Sans Novus (the cut from URW). I see that OpenType superscript works fine in Minion Pro in my document, but I have to manually select numbers from the glyphs palette to get it work with Nimbus or Helvetica Neue, so I assume its a problem in the way the OpenType font is programmed. Is there a decent workaround for this? I've requested fixes to OpenType fonts from other foundries but I'm not sure this is even possible for this project, since I'm dealing with a corporate font choice that is part of their enterprise software solution, and the fonts are served up via the Universal Type Server, making it not just an issue on my end.\n\nThe template will eventually be turned over to the production department, so I'd like a simple fix if possible (the big issue here is that the superscript numbers go to greek onscreen because they are so small when viewed at fit to page, on top of being optically ugly due to scaling).\n\nThanks!\n\n",

You could also use character styles to make a regular number in the same font look like superscript (small size, baseline shift, etc.)\n\n\\> The template will eventually be turned  \n\\> over to the production department\n\nWorkarounds always make me nervous when different people work on a job. One trick is so temporarily make the character style a different color, like red, so it stands out and you can see if it was applied properly, then change it back to the proper color.\n\n"

      "content": "Of course they work. If you pull them into the file, via the glyph pallet being one way, ink will eventually flow and all will see. What you mean is their placement is not automated via the routine you usually use.\n\nI suspect the superscripts you're using are not a stylistic variation of one, two, three, but true superiors, which have a different Unicode number. When you write 6.2 x 10^4, you don't want that changing to 6.2 x 104.\n\nWhich means you could enter them directly via the keyboard. And also means they <cite>may</cite> disappear (into .notdef characters) should someone get a hold of your file and change the font, say for reading the text.\n\nThere are lots of URW Nimbus Sans Novus fonts out there, some for free, some cost, like from Myfonts. [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans-novus/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803032730/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans-novus/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans-novus/\") Without actually having the software (aka \"font\" in this case) to see, there is no way of examining the specific OpenType features someone wrote. That's where any automation takes place. And since it's a customer's font that can't be changed, you'll want to be real careful what solution you eventually pick. I know Murphys' dictum was shorthand for \"mean time before failure,\" but the conventional, sadly humorous meaning can wind up applying, too.\n\n"

Which means you could enter them directly via the keyboard.\n\nTrue in general, and the route I prefer to take for math, but unfortunately InDesign's Footnote Options do not allow arbitrary characters (which they are, as far as ID is concerned) to be used as automatic footnote markers.\n\nAnother point down for ID's Footnote Options, which may well bear the tag line \"Proudly Unchanged Since Original Inception\".\n\n"

      "content": "Theunis, yes, you're right. There is more than one way to do footnotes in InDesign, of course...\n\nFor the workflow in our shop, the ID function \"Superiors/Superscripts\" is rigged, in the font (when allowed), to use an **alternate** number/letter sequence, as defined in the features. As alternate glyphs, there are no Unicode assignments made, and names are something like \"one.super\" and \"a.super.\" If the file winds up in a PostSctript environment, the period and everything thereafter drops out, so the base characters are left. On the other hand, when we need a superior or inferior number for mathematical or chemical nomenclature, they will be the superiors/inferiors that have a Unicode assignment, and must be entered from the keyboard.\n\nNot perfect, but at least one more or less viable compromise.\n\nThen you hit the \"what to do\" wall again when preparing ePUB files, allowing for superior presentation when the fonts are embedded, but still working acceptably when the reader makes a font change. And bear in mind that in practice these days, both ePUB and XML are often prepared from a pdf. Labor is cheap in India, and inexpensive handwork is usually more cost effective than creating and implementing a programmatic solution...\n\n"

If the font designer added correctly drawn superscript digits, it's only a matter of adding the right _feature_ code to the font to add this feature to OpenType-sensitive software.\n\nProfessional software such as DTL FontMaster even allows \"templates\" of standard font features to be applied to entire fonts, no further action needed (as I understand it from [Frank Blokland's regular updates](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803032730/http:/www.typophile.com/node/107315)).\n\nIt's possible you have an older version of your font so you might want to inquire at URW (or your regular font supplier). And if they tell you, \"no we don't do that\" -- point them towards this discussion!\n\n"

I will definitely look into it though.\n\n"
