  "content": "Hi,\n\nI am not sure if this is the right location to ask this, but feel free to move it if it isn't. I specifically need a type 1 font which can be distributed and is royalty free. Do such things exist? I know OTF and TTF have these but I seem to be coming up short with this specific type. I work on the FOP project and need to validate the CharString data from the original against that of a subset which is the feature I'm adding.\n\nIf anyone knows of any and where I can find one that would be great.\n\nThanks in advance\n\n",
