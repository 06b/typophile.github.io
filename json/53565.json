  "content": "Here is a logo and some preliminary designs for stationery for a company providing high class programme for companies, events etc. The companys main focus is in performing arts and especially dance.\n\nThe idea is to silkscreen-print the business card in white to black cardboard. The letterhead is black on the other side with reflected logo (which can be faintly seen on the other side).\n\nThe logo is based on avant garde and the idea is to communicate professionalism and to separate the company from the others in the field.\n\nAny comments are welcome!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020190439im_/http:/typophile.com/files/movingarts_4608.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [movingarts.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020190439/http:/typophile.com/files/movingarts.jpg) | 26.25 KB |\n\n",
