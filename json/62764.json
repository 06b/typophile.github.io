  "content": "Hello World!\n\nthis blog has started! It meant to be a blog for multilingual writers.  \n [Tastaturaufkleber](http://web.archive.org/) is a German word that people use to describe stickers that are used for multilingual tipping.  \nIt’s all about the smallest efforts for maximal results. I want to share my experience and also see which experience other people already have with that type of a solution.  \nI have also started a blog [http://www.aufklebertastatur.de](http://web.archive.org/web/20091123164956/http:/www.aufklebertastatur.de/ \"http://www.aufklebertastatur.de\") to see how people handle this problem of bilingual computer use.  \nI’m also wondering if there are any different fonts on keyboard stickers. Does somebody know this?  \nI’ll be pleased to read your comments!\n\n",
