  "content": "just a quick question. For a simple book design i am obliged to use times. I think Plantin would be a subtly better option. Is this just my opinion (caused by the over-use of times?) or do i actually get the thing right for once? The book needs a regular, an italic and a bold italic (possibly also smallcaps) in 10pt.\n\nthanks for your response.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Afbeelding 1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621165201/http:/typophile.com/files/Afbeelding%201.pdf) | 38.35 KB |\n\n",

I think it has a little more character, and its sturdy serifs and color make it more comfortable for reading. Times is another face that looks spiky in digital format. Get the size and leading right and Plantin will look classic. The advantage you have is that they are similar in proportion, and few laypersons will know the difference.\n\n"

The vast majority of people do not notice that it is a different typeface, but Aldine 721 has a slightly darker, more pleasant color.</cite>\n\n"

The font was published by Monotype as EF Times Modern. The font was designed by Research Studios, led by Ben Preston, Deputy Editor of The Times, in partnership with Neville Brody, former art director of The Face, and lead designer on Actuel, City Limits and Arena magazines. The design team included Ben Preston, David Driver, Mike Prowse, Chris Davalle, Kathleen Wyatt Research Studios: Neville Brody, Jon Hill, Luke Prowse.\"\n\nSince Dux = Luke Prowse [drew Times Modern](http://web.archive.org/web/20130621165201/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29521) he was evidently indulging in a bit of wry inside humor that I totally didn't get last night.\n\n"

It’s a very dull-looking face, and not the sort of thing most people want to stare at for long stretches of time. And the italic is sort of ugly.\n\nI can't agree with that. Times is a fine face for books. It is extremely readable (in the right size, measure, margins and leading). And ugliness of the italics is a designers opinion (with which I fail to agree). Many, many books (generally 20 years or more ago) were set in it, and I have never heard of people having trouble reading it \"for long stretches of time.\"\n\nAll that said, I will agree that the font is overused, and therefore would not use it unless forced to somehow. But it is not a poor font based on other merits.\n\n"

Do not decide against Times or any other typeface because it is overused. Choose typefaces that are right for the project. That's the only criterion.\n\npowers\n\n"

It's the only one with OSFs, as far as I know. But that's if you have to use Times at all; it is, after all, the most over-exposed typeface on earth now.\n\nThe problem with Plantin is choosing between the light weight, which is too light for reliable use under 11 pt, or the regular weight, which is a little too black and clumps up. But I love the look and proportions for Plantin and always have. Depends on your point size and the paper. Plantin Light works with smooth or coated stock but not below 11pt. The toothier the stock the better the regular weight looks.\n\nBe sure to buy your OpenType Plantin from Monotype...they have OSFs; Adobe's OT does not.\n\n"
