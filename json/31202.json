The lower case lettering is quite similar to Mark Simonson’s [Felt Tip Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20070403191936/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/felt-tip-roman/), but not identical. Brian Willson’s [Oak Street](http://web.archive.org/web/20070403191936/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/3ip/oak-street/) also has a very similar feel.\n\nThose were the closest I found in the Script Font ID Guide.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
