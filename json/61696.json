      "content": "This is a tricky question. Volume One of B.S. Naik's _Typography of Devanagari_ has a few pages of specimen of old metal Devanagari faces, but this is probably not what you are looking for. I am guessing that you want digital fonts. I am not aware of a published book that can help you. There are a few PDFs from University of Reading graduates that could help you out (including my own) but these aren't published anywhere yet.\n\nIndic font foundries have PDF catalogs that you can download. Here is one listing C-DAC's Devanagari typefaces – [http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/type/Devanagari.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201050720/http:/www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/type/Devanagari.pdf \"http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/type/Devanagari.pdf\")\n\n(More on this page… [http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/typeface.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201050720/http:/www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/typeface.asp \"http://www.cdac.in/html/gist/down/typeface.asp\"))\n\nThen there is Modular Infotech.
