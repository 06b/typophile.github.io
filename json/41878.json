  "content": "A sub-genre of [blackletter](http://web.archive.org/web/20130829041552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/blackletter) scripts. Like all blackletter and humanist scripts, this evolved over the Middle Ages from [Carolingian miniscules](http://web.archive.org/web/20130829041552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Carolingian%20miniscules). The main characteristic is that of rounded letterforms, or rather curves that are broken os less places than other blackletters. It does not have the strict vertical stress of the [textura](http://web.archive.org/web/20130829041552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/textura) style of blackletter.\n\nRotunda letters, also called _Rundgotisch_ in German, were more popular in Southern Europe as printing was inaugurated, whereas the textura and the [bastarda](http://web.archive.org/web/20130829041552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/bastarda) seemed to dominate Northern Europe.\n\n**Popular Rotunda Typefaces**  \n [Wallau](http://web.archive.org/web/20130829041552/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Wallau)  \nWeiss Rundgotisch\n\n",
