[Meta](http://web.archive.org/web/20050826165644/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/ff-meta/bold-roman/testdrive.html?s=Wallpaper&p=72) has shapes that are so close to this, that your idea of a re-worked Meta is probably a very good bet. As I said, it isn't Amplitude - look also at the tops of the stems, which are different.\n\n"
