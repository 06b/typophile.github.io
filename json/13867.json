Im looking for some really cool type t-shirt to fill up my empty closet.\n\nDo you know if typophile has some or maybe some of you are seeling your designs?\n\nThanks kindreds\n\nMark\n\n [‹ where to find free chinese fonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906154633/http:/typophile.com/node/13874 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [The Day that Gutenberg Died: Anybody have a transcript/video/audio from TypeCon 04? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906154633/http:/typophile.com/node/13847 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
