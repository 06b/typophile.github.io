  "content": "{From Bauhaus to Your House}   \n   \nHas anyone read this book? What are your thoughts?   \nAlthough I still think the world of the Bauhaus greats in general, the book offers a very convincing \"other side of the story\". The book seems to kind of make the point that in trying to \"start from zero\" they ended up with zero.   \n   \nAre there other books anyone knows of off-hand dealing with the negative aspects of bauhaus?\n\n",

      "content": "Not exactly the response I was hoping for.   \nWolfe starts off comparing it to the Vienna Secession, how they both had their own singular building, which was the center for the \"compound\" out of which all the rules and ideas came from.   \n   \nHis main critique is that it became so important and so highly regarded that an attempt at anything else was considered \"bourgeois\", and almost even spiritually wrong. (The book makes many religious references.) Another main point is how clients didn't ever actually like the designs they were paying for, but kept paying for them anyways, allowing the designers/architects to dictate to them what was good and bad.   \n   \nIt deals mostly with architecture, rather than type or any other art, but certainly the applications can be made. It talks about how even Philip Johnson used to like to be called \"Mies van der Johnson\" and that even the architects who realized the flaw of everything looking \"bauhaus\" had to become part of the system in order to be taken seriously and still move away from it (Robert Venturi.)   \n   \nIt has a really striking picure that I hadn't seen before of one section of Yale (a museum I think) which was done in gothic revival, next to an addition in bauhaus style, and it looks rather pathethic, even though it is \"simple\" and \"clean\" which is still how people like to describe \"good\" design, and think that if they say, \"this is good because it is simple\" that they are automatically justified.   \nAnd here's a random thought; I really hope the new WTC design isn't just another \"glass box\" but is instead something really creative. If we keep rebuilding mimics of the past we aren't really making much progress. (Maybe this relates to redoing old typefaces?)   \nAnyhow, good book. Would like to read others like it.\n\n"

But this building designed by Kahn is certainly not 'pathetic'. IIRC, it has some great (complex) ceiling devices for natural lighting (it's a museum) in the intern spaces. The building is only apparently simple. And Kahn is far from the Bauhaus style, he was [not](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Institute_of_Public_Admin.html) a 'modernist'.   \n   \n\\> If we keep rebuilding mimics of the past we aren't really making much progress.   \n   \nOf course, completely agreed.

The contributions of Bauhaus to architecture are mostly exclusively related to architeture. And, FWIW, I think Bauhaus was more important to architecture than to typography...   \n   \n   \n   \nGerald:   \n\\> I don't tell people how to think.

Tschichold could do it well, and could also do classical typography well, and his realisation was that in the latter it was easier for the average craftsman to achieve an attractive result. Only a handful of people produced really good modernist typography: more of it was sterile.

In fact, Paul Klee has been my favorite artist for quite some time, and I like what Peter Behrens for example did with sans, but mainly just because of when he did it.   \n  \nAfter looking through several sites, it seems to me that Kahn's work does highly resemble the Bauhaus, even though he had a lot of spoken ideas that were different. This is another point the book was making...tons of ideas were going around, but everything still looked the same. Kahn talks about how going back to the beginning is where all the excitement is. If this isn't Bauhaus... I mean, that's straight from the mouth of Gropius. (O white god!)   \n   \n [kahn info](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Louis_I._Kahn.html) (click the blue links on this page)   \nand   \n [more kahn info](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/www.rochesterunitarian.org/Kahn/) (I apologize in advance for the massive amount of red you are about to see.)   \n   \nI like many of Kahn's aspirations, particularly regarding artificial & natural light. But about other things I'm not sure: \"Beauty was not within his immediate concerns.\" This is especially confusing when, for example, [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/members.tripod.com/~freshness/essay1.html) it talks about Kahn saying how beautiful columns are, but his addition doesn't have any columns, does it? (maybe it does on the inside?) It's just a wall, with lines, that supposedly reveals the structure of the original. His connections between columns and bringing in light and dividing spaces is pretty brilliant though, and I see how the inside brings in light. But still confused on the outside.   \n   \nIt seems that Kahn's addition could have better related to its context. The context is an entire campus built in gothic revival. How does the International style fit in here? I'm not saying that it can't.. at this point I'm still asking questions, because it's not immediately obvious.   \n   \nIf he would have said that the building was about contrast, I might at least see where he was coming from. But he says his building \"revealed the structure\" of the gothic one next door... I need to see how. Is putting something plain (possibly boring) next to something exciting revealing the structure of anything? The book does mention that the interior made use of some clever innovations. [[pic of the lighting]](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/www.yale.edu/yuag/) That's really nice! Except, still, I don't see how it relates to gothic architecture. Another museum he did used long vaults (long hallways were an international style thing) and I see how that relates, but that was in texas, and later on.   \n   \nOne more link:   \n [Kahn summary](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Yale_Center_for_British_A.html)   \nA quote from Kahn on this page...   \n\"A museum seems like a secondary thing, unless it is a great treasury.

Tom Wolfe's book, which this thread started with, argues that the Bauhaus people where so good at convincing people of their superior taste that they paid for buildings that very few people liked, and many detested.   \n   \nIn the US, when the Bauhaus influence started waning - I guess by the end of the 70's - new buildings started looking a lot better. To me the Bauhaus is a period of bad taste and bad buildings, and kind of inverse Victorianism, which I also dislike.   \n   \nI haven't studied the history, either in architecture or typography, but of course we are surrounded by the stuff in one way or another.

But I have to tell you   \nit�s the first time I�ve heard they�re opposed,   \neven in some senses :-)   \n   \nCould you explain that?_      \n   \n   \nHugo, first let me try to explain what may be misleading in what   \nI wrote: not �opposed to the Bauhaus�, but, _in some senses,_ to   \nBauhaus typography. And when I mentioned �Swiss typography�   \n(a term almost as loaded as �international style�...) was as a   \nconspicuous example of a more general spirit. The �Swiss school�   \nitself, BTW, was not monolithic (one of the things Maldonado advises   \nagainst is the monolithical assessment of modern architecture,   \nand we should take the same care when talking about typography).   \n   \nTo answer you, let me quote one of the leaders of the modernists   \nof the fifties, Max Bill [ from a �dialogue� of texts that happened   \nin 1946: Bill, in his �On typography�, attacked Tschichold for his   \nideological about-face, Tschichold then responded with his �Glaube   \nund Wirklichkeit� (�Faith and reality�). Both texts are fundamental,   \nand, even though I side with Bill ; ) I recognize that Tschichold�s   \nis brilliant. ] Anyway, on to Bill. He attacked the modernists of the   \ntwenties and thirties, Bauhausians also, for, among other things,   \n   \n�that which constituted fashionable accessories: the thick rules,   \nthe fillets, the huge bullets, the overdimensioned folios, and other   \nsuch attributes [...] all these elements are useless and superfluous   \nwhen the disposition itself is correctly organized, when the groups   \nof words are placed in just relations of proportion.� (sorry if this   \nsounds convoluted � I�m freely translating from a French translation   \nof the German original).   \n   \nAnd I add: for justified composition (the Bauhausians didn�t do   \nunjustified setting): the �perfect rectangle� was seen as an   \ninheritance from the old typography, and a purely formalist device,   \nsince it goes against the natural, organic spacing of letters and   \nwords.   \n   \nIn a nutshell: the Bauhausians were seen as formalists by the   \nlater modernists, who saw themselves as functionalists. The same   \nreasoning used for typography can be applied to type design: while   \none can easily (but not very accurately) associate the Bauhaus with   \nPaul Renner�s Futura, or (somewhat more correctly) with Bayer�s   \nand Joost Schmidt�s experiments, the geometrical sanses were   \nrejected by the later modernists as formalist, �artistic� letterforms.   \nThey would prefer the anonymous �jobbing� grotesks of the late   \n19th century. And while Emil Ruder, for instance, saw the release   \nof Univers almost as a holy grail of typography � a grotesk with   \nhigh design qualities �, there were still those who would regard   \nit as being too �authored�.   \n   \nHope that helps.\n\n"

      "content": "_Your theory of his reasons for returning to classical typography conflict with mine however. Do you have source on that. I am very interested in him and his works. Also, as you know, Tschichold and I had a mutual friend._   \n   \nIn what I've read of Tschichold's own writing, he never rejects asymetric typography; rather, he rejects his early ideological insistence on asymetric typography, and acknowledges that both asymetric and classical typography have their place, with the latter being most appropriate for books. I think it is important to look at the kind of material Tschichold was designing at different points in his career, and that the move to classical typography coincides with a move from advertising and what we would now call 'identity' design (e.g. stationery) to book design -- and book design of a specific kind: predominantly literary texts in octavo format.   \n   \nI have an interesting German book that combines Tschichold's writings -- illustrated with samples of his work -- from both halves of his career. Most English language publications, excepting Ruari Maclean's not very good biography, deal with either his asymetric typography _or_ his classical book design, as determined by the interest/bias of the translator or publisher. The German book is better, I think, because it conveys the consistency of Tschichold's attention to detail and quality, and makes one realise how this, not apparently opposing styles, is really key to understanding what Tschichold was about. In his early career, he developed asymetric typography to a very high level, and wrote books urging other typographers to follow suit. In his later career, he applied exactly the same level of quality to classical typography, and wrote what amount to style guides that would enable other typographers to achieve pleasing results. This is why I think the relative ease of achieving such results in the classical style, compared the more difficult task of achieving beauty in asymetric typography, was an important factor in Tschichold's _volte face_, especially as it is expressed in pedagogical efforts such as the essays in _The form of the book._ The fact that he developed his classical book design techniques in the context of the Penguin publishing programme is also interesting, and suggests a context in which mass-production of attractive typography, achievable by designers and printers following style guides, would become preferable to more difficult works requiring individual genius of the kind Tschichold himself had demonstrated in his early career.\n\n"

Your effort has not been wasted on me.   \n   \nI have been exposed to Tschichold from different directions. Not only Hans Schmoller but also Nick Schwabe. Nick was the master Swiss printer that gave me his book. The one we had talked about where the Church developed a peculiar habit of beheading people like me.   \n   \nNick belongs to the famous Schwabe printing family. He was a shareholder of the Schwabe publishing firm responsible for printing many books Tschichold designed, and some of which, he wrote. I would guess you will find Schwabe, the firm, indexed in books about Tschichold.   \n   \n [http://www.lanstontype.com/PrivatePress.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20050810074530/http:/www.lanstontype.com/PrivatePress.html)   \n   \nMost remarkable is how different Tschichold is described by different tradesmen within the same industry.   \n   \nHans Schmoller of Penguin was an interesting designer himself but for that matter so was Nick Schwabe. Nick's work was decidedly _Swiss Style_. But once in a while Nick would express his classical typography. He was good. Also Nick was certainly the finest pressman I have ever had the pleasure to work with.   \n   \nI am telling you about Nick because I have no reason to believe he has passed away and probably still lives in British Columbia.   \n   \nBut I have a little story about Swiss training. Nick taught me how to set type. Part of which is, sadly I report, distributing types correctly back into their case.   \n   \nCertainly this is not the end of the story but it is as far as I dare tell.   \n   \nIf you value your life you will _not ask Nick the end of my story of how hand setting types was taught in Switzerland._   \n   \nMorality aside, it worked very well. I got pretty good at it.\n\n"

This is what we usually call 'International Style' in architecture. This 'International Style' borrowed the superficial look of the modern architecture, but the great spatial explorations of the modernism were left behind.   \n   \nI went to the library today and found Wolfe's book. I gave it a quick glance, and noticed he says good things about Johnson's project for AT&T. To me, this building is 'International Style' too. It's another 'cold glass-box', with a fancy thing at the top...\n\n"

It's a really fascinating and well-developed argument.   \n   \nAnother book you may like is Prince Charles'   \n\"A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of Architecture.\" Here's a couple of lines I got off Amazon's website about it: \"The Prince's central point is that modern architecture has lost sight of its surroundings. Rather than creating structures that harmonize with their location, using local materials and respecting the history of the site, many modern buildings seem determined to draw attention to themselves -- or rather, to their architects. Like any art, architecture is a matter of taste. But while you can hide a bad statue or painting, an ugly building is a blot on the landscape that's darn hard to avoid.\"   \n   \nI read this book way back when it was published -- I think in the mid 1980s. It caused quite a stir at the time, but now his argument seems pretty sensible. The book also includes some fairly decent drawings by the prince himself.   \n   \nTroy\n\n"
