The font has been clipped so that only partials of each letter are showing. The letter elements that I have been focusing on would be the slight upward hump in the **D** and the wide and dipping top of the **A**. The lower serif on the **L** lends itself to the courier font family... but I am stuck.

      "content": "This is such an odd serif font that it seems like it should be relatively easy to locate it — the K and A in particular are not typical — but searching with Identifont, my Serif Font ID Guide, and looking at every slab serif in MyFonts did not come up with anything even slightly resembling it.\n\nThis is a mystery to me, but it feels like something I _should_ know. The flat A top seems very Art Nouveau or 19th Century, and it’s making me nuts.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Notice the K and A, in particular. This font is one I really hope we get an answer for.\n\nMark Simonson, Mike F. or Angel would often be people to come up with ones like this. Any of you out there?\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
