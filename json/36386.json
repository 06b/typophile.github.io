Examples include Priori and Tarzana Wide from Emigre.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023035504im_/http:/typophile.com/files/r_6457.jpg)\n\nNot interested in legs that have an convex, or outward curve, like many other sans (e.g., Myriad) and slabs.\n\nThanks in advance for your suggestions!\n\n [‹ Formatting a book with sans serif!
