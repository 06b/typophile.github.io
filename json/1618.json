I think this could simply be someone's own 'homage' to one of those designs.\n\n"

I can not find a sample online. [Here is what I did find](http://web.archive.org/web/20130914174437/http:/www.emigre.com/ArticleCoppingAnAttitude.php). Brian Schorn designed addmorph while at cranbrook in 1993 though because it was based upon Twombly's trajan, a licensing dispute ensued and the font was never released.I have no idea where it came from, but I have a copy of this typeface. (?!?)\n\n"

While Entropy\\* and   \nOsprey\\*\\* are hybrids constructed from two or more   \nfonts\\*\\*\\*, this one is assembled by fusing parts of   \nthe next letter in the alphabet of the same typeface   \n(Trajan by the looks of it).   \n   \n\\* **Entropy** is uppercase _Missive_ fused to lowercase   \n_Memphis_. **Missive** itself looks like a mix of _Garamond_  \nand _Trade Gothic_.   \n\\*\\* **Osprey** is basically _Entropy_ with _Park Avenue_ lower-   \ncase thrown in for added flavour. How far can you go?   \n\\*\\*\\* a popular practice in the deconstructivist heydays   \nof the early nineties; see also P.
