  "content": "I found a rather interesting script in the hand of pulp SF writer Ron Hubbard. Since I have handwritten copies of some of his, shall we say, amateur psychological work, I decided to digitise it and make it into a computer font.\n\nThe edges of the letters are a bit ragged and the ink thickness varies from letter to letter--this effect is (somewhat) intentional, so as to mimic writing with a biro. On the other hand, the letters slant somewhat erratically (some are written straight up, and some with a pronounced slant to the right). This was unintentional, but I actually think it looks good---Hubbard was of the same epoch as the Beat writers and Hunter Thompson, with the same proclivities (amphetamine and opiate use mostly). Do you agree?\n\nI did the kerning and instructions to the best of my ability---if someone's got a better idea, now's the time to tell me about it.\n\nI named the font, (sarcasm) how VERY original of me (end sarcasm) \"Ron's Font\" in honour of its writer.\n\nThe font can be seen here: [http://www.fontspace.com/nick-matavka/ronsfont](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317180055/http:/www.fontspace.com/nick-matavka/ronsfont)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n",
