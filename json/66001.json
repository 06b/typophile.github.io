Sans meets serif.](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015145656/http:/www.sintesi.ch/)\n\nYou would like to express tradition by using a contemporary font? Sintesi might be exactly what you are looking for.\n\nSintesi stands for synthesis: the unification of serif and sans-serif into a contemporary font, which surprises with different facets depending on its application.  \nIn copy size Sintesi performs like a sans-serif. It is a compact and well readable font that fulfills all requirements of modern digital media.\n\nIn larger sizes, Sintesi unfolds its traditional character. Now, its strong contrast and the perceptible feather-ductus stand out clearly, as we appreciate it in a historical old style face.\n\nSintesi is completed by a suitable italic. Its cursive character has more to do with writing-speed than to moderate inclination. Therefore Sintesi may be well-suited for many other purposes, not only for emphasis.\n\nThe whole font family consists of 20 styles and offers a wide range of Western and Eastern European special characters, typographical ligatures, uppercase, oldstyle and fraction figures.\n\nStart combining antiquity with modernity!\n\nDownload a free trial version of Sintesi with a reduced character set.
