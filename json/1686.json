It seems to me to be a cultural issue: not so much the ideas but the implementation of ideas within a particular framework. Matha noted in the previous discussion that the French educational system was quite conservative, despite having produced so many radical thinkers. This is a cultural difference between French and American academia, and indicates why the same radical ideas might have a different impact in different countries.\n\n"

I would go further and suggest that there is a lack of proportion and definitely not enough scepticism in the American handling of French philosophy. Baudrillard, for example, is considered a bit of a nut by a lot of French scholars.   \n   \nAlso, I'm half-way through Eco's book on the search for the perfect language and the way he describes it, European Academia has been absorbing all sorts of craziness for centuries.

But I will comment.   \n   \nNon-Americans pontificating about America - and I include John Hudson here - often miss large parts of the picture.   \n   \nIt is perfectly true that the American mass entertainment media pander to the lowest instincts of people, including flattering the average consumer by assuring them that everone more intelligent or learned is contemptible in some way or other.   \n   \nBut they sometimes also rise above such pandering and do wonderful stuff. And, more important, America is not to be identified with the American mass media.   \n   \nMany parents and teachers are constantly waging intellectual battle against the debased tone of the mass entertainment media. And there are huge communities of thoughtful people that totally ignore such drivel. They are vibrant and vital and behind the most dynamic economy in the world.   \n   \nJudging America only by the mass media is like those people outside the US 50 years ago who used to think that we were full of cowboys, Indians, and rich people in mansions - because that is who was in the movies.   \n   \nOf course there is anti-intellectualism here, and it is a despicable American tradition.   \n   \nA pretty accurate assessment was given by Alistair Cook, who observed the US through British eyes for most of the last century. He said that in the US there was a constant struggle between forces that were powerfully creating a better society, and forces that were causing the decay of civilization. The last time I heard him on TV (5 or more years ago) he thought that the forces of decay might be getting the upper hand.   \n   \nI think it is a pretty near thing.\n\n"

I got overheated from Hrant's provocation.   \n   \nOne thing I think you overdid, though:   \n   \n\"kids, in particular, are encouraged not to think, by their peers\"   \n   \nIn American high schools there are typically different groups and the kids mainly take their group of friends as their reference group.   \n   \nI have had my three children go through American High Schools over a period of 11 years, up to 3 years ago. I don't really think any of my kids felt these pressures very strongly.   \n   \nI know among groups and some schools the pressures are there, but it is misleading to make it a blanket statement. Also academically less accomplished kids may put up a front of indifference or hostility while actually envying the academically adept. And many kids figure this out.   \n   \nI don't know what exactly the truth is here. Anti-intellectualism is an important problem to be combatted - and from what I read this is particularly so in the Black community. But it needs to be understood to combat it, and it is not necessarily all it seems on the surface.\n\n"

      "content": "\\>some amount of salt during reading.   \n   \nWell, since you encourage me I'll be blunt. Wittgenstein made philosophy into a pointless academic game. As I understand it - and you doubtless know more here - the linguists didn't find him particularly innovative in so far as he got on their territory.   \n   \nThe authors of 'Wittgenstein's Poker' in my view did a great disservice to Popper by assuming the conventional view of Wittgenstein as great, so Popper couldn't be right. Incidentally, I think the two authors probably disagree because there are contradictions left the text.   \n   \nAlso by not understanding rightly the poker incident they ended up accusing Popper of lying, which really is not so plausible if you understand really what was going on.   \n   \nPopper is the real thing - a powerful, innovative thinker on important issues. If you read those amazing essays in 'Conjectures and Refutations' you will see what I mean.\n\n"

My mom had to pick me up at middle school, drive me down the road to the high school, wait for an hour, then drive me back to middle school - all so I could take geometry. they don't even offer the opportunity for kids to move ahead - everyone's expected to be the same cow in the same corral. In high school I had to take night classes at a community college, just because American high schools don't offer enough maths.

Thanks.   \n   \n[disclaimer: I'm not a real linguist, but I play one on the internet]   \n   \nI don't think that linguistics got much from Wittgenstein. Certainly not from the whole 'picture theory' bit. But the later stuff - the 'ordinary language' stuff - has it's impact. Even if every linguist isn't proclaiming the name of Wittgenstein.   \n   \nI don't think much from the early 20th century has much impact on contemporary linguistics - not even the 'proper linguists' like Bloomfield and Sapir. Transformational synatx and generative semantics didn't really come about until the 1950s - and that's more or less the [general] model for what people are doing now.   \n   \nThe ideas of people like J L Austin are pretty well respected and, as far as I'm aware, they deal with similar things to later Wittgenstein (e.g., _Philosophical Investigations_). It's still the whole 'ordinary language' idea. And, like [Austin's book](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123034/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0674411528/qid=1066178604/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1579554-2009616?v=glance&s=books) says, they're both dealing with how language really works, and how we do things with it. But those ideas are all from around the 1950s - the birth of modern linguistics.   \n   \nThat's my understanding, for whatever it may be worth.   \n   \nIncidentally, I enjoyed _Wittgenstein's Poker_, but I did feel like Popper got the crappy end of the stick. \"LW is a charismatic & powerful thinker full of prescient thoughts while EP is a snivelling twat clutching the skirts of Russell.\" Somehow I doubt it was quite like that :-/   \n   \nStanley Cavell actually has an [essay about another philosophical argument](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518123034/http:/www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0631192719/qid=1066180376/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-1579554-2009616?v=glance&s=books) - this one between Austin and Derrida (ordinary language vs. infinite slippage or whatever). Shamefully it's another book I have on the shelf and haven't read. Might be a real gem in this conversation.\n\n"

I would like to read more about it, because it doesn't correspond to my experience or that of my children.   \n   \nIf you were in the South - the South does have a reputation for not having the greatest of schools.   \n   \nMy point is if you have friends who are academically good and you have mutual respect with them, the carping of others doesn't affect you much.   \n   \nIf you went to U. of Chicago you were first rate academically, and you may have had the misfortune of not having peers in your high school.   \n   \nMy son, for instance, went to a magnet high school for science, such as exists in some major urban areas, and they had as much math as almost any kid could handle.   \n   \nOn Wittgenstein (and Austin):   \n   \nIt may be that some stuff that they said in linguistics was valuable, though I haven't heard what it is. Their idea that by analysing ordinary language you would disolve philosophical problems was wrong, and that is the heart of their philosophy.   \n   \nIncidentally, I am not denying that Wittgenstein was a genius and powerful writer. It just that he was fundamentally wrong, and is a dead end path in philosophy.\n\n"

At this point, I believe that if I was a philosopher instead of a painter-cum-printer-cum-linguist-cum-journalist-cum-typographer I wouldn't think that Wittgenstein was as interesting as I do.
