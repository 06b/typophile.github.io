It will include points about plain English, capitalisation, font choice (to avoid red Arial bold italic), the difference between a hyphen and a dash and other relevant bits and pieces.\n\nI want to include a short point on use of white space in documents (reports, instructions, presentations) and web pages. I was thinking something along the lines of: White space should be used deliberately in designing all corporate communications.\n\nMy problem is that I can't formulate the reason for this very well and want to say more than 'because it looks nice and uncluttered'.\n\nCan anyone suggest why white space should be designed into documents rather than left over at the end, or point me in the direction of other style guides/web sites?\n\nThanks:)\n\n",

I'm thinking navigability (not knowing where to start reading) and the amount of information are difficult.\n\nI found this on Wikipedia <cite>'Judicious use of white space can give a page a classic, elegant, or rich appearance. For example, upscale brands often use ad layouts with little text and a lot of white space. Inexpert use of white space can make a page appear incomplete.'</cite>\n\nAnd this from another website <cite>'white space is used for purely semiotic values; for values of presentation which transcend economic values by insisting that the image of what you present is more important than the paper you could be saving.'</cite>\n\nSo the 'luxury' aspect is more suitable for selling expensive products than it would be for setting a purely informational newspaper, perhaps.\n\nHowever, I'm suddenly worried about the last sentence of the Wikipedia piece, so perhaps it is better after all to specify margins than expect non-designers to use white space cleverly.\n\n"

The cost of paper, the cost of makeready (if printed), and in human costs, especially the ergs expended in turning pages.\n\nThis can present a real challenge with, say, a title page. Their just isn't enough copy to fill the page. Perhaps write a little more? Or maybe add some ornaments, the print equivalent of tarting up with earrings, rouge, etc.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nIf you are preparing a print piece, you can a least illustrate the point on white space by including a sample of asymmetric typography contrasted to centered typography.\n\nThe use of white space is a comfort matter, just like every other element of typography. Seeing and appreciating it is a matter of learning; once learned, it becomes part of an audience's expectations & reactions.\n\n"

      "content": "\"Include some space to let the text breathe\" is a useful tip.  \nIt can be as simple as just making sure that headlines aren't sized up to fill the available space.\n\nBut \"White Space\", as an element of asymmetric modernist page layouts is problematic.  \nI don't think it's something that most people can do without a fair amount of study and practice, developing an understanding and eye for it.\n\nConsider modernist architecture. A large office block by Mies, with its expanses of plain and pure form, expensive materials, discrete detailing and subtle proportions, is beautiful. But in lesser hands with less budget, modernism became a crude and brutal exercise of corporate/government power.\n\nWhite Space is ideologically fraught.  \nIts origins, connected to the clean and healthy aspirations of modernist design with social purpose.  \nAnd now the environmental issue.\n\nIgnoring screen display, consider that White Space is an inherent waste of resources.  \nIn corporate or institutional publications, designers are taught to waste paper to create the \"minimalist\" aesthetic. A large part of the effect relies on identifying the awe of big size with the power of the publisher/advertiser who can afford to waste paper--that is the aesthetic. We have established a norm where small publications and advertisements just don't look right for large organizations. So big corporations and government are inherently wasteful.\n\nWhere does the creative industry get off, with its conscience intact, talking about being green, when the creative that it honors most is the work which wastes most paper with big pictures and lots of white space? If you're so creative, get the message across efficiently, sell the product with a smaller ad.\n\nAnd if small is beautiful, then perhaps spend longer conceptualizing and writing to shrink and concentrate the message, because labor is ultimately greener than materials, minimize the physical footprint, and use rules and borders to separate matter, because that takes up less real estate than White Space.\n\n"
