  "content": "Adantine is a display face in late Victorian decorative style, gently oblique and with a sense of refined movement, all capitals of a single height but with subtle distinctions between the ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ case glyphs. It offers an air of delicate distinction combined with legibility.\n\nWe just posted a further pdf specimen on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103085202/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/) showing the progress to date. All constructive feedback greatfully received!\n\n",

      "content": "James you’re not correct at all-Scanfont (nor indeed any scanning software) was not involved in the construction of Adantine, nor has it been involved in the vast majority of Greater Albion’s faces. In fact the only ones where a measure of Automatic tracing of curves was used (not unedited) were ’Tectura’ and the holiday dinbats where we was looking for a deliberately hand drawn look, and this in conjunction with my own artwork worked best as a way to achieve it. Greater Albion has no interest in sticking a typeface specimen in a scanner and calling the result a font.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103085202im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Hand%20Drawn_4031.png)\n\n"
