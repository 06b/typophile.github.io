Note that the a’s and i’s are different, so… not a font? I think it is quite a new thing to have alternate characters in digital fonts. How old is the design?\n\n"

      "content": "I know...this is an old thread. Just wanted to chime in here since I designed that type for the license plates.\n\nIt originated on the special Yosemite License Plates in 1995-ish. Our firm was tasked with designing the plates, including an original illustration. I did all of the type and layout, and a very experienced painter and illustrator did an original painting that was then imaged electronically. The \"California\" type design was then used on virtually all (with some exceptions) California license plates to this day (how many millions?).\n\nI have to agree with APS221. But I wasn't convinced until I fired up Illustrator to see for myself. All these years, I had it in my head that I used Zephyr Script, a Casady & Greene font. Yet today, both Zephyr and Mistral weren't even close, but Rage Italic was a virtual match. Yes, the \"i\" and \"a\" were altered in Illustrator, along with other minor alterations, including the tittles above the \"i\"s I believe.\n\nI still have the original files, permanently entombed somewhere on a Syquest drive, and I have a few physical license plate prototypes (mfd by 3M) that didn't end up being chosen for the final design, along with a few \"SAMPLE\" plates of the final design, and one blank finished plate.\n\nAnyway, I hope this comes in handy for someone...it's definitely Rage Italic.\n\n"
