  "content": "I wonder if there is any reliable independent platform around which gives comparative information about fonts in their possibly latest versions. I have in mind not so much a search like “free funny christmas fonts” but rather specialised requirements, e.g. in science.\n\n[Alan Wood’s Unicode resources](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022025306/http:/www.alanwood.net/unicode/index.html) have been rightfully much acknowledged in the past. But it seems to be heavily out of date, at least with its detailed font informations. No wonder, this is hardly a task to be solved forever by one single man.\n\nWhat do you fellow typophiles make of [Identifont](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022025306/http:/www.identifont.com/index.html)?\n\n[Fontscape](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022025306/http:/www.fontscape.com/) seems to offer a promising approach, yet the selections presented seem to be rather arbitrary – and very limited.\n\n[Wazu Japan’s page](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022025306/http:/www.wazu.jp/index.html) seems to have not been updated for some two years as well; however, it offers an interesting online [font testing functionality](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022025306/http:/www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Coptic.html).\n\nAn universal, comprehensive and detailed font information system – Utopian?\n\n",
