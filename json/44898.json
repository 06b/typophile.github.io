  "content": "Hi all\n\nThis is my first post so thanks in advance. Im designing a promotion for the course I teach on part time ’Interactive Design’ at the University of Lincoln. (We’re promoting a show which is uses obsolete handheld tv’s to showcase student work.) I love this visual for the familiarity and distinct/unique look it can provide- I want to develop the chromakey blue and the aesthetic of this typeface but for the life of me I cant identify it. I think it might be freeware as its so universal for interface design.\n\nAny ideas would be very welcome\n\nTake it easy. Cheers\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709020452im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/INTERFACE_5159.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Picture 1.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709020452/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture%201_133.png) | 55.18 KB |\n\n [‹ similar to Folio](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709020452/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44911 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [specialty coffee - casual sans ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080709020452/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44908 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Chunkfeeder is a variant of an OCR typeface, a monospaced, used with such HUD’s and displays, VHS for example. Chunkfeeder is a versatile family of 6 fonts - 3 different weights, each with an italic.\n\nBest of luck with your project.  \n\\_\\_  \nRez\n\n"
