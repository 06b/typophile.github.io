  "content": "Yesterday I had my first ever portfolio presentation for a design agency. They absolutely tore me apart, but still wanted me to work with them. Interesting people:)\n\nFirst and foremost they really didn't like that I had \"designed the portfolio\". They told me my work should be enough on it's own.  \nOne of the designers had to fetch his glasses to read my captions.  \nThey rolled their eyes over some of my work, and also told me the way I presented it was terrible.\n\n",

They sound somewhat arrogant actually. No big news here. Most graphic designers -- and moreso with those in 'high' positions -- as well being conservative, insular and unimaginative, are drunk with self-importance.\n\ndid they say anything positive? how do you feel it went?\n\nhonestly, sometimes people say you havn't been creative enough with your folio presentation, and other times the contrary. it's a minefield. to quote larry david: you just can't leave your house.\n\nI think a few difficult folio showings is good for the soul in the end.\n\n"

The crux lies in whether meaning is communicated and even then it's a minefield of variables.\n\nsorry to hear that asen.
