It would involve analyzing a list of foundries and seeing what they reveal about their custom work. However, they might not reveal all their custom work (I don’t get around to posting everything I do, whether or not I am happy with the results), and just scanning foundries might not pick up all active work. For instance, some lettering artists also do custom type design, such as Ian Brignell’s new font for [Bell](http://web.archive.org/web/20081020051248/http:/www.ianbrignell.com/).\n\nCustom type varies by country. I get the impression there is more corporate work in the UK, more periodical work in North America.\n\nWith regard to Hrant’s concern, I would say that declining news sales in the US, coupled with consolidation (both economic and technological), might lead to a reduced demand for custom news fonts. On the other hand, technology can open up new markets (on the internet perhaps?)\n\nWhile it might seem that an economic downturn would reduce the budget for custom type, on the other hand, a dramatic change in the zeitgeist could rapidly obselesce exisiting identities, leading to a demand for rebranding. And then of course, with bankruptcies and takovers, new corporate identites emerge which will require expression. Recession as opportunity.\n\n"

How many typefaces do you use? How many do you need? How much new stuff is exciting enough?\n\nSomething to think about: the implementation of OpenType is probably an impetus for continuing growth is type sales, but the time will come where this technology has matured with the evident consequence that sales of OT-faces will slow down.\n\nInteresting question. I am going to think some more about this.\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

      "content": "Like a lot of other products/services there will be a high end part of the business where snobbish people/firms will want to display their uniqueness by commissioning custom typefaces (example: David Berlow did a fontfamily for some billionaire who wanted the digital interfaces for his multimillion dollar ship to reflect the excellence he aimed for in every aspect of its design and build — David presented that during Type 2008). [Fashion: haute couture like John Galliano).\n\nA larger, but still small group of companies/individuals will buy the more exclusive and pricy fonts that might for instance trickle down to the market after their exclusive rights have ended. Some designers may cater to this group. (Fashion: like Dries van Noten).\n\nA greater part of the market will just follow the trends that smart marketeers will initiate. As happens in a lot of other fashionlike industries (cars, clothes, shoes, etc.). Fast-and-furious typedesigners could make a bundle here (Kris is fast!), but they need marketing prowess and power. (Fashion: Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren).\n\nThe masses will just use what comes along, preferably free, maybe with some likeness to what is hip. But most of all: cheap. Think of thousands of name– and faceless type-engineers in sweatshops in China or Vietnam, drawing/building quick and dirty knockoffs of bestselling typefaces, marketing them through the internet, or by including 10 cent coupons in breakfast cereals. (Fashion: Hennes & Mauritz, GAP).\n\nA pretty bleak future, I realise now. : )\n\nHrant: leaders of government have seldom shown any degree of good taste. That is not going to change soon, I think. In the Netherlands the powers that be have decided that all of the different identities of governmental departments and organisations have to go and in future one Identity Program for All will be used. If they had done that 15 years ago, some very fine typefaces (like Lud[as] de Groots Corpid) would not exist.  \nEuro money looks awful, esp for us Dutch who had arguably the most beautiful paper money in the world — Roger Pfunds Swiss stuff is also okay, I give them that —, and that was the result of a decision by a handful of so called leaders and civil servants, who apparantly had no taste as well. More of this is going to happens as institutions become larger and larger and less democratic.\n\nShit, reading what I wrote, the future looks even bleaker now. My plans to do some typedesigning probably will have to wait another twenty years, when I can do it as a hobby…\n\n. . .  \nBert Vanderveen BNO\n\n"

And custom is always an option, right?  \nAnd re my design plans: I have been thinking about optical sizes for the last decade or so and think I have found an approach that could be of use. Now I just need to find the time (and funding) to draw/build the first 9 times 5 typefaces. As a proof of concept, that is.  \nAnd cynical is not the way most people that know me characterise me.

Another way could be that when the deck is rolling, the rain is coming down in sheets, and the salt is stinging your eyes, why would you also want to read 60% horizontally scaled 8.2 point Bank Gothic on a 14 mm square button, or a MS “Cleartype font” with CAD operator-quality typography? Additionally, fashion, to a great extent, depends on people seeing the fashion, which is also hardly the case in the plucked instance. I am not saying I’ve never done custom type design for the sake of fashion, but the boat fonts were not one such instance.\n\nI believe the market is growing. The reason I say so, is because we’ve always been busy with it for 20 years now, and though we used to ’own’ a 100% market share, there are now hundreds of custom font designers, and we only have a 1% market share for the same amount of work being done by us. ;)\n\nCheers!\n\n"
