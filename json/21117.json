The long words you found are the exception rather than the rule. As to philosophical or scientific texts -- once you figure out what someone means by a longer word (which has more to do with the interpretation of the text than mere deciphering of a single word), these words become variables which you just recognize. Whether they are shorter or longer doesn't really matter then.  \nToday \"lichtgeschwindigkeit\" is used which is literally the same as the English and French terms. Not that long.\n\n[Glaube ich nicht. Diese langen wörter sind eher die ausnahme.

Unfortunately, this principle is not followed by everyone anymore.\n\nMost words are longer because of our naive way of describing things rather than using new words. For example, glove is actually Handschuh (handshoe) in German. This makes texts longer but on the other hand, many technical terms are easier to understand for laymen.\n\n"

It seems that semitic languages always had word spaces, but that the addition of vowels to the alphabet for Greek and Latin sufficiently reduced ambiguity that word spaces were not as needed.\n\nThere is a theory, of Noordzij and Saenger that the re-introduction of word spaces by Irish monks in the 8th century enabled silent reading and was a big breakthough. I am wondering whether native speakers of Latin and Greek could read just as quickly without word spaces. I know Latin is highly conjugated, and I've heard the same about Greek, so it may be that word endings are easy to recognize.\n\nMy guess is that the reintroduction of word spaces was because the Irish monks' Latin was not as good as their continental colleagues, so it was more difficult for them to read continuous texts; also they wanted to write Gaelic, which maybe has less end-of-word markers...\n\nIn English we also do aggretated nouns (eg. word spaces), but usually keep the words separate. Does the German practice reduce ambiguity and help readability? Or does the length of words reduce readability? Or is there no difference?\n\nI also note that German is much more conjugated than English. Is this a factor?\n\n"

By the local police in Horsens back in the 1940s. As a spirits test. If you were unable to say this word, you were apparently drunk.\n\nI’m quite glad I didn’t live in Horsens in the 1940s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<cite>«There is a theory, of Noordzij and Saenger that the re-introduction of word spaces by Irish monks in the 8th century enabled silent reading and was a big breakthough. I am wondering whether native speakers of Latin and Greek could read just as quickly without word spaces. I know Latin is highly conjugated, and I’ve heard the same about Greek, so it may be that word endings are easy to recognize.</cite>\n\nMy guess is that the reintroduction of word spaces was because the Irish monks’ Latin was not as good as their continental colleagues, so it was more difficult for them to read continuous texts; also they wanted to write Gaelic, which maybe has less end-of-word markers...»\n\nA few points here.\n\nFirstly, there are still languages that do not employ spacing in writing—Chinese and Japanese are prime examples, and I believe Thai is completely spaceless, too. It is only familiarity with the language that enables the reader to correctly separate words. Especially in Chinese and Thai, which are both completely analytic languages that do not inflect in any way (this is true of Chinese; my Thai is nonexistent, so I’m not entirely sure here, but I believe it too is purely analytic), this causes confusion and trouble for the foreign learner, but not for the native speaker. Even after nearly six years with Chinese, I still find myself often misreading things because I combine the wrong two characters and form words that make no sense in the context.\n\nSecondly, by the 7th and 8th centuries, Irish was just coming out of two centuries of heavy linguistic turmoil, wherein the entire language had more or less fallen completely apart and created out of its own ashes an entirely new (and unbelievably complex) grammatical system. Part of this new system was the initial mutations, resulting from apocope of earlier word endings.\n\nThese were, however, not systematically indicated in writing at that time, so I can imagine it would have been quite useful to add spaces, just to know how to pronounce words. Especially since certain cases could be easily misunderstood if not separated; example: _accat_ could mean either ‘at/by a cat’ or ‘their cat’, depending on whether it is separated as _ac cat_ (&nbsp;=&nbsp;Modern Irish _ag cat_) or _a ccat_ (&nbsp;=&nbsp;Modern Irish _a gcat_).\n\nThe structure of Old Irish made ambiguities like this one very common, and seem to me a good reason (in addition to your own guesses, which I think are probably also factors) to add spaces.\n\n"

Rather than make an effort to understand these rules, far too many people disregard them and sometimes apply ad hoc spacing rules. Those in the legal profession are the worst offenders, especially when they write the names of laws without using spaces, ending up with monsters like this:\n\n대한민국과아메리카합중국간의상호방위조약제4조에의한시설과구역및대한민국에서의합중국군대의지위에관한협정의실시에따른관세법등의임시특례에관한법률  \n(Daehanmingukgwaamerikahapjunggukganuisanghobangwijoyakje4(sa)joeuihansiseolgwaguyeokmitdaehanmingukeseouihapjunggukgundaeeuijiwiegwanhanhyeopjeonguisilsiettareungwansebeopdeunguiimsiteungnyeegwanhanbeomnyul)\n\nJudging from this and their propensity to use as much _hanja_ (Chinese characters) as possible, they must take perverse pleasure in making law inaccessible to ordinary Koreans.
