  "content": "I've taken over the job of typesetting an online academic journal. Past papers were set in the version of Goudy Oldstyle from Adobe. I was thinking of upgrading to the Lanston Type Collection (P22) version of this typeface, in part because it contains a more complete glyph set (e.g., it includes a full complement of superscript figures).\n\nI've never used any LTC fonts, though, and I wanted to get some input before investing in one of them. Are they generally regarded as well-made and well-produced fonts?\n\nI was also wondering whether switching to the LTC version will create a noticeably different look for the journal. I know that there will be subtle differences between the two versions, but I want to preserve a sense of continuity. That is, I don't want it to be obvious to readers that I've switched fonts. Does anyone know how different the two versions are? (I can't think of a good way to test this without buying the LTC fonts.)\n\nI'm just an amateur, and any input from more experienced typophiles would be greatly appreciated!\n\nMatty\n\n",
