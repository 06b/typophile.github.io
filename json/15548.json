Most of you probably don't need it (it's super basic), but anyone who's interested is welcome.\n\nAll that entry requires in enrolling at [City College](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162027/http:/www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Matriculation/step1.htm) and having some demonstrable command of Bézier curves (like in Illustrator).\n\nEverything else we can take care of on the first day of class.\n\nGRPH 152 Digital Font Creation  \nWednesdays: 6:00–10:00pm, Visual Arts 143  \nCCSF Ocean Campus: 50 Phelan Ave.  \n8-week course: October 26–December 14, 2005  \nCRN 76938\n\nBTW, it's a one-unit class, making it a whopping $26!\n\nFeel free to email me with questions,\n\nAmy Conger  \n [http://fog.ccsf.cc.ca.us/~aconger/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162027/http:/fog.ccsf.cc.ca.us/~aconger/)  \n [http://www.abecedarienne.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317162027/http:/www.abecedarienne.com/ \"http://www.abecedarienne.com\")\n\n",
