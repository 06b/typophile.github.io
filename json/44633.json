  "content": "Hi all, I am brand new here and have a question for you seasoned typographers about punctuation. When setting type in a paragraph that has a ™ or ® symbol followed by punctuation, do you:\n\nA) Tuck the punctuation beneath the trademark symbol, while trying to avoid making the punctuation appear to be part of the trademark; or\n\nB) Set the punctuation AFTER the ™ or ®?\n\nI have heard of it done both ways and want to settle this bit of arcanery once and for all! Thanks in advance for any/all input.\n\nCheers,  \nM@\n\n",
