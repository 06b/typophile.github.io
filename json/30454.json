An entity without the semicolon works in IE, and perhaps in other browsers, but is incorrect and may not work correctly in all cases. An entity is defined as starting with the ampersand and ending with a semicolon.\n\n"

A double hyphen is acceptable when all you have is a typewriter, and somewhat forgivable when using a monospace font as one often does for email, but an em dash should be substituted when it becomes available.\n\n"

So it became common practice for the typist to use two hyphens to show the extreme pause.\n\nHowever, when this same document made it the \"professional\" typeshop, it was automatically changed to the 1-M dash it was meant to be.\n\nHope that clears things up a bit.\n\nAlso, don't forget one line under a word or sentence was for emphasis - the typewriter could do that fine...but they didn't have the italic counterpart that the \"professional\" used.\n\nThere are lots of instances from typewriter to typesetting we can go through just like this.\n\n"
