  "content": "Hello All,   \n   \nI've been looking for a Fat square sans with thin square counters. I've looked at [California Grotesk](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123011108/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/california-grotesk/urw-t-black/testdrive.html?s=ROBERT%2BREHME&p=48) and Compacta [Compacta](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123011108/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/compacta/bold/testdrive.html?s=ROBERT%2BREHME%2B%2BS&p=72) but they don't have the stoke variation or the super fat (ultra bold) weight I'm looking for. This looks like I've seen it everywhere but there's nothing in my specimen books or anywhere on myfonts.com. This doesn't seem to be manipulated but I've been wrong before. I've tried the \"more fonts like this\". Maybe I shouldn't work at nights anymore. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks.   \n   \nHere's sample:   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20051123011108im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/36841.jpg)\n\n",
