  "content": "Hi all\n\nI know this is a long shot but is there a macro or method to create glyph components from a mask. I have a large italic font, the accents glyphs were made up from components of the base glyph and accent. These glyphs have been mistakenly decomposed but I need them as components. I could generate the glyphs again with Glyph \\> Generate Glyphs… , this would give me the components but the accents would be the wrong places. Any ideas.\n\n",

If you use the shortcut for this, and also use a shortcut for \"Next Glyph\" (go to \"Tools \\> Customize\" which has a search box) to quickly switch from one glyph to the other, you can revert to components with not too much work. I have done this a few times in the past. (I don't understand the mask part. Does \"Tools \\> Mask \\> Swap Outline with Mask\" help? Again \"Tools \\> Customize\" allows you to assign a shortcut.)\n\n"

You have to run the routine on each component, selected separately.\n\nDone this way, a change to either of the components will be reflected in all the composites based on it.\n\nExample: if you want to change the \\*e\\* glyph and all the e-accent glyphs, then **if** all the e-accent glyphs are composites, the change to the base glyph will reflect that change in all of them. The same thinking if you want, say, to change the length or thickness of a macron diacritical. The po0sitioning of each component will (essentially) remain.\n\nGiven most text editing and layout software today, as long as authors use Unicode's precomposed accented characters rather than a base character and a combining diacritic, this becomes an important tool.\n\nEdit:\n\nActually, since most font publishers -- including the major ones such as Adobe and Monotype -- don't bother with the combining diacritics, authors aren't to blame for not following the Unicode consortium's stated preference...\n\n"
