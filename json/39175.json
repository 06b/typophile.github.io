The early types (Jenson et al) were exact adaptations of the Renaissance humanist calligraphy, and the oblique cross bar, which also extends out of the letter shape, looks exactly like what it is then: a pen / feather stroke, which naturally comes all the way up, following the movement of the hand. When Garamont and his fellows took over the engraving of following types, they kept the overall look of the letters but modified them in order to bring more harmony, structural strength and aesthetic improvements: they basically transformed a calligraphy into a typography. That transition was not as obvious as the one done by Grandjean, Caslon and Baskerville some years later, but it is what I think the correct answer to your question.\n\nDavid R\n\n"

However, what you say about moving away from simply mimicking the Humanist hand is most interesting; and the desire to to distance themselves from calligraphy.\n\nThe history of type from the beginning of the 16th century looks like typography getting into gear, and becoming that much more self-assured. I guess we can observe a similar phenomenon in the nascent days of any new technology; at first, the technology is used simply as a labour-saving device, doing pretty much the same task, only faster, more efficiently; then as it begins to mature it finds new and unique ways of expressing itself.\n\nI really appreciate your help on this one, David.\n\njohno (iLT)\n\n"

It's all about improving :-)\n\nThis being said, I was actually about to express the fact that Some sans serif typefaces have been designed with an oblique cross bar on the lowercase e and other calligraphic artifacts, though in order to state that these types were just trying to involve a sense of humanity in their designs (especially kabel, which i tend to hate because of this very feature: halfway between calligraphy and geometry, very unstable and quite ugly font - according to me, of course, please don't shoot me). Apart from the types where the venetian e is historically justified (Jenson et al), I just can't remember of any font with this feature that I would just enjoy.

Kabel is one of the great underappreciated linear type designs. Unconventional yes, but that is precisely why Kabel is a good thing. Typography needs great designs to challenge what we might call the \"tyranny of mainstream values\".\n\nForget about the calligraphic origin of **e**'s with oblique crossbars for a moment. Type designers can include the structure for other reasons having nothing to do with calligraphy. The angle of such a bar harmonizes nicely with the branching angle of strokes attached to the stems of h, n, m and u, and harmonizes with angled stem ends (if present).\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

If you love them for real, you can’t be that much analytic and distant. can you?_\n\nI love typography and typeface design as unconditionally as I can, balancing my gut emotional response with a _sense_ of objectivity. I have feelings like every typophile, but I also feel strongly about the matter of tolerance. When I see typophiles cringing at great designs it smacks of intolerance. Tolerance of things that grate on you leads gradually, by degress, to appreciation of that thing---if you allow it to happen. Cringing every time you see it is like painting it black, precluding the opportuinity to see it in its true colors.\n\nJohn,  \n_Isn’t appreciation subjective?

That purpose might be practical, like a readable road sign, or emotional, like conveying a happy mood or conveying authority.\n\nAnother way is to try to separate style from how well a design is realized. For example, some people's taste is for simple designs and some more ornate. But even if you don't prefer a style you can see better and worse executions of it. It is also helpful to compare with designs of the same style or stylistic idea--such as humanist slab serifs or something like that.\n\nAdmittedly, even after this there is a big element of what moves you aesthetically.

That sounds to me like the way a type designer thinks about these things. The notion that the bar was made horizontal to 'mark the transition between calligraphy and typesetting' doesn't make sense to me. One can say that the horizontal bar became a mark of the typographic letter, which is a straight observation, but I don't think Griffo was sitting there thinking 'How can I make my type more typographic?' What would that question even mean at that stage in the development of typography? I find it much more likely that, through looking closely at letters, particularly at the sizes at which he was beginning to cut type, he noted how certain relationships could be made less cluttered.\n\n"
