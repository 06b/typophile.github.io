  "content": "Hi, I am working on a design that needs some hand painted / brush letters.\n\nI found a sample, that has a nice blend of thick and thin. And irregularities, which makes me think it is hand lettered. Could anyone recommend a font with a similar flavor?\n\nI found one font, plz-print. Its alright.  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outsidetheline/plz-print-brush/](http://web.archive.org/web/20100630164224/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/outsidetheline/plz-print-brush/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/outsidetheline/plz-print-brush/\")\n\nMaybe I'd have more success finding a font as a template and painting my own letters on top of the guide.\n\nWell, any thoughts would be well appreciated.  \n-=Bookie\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [PaintedLetters.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20100630164224/http:/typophile.com/files/PaintedLetters.jpg) | 217.08 KB |\n\n",
