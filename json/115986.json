More alternatives: [Arquitecta](http://web.archive.org/web/20140916034105/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/arquitecta), [Celias](http://web.archive.org/web/20140916034105/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/typedynamic/celias)  \neyewear: sorry but really too small for my eyes... I know they're using [Utopia](http://web.archive.org/web/20140916034105/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/utopia) Display (and Proxima Nova) on their website. At this size, it could the job even if I'm quite convinced it's not the right one.\n\n"
