(Just click on the background layer to get rid of the outline of the vector mask)\n\n"

Depends on what kind of results you want.\n\nMethod one:  \n [http://asciiconvert.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141203090743/http:/asciiconvert.com/ \"http://asciiconvert.com/\")  \n [http://www.ascii-art-generator.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141203090743/http:/www.ascii-art-generator.com/ \"http://www.ascii-art-generator.com/\")  \n [http://www.altarsoft.com/ascii\\_art\\_maker.shtml](http://web.archive.org/web/20141203090743/http:/www.altarsoft.com/ascii_art_maker.shtml \"http://www.altarsoft.com/ascii\\_art\\_maker.shtml\")  \n [http://www.network-science.de/ascii/](http://web.archive.org/web/20141203090743/http:/www.network-science.de/ascii/ \"http://www.network-science.de/ascii/\")\n\nMethod two:  \nUse Illustrator's spray tool and experiment.\n\nMethod three:  \nI guess this is how the sample image you have posted was been produced.\n\nCreate two layers in the the Photoshop. The top layer should be the text layer and the bottom one should have the image you want to apply the effect. Make sure that your text is set either in white or Black. Now select the top(text) layer and keep playing with the various layers/transperency modes. Shortcut for this: \"Shift\" + \"+\".\n\n"

Right click on the layer with the text and click select pixels. Then invert the selection and change to the layer with the photo. Hit delete and all the pixels that aren't the text will be erased leaving only the portions of the photo where there was text. Hide the original text layer and presto, you've got what I did.\n\n"
