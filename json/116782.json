Designed by F C Herrick for the use of the signwriters and letterers at the British Empire Exhibition, 1923. (c) Mindofone Fonts. 2011.\n\nAccording to LucDevroy this is a free font digitized by Dick Pape:\n\n> In 2011-2012, Dick Pape created a number of free fonts based on designs pointed out to him by Mindofone, and he calls them his Mindofone collection, 86 files strong. They include French Alphabets (FA) and French Advertising Alphabets (FAA). The French Advertising Alphabets were designed by M. Moullet in Brussels in 1946.\n\nYou can download the font from LucDevroy pages:  \n [http://luc.devroye.org/pape/French%20Alphabets/French%20Alphabets-Mindof...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317125155/http:/luc.devroye.org/pape/French%20Alphabets/French%20Alphabets-Mindofone/ \"http://luc.devroye.org/pape/French%20Alphabets/French%20Alphabets-Mindofone/\")\n\nCheck the image bellow. Not a perfect match (no numerals also) but I think it could serve as a good substitute.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317125155im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Herrick-Sign-Writers_5757.jpg)\n\n"

I would say you are absolutely right.  \nThe plaque is from Jersey in the Channel Isles so the fact that the font is French/Belgian would make sense.  \nShame there are no numerals, could you recommend a font I might be able to use or adapt as an alternative.\n\nMany Thanks!\n\n"
