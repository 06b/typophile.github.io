Can anyone lead me to a similar font?\n\nI'm attaching a picture from the cover of the movie \"Exposed\".... it's the pink lettering.\n\nThanks VERY much in advance for any leads.\n\nBest,  \nRyan\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214114748im_/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_4476.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [photo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214114748/http:/typophile.com/files/photo_2.jpg) | 95.86 KB |\n\n",

I've never used one myself, and I still don't understand how these \"brushes\" even interfaced with a computer, since they don't seem to have any wires, and wireless technology wasn't really that big back then.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

You might be able to adapt Letraset's [Rapier](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214114748/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/rapier/) which is a late '80s design.\n\nAlso look through all these scripts by:  \n [Rob Leuschke](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214114748/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/leuschke/rob/),  \n [Charles Borges de Oliveira](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214114748/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/borges-de-oliveira/charles/)  \n [Sudtipos](http://web.archive.org/web/20111214114748/http:/www.myfonts.com/foundry/sudtipos/)\n\nYour example looks as if it was done in some kind of crayon or pastel. If you want this exact look it will be even harder to match with a digital font. You might be better off getting a few different script fonts and use them as a starting point to draw your own lettering.\n\n"
