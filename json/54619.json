      "content": "The font used for \"Arabic calligraphy gallery\" doesn't really suggest calligraphy to me. Think about using a font that captures more of that \"hand-written\" aesthetic. Also think about reducing the size of the text for the gallery location and breaking it into 2 lines and centered. Also consider spelling out the dates (i.e. Feb should be spelled out as February). This will make it look and feel more formal. I don't know what your final poster size will be but also consider making a vertical list and centering the artists names - almost like movie credits. Hope this helps.\n\n"
