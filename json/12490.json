I know that Jonathan and Tobias designed a lot of custom fonts for Martha and I wonder if they did not create this one. I will contact them and see what they say. It does seem so familiar, but I’ve not been able to figure it out either.\n\nI’ll keep coming back, hope to find a definite answer.\n\nBest,  \nMara\n\n"
