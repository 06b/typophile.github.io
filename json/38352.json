What they do is essentially providing promotion / trade fair / modelling personnel to large companies. The logo is intended to work in both German and English. Please have a look at it and tell me what you like or don’t like and what could be improved. (BTW: I am planning to remove the drop shadow...).

      "content": "The 3-D effect is inconsistent - in more than one way. First, the gradient suggest the letters are on a curved surface, yet they’re not slightly warped as they should be — if you put a chess board on a spherical surface, the squares won’t be square any more, right? Second, the letters “DOCK” are plain white without any gradient, which is wrong — just like the black background, even originally plain white area get a gradient if the surface isn’t flat.\n\n3-D effects are tricky to get right, and they’re guaranteed to give you headaches to get printed right. So unless your logo is primarily used on screen (which doesn’t seem to be the case according to your description), you should re-think at least three times if it’s worth the trouble.\n\n"

So the PROMO is like a plug that will go into the DOCK socket. (But maybe the designer should take this misreading as a warning.)\n\nIt’s odd - I feel like the gradient on PROMO is very dated looking (in a kind of early-80s-Radio-Shack home-computer-ad way), and the one around DOCK is very trendy looking (kind of iPhonish).\n\n"

A cutout would reveal the inside edge of the cut — which isn’t there (or maybe it is, but the image is \\*way\\* too small for me to see it — why do so many people post poststamp-sized image for critique as if to make sure that the details are lost?).\n\n"

The word “sophistication” should be used to describe an inevitably complex solution to a complex problem. Obviously, that requires great skill. But the more basic and more important skill is to recognize how complex the problem is in the first place. Intentionally aiming for a solution that is more complex than the problem itself, is — without exception — a very wrong course.\n\n"

It’s just that I’m aware that my current logo needs some improvement but I don’t know exactly which one! That’s probably because I’m not as experienced in logo design as guys are.\n\n(By the way, my favourite logo is the McDonalds logo. It’s probably the simplest logo I know. And that’s exactly why it’s so instantly recognisable all over the world.)\n\nSo, any more ideas on how to improve my logo? Any input is much appreciated!\n\n"

Throw this iteration out and think about the logo again from scratch. Who is the audience? What do you want them to think of when they see the logo? Are there any other businesses providing the same service? What do their logos say to you? &c.\n\nAfter you’ve done this, start sketching on paper.\n\n- Lex\n\n"

The implications above are that anything that is sophisticated is therefore complex, and anything complex, that is executed well, is therefore sophisticated. I’ve seen plenty of good design that is complex, yet not sophisticated. I feel sophistication is more like elegance or boldness. While it is a trait often desired, it is not inherent in every (good, complex) design, nor should it be. Similarly, elegance is something to be admired, but it is not necessarily appropriate in every situation.\n\n\\>Are they sophisticated or simple?  \nI think your list includes many logos that are both, and some that are one or the other (easyJet, for example, while simple, is more casual than sophisticated).\n\nI agree with hola that the font choice is a little too heavy. Maybe even try a serif? Although knowing more about the company and its personality would certainly help.\n\n"

However, something that is highly developed doesn’t have to be complex (nor does it have to be sophisticated, for that matter). I just don’t think one can pass judgment on the sophistication of a mark based simply on its relative complexity or simplicity. That is a completely separate matter, IMHO.\n\n"
