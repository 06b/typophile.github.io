  "content": "In the classic poster from 1979, Jack Summerford promoted the 'new' typeface ITC Garamond by typesetting the word 'Helvetica' in the serif face. I always found this to be quite funny even though I have issues with how Garamond looks - it's an interesting look into the discourse on type that was going on in that period.\n\nI have attempted to recreate this 1979 classic on a t-shirt - it can be found here: [http://www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat](http://web.archive.org/web/20110325135012/http:/www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat \"http://www.cafepress.com/teapotthecat\")\n\n",

      "content": "Because we are such type geeks, we forget the bigger picture sometimes.\n\n_Switzerland’s official name is Confoederatio Helvetica (Latin for “Helvetic Confederation”), which is frequently translated in English as Swiss Confederation. The Helvetii, an ancient Celtic people who occupied what is now western Switzerland, were defeated by the Roman army of Julius Caesar in the 1st century bc. As a province of Rome, the region became known as Helvetia. The name Confoederatio Helvetica, an ethnically and linguistically neutral term that recalls this ancient history, is testimony to an enduring desire to forge unity among a diverse population._\n\nCharles Heatwole, B.A., M.S., Ph.D.  \nProfessor of Geography, Hunter College, New York. He is author of _Switzerland: Confoederatio Helvetica_ and coauthor of _Geography for Travel and Tourism_.\n\nSo unless you are intending to show a specimen of the typeface Helvetica, setting the official name \"HELVETICA\" using Helvetica is actually a design cliché... nothing that we visually sophisticated typophiles would dream of. ;-)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110325135012im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Helvet_Chemica.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20110325135012im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Helvet_Aqua.gif)\n\n"
