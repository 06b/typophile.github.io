  "content": "I'm wondering if it's possible to script any advanced features. Primarily I'm looking to solve a specific problem, but more generally I'm curious if more can be done with OT scripting than the standard \"sub\" script to replace one glyph with an other.\n\nI'm tired of people over-hyphens so I wanted to script a fix for that, so in the standard ligatures I put the following code:  \nsub comma hyphen by comma\\_endash;\n\nThis replaces the comma followed by a hyphen with a ligature glyph where I have a comma followed by a line which is in between the hyphen and the en dash in length, which is more appropriate for denoting prices ($50,–).\n\nNow I want to do the same fix for \"x\" after numbers, so every time an /x is typed after a number it's automatically replaced by a multiply symbol. Unfortunately I'm unable to script this accordingly. Every time I try to generate the font, it aborts because of an error in the script. Now, I'm not sure if my code is appropriate for numbers. I'm trying the following:  \nsub one x by one multiply;\n\nI suppose it's possible to replace 1 followed by x by a '1×' \"ligature\" like in the comma/hyphen example but I need the code to be much more flexible because it's not realistic to create such a \"ligature\" for all numbers from all number sets, and with this method it's no longer affected by tracking. So is there a way to define that the /x is automatically replaced by the multiply symbol when preceded by a number? If I can't script this for all numbers automatically, is it possible to script it for each number specifically without having to rely on the ligature method described above? Is this function possible at all?\n\n",

Years ago you might have said this is the editor's job but an automatic solution is much more practical and elegant and I think you would have admitted to that then.\n\nThe more usable spell checkers highlight the word as you're typing to provide an immediate indication that a change was made and to give the author the option of changing it back. The author also has the option of turning off the spell checker or adding custom spellings.\n\nIf someone could come up with a way to do much the same thing with the same kind of user control and sophistication on the kinds of problems that you're referring to, that would be great. For example, if I could chose to have my text checked and/or corrected against the Associated Press Stylebook or the Chicago Manual of Style I'd be all for it. Unfortunately, OpenType scripting (or whatever it might be called) isn't really robust or extensive enough for something this complex.\n\nAnyway, many of these kinds of issues really are just matters of style — they're not necessarily right or wrong. Also, many are contextual in the sense that they might not always be appropriate. For example, substituting an en dash for a hyphen between two numbers would be great if the en dash is meant to indicate the missing numerical range. On the other hand, an en dash would be inappropriate between, say, the numerals in a telephone number. Likewise, 633 - 244 might be part of an equation or it might be a sequence in a serial number. Similarly, the sequence of a comma and an end quote mark is typically reversed in British and American style.\n\nI'm intrigued by what you have in mind, but you'd need to be very judicious in the implementation and aware of the limitations. You wouldn't want to inadvertently cause a bigger problem than you solved.\n\n"

      "content": "One example of a similar mechanism not doing what it is supposed to do: When you type ' (U+0027), MS Word AutoCorrect will try to guess if this is supposed to be a single opening quotation mark (after a space) or a single closing quotation mark (after any character other than a space). Apostrophes are treated like closing quotation marks, but that’s not a problem—in English. In German, single closing quotation marks and apostrophes are not represented by the same character ’ (U+2019). Rather, apostrophes are ’ (U+2019), as in English, whereas single closing quotation marks are ‘ (U+2018). But AutoCorrect can’t tell. You could try to come up with a better substitution rule (based on the character that follows). As long as that doesn’t happen, each and every German-language document created in MS Word with AutoCorrect switched on will have the single closing quotation marks wrong.\n\nI would also advise against trying to improve the microtypography of a text through OpenType features, for two reasons: First, Murphy’s Law. Second, this kind of replacements will screw up the encoding of the text. It will lead to glyphs being replaced by other glyphs that don’t belong to the underlying character. This would also have the undesirable effect that, when you replace your typeface by another, all typographical ‘improvements’ will be lost. If you want to promote rule adherence on the microtypographical level, write a script for InDesign that performs replacements (like the ones you have in mind) on the character level. Many typesetters have created such scripts for themselves, but if you come up with something that’s cleverer and more comprehensive, there would certainly be a market for that.\n\n"
