Friends come along for a few weeks at a time. It's all documented on his website for The Typo Eradication Assistance League (Teal) :  \n [http://www.jeffdeck.com/teal/blog/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018104811/http:/www.jeffdeck.com/teal/blog/ \"http://www.jeffdeck.com/teal/blog/\") ”\n\n",

I wanted to go along for the ride.\n\nI can't help but spot typos in anything and everything I read. It's enough to make me stop reading a book, when I find too many typos.\n\nBut it's hilarious when businesses get their own phone numbers and email addresses wrong. When looking around for editing work, I've gotten return emails declining my services, even though their text is chock full o' typos.\n\nBy the way, I'm new to this site. Your forum gave me a great answer when I was looking for the right way to abbreviate \"circa.\" I couldn't find the answer in my paper _Chicago_ style manual, but your member oldnick could.
