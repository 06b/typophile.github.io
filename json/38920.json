It is by no means intended as an improvement or replacement of the original Neutraface, but as an expansion of the original concept. Neutra’s highly sought-after residential and commercial designs have stood the test of time, as will the typography that bears his name.\n\n[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=612](http://web.archive.org/web/20071211090259/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=612 \"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=612\")\n\nCLICK HERE TO SAVE BIG MONEY ON THE  \nCOMPLETE NEUTRAFACE COLLECTION!\n\n[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=619](http://web.archive.org/web/20071211090259/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=619 \"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=619\")  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nALEXANDER GIRARD BLOCKS ARE IN STOCK!\n\nLooking for the perfect holiday gift?
