  "content": "Fellow typophiles,\n\nNext tuesday (november 28th) I’ve got my admission interview at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague, The Netherlands. I think I’m going to be alright, but I haven’t got the slightest on what I can expect. I’ve got a good portfolio I think. I have lots of sketches in there, not just final products. I heard admission commitees like sketches. Apparently the creation process is more important than the final product, which I think is rubbish... but hey, if they want sketches, they’ll get them.\n\nBut otherwise, I don’t know what will happen, and I’m quite nervous. I suppose most of you have attended some form of formal art education in the past, so I was wondering wether anyone of you had any suggestions or pointers?\n\nKind regards,\n\nWouter Spaak  \nNijmegen, The Netherlands\n\n",

Then end with a jerk - a piece to leave an impression with the reviewer.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "Also a question on volume of my portfolio... Though I’ve gathered some fifty-odd pieces I’m actually content with, I’ve only included fifteen or so works in my portfolio, mainly because I didn’t have enough time to write a detailed description for fifty pieces before it went off to the printer’s. Is fifteen enough, or should I just have entered everything?\n\n"

      "content": "Get in contact with current students and ask them about the admissions department. Its a great way to find out what the people working there want to see (or not see!), for example, if they’re going to expect you to have some good figure drawings in the portfolio it’s best to know that ahead of time.\n\nHere in the states most schools want to see twelve to twenty pieces, and it’s usually a good idea for at least half of them to be at least 18”x24” in size.\n\nLastly, don’t show anime/manga styled work unless it’s outstanding. Art school admissions departments throw away piles of anime/manga portfolios every day because they get so much of it, and art teachers don’t like teaching kids who believe that line art is the ultimate achievement of human civilization.\n\n"
