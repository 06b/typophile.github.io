I saw you marked the ID to show MVB Bossa Nova, but we can waste a lot of time getting fussy about sources. I agree with Grant, who I think understood why I said Adobe. Are we going to need to add foundry abbreviations (like MVB in this case) to every ID we make, so we need to add MT, ITC, LT, BT, P22, etc, to every name? That's going to be tedious and hair-splitting, in my opinion. People just want to know the name of the font, and someplace they can get it. Do we need to list every source too?\n\nI'm not trying to make a big issue out of this, but it seems like Grant's question was answered without the added comment, because Adobe calls the font 'MVB Bossa Nova'.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
