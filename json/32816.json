  "content": "Before graduating from MassArt last May, I spent a semester (and then some) working on an experimental wood typeface design / production project. The project was recently selected to be featured in a [Contemporary Letterpress](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317173530/http:/www.mcla.edu/Gallery51/0703/) exhibition, so I figured it would be a good time to put all my process together for others to see.  \nYou can read more than you probably ever would want to at [nicksherman.com/design/Intercut](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317173530/http:/www.nicksherman.com/design/Intercut).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317173530im_/http:/typophile.com/files/print-AOEG_RHN-both-680_6558.jpg)\n\n",

It was intriguing to me that there are someone who actually like letters carved in wood; is interested on them beyond their forms, not digital, where they are more then a idea. They ARE, not only as letter forms : They are tangible. Exist, and occupy their own physical space.\n\nPraise!\n\n"
