  "content": "Hi Everyone, I am looking for suggestions for a font that I can use in designing a logo for a sports bar. I am trying not to use any actual sports reference, ie. a baseball or basketball.I wanted to get it across with a really great font. Any type of sports theme is fine.  \nAny suggestions are welcome, I have been searching for hours and have not come up with a great one.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

      "content": "Its a sports bar for all sports, it has a TV at every booth to watch any game and it is in the Philly area. I used a few of the script fonts and I agree they do remind me of baseball. I tried using the blocky ones as well but didn't like the outcome. The problem I am having is that my design style is more simple and clean cut and the guy wants something very loud. So I am trying to balance it. I am also finding it difficult since I can't focus on a specific sport.\n\n"
