I’d like something else for everything else (pull quotes, etc.), and I was thinking about [P22’s Operina](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329212523/http:/www.p22.com/ihof/operinapro.html)… it feels a little like a clash though. Can anyone recommend some substitutions (for any of the three but especially Operina)?\n\nMany thanks,  \nZach.\n\n",
