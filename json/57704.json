This typeface is the visual representation of the character Ina within the story.\n\nLooking for any critique and tips on Opentype as I'd like to include a few ligatures in the future.\n\nThanks!\n\np.s. I have a Flickr set with a few photos of development [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317223858/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/doubleyoudoubleyoudot/sets/72157615005997770/)\n\n",
