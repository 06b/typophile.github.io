I guess it could be further thinned by adding negative (white) stroke. The shapes also are close to [Interstate Thin](http://web.archive.org/web/20100329014009/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/interstate_thin_ot/?&sample_text=GROUND%20MAPLES&update=0), which is closer to the weight here.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
