It consisted of a series of short essays on a number of (English) Monotype typefaces in use at Cambridge. The essays on individual types were set in the type in question. There was also a general essay on Monotype's type development up to 1922. The author was [Stanley Morison](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215164341/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Stanley%20Morison). As a source of strictly accurate historical material, the book is not always to be relied upon: there are elements of publicity and of self-publicity which are not always consistent with strict historical accuracy. (For instance, it is widely believed that the account Morison gives of the design of [Times New Roman](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215164341/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Times%20New%20Roman) is not to be accepted at face value; nor his account of the design of [Bembo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131215164341/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Bembo) italic.) Nevertheless, the book is a useful and interesting source of information on Monotype faces in the first half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn 1973 a revised edition was produced by CUP, with contributions from P M Handover, Netty Hoeflake, Harry Carter, Nicholas Baker and John Dreyfus which added essays on some additional typefaces, and included some notes which added to, or corrected, Morison's essays.\n\nA third edition, a facsimile of the second but with a new introduction by Mike Parker, was published by David R Godine in 1999.\n\n",
