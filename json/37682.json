  "content": "Hi, kind of a type ID request. I'm looking for typefaces that are similar in vein to the \"Chocolat\" script part of Hotel Chocolat, but aren't obviously the same. It would be very much appreciated if anybody could steer me in the direction of some \"nice\" cursive /script typefaces.\n\nCheers  \n1981\n\n[http://typophile.com/files/hc.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102204427/http:/typophile.com/files/hc.gif \"http://typophile.com/files/hc.gif\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hc.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131102204427/http:/typophile.com/files/hc.gif) | 5.27 KB |\n\n",
