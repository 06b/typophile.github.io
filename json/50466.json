  "content": "Let’s talk about about Plantin’s Reale Romaine ( Also known as Van den Keere’s Paragon Roman )\n\nI found it today on page 253 of “16th century printing types” by H. D. L. Vervliet, 1968.\n\nAccording to Jan Middendorp in Dutch Type it has inspired Fred Smeijers ( Arnhem?), And Tobias Frere Jones’ Poyntner Oldstyle, and Frank van Blokland.\n\nI would love to see the face in use somewhere. I have one book listed: Rariorum aliquot stirpium historia, by C Clusius in 1576. Do you know of others? What techniques or resources would you use to find others?\n\nThanks!\n\n [‹ Elegant slab serifs](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192336/http:/typophile.com/node/50501 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How much to charge for book design ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081018192336/http:/typophile.com/node/29544 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

But yes, Renard was inspired by Van den Keere, not Arnhem. (Arnhem traces its roots to Romain du Roi and neo-classical styles, not Dutch oldstyle.)\n\n— K.\n\n"

(Got this at an ATypI auction almost a decade ago.)\n\nThere is a showing of a Reale Romaine, and the annotation explains: “One of the best Romans cut by Hendrik van den Keere. He cut it for Plantin in 1575. [citation] ... No use outside the Plantinian office is known to us.”\n\nReale seems to be between Ascendonica and Parangonne in size, approx. 21 pts.\n\nShall I presume that you’re looking for a hi-res image? I could porbably make time later this week. Contact me offline.\n\n— Kent.\n\n"
