But I am reasonably happy with what I came up with.\n\nI think if I looked long enough I would be able to see some faults with the design, but for the time being it will stay as it is (I'm not going into business any time soon I don't thin).\n\nI am just wondering what might be some suggestions for slight/major alterations and just general thoughts on what I have designed.\n\nThanks for any thoughts.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100124082415im_/http:/typophile.com/files/LogoForm_Final_3918.png)\n\n",
