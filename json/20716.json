      "content": "Explain the name. Why light? Like light weight (not powerful)? What does the mark after the name mean? Would anyone know what it meant without an explaination? I think this first version makes lux look weak (almost industrial, boring). I doubt that is the image you want the company to have.\n\nYou have two problems the concept is weak and the execution is weak.\n\nOne last question. Isn’t fashion and modeling about style and substance?\n\n"

The junction of the vertical and curve on the u is taking the attention a bit you could try raising the outside curve of the serif a touch, see if you can lighten it. As for the kerning ux could be a little bit tighter but really doesn’t need much in my view.  \nTim\n\n"
