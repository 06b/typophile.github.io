I know I've seen it many times before – just can't recall the name.\n\nI need it urgently so any information on the foundry or image source would be much appreciated.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nscarlett\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [ornament mystery.GR\\_.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20120415220533/http:/typophile.com/files/ornament%20mystery.GR_.jpg) | 124.47 KB |\n\n",
