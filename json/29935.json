  "content": "G’day people,\n\nI’m desiging a layout for a textbook-type work and I want to use two serifs in the opening chapter pages (Janson text for body and Linotype Centennial for heads) for me it seems OK because the head and the body have a lot of space B/W them, for the intextheads I’m considering meta so there isn’t that clash. What are your thoughts? Is it ever OK to mix serifs in this way, what do you think of my font-choice?  \ncheers\n\n—N\n\n [‹ Which serif for FF Milo Text?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180917/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29904 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Logo critique... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080628180917/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29890 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

It will take someone with better eyes to tell you if they’re working or not, but I can give you a bit of hope. For every rule concerning what can & can’t or should & shouldn’t be done with type, there are many exceptions. If you’re interested and haven’t already been through it, Bringhurst has a chapter on choosing & combining typefaces in _The Elements of Typographic Style_. In the forward to the book, RB writes “By all means break the rules, and break them beautifully, deliberately, and well. That is one of the ends for which they exist.”\n\nWhat is the font size for your body text by the way? Could just be my display or perhaps I’m just getting tired, but it’s pushing the limits of legibility on my screen.\n\n"
