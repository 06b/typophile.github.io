As to how good it is, that must be judged in the context of the product it labels, and it's not a logo for MTV. It is sober, with reminders of a long history, but with a contemporary air. All that it does admirably well. Its only shortcoming in my eyes is that it could be more elegant, given the look of the cars.\n\n"

The M is squash in the middle, but it doesn't feel forced, even though in other fonts it would be slightly to the left. YOu can see in the background of pictures they played with the idea of a stronger M, but in this case it's subtle, like a grounding force, sturdy. Not a bad image to give off.\n\n_«El futuro es una línea tan fina que apenas nos damos cuenta de pintarla nosotros mismos». (La Luz Oscura, por Javier Guerrero)_\n\n"

      "content": "Frankly, although the lettering is quite lovely, I find it to be a non-identifier. I don't see it as distinctive enough to act as a logo. It just looks like a word set in a traditional looking typeface. The typeface does not seem to suit the company, either. It may make a lovely titling face for a book but I can't imagine it cast in metal and chrome on a car. If this is a logo, it should be more evocative of the company and the products instead of just blending into the world of book typography.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Daimler AG (uses Corporate S typeface) is actually parent company that incorporates Mercedes-Benz (uses Corporate A), Daimler Trucks, but also Daimler Financial Services (formerly DaimlerChrysler bank, using Corporate E). Anyway, as Chris pointed out, it is undistinctive, IMHO does not work that well with former elements of identity, and for the money...well, quite poor. DaimlerChrysler identity including logo, Corporate typeface trilogy and design principles was really great and very sophisticated. This one is not. Maybe balanced, sober or whatsoever, but neither beautiful & balanced, nor beautifully sober, nor outstanding or memorable.\n\n"

If it were for a toy company, it would be fine. I just don't think it suits the brand. I predict that it will be changed within a few years.\n\n"
