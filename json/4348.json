I've never seen this font before but they are used in a logotype.   \n   \nSo there is the possibility that they are custom.   \n   \nThanks in advance for your help!   \nAdam   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124647im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33804.jpg)\n\n",

I think the add-on swash is just that, and it looks too light for the font strokes (IMO). A little outline tweaking would account for most other variations from the original font, I think.\n\n"
