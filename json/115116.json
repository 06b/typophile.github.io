Need to dig more.  \nFor the 3 other bottom ones, I really couldn't tell at this size. The first line could be Helvetica Neue. The second line is a mix of a typewriter (Courier?) and serif, Italic and Bold (Times?).\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Ryuk, Gravostyle is an interesting choice but to my eye, the \\_A\\_ is a little too narrow, the \\_d\\_ looks a little too boxy and the tail on the l and t seem a trifle short. Optimo's design note: \"Gravostyle is designed after the basic cut of the generic Swiss engraving font system.\" None of the engraving machine fonts for which I have samples are any closer. Anyway, I doubt anyone would notice if Gravostyle was used as a substitute.  \nDon\n\n"

Actually, don't know many 'condensed rounded sans' with such a spurred single storey /a... Which finally could appear to be an alternate glyph...  \nIt has also an architectural/engineering/Leroy Lettering feeling like [Bryant Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053800/http:/processtypefoundry.com/fonts/bryant-condensed), [Planscribe](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053800/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/planscribe-nf), [TGL 0-16](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053800/http:/www.dafont.com/tgl-0-16.font), [Rendering](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053800/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/rendering) (no lowercases unfortunately) and so... A good one too is [Simpliciter Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317053800/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/cercurius/simpliciter-sans).\n\n"
