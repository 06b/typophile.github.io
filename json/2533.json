  "content": "So I've been wondering, when is it OK to use a name for a font that's already in use? Clearly you don't want to mess with that frothing-bastard-foundry in Chicago, but \"Leviathan\" for example is used just fine both by Hoefler and Agfa-Monotype. I can see practical problems when/if multiple fonts share a name on MyFonts for example, and I understand that the legal aspect can't be totally ignored, but I'm looking for some accounts of real-life experiences.   \n   \nIn case you're wondering, specifically I'm debating if I should bother using \"Pantagruel\", which is being used by Scriptorium (at least). What's another good classical name for a really big guy?   \n   \nhhp\n\n [‹ San Francisco: Typographic Tourism](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608023306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2531 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Typophile appreciation thread ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080608023306/http:/www.typophile.com/node/2470 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

According to the indispensable \"The Crossbow\" (Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey, 1903)\\* a mangonel is a very large _catapult_, not a trebuchet. And I'm note sure which tended to _weigh_ more, but the trebuchet certainly was much taller and had a longer range.   \n   \n\\* BTW, a careful reading of that book seems to indicate that the trebuchet was actually invented by Archimedes for the defense of his home town (which it did admirably), but was then lost to time until the Middle Ages - so it's much older than people say.   \n   \n\\> too long and difficult   \n   \nBut doesn't that make them more \"thought-worthy\"?
