  "content": "I grew up in Thailand and spent more than half of my reading time on   \nThai & Thai translated version of Japanese comics.   \nNow I've been in London for several months and have begun to   \nenjoy reading western comics very much.   \n   \nIn western (DC, Marvel) handwriting-like all caps are so common.   \nI think this is an attempt to preserve the look & feel of hand lettering.   \n   \nBut in Japanese comics (Manga) they often use formal, serif-like typefaces.   \nI don't understand the reason behind this but when I see   \nEnglish translated version of manga with western comic style typefaces,   \nI can feel some contradiction there.   \n   \nJust wanna hear some opinions on this issue.\n\n",

      "content": "Comics were originally handlettered because it was cheaper. Now that look is just tradition. Some comics (EC for instance, making classic horror comics) didn't use this handlettering, though.   \nI think a reason for sticking with the handwritten look is that the texts in comics mostly represent speech. Lettereres (if you can still call them that) also use different styles/balloons/colours and whatever for different characters. Look at Neil Gaiman's 'Sandman' for instance. (Embarrasing that I don't know the name of the letterer.)   \nA funny thing is that comics usually are lettered in all caps, except when representing small sounds like 'Oh' and 'Uck'. there are also two types of 'I' in comic book typography, one with serifs, only used for first person stuff like 'I'm going down to the pub to get legless' and one without serifs for everything else.\n\n"

Or just the one you couldn't actually read.\n\n"

Their horror comics were lettered using lettering templates, which is what gives them their distinctive look.   \n   \nThe Comics Code, which came down hard on EC, had an interesting effect on EC's _Mad_. They changed the format early on calling it a magazine instead of a comic book, thereby exempting themselves from the Comic Code. To make it look less like a comic book, all the word balloons were typeset (in News Gothic).\n\n"

      "content": "Comic books are an interesting case because legibility is always prime in the lettering: the different roles of inker, letterer, etc keep personality down to a comfortable minimum. Contrast comic book lettering with comic strip lettering and one thing is readily apparent: personality of the strip is very present in the lettering (until it is turned into a font, though this statement is very open to debate). Imagine Winsor McKay lettering in Comic Sans or the EC template...   \n   \nPlus, did you ever notice that American strips printed overseas oftentimes mimic the English handlettering? I seem to recall some Calvin & Hobbes in French that were this way...\n\n"
