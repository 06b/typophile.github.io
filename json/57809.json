All you have to do is go to [YubNub.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/) and type in \"tphile\" and then whatever you want to search for (make sure you use quotes for any phrases). YubNub is extremely useful when you [install it in your search or address bar](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/documentation/describe_installation), so I can now search Typophile quickly from any browser window. Other useful typographic search commands include [myfonts](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=myfonts), [fontshop](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=fontshop), [fontshopadv](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=fontshopadv), [veertype](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=veertype), and [adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108051035/http:/yubnub.org/kernel/man?args=adobe).\n\n"
