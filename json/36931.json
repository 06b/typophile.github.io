If dyslexia you should follow this thread: [http://www.typophile.com/node/36906](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019001714/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36906 \"http://www.typophile.com/node/36906\")\n\nIn case of dyslexia I would not do so because of the way shapes and colour is perceived by a dyslexic.\n\nWhy do so in the first place? It reduces legibility and makes it harder even for those without difficulties.\n\n"

In what context?\n\nI think reversed type is useful on-screen. I wouldn't do it a lot on paper, but that's not based on any specific accessibility guideline that I'm aware of.\n\n"
