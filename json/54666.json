As for United, what, nobody else ever gets to publish an all caps face in multiple weights just because someone else did? Should everybody stop drawing multi-weight sans families because of Univers? Should the development of serif families have stopped in the 1930s when ATF and Linotype were done expanding Cheltenham?\n\nWhen I said this was an original I design, I meant that I sat down and designed all the characters myself without basing the design on an existing face. I even worked without a reference photo of the painted lettering that gave me the idea. And I think that is original. No it isn’t a paradigm shift or some unprecedented idea like Frutiger was, but I’m not claiming it is.\n\n"

      "content": "Back to the font design...\n\n_• I’m not sure that 100 really represents a good starting point. Should this face start at a heavier weight?_\n\nMaybe so - at the lightest weight the change in weight that happens on the strokes with a curved outside contour and a straight counter (e.g.. top/bottom of the round letters) is a little distracting, though perhaps with a touch less weight and a touch less overshoot they might work. But the blockiness really shows well in the thicker cuts.\n\n_• I am especially interested in knowing what people think of the figures and the letter B_\n\nThe figures, again, work better as the weight gets heavier, in general. If you didn't already, I might try reversing the straights/curves on the bowls of 3 and 5 to see how that looks (so the curve is on the lower side and the bottom is flat, compare P). A 2 that looks more like a backwards S might be worth trying, too. My eye kind of wants an upper serif on 3 (compare 2 or C) to fill in that counter space (same on 7 would be a possibility).\n\n4's diagonal looks slight to me throughout. I like 6 and 9 in the heavy weights a lot.\n\nB seems out of character - that notch seems like it's from another font (true of & too), and I expect the counters to have a curved side like PR. I'd look for another solution.\n\nB also seems very close to 8, and D to O, but I can see the argument that in a display face like this context will usually sort out those confusions.\n\n§ is a nice solution; £ needs work.\n\nRe: lowercase, I can see the blockiness of this arguing for a caps-only font. But I can also see the quasi-hexagonal foundation of it fitting lowercase letterforms well (think of fraktur minuscules).\n\n"

This has a bit of a Constructivist feel (or maybe I'm imagining things :-) ). I can see it working very well on posters and flyers, or maybe magazine headlines.\n\nI agree this gets really strong the bolder it gets, but I can see the usefulness of lighter ones as well. I wouldn't chuck out that 100 just yet.\n\nThe glyphs with the curved tops & bottoms are startling me slightly as well. Do they look tall? The \"C\" definitely seems larger than the \"D\". Maybe those could do with a bit less overshoot?\n\nYou asked about the \"B\", and in fact it was the first thing that caught my eye. I was wondering why it didn't have the curves that \"S\" has. I see you did the same thing in the \"8\" and the ampersands, but I agree with Craig that it looks a bit like it'd belong to another font.\n\nSpeaking of curves & angles, I was also wondering about the notch on the right side of the \"3\" – that looks \\*extremely\\* angular compared to say the \"6\" and \"2\".  \nOn the other hand, I'm wondering if the curve on the bottom of the \"2\" may be too soft.\n\nThe \"J\" looks a bit clunky.\n\nI love the \"K\"!\n\nIs the \"M\" a bit too heavy?\n\nThe tail of the \"Q\" looks a bit like it's embarrassed to be there :-) (though less so in the bolder weights). It could be bolder in my eyes – not bolder as in heavier, but as in, more daring. Also, did you try a (more) horizontal terminal on that?\n\nThe \"W\" looks a bit uncomfortable in the heaviest weight. The bottom looks quite tapered, but the apex seems very dark. Can you still make it wider or would that be too much?\n\nI think the second ampersand fits better with the font – the first one looks a bit forced to me, and produces that awkward little corner on the inside.  \nHow about making the top of the second ampersand curved?\n\nYou might try an Euro sign with just one crossbar. That's not standard / intended, but I believe it can read quite well, and would let you keep a bold weight on the crossbar. (I wouldn't know if that works for the Yen, too, though.)\n\nThanks for sharing this, James. I'm looking forward to seeing it progress. It does look yummy. :-)\n\n"

      "content": "For me this has a lot of problems.\n\nFirst, I don't see a coherent design. The DRP don't seem to have a reason to be flat on top and round on the side when the others are sort of the other way around. I say sort of because the verticals on the DRP are rounded inside and out, whereas the horizontals on the OSCG are round outside and straight inside. And the B is neither here nor there.\n\nSecond, the weights of the horizontal strokes on the OSCG seem to be clunky compared to the verticals that are straight on both sides. I don't know if this can be resolved by keeping the shapes and changing the weights, because the strokes are so different.\n\nMaybe you can make it work if you take the idea of the DRP and make the others consistent with it.\n\nBut in any case, I think this design would greatly benefit from being reworked to be more coherent.\n\n"

Every design you make is likely to be something you later regret in some way or even completely simply because you learn more and have better insight. Without pretending to judge James' design in that this context I do think it is worth asking if your design adds something or is just a \"me too\" design. But not necessarily too early in the process. You have to have room to see where something ends up going. Let it run a little.\n\nJames - my take is that optically speaking if the curved forms begin their curves closer to the interior of the letters they will \"jump about\" less. Some of that jumpiness it their charm really so you would have to make a choice. But if you feel it's too much that might be one way to turn down the effect.\n\nWhat about letting the bottom bowl of the B be larger? I think a boxier top to the A will integrate with the others better. V too. Wider forms for split letters like s B R etc might work better too. Other letters too. If C is reference ( just for the sake of arguement ) Look at the K It might be the same width or wider but it feels narrower. So I would expand it's width a little.\n\nI don't know if this stuff will work but it might be worth a go.\n\n"

Take a look at your first line and the word \"INVISIBLE\" and you will see Shilow, The Marne, and Normandy's blood-stained battlefields. compare the N, B, S, V, E, & L. There is precious little room to accomodate the color problems with the stroke weight.  \nThe N is too wide to feel at home with the rest but narrowing it brings the typical angle impingement of the diagonal. You will need some creative trickery to make a family resemblance out of that combination. Compare the crotch of the V with the N and see how they need to relate more. You solved the V by tapering the diagonals but this fights the monoline feel of the rest. The S and B are quite bolder than the rest and the horizontals on the E make for a tough sell next to the B perhaps the E then is too wide. I have done battle in this genre several times but still can't tell you an easy fix. I can only say that you have to cheat on stroke widths and sidebearings to get a happy marriage going.  \nKeep at it, you may or may not find a good solution but whatever happens, you will certainly learn a great deal about type design in the process.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

Unfriendly, nonconstructive critique offers no integrity, thus can be ignored.\n\nI look forward to seeing the completed version.\n\n"
