I'll sleep on this and post back if manage to get a more concrete answer.\n\n"

I love the interplay of the light and dark. I love the fact that someone took the time to create a a set of these varying shapes that have the same theme, so they work together. I love the craftsmanship and care that go into a beautiful typeface. And the, that person (or team) goes on the create other weights and versions of that same theme.\n\nI love to look at the details of a typeface. The way the designer decided to have terminals flare a certain way, how the serifs are shaped, if it has long or short ascenders and descenders.\n\nI love Jim Parkinson's translation of hand painted lettering to a typeface. I love H&FJ's studious interpretations of historic faces. I love Hermann Zapf's way of putting a little calligraphy into each typeface.\n\nI love Ron Arnholm for making me love type more than I already did.\n\nI love everyone I've ever had a conversation with about kerning, typefaces, the shape of a letter.\n\nI love it all, because there is art, craftsmanship, care, love and commitment involved in all of it.\n\nI love type, because it made me appreciate my dad that much more. He is not a typographer, designer or art director. He is a pilot, and loves everything to do with flight. When I was about 9, my parents had a cookout, and most of the friends who came were also pilots. A small plane flew over, and the pilots stopped talking, looked up, observing the plane. \"It's a Mooney,\" one said. \"His prop is out of pitch,\" said my dad. \"He doesn't have the right prop for that plane,\" said another. This set off an hour long discussion on props. For years after that, I thought \"Who could really care that much about propellers?\" When I was bout 35, I was having a lovely discussion with another AD about serifs, and it dawned on me—serifs are my propellers. And it gave me that much more appreciation for my dad, and his love of flight. And now I even kind of care a bit about props. The funny thing is, for the last 9 years, his love has been sailplanes (gliders)—no props!\n\n"
