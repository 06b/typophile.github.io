You should also read Gerard Unger’s book _While You’re Reading_. It is not directly relevant and will not answer any of your questions, but it will give you a great foundation in understanding what type and reading are, and why they are what they are, which will make it easier to think about where it’s all headed. Last, contact Nick Shinn about his essay _It’s Hip to Be Square_. It’s a great read about why traditional type designs will become less relevant and new type will be square.\n\n"

Then Gone.” [along with the most impressive hand-made typographic experiments I have ever seen.]\n\nIn great depth and consideration, it ponders the simple moments of our lives when we find an arrangement of things, circumstances, interactions, and / or ideas that appear in a fleeting instance as perfectly designed — as if beyond human capability — and then are just as quickly gone from our perceptions. Within that moment, pure beauty is realized in the simplest of forms and it is in this realization that we, as designers, can create the kind of conceptual wonders that you are aiming for.\n\nmartin’s design studio can be found here :: [Appetite Engineers](http://web.archive.org/web/20081203152445/http:/www.appetiteengineers.com/)\n\n"

Sometimes it is easier just to say something in a text message because you’re less likely to strike up a “conversation.”\n\nOne can draw parallels between wireless communication and telepathy. This is how many computers are communicating today, right? So lets just say we begin merging our technology with the human body for the sake of “efficiency” (this is already happening on a small scale). If the biological computations of the human brain were to begin working more like a machine, how would this change human interaction and communication? What if we could communicate using only our minds without actually speaking?\n\nI can’t imagine what this would look like. Would our brains tell us we’re hearing speech, or would we visualize letterforms and text? Or... would it be something else?\n\nI apply this to typography as a craft and I get scatterbrained. Synaptic connections between two brains? What a mess.\n\nForgive me, my imagination poses a lot of questions. Just thoughts.\n\n"

If I can commit myself to one concept, I think my project will be successful.\n\nThat being said, I have narrowed down to a couple of concepts: dimensional typography and bouma shapes.\n\nI know these are nothing new (80s-90s?), but they could be a stepping stone for the future of the craft. It would be nice to leave the current flatness of the Web behind for a more engaging, interactive “environment” in more dimensions than two. Perhaps I can create a typeface that is legible from any angle which can function in a fluid, ever-changing 3D environment. Or maybe I can work on simplifying type into only bouma word-shapes (word shape recognition being the key to speed reading, and therefore, a faster way to assimilate knowledge and information into our hungry minds). If I used bouma shapes, the stress would not be on the invidual characters, so I would have to somehow prove that it is applicable to any word combination.\n\nSomeone is going to scold me for changing my mind... I just know it. My professor (Fo Wilson) supports this move. I feel much more confident in choosing one of the theories from the last paragraph, and they do spark my interest. I am not dismissing any ideas I discussed earlier, I am merely saving for a time when I can do them more justice. I still have a lot to learn about our beloved typographical heritage.

Perhaps the real questions are: what kinds of divergence, and to what degree at the levels both of the glyph and of the alphabet, assist readability? And what kinds and degrees of divergence harm readability by attracting the reader’s attention? Any answers must be largely empirical, though the research will need to be based upon a good understanding of type and typography if it’s to arrive at useful results.
