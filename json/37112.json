He has supplied me with three weights Bold, Regular and Light which shows up in Suitcase X1 as three different fontfiles with working preview. The problem arises when I try using them in InDesign and Illustrator CS3. The regular comes doesn’t show but comes in as an another light. So I get 2 lights and one bold but no regular. What can this be caused by? Is the problem in the building or export of the fontfile in FL or in the Adobe software interpretation of the fontfile?\n\nAnyone know?\n\nJuan Pablo informed me that he is using fontlab 5.\n\n [‹ kern subtable overflow](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141018/http:/typophile.com/node/37295 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [sorting ligatures ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141018/http:/typophile.com/node/37386 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Not very strange, since it’s a big hassle to get it right, hyphen, no hyphen, abbreviation here, space there.

I usually do it like that, and it has worked for me. Maybe Juan Pablo can use it.\n\n"

      "content": "You probably have a naming issue.\n\nIn FontLab, (with the font(s) open), choose “Font Info...” — there are a LOT of choices here, but the important ones are on the first screen: Family name, weight, width, style etc. Set these up for the weights you have, and then go thru the SEVERAL following screens (you can use the little arrow at the top to advance. FontLab is very good a “auto-filling” these (the little diamond icons) for you, but you have to set the initial values up right to begin with. If a auto-fill comes up weird, check your initial values and try again... you CAN override the auto fill, but you should consider using it as a “test”.\n\nFor example: Yous set the family name to “Wacky”; then use the pop-up to set the weight to “Bold” (you can type anything here, but if you want to be consistent with the thousands of faces out there, use one of the pop-up values); tehn set the width to medium(normal). Now use the “Build Style Names” auto-fill to finish the other values, then click to the next screen and click “Build Opentype Names” and so on and so on.\n\nThis should solve your menu problem.\n\nNote that you COULD be having problems with Illustrator/InDesign’s font menu cache as well. Find a copy of Font Finagler and clean out your “old” cache files to fix any lingering menu issues (I have ot run this every month or so to clean out phantom menu items).\n\n"
