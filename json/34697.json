I can only find it in Spanish and German. My German is so rusty I don't look forward to reading it.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n",

      "content": "Thanks to your post I found out about Raúl Rosarivo, so I am grateful for that, George.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that none of his books or articles can be found in English translation -- an Argentine designer, Fabián Carreras, has what looks like [**a very complete Rosarivo bibliography**](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090927/http:/fabiancarreras.com.ar/rmr/bibliografia.htm) on his website.\n\nP.S. On Amazon, he only comes up as [mentioned in three books about type and design, and as the illustrator of a fourth one](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090927/http:/www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-3680925-5180609?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=raul+rosarivo&Go.x=11&Go.y=11&Go=Go).\n\n"

      "content": "There's a discussion of his work in Tschichold's _Form of the Book,_ but Tschichold doesn't go into a lot of detail so I was interested in finding out more about his work on Gutenberg. Rosarivo is evidently the guy responsible for figuring out Gutenberg's page layout. Guess I'll have to try and sharpen up my Geman then.\n\nThanks for the bibliography reference.\n\nGeorge  \nI felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni\n\n"

But I have a feeling it will be hard to find, unless I go to a university library.\n\nP.S. The Tschichold article that George mentions is reproduced [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20131106090927/http:/learning.north.londonmet.ac.uk/epoc/tschichd.htm), by the way.\n\n"
