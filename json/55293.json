U.S. and Canadian style is to place periods and commas inside quotation marks always (double first, single for quotes inside quotes). There are highly unusual exceptions, as in computer code and linguistics, that will surely never affect you.\n\nThe dominant but not sole U.K. style is to place periods and commas inside quotes only if the quote is an actual human utterance. (So no androids!) Otherwise outside. Single-double, not double-single, is the dominant usage.\n\nOther countries can barely get their acts together in the first place, and I don’t know what system they use.\n\nNonetheless, you _cannot_ just pick and choose an orthography based on what you, out of ignorance, think looks nice.\n\n—  \nJoe Clark  \n [http://joeclark.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020152727/http:/joeclark.org/ \"http://joeclark.org/\")\n\n"

That is the thinking behind the UK convention, and it makes a lot of sense.\n\nIt is also helpful to think about it this way: if an entire sentence is a quotation, then all the punctuation of that sentence, including the terminal fullstop, is part of that quotation and hence the fullstop belongs within the quote marks. If a quotation is only part of a sentence, then the terminal full stop belongs to the sentence as a whole and not to the quote, and hence the fullstop belongs outside the quote marks.\n\nMost Canadian practice seems to follow the US model, which I consider arbitrary and without grammatical logic.

It is notable, though, that even within such countries individual publishers, some of them significant and influential, ignore those rules. Recent German spelling reforms are not universally implemented. Some Greek publishers continue to use polytonic despite the monotonic system having been the official rule since 1982.\n\nThere are not, in fact, national rules. There are widely observed conventions and there are also variations. There are indeed rules for e.g. government publications, but in that respect the government is just one more publisher, and other publishers may employ variant rules in their own house styles.\n\nI long ago determined that the prevailing British conventions for punctuation made more grammatical sense and looked better on the page. So that is what I use. This isn't 'ignorance': I know what other conventions are common in Canada. I disagree with them, and I'm not generally in favour of doing what other people do just because they are doing it.\n\n"

When typesetting German, whenever I'm given the liberty by the editor, I employ pre-spelling reform rules rather than the current \"correct\" ones – they simply make more sense grammatically, and in terms of what people are still used to reading. – Different example: in German it is a rule not to set ligatures across word breaks in compounds; but I still do that with certain fonts, depending on the actual design of the ligature, and it works just fine.  \nI believe that knowing the rules and abandoning them in some occasions and for good reasons does not constitute the same crime as ignoring them and just doing whatever.

But if this problem is solved, as Smarty Pants has, then the single-quote style of quote marks doesn't work.\n\nAs the Smarty Pants system is the only way of converting hash marks to curly quotes (short of adding a dictionary) and not rotating the apostrophes used in abbreviations, and it works with the North American quote style, rather than the UK, it is arguable whether the merits of the UK quote style are sufficient to warrant the extinction of the \"single-quote-right\" shape of apostrophe, which will probably occur as a result of \"curly quote\" layout software.\n\n"
