Most of the other sightings are like this one: swift corner manipulation, for a logo or a ‘custom typeface’.  \nAre you planning an unbiased Bowfins Printworks Finger Sans ID Guide?

There is one for the Script Guide, but I didn’t have some of these Sans fonts on it, as they are rather borderline as Scripts, even in my broad definition. I’d like to also get them into the new interactive [Sans Serif Font ID Guide](http://web.archive.org/web/20091203150753/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php), which Jan and I are trying to bring up to date.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
