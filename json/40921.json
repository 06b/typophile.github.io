The Madam answers the door and as she closes it and welcomes her client, she also shouts for the old man to go away. The john goes upstairs to his usual gal and they start to figure out what they want to do \"this time.\" She suggests the shower. \"Nahhh\" he says, \"we did that last month. \"The upside down thing,\" she proposes. \"Like last week?\" he says. It starts snowing more heavily as they make their way out of the window and onto the roof. \"We've never done it outside, much less in snow,\" he points our as he lowers his drawers. They start in on it as the snow begins to accumulate heavily and she's starting to get really into it. They go and go and go until they are nearly exhausted and though still connected are nearly buried in the snow. Finally he finishes but it's so cold now they've frozen together covered in frozen snow and sweat and can't fit back in the window. Stumbling around while still connected on the roof he slips off and she along with him to crash, frozen in position into a snow drift on the street. The startled old man lurches out of the way, and up to the cathouse door which he knocks on. The Madam answers and shouts at him again, \"Go on, get out of here, you are never coming in my house.\"\n\n\"I don't want to come in,\" he shouts over the storm, \"I just wanted to tell you, your sign fell down.\"\n\nIt is a type joke!
