  "content": "I have created c2sc, smcp and swsh features which all work as they should. However, when applying the smcp together with the swsh, the two ligatures for n\\_g.swsh and h\\_y.swsh appear instead of N, G, H and Y small caps. How can I have the two features together and somehow override the ligatures?\n\nHere's the code:  \nfeature swsh {  \n sub @swsh1 by @swsh2;  \n sub N i by N\\_i.swsh;  \n sub h y by h\\_y.swsh;  \n sub n g by n\\_g.swsh;  \n sub n y by n\\_y.swsh;  \n sub r h by r\\_h.swsh;  \n sub r i by r\\_i.swsh;  \n sub r j by r\\_j.swsh;  \n sub r k by r\\_k.swsh;  \n sub r t by r\\_t.swsh;  \n sub r.swsh' @fligs by r;  \n sub @swsh3 by @swsh4;  \n} swsh;\n\nI've been messing about with it for so long I can't think straight.\n\nAny help gratefully received.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416045216im_/http:/typophile.com/files/featuresgrab_4746.png)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Nick\n\nHaving a guess at what is happen here, it could be that the 'swsh' feature may be happening before 'smcp' and/or 'c2sc'. You probably want all the standard replacements to happen first - then have the swash ligatures lookups act on what's there after.  \nAlso if changing text with swash ligs into small caps, you may need to decompose the swash ligs back to standard glyphs in a separate lookup before applying smcp lookups.\n\n"
