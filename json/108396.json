  "content": "Hello, I recently purchase the poem script font. It has a LOT of flourishes. I am having an issue and was wondering if anyone might have a solution/suggestion?\n\nWhen I print a name and address with that font, some of the flourishes are not printing, it is very thin in some parts. I have adjusted the line spacing and now am just trying to print one line. I have printed on a color laser and a wide format inkjet - both with the same result. I have put the quality at the highest level and have even increased the saturation. Nothing helps.\n\nI am printing from Microsoft Word and have also saved it as a PDF and printed from Adobe Acrobat. Acrobat is a bit better, but not perfect. Any suggestions?\n\nThanks!!\n\nJackie\n\nSample shown here:  \n [http://www.flickr.com/photos/48850147@N04/12061679616/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804091019/http:/www.flickr.com/photos/48850147@N04/12061679616/ \"http://www.flickr.com/photos/48850147@N04/12061679616/\")\n\n",
