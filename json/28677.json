  "content": "o.k. so i want to make some personal t-shirts and am wondering what are some cost effective ways to do it and interesting techniques. Any ideas? (It might be easy to make the film positive myself but i would probably go to a shop to do the rest. Also any other specialty techniques like flock or puff printing that i should know of?)\n\nI don’t like most of the standard t-shirt materials or the way they are printed for like sports teams and stuff. I love the thick tinted OBEY t-shirts. I am also looking for different types of inks or coats or whatever to give the shirts a high quality look.\n\nAlso I know most of the cost in printing t’s is the setup. So if i can prepare anything for the setup to reduce costs that would be sweet. The shirts i want are probably going to be 1-colour so its easier.\n\nThanks,  \n-jesse\n\n",

      "content": "Generally, the major portion of the cost of producing silkscreened apparel is not the setup, but the apparel itself, and perhaps even more so in your case, since you expressed a preference for a more “upscale” substrate. For personal-use projects, you will probably be best off contacting local apparel silkcreeners, and comparing costs. If you want to get into the business of producing screend apparel, you would probably be best served by having your designs printed first on thermal transfer paper, then applied via heat press to the garments. The advantages to this method are (1) less upfront cost (the paper is MUCH cheaper than the garments); (2) virtually no spoilage (unless the heat press operator is a total dunce); and (3) little or no “dead” inventory (if certain designs do not sell well, you are not stuck with imprinted garments you will most likely have to sell at a loss).\n\n"

I’ve got one American Apparel shirt, but am not that impressed, comparatively, with it.\n\nThe first place I used here does a lot of work, but I’m just not impressed with the overall quality of their image repro sometimes, and a lot of their stuff tends to be more of the “throwaway” kind of shirt: in fact, the last one self-destructed a few years ago.

If you scroll to the far right side of the top photo, you’ll see the placement of the type.\n\nEverything’s silkscreened. Friend of mine did the front as a limited edition (75, I’ve got #1 hanging in my dining room) linoblock print entitled “Light Lunch,” and sent me an artist proof that I took over to the company.\n\nThey did a high-end scan of the print and reversed the colours (in the print, that big expanse of open shirt above the glass is actually ink), and my Illustrator file of the type, and within a week, I had a monster box of these. Extra charge for XL and XXL, of course, but still pretty reasonable.\n\nHere’s a picture of the short-sleeved version — you can see the type on the sleeve....\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20091121083209im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/IMG_0005_2_5247.jpg)\n\nIt’s not as spiff, but that’s why it’s “Chard”. ;-)\n\n"

I too have been seriously considering getting some of my own shirt design made recently.\n\nA friend of mine runs a screen printing shop up in the San Francisco area. He is currently putting some information together for me on blank shirts. I’ll gladly share the information he passes on.\n\nFor now here is my take on American Apparel:\n\nAmerican Apparel seem to have replaced Hane’s Beefy T’s as the blank t-shirt of choice for many bands and hip t-shirt designers over the past few years.\n\nPersonally I have to give them really mixed reviews. They are probably the most comfortable t-shirts I have ever worn. Initially AA shirts fit nicely and are really soft. However after just a few washes they tend to shrink up pretty severely. Also, that nice, thin material does not seem to hold up as long as other t-shirts I have.\n\nPerhaps we could work out some sort of t-shirt trade once some of us have them made...?\n\nDuncan\n\n"

The Gildans were fractionally cheaper and came in the “right” colour, but I certainly prefer the Beefy T.\n\nYour experience mirrors mine with the AA shirt: the shrinkage was particularly noticeable with mine on the shoulder seam, where the inside tape shrank massively and the shirt itself didn’t. Not a pretty sight.\n\nLinda\n\n"
