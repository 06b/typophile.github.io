  "content": "This is how it works:\n\n- A couple of words are published in the Type ID Pop Quiz, possibly — but not necessarily — providing a hint.\n- Try to identify the typeface. To win, you need to e-mail me both the correct name and weight.  \n- Show off your knowledge by casually mentioning additional trivia, like who designed it, when and by whom was it (first) published, and other cool stuff to impress your fellow Typophiles with.\n- Every week a new challenge will be posted.\n- The person who wins a game can’t win the next game.\n\nIn case of any disputes, I will act as judge, jury and avenging angel of wrath.\n\nIf you think this is too easy, maybe try the [Intermediary Level Type ID Pop Quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20061130182035/http:/typophile.com/node/28061) or [Expert Level Type ID Pop Quiz](http://web.archive.org/web/20061130182035/http:/typophile.com/node/27994).\n\nGood luck everyone, and have fun. ;^)\n\n_With respectful thanks to the originator of this utterly useless but highly entertaining waste of time, the often imitated but never duplicated Cheshire Dave._\n\n",
