I've searched through various forms, and everyone has the same few tips to offer, and of course none of them work.\n\nDoes anyone here have that problem? When outputing .pdf files black appears as a grey. It's driving me crazy. No matter how I adjust appearance of black settings or my rich black portions It still screws me every time. My recent hack has been to simply set all my blacks to \"registration\" but obviously that's not the right solution.\n\nAm I missing something obvious? From what i've found from others, this is a big problem. I hope cs3 will fix this.\n\n",

It will make black look more black in PDF. If you are working with black on full color jobs, in most cases it's wise you use rich black anyway (all non-text objects). If you use only K, the grey in Acrobat isn't even that far off from the way it will look in print (e.g. crappy greyish black).\n\n"

As this is well over the total ink limit, it's will look like crud (even on toner-based devices such as PS color laser printers).\n\nI agree with the posters who are saying that the Acrobat PDF display is \"not a bug.\" Have you ever studied color management at all? For pre-press purposes, the whole point is typically to maintain visual distinctions and map the entire gamut of one device to another. If Acrobat displays a 0C-0M-0Y-100K black as the darkest possible black, what it is it supposed to do with a 100-100-100-100 black? (Okay, maybe it's a 30-30-30-100 black, same idea - it needs to be darker than that previous black.) If you make the PDF in RGB, with the right settings, presumably you can get a 0-0-0 RGB black, and that's the darkest black, period. It will display great on screen. It will print on color devices as a maximum rich black, though, which may or may not be desirable.\n\nYou could also try in Acrobat going to Preferences \\> Color Management \\> Conversion Options turning off \"Use black point compensation, and see what effect that has.\n\nNote also: If you are having a problem with your black looking grey \\*in print\\*, in many workflows the best solution when making documents in InDesign is to go to Edit \\> Color Settings and under \"Color Management Policies\" set CMYK to \"Preserve Numbers (Ignore Linked Profiles)\". This essentially turns off color management for CMYK elements in the document, such as text.\n\nWith that configuration you can still place RGB photos and have them properly color managed (set RGB to \"Preserve Embedded Profiles\"), and Bob's yer uncle. Leastways, this has always worked well for me in InDesign.\n\nRegards,\n\nT\n\n"

Contrary to everybody's assumption that \"if it says 100% black, it'll print 100% black\", there's something going on in my InDesign color setting that's converting it, and I need to figure it out.\n\nThe oddest part is that, if I click on the color in my tool bar, the RGB samples at low numbers. If it were a TRUE black, those should all show up as zeros, right? If I convert it to 400% rich black, then it show RGB values at zero, but with CM&Y at zero, RGB is registering values, and that ain't black.\n\nPersonally, I couldn't care less how it looks on screen, but it has to print correctly. Converting it rich black is a good idea because this particular job is going on a copier, but it would be problematic if I were going to press and the Black plate showed up as a 90% screen.\n\nI'll tool around in other forums to see if I can't figure it out.

I’ve got PitStop and can select the shape in Acrobat that is printing as a screened half-tone to view its values and its values are 0,0,0,100 but it still prints as a screen. I’ve created a shape in Acrobat and gave it the same fill values of 0,0,0,100 and it prints solid. So, one created in Acrobat doesn’t simulate offset black-only black. So, something in the PDF made from InDesign tells it to simulate offset cmyk black only printing.

When you choose the second option (accurately) you notice that the 100% black is actually darkgrey for the eye.  \nThis has nothing to do with exporting with PDF/x standards or none. If exporting in RGB the pdf just fakes the 100% black to rich black on the screen. So exporting with PDF/x standard in CMYK is accurate. When printed it is still darkgrey, and when imported again in Photoshop or InDesign you can see the black is still +/- 80%K instead of 100%K.\n\nHere are some different settings for rich black:  \n63C, 52M, 51Y, 100K  \n30C, 20M, 20Y, 100K  \n60C, 40M, 40Y, 100K\n\nThis solved my problems.  \nIf you want 100% K black to print on top of the CMYK colors uncheck \"Overprint [Black] Swatch at 100%\". Or else it will become transparant.\n\nThis website was helpful to me, check it out: [http://www.graphic-design-employment.com/over-printing.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190408/http:/www.graphic-design-employment.com/over-printing.html \"http://www.graphic-design-employment.com/over-printing.html\")\n\n"

      "content": "@ jayyy:  \nPhotoshop (earlier versies I think) black is C75, M68, Y67, K90. At CS4 it is C88, M79, Y65, K93 that is the rich black Photoshop uses, not 100%K. So if you are using 100%K in InDesign that is the cause of the difference.  \nTry to stay within a total of 280%, or the ink won't dry that good. So in that case the Photoshop rich black is to much. According to some resources 300% is possible too.\n\nIf you make a good rich black swatch, with the same CMYK settings both in Photoshop and InDesign, your problem should be solved. Make sure that both the .indd and .psd file have the same CMYK profile.  \nCheck the website link in my previous post, it helped me.\n\nHope this helps you to.\n\n"

      "content": "\\> _Just 100%K is going to print 80%k._\n\nNo, it will not. 100K will obviously print as 100K. However, optically it doesn't look pitch black, because offset inks _aren't completely opaque_, making the printing surface shine through a little.\n\nIn full color jobs you can indeed make the black more pitch black by using what has already been mentioned as 'rich black', which is a blend of all four colors (e.g. 30/40/40/100 or similar). This will make the ink-coverage nearly opaque, resulting in a dark black. Obviously you _shouldn't do this_ when you are working on something that will be printed in black and white (i.e. one color, K only), because rich black will produce four printing plates instead of one. It's usually best if you only apply rich black to larger surfaces, because very fine details could in some cases cause registration problems.\n\nAs has been said before in this thread, if you use 100K, the PDF will show that as a very dark grey. This is not a bug, but intended behavior for prepress purposes, so please stop calling it a 'problem', because it isn't. If you want really dark blacks in your PDF's for _screen purposes only_, export it as RGB or temporarily make the black a rich black.\n\nThe blend you use for rich black determines what 'shade' of black you will get. I.e. more magenta and yellow will result in a warm black, while more cyan will make a cool black.\n\n"

      "content": "Jeronimo - these mixtures you site are simply what different color profiles convert pure black from RGB into. They are not \"recommended\" at all. Do the math - c75 y68 m67 k90 simply adds up to 300% total ink, which is the ink limit if you are using SWOP V2 (the most popular magazine color space). It's been the same in PS for a long time and still is - do the math on your other mixture - c88 m79 y65 k93 = 325 total ink. You have changed your color profile, that is all.\n\nRich black is typically K=100 with undercoating, that is because ink is slightly transparent. If you want to know what \"temperature\" your undercoating is - look to the left of the color sliders in Photoshop and you can see it. If you want your undercoating completely neutral - make sure that CMY are equal. I have never seen a valid reason for anything more than 240% - that doesn't mean a reason doesn't exist.\n\npbc\n\n"

      "content": "Well, you see, basically the problem is the following: Your pdf is perfecly good for offset separations but it still prints as approx. 80% gray on a laser.\n\nThe solution is extremely simple if you have Pitstop in Acrobat (you have a default action \"Convert Color to Gray and keep Black text\" :) additional steps and gray color profile [http://www.penpro.rs/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317190408/http:/www.penpro.rs/ \"http://www.penpro.rs/\") [google translate to english, it's currently available only on serbian :)])\n\nIf you don't have Pitstop, there is an other solution: From Indesign (any version) print to .ps file with separations enabled, turn off CMY plates, leave just the black channel. Destill the ps file and voila... you are good to go, the pdf now prints 100% black.\n\nOne more solution: Open pdf in Acrobat, select file\\>save as\\>postscript(\\*.ps), click settings to the right, under Output-\\>Color:separations, ink manager: turn off CMY, leave just Black on. Click OK, Save. Distill the file, and once more you are good to go.\n\nExplanation: From the aspect of laser printers, there is a great difference between CMYK and gray colors. C0M0Y0K100 isn't black (its stupid, but thats the way it is), only Gray 100% prints as 100% black (RGB translates depending on printer color profiles etc. its not convenient color mode for solving this problem). Turning on separation when printing, automatically creates grayscale mode PDF, so it solves the problem above :))  \nOne more thing, with the Touchup object tool select the text line, right click and select properties, if under the color tab the Color Space is Gray or DeviceGray it will print correctly. Just to don't waste more paper than you must :)\n\n"
