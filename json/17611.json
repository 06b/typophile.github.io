Flash 8 does, with FlashType (based on the MERL Saffron rendering engine). Flash 7 does not with their built-in dynamic text object, but a sufficiently enterprising programmer could probably hack up their own which draws the glyphs individually.\n\n"

But as you download my exe file from link above you might notice that some your fonts are not displayed properly in this application. It happens because flash does not display some PS fonts as well as others. Do not remember what is the problem (it was quite long time ageo though) anyway it looks like problem that cannot be solved so I left it.  \nAnyway flash crashes if you are using ps fonts and do not have ps display drivers installed(come with ATM)  \nSome info :)  \n [http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn\\_4105](http://web.archive.org/web/20080906234002/http:/www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_4105 \"http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn\\_4105\")\n\n"
