It appears that the requirement that fonts must be packaged with software only applies to selling them for money, not for all redistribution. That apparent silliness, though, may not be what Hrant is objecting to.\n\nOK, I've read the license, and although it's much briefer than the GPL, I can't see a problem.\n\nAh:  \n<cite>Apache does not stop people from deriving free fonts, while OFL does stop people who cannot allow themselves that luxury, due to factors essentially out of their control. OFL is idealistic to the point of in fact actually doing damage to minority writing systems,</cite>\n\nreading what Hrant said lets me see what the issue is; that issue is that the OFL **is** like the GPL instead of the BSD license.\n\nThe objection is reasonable - people who use minority writing systems tend to live in poor countries, and so they may not be able to indulge themselves the way people in rich countries might by working for free. While people in the rich world might not have any problem drawing the _glyphs_ for the writing system of a foreign language competently, it may well take a native speaker to set up all the various Unicode composition rules for a given language correctly.\n\nSo an OFL-licensed font does not serve as a resource for commercial indigenous font designers.\n\nBut why did the GPL come about in the first place? To prevent someone from tweaking a program, making a few improvements, and then preventing the originators of the program from making similar improvements without copying anything from that person's implementation.\n\nI see this limitation of the GPL, therefore, as coldly practical - not _primarily_ a manifestation of the idealism that Richard Stallman indeed does advocate. I too have lots of problems with Richard Stallman's idealism; as far as I'm concerned, people producing IP and making money from it under the current copyright regime are not doing anything questionable (merely by doing so).\n\nThe scarcity that leads to the world's real poverty problems isn't scarcity of IP, which is so easy to copy, legally or otherwise. It's scarcity of land, shelter, food, water... neither legal copies of Linux or pirate copies of Windows or Britney Spears records will help all that much with that.\n\nThis is not to deny that computers haven't helped to improve the efficiency of the production of physical goods. But, if Brazil needed an operating system for its computers, it has the resources to write one. And the gains are relatively small ones; agriculture hasn't improved by Moore's Law style leaps and bounds.\n\n"

But when you speak of the OFL harming minority scripts, I had thought in terms of how existing OFL faces for those scripts were most likely to be defective.\n\nIf they don't follow the proper writing rules for the language, then they are unusable for the native speakers of the language to express themselves. Correcting that would be a lot of work, which people in the target area might not be able to do for free. That would obviously be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if those faces are fully usable, then they're not doing cultural damage. That any commercial operation seeking to make new styles of type available in the target area for pay would have to do their own Open Type coding doesn't strike me as an issue. If we're talking about a poor country where people can't afford to work for free, we're also talking about a poor country where people can't afford to pay for fonts. So why is the culture endangered by firms serving the rich elite having to do their own work?\n\nNow, though, this is a massive oversimplification. Most people in the United States would never pay over $1,000 for a font, but they read magazines published by companies that have done so. Poor countries still have businesses in them which have appreciable amounts of capital.\n\nPoor countries also tend to be small countries, and if they have more complex scripts than ours, the position I have taken so far would seem to demand that their economies support typographical firms larger than Adobe. Except that Adobe supports a lot of scripts, and I had thought it wasn't _that_ hard to specify ligatures and such in OpenType.\n\nOf course, that's based on a picture of a \"complex script\" being something like the one for Thai or Burmese, say. Maybe you're thinking of something more along the lines of Nastaliq' - for which, I notice, the Pakistani government has found it necessary to provide a font providing support. I don't know about the quality of that particular font; I've tended to assume it's probably basic and limited. In that case, unlike the case of Brahmi scripts, Ethiopic, and so on, I don't know of any OFL fonts produced by Westerners, though.\n\n"

But I am still in the dark about one point which makes me still unable to fully understand your concern. What you had in mind was \"the extension of existing libre fonts for minority scripts\". Extension in what way? Adding better rules for ligatures and language processing? Adding more glyphs?\n\nWhat is it that those fonts in numerous cases need, and which cannot reasonably be expected to be provided for free, that is being obstructed by the OFL? Unless I know the nature of the harm claimed to be caused, I can't either agree or disagree with your claim that there's a problem.\n\nIncidentally, being a long-time reader of _The Register_, I wouldn't be inclined to call you wildly inappropriate names in lieu of productive discussion in any case.\n\nEDIT: I see you wrote \"which we have in fact been seeing on the ground, with Armenian and other scripts\", and that is a tip-off that complex scripts aren't the issue, as Armenian isn't a complex script any more than Greek or Latin are. And since your comments were initially directed at the OP, whose project involved a new typeface for the Latin script, then it seems you mean extending an existing libre font _by adding the characters for the minority script to it_.\n\nIf this is in fact your concern, then I am going to have to say that I find serious fault with the logic of your objection. Releasing a libre font under the OFL for the Latin alphabet in no way stops someone else from producing and releasing an entirely new font for a different alphabet in a similar style. Oh, wait, there is duplication of effort: the punctuation marks will have to be redrawn - and the Arabic numerals!\n\nPlease tell me that I am mistaken. Cultural doom cannot be the result of having to switch to a different font when including Latin text, or by the need to redraw digits and punctuation marks and other sorts.\n\n"

To me, at least, that raises questions like \"why did they bother\" - it seems as though the parties involved hadn't thought the issue through carefully.\n\nSo it's not just that the letter is not enough to enforce the spirit, it's that even the spirit of the license is placed in an awkward spot by the existence of GPL software that uses fonts. Because CD-ROMs are in a standard filesystem which all major operating systems can read, on the one hand, and including OFL fonts as one of the things provided in a Linux distribution does make sense for the users of that distribution.\n\nOf course, if the intent is really just to make the fonts available, one can still say that refuge is being taken in the letter to violate the spirit.
