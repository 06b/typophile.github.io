  "content": "hello everyone. a poor little (typophile) student is asking for help.\n\nI’m a german student of communications-design studying for one year in Barcelona. And here I have a great typography-work to do.\n\nI want to work out a book about slab serif-fonts. History, characteristics, interviews, examples of usage, etc.  \nBut it seems as if there is no information out there.\n\nIt’s a great topic and I learned to love slabs, but it’s still very dificult to find usable texts, discussions, or examples (with background information).\n\nNaturally I found something in the web and in books buts it’s still very little.\n\nDoes anybody know any writings, links or books that could help me? Somebody knows detailed history facts and examples, or has written something he would like to show me?  \nDoesn’t matter if it’s english, german or spanish, ever piece is very welcome.\n\nI found nice information about the IBM-logo, have two interview-partners, and found other stuff, but there must be more.  \nWhere is a detailed story about a font in particular, where are nice-to-know- and funny things? why I cannot find who made the serif-kodak-logos or all the others?  \nwhere are the experts?\n\nIt would be really great if I would receive some hints out of this lively forum.  \nThanks to all of you.\n\nGreetings,\n\nRobin\n\n",

Or just has some goodies for my work (pics etc)\n\nWork goes on.\n\nRobin\n\n"

      "content": "Barcelona, eh? Lucky hund.\n\nYou might say that the seeds for the slab serif (like those of  \nso many other features in type) were planted with the RdR.\n\n\\> Where do a serif begin to be slab in your thoughts?\n\nWhen its top edge is [nearly] flat. (And the bottom one too I guess.)  \nOtherwise it’s a wedge serif (pointed or sheared). A special case of  \nthe slab serif though is when it’s very thin, in which case I think  \nit’s better to call it hairline. But of course grays abound.\n\nhhp\n\n"

      "content": "sí, definitly lucky, you know the reasons hrant\n\nthank you all so much for your help. more of this, typophile!\n\nthats interesting what you comment, hrant. I never would have thought in the RdR. The edge is flat but the edges are rounded there, no? Like the serifs seem not that long there, it forms nearly an wedge serif. But I Haven’t found a good image to look nearer.\n\nThe second one is even more interesting. I heard definitions, and it was mine too, that the serifs nearly has to be as bold as the main stroke (optically). If not, Bodoni would be slab, but Lino Letter and The Serif wouldn’t.  \nIn Germany Slabs are called “serifenbetonte Linear-Antiqua”. That means that their serifs  \nare stressed, what normaly means that they have to be big.  \nWhat do you think?\n\nAnd thanks to for your Hairline opinion. Now fits to this discussion about the definition of slabs. (that hopefully will go on with even more people)\n\nMuchas gracias y/und Dankeschön.  \nand sorry for my english if I really did such mistakes as I think.\n\nrobin\n\n"

      "content": "\\> The edge is flat but the edges are rounded there, no?\n\nThe RdR has adnate serifs, yes. But I think the key concept  \nbehind the slab serif is its <cite>separation</cite> from the stem, and  \nto me it seems this is the archetypical RdR logic, to treat  \nletterform elements as things that exist independently (as  \nopposed to arising from a continous flow [of a marking tool]),  \nelements that come together and fuse. But in fact I’m merely  \nguessing that there is a connection there.\n\nAnother possibility (although typographic chronology might  \nrefute this) is that slabs came about as a result of wanting to  \ntack on serifs to sans forms.\n\n\\> the serifs nearly has to be as bold as the main stroke\n\nCertainly the typical slab is pretty thick. But “looking ahead”  \nterminologically I worry about what to call the non-thick ones! :-/  \nSo to me it seems best to call them all slabs, but some “thick”  \nand some “thin” (and some “hairline”, but for that without  \nneeding to also have “slab” in there).\n\nhhp\n\n"
