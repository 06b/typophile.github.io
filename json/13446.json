  "content": "hello\n\nim very interested in pictogramms (symbols, icons), especially in their function as a substitute for typed words. i made an invitation for a party once for my brother when he moved in his new appartment. you can see it [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130619180122/http:/www.art.ificial.ch/jobs/wg.gif) (the top part is the front, the bottom part the back of the postcard - dont look at the typetreatment, its not too good). its simple, it was a rush job - but it shows what i mean.\n\nhow do symbols evolve, and how do we perceive symbols? how does this \"convention\" on what symbols are internationaly understood (like the sportsymbols once made for the olympics) change or does it even exist?\n\nim just interested in a discussion about symbols and how they can replace written language sometimes, making things easier (navigation in a museum, driving in a car, getting an overview over a lot of different categories/subjects - the olympic sport symbols - etc. etc.\n\n",

But why are certain primary shapes and configurations of dot and line perceived and remembered more easily than others? In this fascinating and now-classic study, the world-renowned typographer and designer Adrian Frutiger explores the development of signs and symbols in general and writing in particular, relating basic graphic principles and components to a wide range of historical, linguistic, and practical concerns. The author embraces everything from Egyptian hieroglyphics to modern company logos in his intriguing analysis of the way humans have always tried to express thought through graphic means.\"\n\n"

Otherwise, it's not even worth the single word or idea it is meant to convey.\n\nOn the other hand, some symbols gain currency through extensive use, even if their meaning is not conveyed visually. The universal \"No Entry\" sign, a horizontal bar in a circle, doesn't really say much on its own, but over time most folks understand what it means. And I have yet to encounter a sign that says clearly and unequivocally \"Ausgang/Ausfahrt, exit, salida, sortie,uitgang, uscita or way out (my favorite).\"\n\n"

My thesis project was redesigning the New York City subway wayfinding system.\n\nWhile I went as far as creating a new typeface, and redesigning (and rewording) the signage, I also wanted to experiment in creating a custom pictogram system similar to those used in Olympic systems. Given the scope, I bit off more than I could chew. While I have completed my Master's degree, it is definitely a project that I continue to work on on my own time.\n\nNick brings up some good points as one of the tasks that I found difficult to achieve was figuring out a pictogram for the term \"exit\". A word that shows its ugly head in multiple languages in every wayfinding system. Why can't we figure out an image to express that concept?\n\n"
