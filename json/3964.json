It is similar to Jonathan Hoefler's [Proteus Project](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018075201/http:/www.typography.com/catalog/proteus/index.html), in the sense that a given underlying structure becomes the base for a mixture of eclectic fonts that somehow work very well together.   \n   \nI'm not saying Priori and Proteus Project look similar, I'm just noticing a similarity in the approach to building the family.   \n   \nIs this a fair comparison? Are there other font families that take a similar approach? What do you think?\n\n",
