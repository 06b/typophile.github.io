  "content": "Hello all,\n\nWe’ve just redesigned (or more accurately - had redesigned) our magazine and the dude has chosen freight micro as our serif font, which is nice. I quite like it, its a bit all over the shop in a nice way. But when it is display size all these little bits of mess look most scruffy and awkard. I can just about get away with using it all caps, but I don’t like being constrained this way.\n\nCould anyone kindly suggest some similar yet more suitable slabs for headlines so I may offer it to my bosses as a replacement?\n\nIt would be most appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\nG T\n\n [‹ Typographic Munich.

Well now my problem is; big company, small budget for fonts, so I’ll have to find something else as I don’t think they’ll wanna fund another freight redesign.\n\nJust wished they’d asked my opinion before choosing fonts.\n\noh well…\n\n"
