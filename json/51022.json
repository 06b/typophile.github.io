  "content": "Hello typophiles...\n\nWhew, need some help here. Have a client that has offices in China, and I need to recreate a logo using the Chinese characters - and not spend an entire day searching through the glyph palette.\n\nI've used whatthefont.com in the past to identify fonts English fonts... Is there some other kind of website that could \"see\" the characters in a jpeg so I could copy / paste into my layout?\n\nIn the past, I've been able to simply copy / paste characters from supplied Word files or off their website - but there's nothing available for this particular logo (it's a new location).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated - thanks in advance, everyone!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20101029050712im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Beijing_Clinical_Logo_Small_5553.jpg)\n\n",

If not here, why not ask on a Chinese forum of some sort?  \nGood luck!\n\n"

      "content": "I'd imagine because Dr Ken knows these characters. If you didn't, you could use a character dictionary, which traditionally order characters by radical. Most characters are made up of discrete elements, or radicals, of which there are traditionally 216.\n\nAnother way of ordering characters is by number of strokes. So you count the strokes (made easier by the rigid rules governing stroke order) and skim through, say, 9-stroke characters.\n\nA newer method is called SKIP and is used in \"NTC's New Japanese-English Character Dictionary\" by Jack Halpern. It uses a combination of patterns and stroke count to look up characters and generally works well.\n\nIncidentally, \"Beautiful Country\" is America. But don't feel too flattered: \"beauty\" sounds similar to the ME in aMErica. It's a phonetic association.\n\n"
