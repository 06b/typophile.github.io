      "content": "Thanks, Craig! The {g} showcases the new style of descender that I built just prior to the release. The solid stroke of the descender is steeper and protrudes less to the left, and conversely the thin connecting stroke is now less steep, instead matching the 39° angle of the cuts of the vertical strokes.\n\nAlso, I've slightly revamped my marketing material thanks to some comments on the TypeDrawers board, and put them up on Behance: [http://www.behance.net/gallery/Gryffensee-a-geometric-blackletter-%28inc...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414174205/http:/www.behance.net/gallery/Gryffensee-a-geometric-blackletter-%28incl-Cyrillic%29/8236533 \"http://www.behance.net/gallery/Gryffensee-a-geometric-blackletter-%28incl-Cyrillic%29/8236533\") .\n\n"
