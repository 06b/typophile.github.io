Bromwich was one of our earliest families and is something of a favourite with us and others. It remains a solidly popular face and is also somethingof a signature family for us, being the basis our our Foundry logos.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014141700im_/http:/typophile.com/files/bd_6308.png)\n\n",
