Taking out OpenType features and alternate glyphs? Publish just a single member of a family (as FontFont has been doing for a while)?\n\n:-)\n\n",

      "content": "It depends on how you define free. In the case of some free downloads of fonts, you are actually just licensing the font without paying the traditional fee. In other words, instead of paying $30 for font X from family Y, you pay $0 for font X from family Y. But in order to download the font, you must still agree to same EULA that you would if you had paid $30 for it.\n\nThere are also other foundries that bundle a free version of another font whenever you make a general purchase. So if you license family Z, foundry A will also give you a license for font X of family Y, both to thank you for being their customer, and also in the hope that you might like to someday license the rest of family Y.\n\nI don't know about taking out the OT features or the alternates, and then distributing that as an alternate version. I could be convinced of its benefit, but I tend to think that it might be too much work to go through on the distributor side. Would it recoup its cost? In theory, anything that recoups its costs might be worth a business considering.\n\n"

Could you name the foundries? :)\n\nTo clarify, I understand \"freemium\" to mean, \"available at zero price as a 'loss leader' for something else that costs money\" - I didn't mean \"free as in modifiable\" etc and so avoided the word 'free' :)\n\n"

I am sure that the quality of his offering is paramount here: his free fonts are not crippled in any way, they are well crafted and with extensive character sets, and what's more, he gives away the (medium and medium italic) most useful members of the family and charges for the peripheral ones. The other vendors are more likely to give away the least popular cut, say semibold italic.\n\nI tried a similar approach with one of mine and now can see it around, used in the free fonts, while the sales of the paid fonts are minute. Well, it may just be a dud. That said, it worries me a bit. Apart from all the more or less professional fonts bundled with operating systems or applications, the free fonts available on the net are quite abundant, and some of them are not at all bad. There seems to be a lot of talented people out there who will release a free font just to see it used somewhere. What is the longer-term future of fonts for sale?\n\n"

It all lead to the point where I am now because I gave away my free fonts (of higher quality than most other fonts) at that time with no other intention than to share them with the rest world.\n\nStephen, I can't remember saying that, but I do agree. BTW Traffic is all about sheer numbers —I'm now counting about 6,000 hits a day— and the fact that there are (and always will be) people who really want to make a purchase. They just have to like your fonts and have to know where they can find them.\n\n"
