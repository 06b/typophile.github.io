The lower case a looks big and the g small in relation to the other letters. Try a less shy \"t\".   \n   \nMaybe it would not be a decent move, but it would certainly put some eyes in your type if you called it \"Not Cheltenham\".\n\n"

      "content": "What about 'lox' - the font has a slightly fish oriented style to it. It's a tasty font so far. I agree about the 't' it is a bit shy. I like the g but it seems out of place. What about a bigger bowl on top? Or maybe just a wider one? The k isn't completely convincing in it's current form. Not the way a-f are. Something about the binary 'this style on this side & that style over here' treatment of the legs seems too simple. Too formula. The v, x & y also seem less finnished & less beautiful than the others. I really like the font though & I usually don't like scottish looking fonts like this - so I hope you keep refining it!\n\n"
