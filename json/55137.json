  "content": "While looking over the recent TDC2 2009 Winners I noticed Expo Serif. After printing the sample .pdf and mulling over how this type family looked on the page, I began to realize how well it reads. This font has to be among the most legible and readable I've come across. I usually don't go in for such softly-curved letterforms (save for Kris Sowersby's Feijoa, which I \\*love\\*), but Expo's getting to me.\n\n[http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font\\_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09\\_03](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023082751/http:/www.typeculture.com/foundry/font_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09_03 \"http://www.typeculture.com/foundry/font\\_collection/font.php?ID=FNT09\\_03\")\n\nAny thoughts on Expo Serif? I wonder what my typographic betters think of this, so I can learn as well.\n\nCheers,\n\nChristian.\n\n",
