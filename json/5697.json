  "content": "Is there a Quark XT for Hebrew layouts? I created a booklet in Quark 6 in English that's being translated into Hebrew. I found out that Hebrew is the exact opposite of English--it's read right to left and books are front to back. Is there an extension for Quark that can flow text in this manner? I've seen a post regarding Arabic, which is apparently similar, but, from what I gather, it seems the extension doesn't work that well. Is anyone familiar with a Hebrew extension?\n\n [‹ Need to find articles on Arthur Baker](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055157/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14276 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Hiragino Mincho Pro - PC version? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080605055157/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14564 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
