I honestly just don’t know how to deal with someone who wants me to work for free, will only pay a cut rate if I do get the contract, and makes it abundantly clear that they’ll send the work to some guy in Bengaluru if I want wage that would allow me to pay off my student loans. And that’s just the design firms…\n\n"
