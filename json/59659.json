  "content": "I'm making this number for my wife to celebrate our 8 years of being together. I'm trying to find a balance between it having a decorative character and still resemble an 8.\n\nThe problem I'm having is that even though it's a two-story construction, I think I need to balance the lachrymal terminals on the upper and lower story. But I like weight. Also, think it looks like an \"S\" in that regard (that's a good thing).\n\nI've added a few simple ornaments to represent the 8 years we've been together; six unmarried, and two married.\n\nI've attached the progress along with the ornamented, latest version. I'm going with the inline version in the final piece but comments on either version are welcome.\n\nI'm asking for everyone's opinions and criticisms. This is only my second time making a custom character and I want to make it as \"finished\" as possible. I appreciate all the help. Thank you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Special 8.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204616/http:/typophile.com/files/Special%208.pdf) | 202 KB |\n| [Special 8 \\*2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204616/http:/typophile.com/files/Special%208%20*2.pdf) | 198.24 KB |\n| [Special 8 \\*3.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418204616/http:/typophile.com/files/Special%208%20*3.pdf) | 120.51 KB |\n\n",

I did notice that the top-right part was a little low and tweaked it slightly.\n\nI also fixed the top and the bottom of the inline to be more rounded and smoother.\n\nI've attached the new version to the original post and included it here for review. I'm still looking for more opinions and criticisms. Keep um' coming!\n\nNOTE ::: Typophile is not letting me insert and image into this post. I've included the new version in the original post at the top. Sorry.\n\n"

It would look weird at this point.\n\nI've moved the node to a more appropriate category.\n\nI've also added some simple circular ornaments. Comments, criticisms, and encouragement is always welcome. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions so far, they've been great.\n\n"
