  "content": "I'm going thru my type library, intent on using types I've not used in, like, forever, if ever. Though I love Univers--and I believe this book will have scientific formulae in it--with an Old Style serif--I also like the idea of trying something I've had around forever, but just never got around to using, Stone Serif and Stone Sans. But I'm concerned about the narrow width of the text column, a touch less than 20p. I'm figuring a generous leading, but would still like something that fits well, in a compact kind of way (but, of course, not a Times) without looking jammed in.\n\nThank you.\n\n",
