  "content": "Hi all, I'm designing my cards and have been caught up trying to decide a way to best present my name, the problem is I'm writing it out in full in all caps, my name is MATT and kerning the double T's is killing me! I've drawn them together linking the crossbars but it attracted too much attention and looked odd, I tried to make custom T's with narrower crossbars but they too stood out strangely, the gap and between large gap between the ascenders and the tiny space between the end of the crossbars makes me cringe! Any thoughts? Advice?\n\nMuch appreciated, thanks in advance...\n\nMatt\n\n",

These examples aren't very good quality, I didn't see it as \"crashing\" ever but do you really think it is an issue? I def like the alignment kept simple all at the left, has been working well across all other stationary...\n\n"

      "content": "To kern MATT correctly, I would do this:  \n1. type NATN or HATH (whichever has both sides vertical and is largest),  \n2. kern AT so that the visual distance between MA and AT is the same (other way of seeing it: so that you get the same white in-between)  \n3. use the AT kerning value in MATT, chances are you need not change TT BUT if you do  \n4. type HHTTHH or NNTTNN so you get an evenly spaced block.\n\nIMVVHO your name does not look good with the shortened TT bars; it might look better with  \neither a ligature TT (joining on top)  \nor a TT where only the inside of the 'cross' bar is shortened.\n\nStill, I would keep it as in the font (or change font).\n\nPS. My name is DAVID and in 99.99% of the fonts, it looks horrible when spelt in all-caps, I need to respace everything manually, sadly (working first on HHDAHH, then HHAVHH, HVIH and chekcing HIDH, though this is rarely a problem - then it all assembles magically).\n\n"

      "content": "All-cap (and small cap) settings are traditionally letterspaced, and to this day, many foundries add extra \"cpsp\" as an OpenType feature, as a matter of course.\n\nI concur with Ilene.  \nWhen I first started making fonts, I put a lot of kerning in them, but now I consider that less is better. If a font has kerning between A and T, and A and C, as this one appears to, it only worsens gappy combinations where kerning is not possible.\n\nThe exception is the \"tight but not touching\" style, where the spacing is all about proximal distances, not the balance of light and dark.\n\nIMO, the proximal style makes sense for Syndrome, as it is a feature of the wordmark, where the stencilling leverages the proximal effect. So I don't have a problem with MATT MACDONALD; however, I find the letterspacing in Syndrome to be too great, in relation to the stencil gap, and the tightness of MATT MACDONALD, which is also much tighter than the U&lc text. So, the card exhibits three different spacing strategies--loose, tight, and default-- which seems wrong.\n\n"
