  "content": "Hi all,  \nAs always, I believe that the knowledge of the collective far outweighs that of the individual. So, once again, I turn to typophile for suggestions.\n\nI'm looking for a great, black or bold weighted, legible typeface to use for subheads in a brand new, high end magazine I'm currently designing. I would like it to have minor traits of art deco without compromising its legibility. I have something in mind for the layout that requires the chosen typeface to be on the bold side.\n\nAny suggestions are appreciated and thanks in advance!\n\n",
