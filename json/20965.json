I couldn't believe how many people were jumping at the chance to do work for free, without any recompense.\n\nNick brings up a real valid point about us having a registered profession and the RGD have ethical guidelines that all designers should be adhereing to, supporting and promoting. When a contest is run for any kind of design, or someone does work for free, it undermines the graphic design profession - it doesn't do anyone any favours (for the most part). We educate our students all the time on avoiding doing work for free.\n\nDo we ask Doctors to make diagnoses for free? Propose possible prescriptions as part of a contest? Do we ask Architects, Engineers or Lawyers to submit proposals and re-works for free? Yes, I realize that there are all levels of design and art out there and yes, I realize that a lot of designs are created via committee, but we have a responsibility to our profession to guide people, educate them and sell them on what works. We also have the right to fire a client and walk away.\n\nThis monstrosity of a logo looks like it was sitting atop a photocopier machine and just as someone was about to photocopy it, the person moved the original sheet. I agree the original logo was a bit conservative but we're talking about a logo for a government - not a festival logo. Think about what the logo is representing and what it will be used for — and the fact that it cost more money than it was worth.\n\n"
