Can anybody tell me more about this typedesign? Thanks. ![Capone base](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054717im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68994.gif)\n\n",

The caption (not included in the ABZ book) reads:   \n   \n\"Gothic Extended. This particular cutting made by the Hamilton Company after 1900. Lowercase is missing.\"   \n   \nWood type Gothics like this go back to the 1840s or earlier.\n\n"

It's good to hear it's cut after 1900 because I named my version after Al Capone. So the period was right.   \nDav thanks for the other interpretations based on the same typeface. I think Rhode isn't based on the same typefase but it's very nice.   \nThanks all!\n\n"
