  "content": "I need a little help. I have been sent a word Doc with a name in Japanese. The font is MS - comes with the system. I tried to copy and past the type to illustrator and use the same font, but I can’t get Japanese to show up. Just weird English punctuation. I know it must not be hard, but I haven’t dealt with this before. In the mean time I’ve exported the doc to a pdf and opened in photoshop and saved as a tif file. Would like to be able to outline the font.\n\nThank you\n\n [‹ WHAT THE FONT???](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408045931/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37227 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Letragraphica ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408045931/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37168 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
