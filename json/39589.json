Their purpose is to generate  \ninterest in my typo-illustration work.\n\nIt's the first two images here, 'Sexy as Hell' and 'Natural Beauty'.\n\n[www.seblester.co.uk](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014001122/http:/www.seblester.co.uk/ \"www.seblester.co.uk\")\n\nWeird, cool, offensive? Just plain dull? Any input appreciated.\n\nSeb\n\nps. The lettering can be seen here too...\n\n[http://seblester.co.uk/type\\_lettering.php](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014001122/http:/seblester.co.uk/type_lettering.php \"http://seblester.co.uk/type\\_lettering.php\")\n\n",
