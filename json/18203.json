  "content": "Anyone know what the really cool kids are doing with respect to marking footnotes these days? The asterisk, dagger, doubledagger system of marks seems a bit antiquated, and I’m not sure if these are internationally understood outside of academic texts. Superscript numbers seem a bit boring, and I’m not sure if these would need to switch to local numeral forms in Hindi or Arabic text. Any other ideas?\n\nCheers, Si\n\n",

      "content": "I've taken a look through a few recent scholarly publications and other non-fiction works with notes. In scholarly publishing, there seems to be a tendency towards inline citations rather than footnotes or endnotes; in popular non-fiction, endnotes are clearly preferred to footnotes, as they have been for some times. The note indicator is almost always a superscript number, the size and height of which, however, and a remarkable number of publications use fake superscripts.\n\nThe old asterix, dagger, doubledagger sequence was only ever useful for footnotes, generally where notes were sparse. Today they are used only informally, or in texts where notes are very rare. As soon as you have complex notes, multiple citations, etc. you really need a numeric system.\n\nRegarding localised numeral styles, I presume that the numeral style used for notes should be the same as that used elsewhere in the text. Use of European numerals is now very widespread, and it is relatively uncommon to see localised numerals in use. This is rather sad, especially since the localised numerals usually look better withint he context of the local scripts, but it is clearly the trend. I guess the implied question behind your query is 'Should e.g. an Arabic or Devanagari font contain sups glyphs and lookups for superior localised numerals?' I think it is possible that a minority of users might indeed find these useful.\n\n"

Of course that wouldn't work for just any sort of text but it looked great and was very easy to follow.\n\n"
