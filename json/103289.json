      "content": "The idea of the lowercase **r** replacing the middle bar of the **E** works, but a few details don't look right to me.\n\nFirst, the top of the **r** sits a little below where the middle stroke of the **E** would normally be. I'd move it up very slightly.\n\nSecond, the slight concavity of the terminal at the top of the **r** is dissonant (to my eye) with the flat outer edges of the serifs on the right-hand side of the **E**. I'd make the terminal at the top of the **r** (and its flipped image) just a bit less concave.\n\nFinally, the flipped image isn't just a flipped image. The rotated terminal above the **r** is visibly wider than the one on the **r** itself. I would make them match.\n\n"
