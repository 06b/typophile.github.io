I attempted to make a faithfull version but it was done 2 days ago so it isn't exactly \"a true old one\"--I can post a PDF sample when I get home this evening.\n\nOtherwise, the modern versions mentioned above may suit your needs. The \"Modernist Pack\" from P22 has numerous styles to choose from.\n\nChrisL\n\n"
