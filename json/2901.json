  "content": "okay, so if you know what this subject means, you must know that i'm a LOTR geek (check the current icon); i found some other information on [tengwar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417201223/http:/typophile.com/wiki/tengwar) fonts on the string about mixing scripts and thought it deserved its very own string. so i had a couple questions... first of all has the unicode been standardized for the script? secondly, does that really matter now with open type? i mean couldn't a person make a tengwar font these days that would just replace the appropriate ligature for the vowel placing? (or is ligature substitution what one would want to use for tengwar?) i've been interested in making my own tengwar font as the ones that are out there don't seem to be as interesting and/or artistic as the could be. (or can one of you point me towards some finer fonts?) i'm thinking that New Line had to have done SOMETHING for the LOTR series and some of their stuff (like the lettering on the ONE RING is absolutely gorgeous!) dunno if they actually made a font tho, would be great if they had. anyhow i'm just surprised that the movies hadn't sparked more interest in here on this topic! let's get some good dialog flowing... i'd love to be enlightened on this one!\n\n",

I've got in my own collection most of the Windows freeware Tengwar fonts out there, (and a couple of them I made myself, actually). Most of them follow Dan Smith's \"standardized\" character mapping, but there are also a few that are mapped phonetically. I have also found a number of Roman-readable fonts based on Tengwar letter forms. E-mail me if you have questions.\n\n"
