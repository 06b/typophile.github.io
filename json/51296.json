  "content": "Hey guys, I just started cross browser testing for the first time on a site I'm currently doing which uses Georgia. I opened the site in Internet Explorer 7.0 and noticed that my font of choice (Georgia) was slaughtered. Has anyone encountered this problem or maybe know a good alternate, it really looks bad. Man do I dislike IE.\n\n",

It seems to trigger the bold style in IE, but of course you can overwrite this standard behaviour, even in IE.\n\n"

There is no weight attribute in my stylesheet so I dont see why IE is interpreting it as bold as opposed to firefox as regular. That is why i thought the font was \"slaughtered\" because it renders in a entirely different weight. I'm not sure if this is appropriate to post in this forum, sorry if it is.\n\n"

I don't mean using flash either. I mean an entirely self-contained dynamic document format, and let RIA's use code and live out of the browser like Adobe AIR is trying.\n\nI think the web and the web applications need to separate ways, to both leave the browser and allow the designer/developer to have the utmost control, and not rely on another person's shoddy implementation of what 'ought to be'\n\nMy only recommendation for you is, if you wish to maintain the highest order of parity between your site out of Internet Explorer and in IE, you need to manually account for the differences using a seperate IE-only CSS file, and only load that upon browser check.\n\nThanks a lot Microsoft!\n\n"
