  "content": "Hi all, I've just started making fonts for the first time and am having a few problems...   \n   \nI've been importing designs from Illustrator as EPS's. All was going well, until I hit the letter 'f'.   \n   \nI've done a-e and when I tried f and other letters, it doesn't show them in the table view.   \n   \nWhen I re-open the glyph, it's not there, but its about half way to the edge of the page, moving left. So they are going in, but Fontlab is moving them around miles to the left, and not showing them in the matrix/table window... its moving the verticle guidelines too, but I can still see the horizontal ones, hence why I scrolled around to see if I could find it...   \n   \nHope you can help me out, looks like it could be good for my project, but a-e isn't soo impressive. ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518131057im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \n   \nThanks loads, Rob.\n\n",

Preferably and automatic system?   \n   \nI've tried the kerning and metrics assistance, but it doesn't seem to let me do anything.   \n   \nThanks again.\n\n"
