Which in reality is the way type making works in general. Still, it’s a stupid bug and I wish they would solve it.\n\nI have a lot of empathy for you position in looking. There is no obvious good answer that I can see unless you want to shell out very heavily for a Xante. But even then you might want a POS printer to see what the worst might be like... You can console yourself with the knowledge that there is no one right proofing choice for you. No silver bullet - except to be aware of what you are aiming for and what methods you want it to work well in and find a way to have it tested there. So if it is fine offset - make pals with a printer and see if you can run stuff in the margins - and so on.\n\nThere are several threads on Typophile that address similar questions and in many ways what I have written here is a nutshell summary of them along with a little salt of my own. Still, I encourage you to dig them up via a google site specific search and see what was said and by whom.\n\n"

However, when PS is transformed to PCL, mathematical rounding errors are unavoidable, but the same also happens, when you embed TT fonts into a PDF and make a printout on a PS printer, so it is difficult to avoid such rounding errors.
