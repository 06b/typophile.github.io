  "content": "In the movie \"13 Ghosts\" there is a \"Latin\" handwritten style font used through out the set on the glass. (It's the only redeeming quality of this movie.)   \n   \n ![13 Ghosts script font](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222214106im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33326.jpg)   \n   \nI'd love to find something as close to it as possible. The production notes about the set only gave me the following clues: \"The Latin “etchings” were actually rendered on a plastic overlay and adhered to the glass walls to achieve Hargreaves’ “Arcanum” design motif. \"   \n   \n   \nThanks for your time.   \n   \nDar\n\n [‹ &#40;x&#41; Hustle - Tuscan face {Nathan}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222214106/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4294 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Eagle Pack ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071222214106/http:/www.typophile.com/node/4305 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
