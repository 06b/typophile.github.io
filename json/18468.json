I'm mostly interested in knowing how it works in international operating systems (English, French, Italian, German, ect.) Win and Mac. Central European and Turkish characters are also included.\n\nThe characters that are included are here (4 Turkish characters [Ğğİı] are not present below):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062347im_/http:/typophile.com/files/charTable2.gif)\n\nI have English and Greek languages installed in my system (Win XP pro) but i don't know how i can access the above letters that are wanted in\n\n**Western European languages**  \n(_Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Iceland, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish_)\n\nand in **Central European languages**  \n(_Albanian, Croatian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Latin, Slovak, Slovenian_)\n\nAre the characters of your (above) language available at your system?\n\nIf you find that something isn't working please post here the versions of you OS and software that you're typing. You can also email me your feedback at the email that can be found in the txt.\n\nIt is a pixel font and use it at size 8px with \"none\" anti-alias. You can use it for free at your own risk!\n\nThanx in advance.\n\n",

      "content": "I'm new to pixel fonts, too. I tried out a paragraph in a few different sizes. I also tried all caps. I find that in MS Word (quickest way for me to test a full paragraph), on a 72-dpi screen, LCD laptop, it actually looks best at 6 point. All caps looks just about as readable as standard \"sentence case.\" There are a couple spacing issues that bug me:\n\n1- LC \"a\" often needs more space on left, but not always. check various pairs\n\n2- LC \"i\" often rides too close to others on the right\n\n3- \"z\" isn't right as a mirror of \"s\" -- it looks like numeral \"2\"\n\n4- the most conspicuous irritation is that the standard intra-word space is too small. I replaced all lone spaces with two spaces, and it instantly became FAR more readable.\n\notherwise, i like it.\n\n"

MS Word needs \"insert special character\", although you can set up custom keystrokes for anything that doesn't already have a keystroke. In InDesign, you can grab stuff from the glyph palette. For online work, there are many HTML entity tables out there.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanx jlg4104 for your instant feedback...\n\n| _...I tried out a paragraph in a few different sizes..._\n\nOk i guess i have to paste some guidelines on using this pixel font in order to work ok. It is designed to work with software like Macromedia Flash and Adobe Photoshop:\n\n`\n############ Macromedia Flash 8 ############ `\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062347im_/http:/typophile.com/files/FL8.gif)\n\n**1)** Use the font only at 8px or multiples of 8 (16,24,etc) with \"anti alias for animation\" selected.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**2)** Position your text blocks where \\_x and \\_y values are whole numbers,\n\ni.e. position them at the point \\_x=250 and \\_y=150, NOT at \\_x=250.8 and \\_y=150.4.\n\nIf you don't place your text's \\_x and \\_y position on a whole number, the pixel font will look blurred.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**3)** When you place your text inside a movie clip, the clip must also be positioned on whole pixel \\_x and \\_y values.  \nDo not scale the movieclip. Make sure it is at 100% size (Modify / Transform / Remove Transform)  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**4)** Align your text only left, NOT right, center or justified.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**5)** Try to avoid animating (tween animation) pixel fonts. When your fonts move, they get blurry  \nbecause they are not located on a whole pixel value. On the other hand you can try and animate them  \nvia actionscript using the Math.round(); function in order to animate the text clip in whole pixel values.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**6)** Avoid scaling pixel fonts using Flash's Scale feature. If you need to increase the size of your pixel font,  \nincrement the text's font size by 8 (16,24,etc).  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**7)** Make sure that you view your stage / movie / swf file at 100% view size. (View / Magnification / 100% - Ctrl+1)  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**8)** To enable the kerning pairs that are included with the font (Ta, Te, Tn, To, Tr, Ts, Tu, Tv, Tw, Ty, Tz, gj, yj, Γά, Γέ, Γή, Γα, Γε, Γη, Γι, Γο, ect ), with \"Static\" texts turn on the \"Auto Kern\" feature while \"anti alias for animation\" is selected. In \"Dynamic\" and \"Input\" texts with \"Auto Kern\" feature on, you must also  \nEmbed the letters that are included in the pairs.  \nIf you turn off \"Auto Kern\", the font will still work fine but without the Kerning Pairs available.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n############ Adobe Photoshop CS / CS2 ############\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414062347im_/http:/typophile.com/files/PSCS2.gif)\n\n**1)** Use the font only at 8px or multiples of 8 (16,24,etc) with the Anti-aliasing set to \"None\", the \"Kerning\" feature set to \"Metrics\",  \nHorizontal and Vertical Scale set to 100%, the tracking set to 0 and the text field must be \"Point Text\" (click and type - DON'T click, drag and then type).  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**2)** The resolution of you picture must be at 72 dpi.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**3)** Always align your text Left. Sometimes it also works when aligned Center and Right, but use it at your own responsibility.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**4)** To enable the kerning pairs that are included with the font, set the \"Kerning\" feature to \"Metrics\". To disable Kerning Pairs, set the \"Kerning\" feature to \"0\".  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHope i helped...\n\n"
