  "content": "I design wine labels and some are very nice but I stink at typography. I am often blown away by my competitions use of type. I am not talking about designing type or reworking it. I am talking about what fonts to select and interesting compositions. I don’t understand how they consistently bang out great design. Often their type choices are clean and classic. Any tips on how I can improve so I can remain competitive. Books, web sites references. How do kick butt designers do it?\n\n [‹ Flavour, food? Type?
