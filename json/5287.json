The \"LG\" seems redundant on the versions with the text portion and at smaller sizes is hard to distinguish.   \n   \nThe \"S\" doesn't seem right - sort of floating above the baseline or maybe reworking the lower curve.   \n   \nAlso, your Cafe Press shop doesn't appear to have any items on it.\n\n"
