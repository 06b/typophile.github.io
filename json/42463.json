  "content": "Hi guys (and gals),\n\nI’m currently working on a project where my AD has asked me to illustrate the process of drawing up the words ’The End’. From the sketch, to the final digital version in illustrator / type program. Its for a large client (Panasonic) and I need to version this in 26 languages, and I need to do 3 or 4 stages for each one. (Sketch / Firming Up / Scanned in and illustrated / Final). aghh!\n\nThe font is set, Din Condensed Medium. So what I need to do is retro fit the idea to the font...\n\nSadly, I’m no expert typographer! I’ve built/tested a couple in my spare time for the fun of it, which is why I’ve been asked to do this.\n\nSo I wondered if anyone knows of any nice examples or tutorials of people drawing up there type. I’m just looking for the style of drawing, and what kind of grids/lines people use to help sketch, and then firm up their designs.\n\nAny help, much appreciated,  \nRob.\n\n [‹ FontLab: class based kerning for a ZERO value](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141048/http:/typophile.com/node/16413 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [GlyphOrderAndAliasDB ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081208141048/http:/typophile.com/node/42076 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
