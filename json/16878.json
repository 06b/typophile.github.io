  "content": "I’ve been struggling with a logo for a long, long time. It’s for a natural foods grocery store. I presented a much earlier version and received helpful advice, though this version does not neccessarily include that.  \nIn order to maintain a certain handmade feel, and to create a sense of history, I’d love to utilize type that relates to the hand painted windows and signs of day gone by. I’m interested primarily in type that either stem from long enough ago that they smack of history, or that comes from the mid-seventies, when the store was founded. Currently, I have three logo consepts in progress. One that feels way back, using Brothers by John Downer, another that should feel a little groovy, but still contemporary (hopefully I’ll find something just right—maybe a rounded serif Didone?) and the attached. I’d like this to feel very contemporary, but I don’t want to give up the history. It’s Century Gothic, but I’d love to hear if anyone knows of a more interesting geometric gothic with some roots in brush lettering.  \nThanks!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [gothic.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003419/http:/typophile.com/files/gothic.gif) | 4.04 KB |\n\n [‹ Circa C and Numerals](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003419/http:/typophile.com/node/16881 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Eurostile Alternatives... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071023003419/http:/typophile.com/node/16743 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In my defense, I’ve not been to either, but I certainly can’t say for certain that I’ve never seen one before.  \nI’ve been trying to draw out stuff from Letterhead fonts for about a week. We can’t buy anything until we’re committed, so I’m working with a brush and pen for now. As far as that goes, you’ll notice I haven’t posted any of that concept yet. Heart’s in the right place, the hand with the pen in it, however, is not.\n\n"
