  "content": "Hi all,  \nI'm working on a farm to table restaurant design. But it will be more than a restaurant, with packaging and food products down the line.  \nI'm looking for a slab serif that has some light, somewhat feminine qualities. The brand I'm working on has a light feel to it, and I don't want to use a thick slab to move in on that.\n\nI know lots of designers deride archer as overused, but it's still stands up.\n\nJust wondering if anyone knows of a slab serif that has multiple weights that could have similar qualities.\n\n",
