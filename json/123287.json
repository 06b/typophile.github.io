  "content": "Among Doves Type distinguishing features are: severely curtailed question mark (no top loop); dropped left quote marks (which are a characteristic of some European languages other than English); markedly right-offset dot to the i. Are there any other notable book fonts (i.e. not speciality fonts) that include one or other of these features. Many thanks, Anthony\n\n",

      "content": "Montaigne and even Eusebius offset the dot on the i as well - but only to a small extent compared with the Doves type. This is because Jenson's own original roman face offset the dot on the i; and many modern Jensons don't include this feature, as it is (and I think correctly) perceived as limiting the potential usefulness of a typeface.\n\nThus, even Centaur and Cloister Lightface don't do this. So, except for a Jenson aiming at maximum authenticity, the offset tittle is likely something you will hardly find anywhere. As to the question mark, the specimens I saw in a brief search didn't include it, but I think I've seen such question marks before, so there may be possibilities there.\n\n"
