It's a matter up for much debate, but I'd like to see what we can come up with.\n\nHere is my contribution. Feel free to rip it to shreds, and add/delete. Apologies in advance to Linux users.\n\n\"Humanist Sans\":  \n`font-family: \"Gill Sans\", \"Gill Sans MT\", \"Gill Sans Std\", GoudySans, \"ITC Goudy Sans Std\", \"Myriad Pro\", \"Myriad Web\", \"Myriad Std\", \"Bitstream Vera Sans\", Verdana, sans-serif;`\n\n\"Oldstyle\":  \n`font-family: \"Adobe Jenson Pro\", \"Hoefler Text\", \"Centaur\", \"Centaur MT\", \"Garamond Premier Pro\", \"Stempel Garamond\", \"Adobe Garamond Pro\", \"Adobe Garamond\", Garamond, Georgia, serif;`\n\n\"Geometric Sans\": \\<\\<- My worst one.

The big issue is that some people cannot let go of the fact that many people are going to see different designs, regardless of the designers intent. That's just the way of the web.\n\nThe WORST font stack article was the most recent Sitepoint.com article [http://www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/](http://web.archive.org/web/20120211003116/http:/www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/ \"http://www.sitepoint.com/article/eight-definitive-font-stacks/\")\n\nI felt a lot of bile in my throat as I read that, and it is what has spurred me on to create better, more typographically informed font stacks.\n\n@litherland  \nI don't recall ever seeing that chart. Very nice!\n\n"
