  "content": "What are some typefaces you guys would recommend looking at if you wanted to move from using Gill Sans, forward in a more contemporary direction, say 10% forward (perhaps another more recently designed humanist sans) and maybe some directions that move more radically in a different direction but hint at the origins?\n\nNot sure I put it very eloquently, so I hope I've got my point across.\n\nBasically, suggestions for a small move forward from Gill Sans, and also suggestions for a large leap forward as well.\n\nEg, off the top of my head a small move might be myriad, scala, meta or frutiger, a large move perhaps legato, DIN, helvetica?\n\nAnyway, any suggestions appreciated.\n\nCheers,\n\nChristian\n\n",
