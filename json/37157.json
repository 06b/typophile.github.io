One thing I've been asked by a client of mine is a page where they can actually log in and view progress on work being undertaken for them, which is easier said than done but I can definately imagine the benefits.\n\nAfter continual searching on Google and indeed our own forum, I've been unsuccessful in finding any relevant information about creating such a system.\n\nIf any of you know of a decent resource with a tutorial or otherwise, and can indeed gauge the difficulty of setting up such a service with limited coding knowledge, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaul\n\n",

Here's a quick tutorial: [http://www.besthostratings.com/articles/password-protection.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021002844/http:/www.besthostratings.com/articles/password-protection.html \"http://www.besthostratings.com/articles/password-protection.html\")..\n\nUsing .htaccess is very simple. You don't even have to create a login page, because the browser will popup a login dialog, in which you can fill out name and password.\n\n"
