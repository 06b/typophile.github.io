It could be just slanted, or it could be different, like CMU Typewriter. If that font was narrower and lighter it would be perfect.\n\n"

That single width is a compromise allowing the m to condense and the i to expand while just maintaining marginal readability.\n\nso what you are asking for doesn't exist, (with multiple weights and italics), for a reason. you are in luck though— Courier condensed can be simulated on just about any desktop computer for free, so you can see.\n\n"
