The fonts will work as companions or separate. Best used over 36pt as a headline display face, these fonts will bring a bold playfulness to any project where a vintage or retro style is in the concept. The style reflects the era when things were indeed, mad, where men (and some women) did crazy art for vinyl records, food packaging and kiddie products. Sugar frosted blue donut cereal is yummy for your tummy like... Rocket Pop and Rocket Pop Outline. Buy both and get the discount! Watch for the Cerealboxx Set coming soon that will include the astroluxtype fonts, Sugarbang! Koo Koo Puff and Rocket Pop together in one box.
