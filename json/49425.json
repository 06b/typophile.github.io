I was referred to this forum by a friend; I’m trying to find a certain font.\n\nYou know how whenever you went to the skating rink or the carnival, the snackbars would always have backlit signs with plastic letters that looked like this:\n\n[http://i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn191/codytebaldi/menuboard.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052605/http:/i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn191/codytebaldi/menuboard.jpg \"http://i304.photobucket.com/albums/nn191/codytebaldi/menuboard.jpg\")\n\nIs there a font I could obtain which is identical to this lettering style? Helvetica looks close, but I’m not sure it’s a 100% match. Perhaps someone a bit more studied in typefaces could identify the font?\n\nThanks in advance...\n\n [‹ India style typo](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052605/http:/www.typophile.com/node/49337 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Open source layout/word processing software with support for Opentype? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081025052605/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48354 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
