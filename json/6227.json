I only leaved you some ideias to you reflect or experiment, try to implament a baseline overshoot to fall dawn the cross bar of some letters (capitals) like your E and V. Its because you must compensation this kind of letters to the others that have a horizontal stroke.   \nLike tiffany saids take a look the kerning of the letters, will be fresh the apperence of the text. The other point is the fact of the size of the descender are probably to short if compareded to the ascender. It only suggestions but you should creat the rest of alphabet and more samples to give us a better ideia.   \n   \nGood work and regads / Ricardo\n\n"
