The collection will be available January 1, 2007.\n\nThe collection features Burbank Big, in three widths and four weights, and Burbank Small, in four weights of both  \nRoman and italic. Designed for mixing and matching, Burbank offers a nearly endless array of combinations.\n\n“Until now, animated typefaces were drawn as single, stand-alone display fonts. They rarely had relatives or a  \nsupporting cast,” says Burbank designer Tal Leming, who was inspired by the versatility of his favorite cartoon  \ncharacters and the hand-lettered titles of classic animation.\n\nOften stymied by the lack of typographic options for his own graphic design projects that called for animated fonts in display and text weights, Leming set to work nearly a decade ago to create the Burbank “super family”  \nof typefaces. The collection features hand hewn fonts from big to small, wide to condensed, light to black and  \nnearly everything in between.\n\n“Designers need a coordinated, animated font family like this. I know that I sure did,” Leming says.\n\nHouse Industries is offering the entire Burbank collection of 20 fonts for $299, including a free T-shirt. Or you  \ncan purchase the display and text sets separately, for $199 each. Burbank Big features the 12 display fonts  \n(condensed, regular and wide in light, medium, bold and black weights). Burbank Small includes eight fonts total,  \nfour Roman and four italic, for use in text sizes.\n\nOrder online at [www.houseindustries.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20070825115519/http:/www.houseindustries.com/ \"www.houseindustries.com\") or call 1-800-888-4390.\n\n**About House Industries**   \nHouse Industries is a Delaware-based independent type foundry, illustration studio and design firm that markets  \nunique fonts and artwork worldwide.
