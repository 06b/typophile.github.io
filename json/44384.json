Vibration Gothic, like Titling Gothic, has the feel of an older, Akzidenz Grotesk-like sans.\n\n\\*We magazine designers prefer that to \"masthead,\" which is the listing of the staff/contributors.\n\n"

What first made me look at these was the font Rolloglide (shown [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140126045955/http:/www.bowfinprintworks.com/LinedFontGuide03.html) in the Lined Fonts Guide)-- imagine a solid version of Rolloglide with the C (alt) from Gemini on the FontBros page.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
