      "content": "I'm going to guess that these samples you have shown us came from a stationer who does wedding invitations and other formal stationery. If I recall correctly the other font we ID'd for you was Citadel, but you see Citadel is a digitized version of an older film type. There is a film type from Photo-Lettering called Stuyvesant Light 3 which has the identical initials to Citadel, and the lower case is I'm sure from another typeface that was a film type. That sort of mixing and matching of initials and lower case letters was done all the time. We have discussed this before here, and pointed out examples you can see in the Solotype Catalog of the way 'new' fonts were created by shuffling different initials with variations of lower case letters.\n\nMy point in all this is that I believe many formal stationers have held on to older technology, including engraving plates, and film types, because it allows them to (usually) avoid what I suspect you would like to do, and that is to find a cheaper way to get the look used by the stationer, by doing the printing yourself. Many commercial stationers, such as Carlson Craft, do use commercial fonts that they give code names, and those we can almost always ID quickly. However, because I get these kinds of requests very often, I can also say that there are many formal stationers who are not using commercially available digital typefaces. There can be several explanations -- they are custom fonts with limited distribution, or they are typefaces from an older technology, such as metal type, film type, or engraving plates. In any case, I think you need to accept that this 'font' is probably nothing that is available to the general public, and find an alternative.\n\nIf it was me trying to 'create' something similar, I would try [Helinda Rook](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018144613/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/athelinda-rook/) initials with [Diskus](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018144613/http:/www.philsfonts.com/showing.html?sku=LI00211001OT&start=1) lower case, and see if that worked for you. It's not identical, and it may be a bit awkward looking, but I think it has some similarities and would be unique. I personally don't like this 'Pamela Mann' font much, but that's what I'd try just for fun.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I am not being aware that this is a wrong doing here.\n\nIn fact, I found this seating display card for Miss Pamela Mann in the trashcan where I work last week. This is a very fancy wedding party. Too bad, I did not have a chance to check it with the wedding planners. I am trying to know what it is and plan to use it for one of my works soon.\n\nThank you for your hard trying to help! Again, I am sorry if I disturb you here.\n\n"
