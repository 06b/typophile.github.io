  "content": "My client (Robert Ayres) freelances as a stylist and makeup artist.  \nHe also does his own photography, with focus on weddings.  \nHe has used the logo icon (which I created a couple of years ago) as  \nAyres Creative,  \nRecently he has decided that it would be better to push his name (which as  \na great reputation in the field). Business was re-named Rob Ayres (the \"creative\" was dropped).  \nI am revamping the old type work which was done using Lineto's Normetica  \nfont (which I will continue to use in associaterd text). I am thinking that in  \nfashion, simple sans serif in a light to medium weight and wide seems to works well.  \nI like to openness of the design, with the large counters, and alternates.  \nI am having issues with balancing everything, as well as choosing the best characters.  \nI have done several Y's (unicase and standard caps), target-shaped geometric O's  \nand an alternate O with has larger counter. There was alternates A's designed  \nas well. I will post my a few designs.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [RobAyres1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020071436/http:/typophile.com/files/RobAyres1.jpg) | 69.72 KB |\n| [RobAyres2.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020071436/http:/typophile.com/files/RobAyres2.jpg) | 67.3 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "Is the second one supposed to be centered? With the slant of the A, it's hard to tell. I like in the second one how the gap between the block and ROB is closed. What does it look like when left-aligned, with the block almost as far left as it is in the first one, but with the amount of space between the block and the R from the second one? Unless some of the letters start lining up strangely, that might be the best way to go.\n\nI think the wider A and squared O match the rest of the letters better. The S looks like it could be wider. The curved Y is great, I think, and gives it extra personality. The O though looks a little small. Since it's not a flat top & bottom, it should probably crest above/below the cap height & baseline.\n\nAre the grey lines part of the logo? Also, what is the dot in the block? I almost don't want to suggest this, but the more I look at it, the more it seems like you might be able to get away with just the letters...the block is very dark compared to everything else, and the letters are working very well by themselves.\n\nBut without a logo, you always feel bad about charging someone for just letters. :)\n\n"

      "content": "Grey lines are from a grid I used and not part of the design. As for the O, I realize in most cases that \"O\"'s often more extend above and below beyond the x-height by 3-5%, and I may explore this as well. In a closely stagered formation as this is I suspect it will not work , but that is what experimentation is for. I have the files on another computer so I will upload some changes in the afternoon when I am working on that system.\n\n"

      "content": "I realize I didnt' answer all your questions, so...  \nSecond design is supposed to be centered (and aligned) in a \"regtangular\" formation and not the trapezoid as shown, but AYRES is too wide at this stage.  \nBlock / Icon will be printed in metallic foil, so it will look seperate from rest.  \nClient paid for Logo over a year ago, it is just being re-used. Type treatment is new.  \nI usually charge extra for guilty feelings, but in this case there are none.\n\n"

      "content": "the foil printing is a nice touch-The first one with the \"fun\"y is the type of letter that bugs you enough to make you remember it and brings unique personality and contrast within the font. I think the logo should form a justified rectangle with the spacing between the icon and R as in the first logo. I understand that you are set on using the icon but I do have to agree with the previous post and you could(in the future) use just the type and maybee print foil just for the y or a die cut...I just like the y...it's a logo within itself!\n\n"
