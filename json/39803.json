  "content": "Hi,\n\nIve been searching for a good intro book to design theory and design movements. Im not looking for thought relating to graphic design in particular but design theory and though that relates to all forms of design. I dont know if this kind of book even exists out there but Im hoping it does.\n\nI have a pretty basic understanding of design movements like modernism and functionalism for instance but I want to learn how these ways of thinking and designing are related and how they have evolved and what designers were associated. A book with images that show examples would be a bonus also. Some critical essays and good all around coverage of the timeline would be nice also.\n\nSo does anyone know of such a book.... ?\n\n",
