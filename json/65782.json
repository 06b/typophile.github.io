Notice the slight slants on the t and r aside from the distinctive lowercase a which is probably the dead giveaway/key to a door which I do not have in front of me.\n\nAny help greatly appreciated.\n\nDavid\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019044639im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Catherine_5391.jpg)\n\n",

Apart from the weight, it seems to be a hit. I don’t know if/where it is available in digital form, though.  \nF\n\n"
