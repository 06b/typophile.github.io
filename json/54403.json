  "content": "DSType announces the release of the new website and very soon a completely new online store will be available. The new site brings new typefaces: Dobra and Glosa Display.\n\n**Dobra**\n\nWe proudly introduce Dobra, the redesign of a previous released typeface by DSType named Dione. We decided to keep the same basic structure but we added more style and personality, while gaining a few more weights and styles. Dobra is now more robust than ever and is available in five weights with matching italics and is a good choice both for publication designers and corporate identity.\n\n[http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=59](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014212046/http:/www.dstype.com/index.php?id=59 \"http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=59\")\n\n**Glosa Display**\n\nGlosa Display is the latest addition to the Premium Typefaces and the perfect companion to previously released Glosa. With it's extra high contrast for eye-catching feature titles and strong personality, Glosa Display is the ideal typeface for use in very big sizes, every time you want to achieve a stylish but classic look.\n\n[http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=57](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014212046/http:/www.dstype.com/index.php?id=57 \"http://www.dstype.com/index.php?id=57\")\n\nDino dos Santos  \nDSTYPE\n\n",

      "content": "\"What is the difference between a “Premium Typeface” and a non-premium?\"\n\nGlad you ask!  \nThe Premium Typefaces are more like a process or a service than just a collections of fonts.\n\nYou can choose to license 10 weights, for instance, and that doesn't mean that the weights should be the ones available in my site because it's possible to customize certain aspects (weights, widths and few new glyphs) without charging extra money. Of course without exclusivity.\n\nThis implies a more close relationship between designer-costumer, and I appreciate that. The client might need a not-so-condensed version of Prelo, and a weight between the Medium and Semi-Bold, to use in the cover of a magazine. It will allow the fonts to fit as perfect as possible, the costumer ideas.\n\nDino\n\n"
