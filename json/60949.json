It reminds me of work by Underware and Storm Type -- it follows its own internal logic to surprising but interesting conclusions.\n\nI love the phallic R, too.\n\n"

It looks like you've taken great care in working out all the quirky details, both separate glyphs and word shapes look very good indeed. Could you please post a pdf? I'd really like to take a closer look at this.\n\n"
