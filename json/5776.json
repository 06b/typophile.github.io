And I haven't been doing this for very long either.. In fact I discovered typography only about a year ago when I started to prepare for design school. I fell in love with type, and I've been learning and researching since then.. This place is great for learning, considering how you get to watch the Godfathers of Type ID (Mike, Mark et al) work their magic. ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109094824im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)  \n   \n(Oh, and the not-drinking/smoking-thing might help too, although I'm not exactly sure how that factors in ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109094824im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/wink.gif). )   \n   \nBy the way, I first thought the sample David posted was [TheSerif](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109094824/http:/www.lucasfonts.com/cgi-bin/loadframe/lucasfnt/theserif/serif-.html), I looked that up and it didn't match, so I tried the other famous \"humanist slab\", and bingo! ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20051109094824im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)\n\n"
