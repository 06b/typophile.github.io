  "content": "I've been thinking about buying a great sans-serif for use on all kinds of things for some time now, but I've only just gotten around to it. While I would be content with just about any well-designed sans, I've found while browsing that certain qualities stand out. Can anyone recommend sans-serifs that have a number of the following characteristics?\n\n- Generally geometric design (but preferably not overly geometric, so Futura's out); possibly almost Art Deco in flavor \n- Some sharp points (I especially love an N with pointy ends) \n- An italic that uses italic letterforms, not just sloped romans \n- A decent, preferably wide, range of weights and widths \n\nIn my searches, I've found a number that could serve me well. The front-runners are Font Bureau's [Agenda](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Agenda) and [Relay](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Relay), with [Neutraface](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfontspecimens) and [Nobel](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel) close behind. I'm particularly enamored with Relay, as it has lots of weights, a real italic, and that smooth, Decoish character; it's taking some self-control not to just buy it now. I've also looked at [Avenir Next](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html), but it lacks a \"true\" italic, and Kabel, Erbar, and Metro, but all three are missing italics. One thing that would truly make my day would be to find a sans like the one I described, _plus_ alternates for certain letters (which Neutraface and [Anisette](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Anisette) have). Thanks in advance for any help you can give.\n\n",

Their humanism is probably what's not clicking; I think I'm latching on to a bit of an early 20th century vibe in what I want.\n\nI think you're right; I am looking for a display typeface, especially since I'm planning on finding a good serif for body copy later on. That said, I do want to have the _option_ of using the sans for longer passages if I need to.\n\nJames, I may just go with Neutraface, especially since it does have the flexibility of being both display and text (luckily, I don't use the dimension sign all that much, but that is odd). Plus, it's designed by Christian Schwartz, just about my favorite designer. But it doesn't quite grab me like Relay does. Any other typefaces that I should consider?\n\n"

The caps, which I realized are what I'm most looking at in these faces, are especially up my alley. Unfortunately, the italics are sloped romans, and I've always preferred it when there is some differentiation more than the angle (as in Neutraface). But the wide range of weights and widths does definitely keep it a strong candidate ...\n\nStefan, both Stalemate and Sophisto are great looking, but they're both too modern in tone. On a complete aside, looking at macrhino.com, I was struck by Ommegaand. The fact that it's Dutch and combines straight and wedge serifs reminds me somewhat of Farnham, which I'm using in my newspaper's design.

So the R where the tail joins the stem without a crossbar (hope I got the terminology right), the A and N with sharp tops, a near-perfectly circular O, and a G without a bar in the counter appeal to me.\n\nI happened to find another one I like on my own (looking through the book _Contemporary Newspaper Design_). The _National Post_ uses Jim Parkinson's [Richmond](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/parkinson/richmond), which has the sort of Deco/Johnston character I like.

Are you objecting to the concept of a designer going back and reworking an earlier work (like the controversy with Star Wars and George Lucas' editing)?\n\nTim, Regulator is both a bit too quirky and a bit too geometric without being Decoism for me.

Richmond is on my top two, along with Relay; I may have a tough time deciding between the two.\n\nJames, although my preference is for italic letterforms, I like the Vanity Fair sans enough that I'd be willing to see if the roman letterforms intrigue me enough to make me forget about the oblique. For me, I like when the italic is truly differentiated in text; an oblique just doesn't look striking enough for me.\n\nThanks for pointing me to those Metro samples, Marc.

It's now on my list, although it may not have enough of a Deco flavor to take the crown.

There are several, offering various degrees of differentiation from the upright. Bringhurst shows an interesting cascade of Sans italics, indicating the range of \"italicness\". Everything from pure sloped roman to completely different structure.\n\nReed, this might be a good time for you to bust out FontLab and try your hand at making the Geometric Sans Italic you want. That's why I made Mundo Sans; I couldn't find the typeface I wanted, so I made it. If there's a project you want it for, you could just make a few letters for it, and add to it over time.

You're right about Metro - too few weights for me. I actually prefer Neutraface over Verlag because Neutraface has a more differentiated italic, is designed by Christian Schwartz (although I love H&FJ nearly as much), and Verlag just has this slightly more sterile feel (perhaps owing only a little to the typeface and more to my knowledge of its origins for the Guggenheim). Gill Sans, Freight Sans, and John Sans, though all great faces (I especially love John Sans' concept of being Baskerville minus serifs), aren't quite Deco enough for me, the same way that Johnston and Nobel aren't, on further reflection.\n\nGotham hasn't been mentioned, Chris, but in looking at it, it doesn't grab me like some others. I want to say it feels _too_ geometric, maybe too workmanlike, but it's more of a gut reaction. And, like many sans-serifs, its italic is an oblique roman, which I'll use if I love the roman, but would prefer not to.\n\nTiffany, thanks a ton for your sample! For me, it's pretty much down to Relay, Richmond, and Neutraface, with Relay edging ahead. Actually, I never found the Font Bureau specimen to be that cold - I kind of like Relay and other similar faces' quality of being somewhat stark and machined - that's why I like those pointy A's and N's! I'm glad to see, from quickly glancing at your specimen, that what makes it interesting in large sizes doesn't distract as text, which was one of my concerns (since it lacks Neutraface's text and display fonts).

That said, later in the school year, when I have more free time, I might try my hand at putting my anchor points where my mouth is.\n\nI actually don't want it for any specific purpose; I just want a really great-looking typeface to use, and I love that Deco flavor.\n\nThe posts expressing interest/mild disdain for my dislike of slanted romans as italics come as a bit of a surprise to me. I use Myriad Pro, with its rather italic italics, all the time, and after seeing Relay's italic a and g, I thought that typefaces like this would be the norm. Looking back at Relay and Richmond, their \"italic\" italics are actually evident in just a few key characters, so maybe I overstated my love for them just a bit. Neutraface's may be the missing link; it has by far the most divergent letterforms. As I mentioned previously, I like a clear differentation between roman and italic for combined use in text; I also can never get the taste of MS Word's horribly skewed false italics out of my mouth after using it unwittingly for years.\n\nI'm glad that I was able to suggest something interesting to get you thinking. Maybe if I have a few minutes I might try some sketching too. But I'm afraid of what my pencil will produce.\n\n_Tangentially related to this discussion of italics:_ without getting this thread sidetracked, as I'd still like to know if there's anything else out there I'm missing (though that doesn't seem likely at this point), I've found two really interesting and unconventional uses of italics in typefaces. One is [Aspect](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/www.typography.net/type/aspect.htm), which I think is well known around these parts. Pampatype's [Rayuela](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/www.pampatype.com/html/tipografia_caracteres_rayuela_reg_home.html) seems less known, but equally intriguing. The roman has this remarkable ability to be legible and upright and yet feel wonderfully italic - did I mention I love using italics for running text? And its italic is loads of fun too - I especially love the alternate o and s's - check them out in the [PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20110322094113/http:/www.myfonts.com/HelpImages/Rayuela.pdf). Just wanted to put Rayuela out there - I might get that after the geometric sans if my funds haven't dried up.\n\n"
