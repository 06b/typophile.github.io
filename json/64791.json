I drew this as a companion for Futura.  \nI just needed some direction on the lowercase. So I was wondering if it looks similar to something that's out there. I definitely had Luc De Groot's Antiqua in the back of my head as I was drawing this but I'm not sure if it even shows.\n\nI was being sneaky in posting this here. It definitely belongs to the Design or the Critique forums. Oh, thanks for the feedback on the Q. It put a smile on my face and some ideas in my brains.\n\nBut yeah, anything close or similar you guys can think of?\n\n"
