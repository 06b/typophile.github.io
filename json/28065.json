In response to a couple of requests of people who told me the Type ID Pop Quiz is too hard and only fun for obsessed type nuts, I decided to crank up the game factor and add two more Type ID Pop Quizzes. The difference between the three is how much of the typeface is shown.\n\n- [Type ID Pop Quiz V2.1 - **Entry Level**](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116091052/http:/typophile.com/node/27995)  \nThe challenge shows a number of words which may or may not provide a hint. This is the only quiz where I personally post all the challenges and where you need to send me the solution **by e-mail** to allow other enthusiasts to participate as well. If people come up with a fun challenge they can always send it to me and I can include it.\n- [Type ID Pop Quiz V2.1 - **Intermediate Level**](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116091052/http:/typophile.com/node/28061)  \nThe challenge shows a single glyph. The person who identifies the typeface and weight posts the new challenge. You can’t win two games in a row (to avoid a ping pong situation where two people end up playing against one another).\n- [Type ID Pop Quiz V2.1 - **Expert Level**](http://web.archive.org/web/20061116091052/http:/typophile.com/node/27994)  \nThe challenge shows a portion of a glyph. The person who identifies the typeface and weight posts the new challenge and can’t win the next game (for the same reason).\n\nCome and join the fun. ;^)\n\n",
