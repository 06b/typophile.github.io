  "content": "When making a font in FonLab SF5 (i.e., writing the features), is there some way to preset what features are on by default, or is this strictly a matter of the application program (such as InDesign)?\n\nFor example, I made up a set of fonts for a book designer, who complained that the ligatures didn't work. We never did trace this down, he just changed fonts. He does use InDesign on a Mac and I use Windows XP; they worked fine on my machine. For all I know, he simply forgot to check the features list in InDesign. But If I could cause certain features to be on when the typeface is selected, that might solve a few problems. I did look in the FL5 index, nothing under \"default . . .\"\n\nThe OT tag registry indicates certain features should be on or off,\n\n\\>\\>UI suggestion: This feature serves a critical function in some contexts, and should be active by default.\\>\\>\n\n. . . I always assumed that was up to a particular applications program.\n\nTIA\n\nCharles\n\n",

They are for both type Devs and app devs.\n\nThey help the developer of the OT feature set anticipate what an application _may_ do, and application developers understand what might be best for them to choose. Whether or not an OT feature is available and how it is implemented (like defaulting to \"on\") is up to the application developer.\n\n"

The features that typically are on by default but can be turned off are: \"calt\", \"clig\", \"liga\".\n\nAdam\n\n"
