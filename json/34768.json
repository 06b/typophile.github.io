Since I didn’t want to play too long with blends over paths (that would actually be the best way with less work to get a more complex gullioche pattern) I created a curve from top to right  \n3. I used this curve for the margin as it’s set on the image  \n4. Did the blending and adjusted number of steps  \n5. visually adjusted each ellipse’s size to go to the margin (YOu wouldn’t have to do this if using paths)  \n6. copied and mirrored the result\n\nFor the special effect I also put a gradient in the back (blueish colour from centre to the outside)\n\n"

CorelDRAW also doesn’t give you margins (not to my knowledge of V12) but it gives you custom paths and rotations you may need to get a proper pattern. I adjusted the sizes myself.\n\nI guess if you need professional result you cannot always rely on tools and their properties only. Some work always needs to be done.\n\n"
