It is a flowing script that can perhaps be seen as a casual, modern version of the traditional copperplate script. A fresh take on how ascenders and descenders interact with the context of the setting. Angelus is ideal for use in package design, as well as on personalized collateral and book covers.\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  \nNEGRO FONTS BY SUDTIPOS  \n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n**[Lynda](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202022830/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/lynda/familytree.html)**  \nA post-modern, monoline rounded sans ideal for club flyers, music covers and fashion publications.\n\n**[Paz](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202022830/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/paz/familytree.html)**  \nA squarish 4-weight industrial family, ranging from extreme hairline to black.  \nIt is ideal for editorial headlines where type plays a major role in the overall design.\n\n**[Santino](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202022830/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/santino/familytree.html)**  \nA rounded monoline, post-bauhaus geometric font with smooth extremes and a touch of modern sensuality. It is named after Ariel “Negro” Di Lisio’s son.\n\nAll the Negro fonts were designed by Ariel Di Lisio and digitized by Alejandro Paul.\n\n",
