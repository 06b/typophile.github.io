  "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nI have a question:  \nI've search for lot of materials and books on design, but still have no satisfactory answer at all. Opinions differs, so I ask yours!\n\nProblem: position of the picture in the text on the page and it's relation to the baseline grid and text, In the case of modular grid.  \nNow I found two general opinions:\n\n1)  \nThe bottom always is standing on the baseline, and the top is on the mean line (x-hight).\n\n2)  \nThe bottom is standing on the desent line, and the top is on the ascender line (Caps hight).\n\nWhat you think about it?\n\nMaybe there are straight solutions, or reasoned opinions.  \nThank you\n\n",
