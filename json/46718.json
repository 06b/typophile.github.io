It seems to be Helvetica bold, but the _s_ and _l_ aren’t right. (Neither are the _p_ descenders, but those might just be customized).\n\nThanks for your help.\n\n [‹ Type ID](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829121933/http:/typophile.com/node/46849 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [ID: Similar to DIN... ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080829121933/http:/typophile.com/node/46846 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

There’s also Schulbuch Süd (aka Schoolbook Alternate etc.), which has a slightly more Futura-like feel.  \nPlease note that both Schulbuch Nord and Süd have the single storey a.\n\n"

The intention was to interlink (and therefore facilitate) the process of learning both to read and to write.\n\nCheers,\n\nGünni\n\n"
