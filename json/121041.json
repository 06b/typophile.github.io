A few months ago I picked up Norpeth.\n\n[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/norpeth/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150420142930/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/norpeth/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/northernblock/norpeth/\")\n\nI noticed on the heavier weights the colon is merged to form one \"dot\". Also, commas are vertically compressed to almost appear as periods. I did contact Northern Block about this and they said they'd be happy to build a custom font (for a fee, of course).\n\nQuestion is: Has anyone ever seen glyphs designed this way? I like the font but I think I need to relegate this to my \"don't use\" folder.\n\n",

Something evidently went wrong with the colon and the fact that they didn’t check and put it on sale anyway is frankly inexcusable.\n\n"
