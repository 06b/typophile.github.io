  "content": "As such a beginner in this field, I have been searching for a sans serif to match the Arnhem Pro for some documents works.\n\nFirstly, I considered the Myriad Pro, but it is overused and could not excite me any more. Then, I thought about the Avenir Next, which is special enough but not very perfectly matched the Arnhem Pro. I love the Arnhem Pro, but I can hardly get a perfect sans serif to match it, so here am I. I think turn to the professionals will be a good idea.\n\nSo gentlemen, please give your suggestions.\n\n",

      "content": "I absolutely adore Fresco Sans, but there are some issues with it that you might want to keep in mind. Its loose spacing works great at text sizes, but when set large (in an editorial context) I almost always have to tighten things up, something that Fresco’s shapes doesn’t handle very well (e.g. needs a lot of manual kerning). For more “silent” work, you could get away with the default spacing, but it doesn’t hold up well when you want some punch. The small caps are almost at x-height, and pretty unusable for editorial work. Bits and pieces of the extended character set (particulary those necessary for typesetting Norwegian) also stray too far from convention for my taste. So much so, that I had to ask permission to make a few modifications.\n\nBut I love it. It is such a beauty! Nobody is perfect, I guess.\n\n"
