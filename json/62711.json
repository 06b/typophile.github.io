I post both version regular and italic.  \nSomeone recognize this typeface?  \nThank you for the help.\n\n",

      "content": "Jan Middendorp’s book “Dutch Type” makes it sound as if the latter part of the 19th century saw the Dutch copying typefaces from other countries. Only Enschedé and Amsterdam Type Foundry were in competition by that time. It seems that not much new Dutch design happened until the time of De Roos in the 1920’s. I’m sorry if these details are wrong, but this is based on a quick scan of the text.\n\nI was trying to hunt for Dutch typefaces, and maybe that is not where to look.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
