I was going to purchase another Licko font (I think there is a Mrs. Eaves san serif, yes?), but really am short on cash. I have Adobe Type Basics OpenType Edition, purchased for my classes. Can anyone list some wiser combinations for me? I am still in the basics of typography. Some combo’s I have thought: Gill Sans, Lucida Sans, Helvetica Nue, Frutiger. I think I picked these, because these are the only ones I have leaned towards, that is from my typography class approved typefaces. Any help, will be appreciated.\n\n",
