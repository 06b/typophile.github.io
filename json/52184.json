The main logo is a simplified blackletter script, somewhat like [Cloister Black](http://web.archive.org/web/20110514170304/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cloister-black/) or [Agincourt](http://web.archive.org/web/20110514170304/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/agincourt/), but it doesn't match any blackletter font I could find.\n\nI think the sans serif lettering at the bottom of the sign looks like Helvetica.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
