  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI have a project called \"Phil's Tour\", which is me, Philippe, touring Europe and producing a TV show of weekly episodes released on it's own YouTube channel. I will spend one week in a region of a country trying to uncover a hidden treasure. I mean by that, an artist, someone who perpetuates a very old tradition or someone who has a peculiar passion. The uniqueness of the show resides in the fact that I will not visit any cities and will focus exclusively on tiny villages and the countryside.\n\nI am now building a website (that will later link to a Kickstarter page) using GoDaddy's website builder. So far it is perfect for me who possesses zero knowledge in programming.\n\nAnother area where I have zero knowledge is in design, thus this post.\n\nWhat would feel right, font-wise, for the tour's website, keeping in mind that my show will be light, warm and familiar?\n\nAlso, would it be a good idea to go for a pair of fonts or stick with one and utilize an all caps version for titles?\n\nMy budget is very limited, so I can't lie and would love it if your suggestions rely on fonts included in Windows ;)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI would like to take this opportunity and ask you about choosing the official colors of my projects. I don't really have a preference except that it should be a choice that reflects the three qualities described above.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nPhil\n\n",

      "content": "Cool project.\n\nFirst of all: don't use all-caps for titling; choose a good text font, and a good harmonious display font for larger sizes.\n\nBTW you don't have to stick to \"system fonts\" – luckily there are a number of good free fonts out there these days (although do be careful of the lion's share of bad ones). One great place to look is Typographica's annual round-up of favorites... although actually few of those are free.
