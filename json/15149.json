      "content": "No, I would not compare it to Font Labs hinting ability, it is a different kettle of fish.\n\n\"In FontLab we use a small set of high-level hinting instructions that are automatically compiled to TrueType instructions during font export. Because these instructions can be set and edited visually we call them visual TrueType hints or just visual hints.\"\n\nTTHmachine (the cuurent version) is a tool for applying low-level instructions to fonts, it also has visual rendering to help in this process.\n\nThe aim is to add (in later versions) a higher-level hinting ability also (that could be compared to font-lab, I guess).\n\n"
