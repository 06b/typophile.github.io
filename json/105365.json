For me the script\n\n    ---- fnt2ufo ----\n    #!/usr/bin/env fontforge -lang=ff\n    \n    Open($1);\n    Generate($1:r + \".ufo\");\n    Quit(0);\n    ---- cut here ---\n\nappears to work. With linux or OS X, a simple\n\n    find . -name \"*.otf\" -exec fnt2ufo {} \\;\n\nshould do the job for all otf font files in the current directory and subdirectories. If that is not fast enough (due to one call to fontforge for each file) you can reduce the number of calls to one reusing some code of [http://fontforge.org/scripting-tutorial.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415054428/http:/fontforge.org/scripting-tutorial.html \"http://fontforge.org/scripting-tutorial.html\")\n\n"

Then, and only then, you can execute (in any folder)\n\n    find . -iname \"*.[ot]tf\" -exec sfnt2ufo {} \\;\n\nto process all ttf and otf files or simply use\n\n    sfnt2ufo <fontfile>\n\nto get the corresponding ufo of one particular font file.\n\n"

The input was 486 western fonts from Adobe Type Classics (something of about 10 years ago). It took about 2 minutes to generate the ufo, but FontForge would not process back some of the UFO files, telling it could not process the features in the ufo and scrapping them.\n\n"

Those are the 242 lines that cause the problem with the 242 ufo files.\n\nAfter executing\n\n    find . -name \"*.fea\" -exec sed -i .orig '/by[]*;/d' {} \\;\n\nto remove those lines, FontForge accepted the ufo files as input without scrapping the features.\n\n"
