  "content": "My client is a small semi-upscale boutique for designer infantwear. They describe themselves as punk, but everything looks too clean for me to endorse that fully. Rather, think D&G writ small, tiny rock-themed graphic Ts, asian patterns, etc.\n\nThey need a typeface (or two) to use across a range of publications. It should be suitable for body copy and headlines. I can use either a single face or a body/headline pairing. Their marketing strategy is entirely focused on the parents. The baby is framed as an accessory of sorts.\n\nThe concepts of 'punkness' and 'infancy' are almost completely antithetical. Thus far, every combination I have found comes across as a joke. Is there such a thing as clean, safe, adorable punk? They currently use all lowercase courier new, which is awful . . ..\n\nTim\n\n",

As I touched on earlier, it's not really 'punk' as I understand it (c.1970s London) but it's definitely edgier than any other infantwear I've seen. We're presenting it this way: A baby could care less what decorates her onsie, so her parents might as well dress her as they like until she's old enough to define herself . . . and very few twentysomethings would opt for Winnie the Poo as a personal aesthetic.\n\nAnd actually, I was completely serious about the Clarendon. Am I the only one to notice the Clarendon/Edgy-art-school-knitting-club connection? In hindsight, \"they seem favor sturdy Victorians like Clarendon\" has a backhanded \"women in comfortable shoes\" connotation that I absolutely did not intend. Sorry if I offended anyone :-/\n\n"

And, the spacing of the letters are just discongruent enough that it won't look perfect.\n\nPart of the uniqueness of punk is that it doesn't try too hard. Cut n' paste and typewriters are not punk because they've been sanctified by the Punk Rawk Academy, they are merely accessible and easy methods. Style was—at at least at one point—a byproduct of the tools, not the other way around.\n\nAs a person who grew up in a punk scene, I abhor grunge fonts. I feel that if one wants to dirty up a font, then that person should do it by hand. Could you suggest to your client that they take all their print material and photocopy it to give it that extra edge? I realize that's a chore, but if you can sell them on the idea, I feel it would do your work (and most importantly their brand) justice.\n\n**Have fun.**\n\n"
