  "content": "Hello,\n\nYears ago I installed Fontographer for windows xp. Since rebuilding my system I have started over from scratch. I keep getting the out of memory message when i start fontographer. I remember editing some numbers, not the virtual memory. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\nThanks and much appreciated.\n\n-Chuck Borges\n\n [‹ how open is open type](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145248/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14338 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FontLab kerning classes ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080825145248/http:/www.typophile.com/node/14310 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
