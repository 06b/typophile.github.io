I would highly recommend reading through, [Karsten Luecke's guide to font metrics](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809201633/http:/kltf.de/downloads/FontMetrics-kltf.pdf) (fair warning, depending on your browser, that link will trigger an automatic download of a PDF). There are also numerous discussions elsewhere on Typophile, but the one about [UPM and Vertical Font Metrics](http://web.archive.org/web/20140809201633/http:/typophile.com/wiki/UPM%20and%20vertical%20font%20metrics%3A%20please%20help%20to%20clarify) should have the level of detail you need and cover most questions.\n\n"
