  "content": "Cyrillic Weekend, with [Maxim Zhukov](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Maxim%20Zhukov) as the instructor-moderator\n\nFor those of you with an interest in multi-script typeface design who could not attend the [TDC](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Type%20Directors%20Club) program last weekend, you missed a fantastic opportunity. Maxim was at his finest presenting the nuances of [Cyrillic](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cyrillic) type and helping the 18 who attended improve their own works in progress. The event started with a trip to the New York Public Library special collection of rare early books printed in Cyrillic. I’ll bet it was tough having the Czar as your art director—we got to see handwritten notes of instruction and critiques in the Czar’s own hand and some spectacular books.  \nAfter a day of Maxim’s presentations on Cyrillic forms and styles, there were critiques of numerous impressive works in progress by the participants.  \n [James Montalbano](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/James%20Montalbano), [Gary Munch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gary%20Munch), and [Carol Wahler](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Carol%20Wahler) put the event together helping Maxim bring it to life. Hats off to them all for making it a valuable learning experience and an enjoyable weekend as well!\n\nThe TDC will also bring [Gerry Leonidas](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Gerry%20Leonidas) back in the Fall to present Greek Weekend, the second in the non-Latin the series.\n\n[http://www.tdc.org/events/education//non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatleonid...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatleonidasgreek.html \"http://www.tdc.org/events/education//non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatleonidasgreek.html\")\n\n[http://www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatzhukovc...](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatzhukovcyrillic.html \"http://www.tdc.org/events/education/non-latinweek-ends/2007nonlatzhukovcyrillic.html\")\n\n[http://www.tdc.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/www.tdc.org/ \"http://www.tdc.org/\")\n\nChrisL\n\n",

The adoption of Unicode, and the industry-wide transition to OpenType font format has put the skills and the expertise of type designers to a new test.

Cyrillic is one of these scripts, used by large numbers of readers and writers and designers.\n\nFeatures of Cyrillic will include :\n\n\\* Cyrillic, its origins, its history and evolution, its structure, its peculiarities, its traps and pitfalls  \n \\* Character-by-character overview, comments and tips (character set: Windows 1251, plus Old Cyrillic, plus Serbian alternates)  \n \\* Cyrillic and Latin  \n \\* Cyrillic and Greek  \n \\* Cyrillic caps, l.c., and yes, s.c.  \n \\* Cyrillic roman and Cyrillic italic (and Cyrillic cursive?)  \n \\* Serbian Cyrillic and Bulgarian Cyrillic  \n \\* Old (pre-1918) Cyrillic  \n \\* [more?!]\"\n\nThat link seems to work just fine.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

So the underlying text data for Russian, Bulgarian and Serbian is the same, the only difference is the glyph form.\n\nTo answer Nick, Chris is right; to implement these glyph-form differences in an OpenType font you'll have to use the 'locl' feature. Here's a code snippet that handles the lowercase 'be' (б U+0431 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER BE):\n\n`feature locl {`\n\nscript cyrl;  \n language SRB exclude\\_dflt; # Serbian  \n sub be by be.serb;\n\n} locl;\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142im_/http:/typophile.com/files/be_beserb_3714.png)\n  \n'be' and 'be.serb'\n\nThe above assumes that the default form of 'be' is the one used for Russian (i.e. the default representation of the character U+0431 is the 6-like shape).  \nIf, for example, the main market for your font was Serbia, then you could (hypothetically) revert the order and make the Serbian form the default one. But this would complicate the feature code, because you would then have to specify all the other languages that use Cyrillic and which prefer the 6-like shape. Here's what I mean:\n\n`feature locl {`\n\nscript cyrl;  \n language RUS exclude\\_dflt; # Russian  \n lookup BE\\_SIX\\_LIKE\\_SHAPE {  \n sub be by be.russ;  \n # Notice the difference in this substitution.  \n # Also, glyph 'be.serb' was renamed to 'be', and 'be.russ' was 'be'.  \n } BE\\_SIX\\_LIKE\\_SHAPE;\n\nlanguage UKR exclude\\_dflt; # Ukrainian  \n lookup BE\\_SIX\\_LIKE\\_SHAPE;\n\nlanguage UZB exclude\\_dflt; # Uzbek  \n lookup BE\\_SIX\\_LIKE\\_SHAPE;\n\nlanguage MKD exclude\\_dflt; # Macedonian  \n lookup BE\\_SIX\\_LIKE\\_SHAPE;\n\nlanguage BEL exclude\\_dflt; # Belarussian  \n lookup BE\\_SIX\\_LIKE\\_SHAPE;\n\n# And so on...  \n} locl;\n\n"

The Greek diacritic letters with tonos and oxia both decompose to letter plus U+0301, which is the combining acute accent character. This means that bi-script fonts supporting combining mark characters need to have a Greek-specific ( feature) glyph for U+0301 and other general diacritics.\n\nSimilarly, in a combined Latin-Cyrillic font with combining mark support one would want a Cyrillic-specific 'breve' glyph.\n\nAlthough the form of these characters as used in different scripts may vary, they are clearly the same character performing the same orthographic functions. The Greek tonos performs the same stress mark role as the acute in most European orthographies; the Greek oxia and varia were tone marks and correspond to the use of acute and grave in the orthographies of huge numbers of tonal languages in Africa and elsewhere; the Cyrillic kratka, like the Latin (and Greek) breve, indicates a short vowel sound.\n\n"

But one shouldn't presume that the kratka will always be considered 'part of the letter' in all orthographies. It is a mark that indicates a short vowel sound, and hence could easily be adapted as a combining diacritic in orthographies for other languages.\n\nAs a parallel, think of the Latin á. In French, this is considered a letter plus diacritic mark, and is sorted in dictionaries amid the letter A words. In Northern Sami, á is considered a separate letter and is sorted after A.\n\n"

Kofi Annan used to say about some political developments, \"It’s not an event, it’s a process.\" Maxim referred to this quotation on several occasions.\n\n2. While Maxim Zhukov worked as typographic coordinator at the United Nations in New York, his immediate boss at the UN was also Russian. At one time, When Maxim prepared a publication, something has gone wrong. His boss looked at him and asked: \"Maxim Georgevich, is this a screw-up, or is this a position?\" Maxim admitted that it was a screw-up.\n\nWhen [Gary Munch](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/flickr.com/photos/adamt/410712188/in/set-72157594570229703/) said \"shnorkel\", I interpreted that he meant the German \"Schnörkel\" (an embellishment, squiggle, flourish) rather than \"Schnorchel\"/snorkel. But I think it may have been just a merging of both terms.\n\nGary has reasonable knowledge of German but his rendition of Schnörkel sounded more \"New York jiddish\" than actual German. James Montalbano instantly liked the term, so did I. I think it should find its way into general typographic terminology.\n\nOverall, I must compliment Maxim on his teaching skills. I was very impressed with the Cyrillic workshopm and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though I do have good knowledge of Cyrillic, I did learn a lot. I found the formula very well chosen:\n\n\\* Friday afternoon was a visit to the Slavic division of the New York Public Library, where we could look at some old Cyrillic type specimens and prints (though some participants, including myself, wished that we could spend more time looking at the specimens).\n\n\\* Saturday was a full-day (9 to 5) lecture-style, when Maxim first talked about the development of the Cyrillic script (the pre-Petrine time, the reform by Peter the Great, the 19th century type founding, the Soviet period and the newest times), and then discussed the entire alphabet [letter-by-letter](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/flickr.com/photos/adamt/410708645/in/set-72157594570229703/) (the Russian as well as some non-Russian letters): first uppercase, then upright lowercase, and finally italic lowercase. He also discussed the peculiarities of handwritten and script Cyrillic.\n\n\\* Sunday was another full day, during which Maxim critiqued the Cyrillic type designs that the participants sent him before the workshop, all produced according to a standardized layout. For the first 3 or so participants, he spent some 30-40 minutes talking about each project. All the time, he actively asked for comments from other participants, and it was a collaborative critique rather than a one-way monologue. We spent a bit less time for each of the designs discussed later, but it was not a problem because the discussion about the first three or so designs already covered many common problems that appeared in designs that appeared later, so we didn’t actually feel that we needed to talk in great detail about every single alphabet. So in the discussion on the later designs, Maxim concentrated on the specific issues not discussed previously.\n\nThe visuals presented by Maxim were very good and comprehensive. He also presented a collection of books that people could find useful when studying Cyrillic (many of them were in Russian only).\n\nI found Maxim’s timing perfect: he finished 4:58 on Saturday, and 4:45 on Sunday, just on time. The balance between serious content and lightweight anecdotes was just right. It was both [informative](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/flickr.com/photos/adamt/410714979/in/set-72157594570229703/) and [fun](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/flickr.com/photos/adamt/410716190/in/set-72157594570229703/).\n\nEven though the event was not the cheapest for me (flight from Berlin to New York, hotel and the participation fee), I felt that my money was extremely well spent. Even though I had known Maxim for seven or so years now, worked with him on several ATypI projects, and spoke to him during various conferences, it was the first time that I could enjoy his knowledge and experience for a longer period of time, several days. This was far better than the brief conversations we had previously. Thank you, Maxim!\n\nI’d also like to thank [the other participants](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015022142/http:/flickr.com/photos/adamt/410731168/in/set-72157594570229703/). I felt it was an excellent group, very active and responsive, and it was fun seeing some of my good friends again, and taking part in it.\n\nAdam\n\n"
