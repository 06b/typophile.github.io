TYPE, LETTERING, AND CALLIGRAPHY, 1450-1830. (MONDAY-FRIDAY, 14-18 JULY). The development of the major formal and informal book hands, the dominant printing types of each period, and their interrelationship. Topics include: the Gothic hands; humanistic script; the Renaissance inscriptional capital; Garamond and the spread of the Aldine Roman; calligraphy from the chancery italic to the English round hand; the neo-classical book and its typography; and early commercial typography. The course presupposes a general knowledge of Western history and some awareness of the continuity of the Latin script but no special knowledge of typographical history. Instructor: James Mosley.   \n   \nJAMES MOSLEY is Visiting Professor in the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication at the University of Reading. He retired as Librarian of the St Bride Printing Library in London in 1999. The founding editor of the Journal of the Printing Historical Society, he has written and lectured extensively on the history of European and English typography. In 2003 he received the annual award of the American Printing History Association for his contributions to printing history.   \n   \n   \n   \n63. INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF TYPOGRAPHY. (MONDAY-FRIDAY, 28 JULY - 1 AUGUST). A survey of European and American typographic history from 1450 to the present, but concentrating on the period 1480-1950. Topics will include: the development of Roman and italic; from Old Style to Transitional to Modern (Italian, French, Dutch, and English developments); display types; the coming of machine composition and the historic revivals; typeface nomenclature; and techniques for dating pre-1885 hand-set typefaces and for naming post-1885 machine-set typefaces. In laboratory sessions, students will have a chance to set type by hand, proof, and print. Instructor: Stanley Nelson.   \n   \nSTANLEY NELSON has been a specialist for many years in the Graphic Arts Collection of the National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution, and he has given many demonstrations and lectured widely on various aspects of typographic history. He is both author and presenter in the 1985 Book Arts Press videotape, From Punch to Printing Type: The Art and Craft of Hand Punchcutting and Typecasting.\n\n",
