Farquart complains that 1 and 2 don't correlate, and Stewf chimes in that plenty of 3s that were not 1s.\n\nI wonder how much graphic designers go for something \"timeless\" in their designs, which might involve using (as farquart notes) something with a more neutral personality. Witness the continuing usage of Helvetica.\n\nOn the other hand, commercial success for a font publisher often involves convincing graphic designers that last year's typeface is now passe and needs to be replaced with the hottest, latest typeface. \"You don't want to use Fnorkle Script for Shazbat, Inc., because Blah Industries used it in their ad campaign last year.\" Nevermind that both the Shazbat and Blah logos are Helvetica.\n\n"

      "content": "I'm not how sure how commercial success should be brought into type design competitions (this one, or others). The TDC2, for example, does not require that submitted designs already have been released. I guess that some winners might never get released… that is at least a theoretical possibility.\n\nMoreover, since the contest is supposed to be blind, should judges really consider how successful a typeface may have already been? When you submit your PDFs to the contest, you don't include the designer's name, typeface name, or foundry name in the layout. So you couldn't well write \"Dear judge, this typeface has already sold xxx copies! Love, foundry y.\"\n\nNow, I guess that individual judges could look at a design, and try to guess how successful a design might be. But that is a slightly different question. Also, I suspect that \"success\" is defined differently at each foundry. I also think that each foundry has—to an extent—its own unique customer base. The customers that really like a certain kind of typeface may always drift to foundry A, while foundry B gets customers who like their popular typefaces a bit better.\n\nLike Stephen Coles, I've been involved with submitting designs from a foundry to this competition for five years now. I also can think of several designs I think were submitted to the contest this year that did not win, and of course I wish that they would have. But I am sure that this year's judges had good reasoning for their choices. I am honored to be on the list of those designers whose typefaces were selected for recognition. When we all read the published TDC annual that comes out later in the year, we can read what the judges had to think about this year's entries and this year's competition.\n\n"

In the past few years I have not been as involved as I was previously. This year was one of the few times I was not present at the judging.

On another day the results may be different. What that means for the commercial success of any given design is meaningless.\n\nI do think that most graphic designers play follow-the-leader when it comes to type selection. What fonts are \"The Handful of Influential Designers\" using, and there you go, everyone else follows suit.\n\nI would also say that this small universe of Typophile readers is an insignificant sample of the tens of thousands of designers working today. What goes for conventional wisdom here, hasn't even been thought of \"out there\", and from my Type Designer's point of view, \"out there' is more important than \"in here\".

      "content": "On the TDC Facebook page--before this arose here--James M. raised this question about TDC type winners vs commercial success. I asked whether maybe there was a bias for novelty. James posted a reply that he had often heard judges say \"I've seen that before\" as a reason not to choose a face.\n\nThe example Stephen gave above of FF Netto I think tends to support this. Soft sans generally are popular and familiar now. For example, my local Giant Food store has just redone its identity in Cronos. (It has gone from Benguiat to Meta to Cronos over the years.) One corporate logo after another seems to be coming out in a soft sans. FF Netto is a soft sans, and it also uses the 'stemless' look of Dax and others. So you could say, \"I've seen that before.\" But it seems to me that Netto is one of the best of this class, having softness and charm without being weak or cute. Should it have been rewarded for its excellence of execution, even if its look is not that original?\n\nI'm not saying that there should be any rule, but it might be that graphic designers are more concerned about the best in a class, rather than what is most original in look, whereas type designer judges tend to go a bit the other way.\n\nI know there is something like this difference in popular vs academic writing. In academic writing the main thing is originality. It's an explicit requirement for PhD dissertations, for example. But in popular writing having an enjoyable read is the main thing. And originality is only important in so far as it interests the reader--it doesn't need to be actually original, just new to the reader. For example, Malcolm Gladwell's books are reports on others' academic research. They would not be accepted by academic journals or get a PhD, but they wildly outsell almost everything academic.\n\n"

'commercial success': it happens that the graphic design business, on account of the kind of material that it produces and the way it produces it, accounts for a sizeable portion of the retail licensing font market. I don't think anyone really knows just how large a portion, or how large the retail licensing font market is relative to the overall market for fonts including OEM bundling, custom font commissions, etc., either in terms of number of units moved or in terms of income.\n\nAs a full-time type designer who had not had anything to do with retail font licensing for almost a decade, that market -- and the graphic design business in particular -- is practically irrelevant to me. So I'm pretty glad that the TDC competition does not seek to honour 'commercially successful' types; indeed, I'm not sure how such a criterion could be fairly judged it it were based on retail licensing figures, since the 'success' of OEM bundled fonts in terms of units moved is so much higher.\n\n"
