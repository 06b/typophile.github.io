  "content": "I wanted to experiment with making a typeface in a casual, unsophisticated way, as an educational experience. I'd like to try and get technical like you good folks at some point, and make some really crisp & clean fonts, but I know there's a big learning curve waiting for me. So this was just a quick & dirty project.\n\nI love the font used in the movie poster for Hanna, and saw that there wasn't a full typeface out there yet, so I thought I'd give it a shot. This is just a screengrab out of Illustrator, with some alternate characters below. I love the tension between the vertical lines in every character (so, a total of 3 distinct characters...) in the movie poster, so I was disappointed when I couldn't give every character those vertical lines. It just started to look like a B.C./caveman font... So I looked at some fonts with similar \"A\"s and decided to go with some rounded characters.\n\n![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203206im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hanna-font-WIP.gif)\n\n_Also please note, I have no idea where this falls in the grey area between rip-off and paying homage, but this project was just for fun, I have no desire to profit on anyone else's work, so if anyone's concerned about that, feel free to advise me, I don't even have plans to release this font on a free site unless someone really wants it for some reason._\n\nNot sure if it's good enough or if there's glaring changes I should make, besides cleaning up & tightening the respective sizes and margins and such...\n\nAny critiques or advice for me with this little project?\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [hanna-font-WIP.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317203206/http:/typophile.com/files/hanna-font-WIP.gif) | 47.27 KB |\n\n",
