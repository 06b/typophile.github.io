  "content": "Hi all-  \nI’m trying to help a friend who adopted a system  \nunfamiliar to them. They’re having two similar problems.\n\nAn OpenType font they purchased is not working. They  \nopen it in Font Book but they’re getting some kind of  \npostscript error when trying to print. As a test, I gave  \nthem an alternate font to see if that worked and FontBook  \nonly enables some but not all of the styles in that font.  \nBoth work fine on my computer.\n\nI have been through everything: dumping other versions  \nof it in other folders, repairing permissions, quitting apps  \nbefore opening fonts, restarting. To no avail.\n\nThe ONE difference between us is that I’m on 10.4.3 because  \nI heard there were font problems in 10.4.7. They are running  \n.8. I suggested they re-install the original version of Tiger  \nbut they’re afraid to do it. They don’t have an easy backup method.  \nNeither are experienced Mac people.\n\nI’ve spent hours tech supporting them and I need to get this  \nsolved so I can do my own work! : (\n\nAny ideas?  \nThanks!  \nJane\n\n",

If they are using the fonts in Illustrator or InDesign they could try putting the fonts in the “fonts” folder which is inside the applicaton folder for both apps.\n\nHow were the fonts installed into Font Book? Did you drag them into the user folder or did you open them and respond to the request to install them?\n\n"

      "content": "Hi All.\n\nYes, they are being used in InDesign. I made sure they put the fonts into the Fonts folder in the Library for the User. I also had them do a search for other versions of the font and get rid of all of them except the one.\n\nShe’s now getting fonts printing out strangely. Selecting Minion for example and it prints out really weird. I told her to try printing that font from another app first. Then also printing that same text in a new InDesign file, in case the current one is currupt….to at least see if it’s an app problem or a font problem or a doc problem.\n\nI could try suggesting that they put the fonts in the Apps folder. Still seems like there’s something wrong. I know FontBook isn’t that great.\n\nHas anyone heard about font issues with 10.4.7 or .8? A friend who upgraded to Tiger a while back did the .7 updater and had tons of font problems. She downgraded to .3 or something and all the font problems went away.\n\nBut I don’t know about .8.\n\nOne last thing…is it possible anyone is using a printer these days that isn’t postscript compatible? Seems she is getting errors that a font she has used isn’t available when she goes to print OR make a pdf, even though the printer font is there in the folder, seems to be there in FontBook and doesn’t get an error message when trying to choose the font in InDesign. This is nuts. I get an error message on selecting a font if the printer font isn’t available…as it should be.\n\nthanks,  \nJane\n\n"

I would not keep upgrading and down grading.\n\ngood luck\n\n"
