  "content": "Hi everyone,   \n   \nI'm trying to identify the font in the following images. The images are from a set of logs on our website and on our company cards. they were designed by a local graphics design company which went out of business several years ago and their graphic design staff have (as far as we can discern) left the country so we are unable to simply ask the designers what it is!   \n   \nI have been using any online ID tools i can find in my attempts to ID this font and most recently Mike Yanega of Bowfin Printworks' ID tool. He suggested i post here as he is sure you people will be able to cast your experienced eyes over it and say what it is. I'm hoping, nay preying, he's right.   \n   \nPush comes to shove i'm prepared to sit down with what i've got, download a font authoring tool and over the weekend emerse myself in redesigning the font type from scratch if necessary so any help with that would also be good.   \n   \nI've setup this account with my work address but if you have a 100% sure ID on the font you can email me at home over the weekend (it's friday afternoon here now) at [giant@paradise.net.nz](mailto:giant@paradise.net.nz)   \n   \nCheers   \n   \nDean Lawrie   \nWebmaster   \nwaymark solutions   \nWellington   \nNew Zealand   \n   \n<!--attachment: FontSample1-26428.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/bmp*101.5*waymark+font+sample+1*FontSample1%2ebmp -->\n\n<center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052208im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"image/bmp\">waymark font sample 1<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052208/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/FontSample1-26428.unk\" target=\"_blank\"><b>FontSample1.bmp</b></a> (101.5 k)</td></tr></table>\n</center>\n<!--/attachment-->   \n<!--attachment: FontSample2-26429.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/bmp*56.5*waymark+font+sample+2*FontSample2%2ebmp --><center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052208im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"image/bmp\">waymark font sample 2<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052208/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/FontSample2-26429.unk\" target=\"_blank\"><b>FontSample2.bmp</b></a> (56.5 k)</td></tr></table>\n</center>\n<!--/attachment-->   \n<!--attachment: FontSample3-26430.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/bmp*104.0*waymark+font+sample+3*FontSample3%2ebmp --><center>\n<br>\n<table border=\"1\"><tr><td>\n<img src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052208im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif\" align=\"left\" alt=\"image/bmp\">waymark font sample 3<br><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20050518052208/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/FontSample3-26430.unk\" target=\"_blank\"><b>FontSample3.bmp</b></a> (104.0 k)</td></tr></table>\n</center>\n<!--/attachment-->\n",
