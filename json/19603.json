I’ve just made a logo by breaking apart outlines of text and repositioning the frangments.\n\nIt would be great if there was a way to join these little shapes, as I now have the larger shapes completed, but the fragments still appear when I select them with the pointer. Also I’d like to keep this file as vector art.\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated. I’ve included a small example...This is the N in my logo, I’d like only to keep the outline of the letter.\n\nThank you,\n\nJesse\n\n [‹ Mac advice needed](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415205326/http:/www.typophile.com/node/19514 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type design DVD's/videos? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080415205326/http:/www.typophile.com/node/18420 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
