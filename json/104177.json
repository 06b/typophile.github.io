      "content": "Faces such as Broadway and Hobo were mined from popular styles developed by lettering artists.\n\nNo doubt one person came up with the prototype, but after the style had gained some traction in the media, having been swiped/reinterpreted by other letterers, than it would have attracted the attention of the new font committee at ATF.\n\nOne can imagine a meeting where a number of different examples of a particular style were compared, and a consensus reached as to the direction a type based on the style should take.\n\nA very similar process to how many custom types are commissioned today. Back then at ATF, the draftsperson was not credited, but now, if the work is supplied by an “independent” foundry, that person may well be credited as the designer.\n\nIf the expectation is that authorship in type design belongs to the draftsperson, then we can say that that person is the designer.\n\nBut if the situation is more like modern art in the present, conceptual era, where the idea is the main thing not the making, which may often be done by anonymous artisans, then the author may be considered the artist or art director, whether or not he/she does the drawing.\n\n"

Lots of ATF drawings have been available for a long time.\n\nSign paintings and hand lettering are not type. Being a sign painter or a letterer and having a style, does not make your style a typeface. Making fonts in metal type, required type design and Benton was about the best.\n\nYet, this funny question keeps coming up, how much of a \"type designer\", was this guy responsible for 1,000s of fonts when it took a year for each... and he did not live to 1,000.\n\nHmmm.\n\n"

      "content": "David, ATF was a factory with division of labour commensurate with its size.\n\nThat is why the design of type was split into different segments along the production process, and why it was possible for Morris Benton to art direct so many typeface designs, just as Cedric Gibbons art directed all those movies for MGM.\n\nIt’s a different notion of design than the hands-on craftsmanship practised by Fred Goudy (in the latter part of his career), and by those with Fontographer in the 1990s.\n\nIf one expects a proper type designer to be drawing the prototype of each letter, then Benton was riding on the coat-tails of others who did the hand work—and that is why he has not been raised in the pantheon along side Cooper, Goudy and Dwiggins. We like to see some artistry in type design, and associate it with individual authorship, not the impersonality of industrial production and the assembly line. However, if one approaches design as a more conceptual kind of work, then someone like Benton deserves more recognition.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124143224im_/http:/typophile.com/files/graphic-arts-and-crafts-year-book-1910-376-atf-factory-0600rgb-rot0p3cw-crop-factory-2852x2692-scale-512x483_3708.jpg)\n\n"

What do you think happened in this process?\n\nAnd, when you label Benton as the \"art director\" at a company just making fonts, you lose me. What does an art director do when fonts are the only product?\n\n"

      "content": "David, I’m on topic.  \nThe issue is, how much work—both conceptual and production—does someone have to do to be considered the designer of a typeface?\n\nBenton’s reputation has suffered because he was the “art director” at ATF.  \nCompare with Goudy, Cooper and Dwiggins, whose lettering work demonstrated their hand skills, and whose type designs were their own original concepts (mostly).\n\nBenton’s work was conceptually subtler and more adaptive than Goudy, Cooper and Dwiggins; there is no record of his handwork (AFAIK); and at ATF there was a production line where unaccredited draftspersons produced the glyph drawings, under his art direction.\n\nWe have letters between Dwiggins and Griffiths discussing the implementation of WAD’s drawings, but are there production notes from ATF concerning any of Benton’s faces? Where are his sketches?\n\nConsider also the relationship between Hermann Zapf and August Rosenberger. Had Zapf not been involved in the production of Palatino, but Rosenberger had adapted it from his lettering (as Slimbach adapted Caﬂisch), would Rosenberger have been considered the designer of the typeface?\n\nZapf and Frutiger both did very little work on the “Nova” versions of their faces executed by Kobayashi, they art directed, I would say. For instance, in the old style ﬁgures for Frutiger Nova, Frutiger had sketched the ﬁgures extremely roughly, with “4” standing on the baseline, no descender. Kobayashi corrected that.\n\nThe assignation of authorship is not as simple as “who does what”.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nOne can have it both ways.  \nIf one draws a revival, one is called the designer of the new typeface, even if one is careful to credit the original and not call oneself the designer.  \nAnd yet if one does sketches for an original design, and art directs someone else doing the drawing, one may still be considered the designer of the new typeface.  \nFollow the money.\n\nStanley Morison admitted to having “excogitated” Times New Roman, but was for many years credited as the designer. Now wiki says he commissioned it, and Victor Lardent drew it. So nobody designed it!\n\n\\*\\*\n\nOver the years, the action in the arts has shifted from making, through direction, to curation.  \nJanet Cardiff’s _Forty Part Motet_ is a piece of installation art, in which she neither composed nor performed the music, or made the loudspeakers. It was her idea.  \nIf that is how things are now in the art world, I would say this article has it wrong, and that Morris Benton will be getting more recognition in the font world, as a type designer, on those terms.\n\n"

One important part of that was that they were of necessity self-promoters, which he, as a corporate man not a freelancer in trade, didn’t have to be.\n\nIf he had an antipathy, for whatever reason, towards presenting himself as a professionally creative individual, well, he has certainly been able to fool most of the people most of the time, including Rick von Holdt.\n\n"
