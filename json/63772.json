What is your preferred version, and why?\n\nI was thinking of going with a [Futura Value Pack from Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131114416/http:/www.linotype.com/247688/futura1-valuepack.html) (about $150 6 fonts in 3 weights), but then I saw the [Cambridge CD set from Bitstream](http://web.archive.org/web/20100131114416/http:/www.myfonts.com/products/bitstream/cambridge)  \nand since it has a total of 200 fonts for only $199, I thought it was a great deal.\n\nI am trying to build my font library at home for freelance projects, and Futura is a face I like to use frequently at work. I currently don't have a huge need for any special character sets, so I am leaning toward the Bitstream set since it includes many other fonts my library lacks. I wasn't sure if the price difference was simply because of the more limited character set, or if there is a quality difference between the foundries.\n\nThanks! I value your opinions, and any guidance you can give.\n\n",
