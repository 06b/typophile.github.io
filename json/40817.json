It was the second typeface designed in Denmark. First was Paul Søgren's Jante (1992).Until 1999 Liber© was reserved for the exclusive use of the Royal School of Library and Information Science - and was my personal font, which it remains. Since 1993 a number of books and booklets published by the school were set in Liber©. In 1999 I decided to give it wider application, and a few commercially produced books were set in Liber©. After 15 years the font can be now acquired for general use. Applications should be adresssed to me at [psl@psl.dk](mailto:psl@psl.dk).\n\nThe font was designed as a bookface for print only, and for use in sizes between 5 and 13 pt. The enclosed GIF image displays the characters in rather crude shapes.\n\nThe attached PDF-file is a poster produced for the recent ATyPi conference in Copenhagen. It shows the characters as they really look.\n\nComments are wellcome !\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Liber-poster.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20110321010325/http:/typophile.com/files/Liber-poster_0.pdf) | 47.07 KB |\n\n",
