Also, setting a time limit between posts really helps to slow down bots. Another technique I'd like to try is to run a duplicate site where content is automatically up loaded to a replica site off-line. So when bots strike simply upload a copy of the replica site.\n\nBlocking whole blocks of IPs gets out of hand, and dynamic IPs come with the territory, so vigilance is our most effective weapon.\n\nn.\n\n"

And reporting these 15 threads each and every day is no solution.\n\nMy suggestion would be to migrate that old system to a “real” full-fledged discussion board software, which comes with tons of options to fight spam.  \nOr they can be as simple as: New users would be added to a \"validating group\" until they have a certain amount of approved post. Before that, their posts will have to be manually approved by a moderator. Hardly any spam would come thru this way …\n\n"

Anything marked as spam gets sent to a moderation queue; if it's confirmed as spam it gets added to the database.

Please join me in wishing them a warm welcome to this new duty.\n\nWe're also looking at enlisting a few new moderators from around the world to help try and keep eyes on the boards 24/7 as we've had in the past. In the meantime, new account creations are passing through a vetting process, and that's already been instrumental in helping us see which accounts are humans and which are clearly bots. I'm also bringing in some local Drupal experts into my office during the next two weeks to get a sense on cost & effort to better block spam and fix bugs moving forward... hopefully allowing our esteemed moderators to focus on more fruitful efforts, like making Typophile a better place to hang out.\n\nMessage me if you've got inputs you'd like me to consider. Thanks-\n\n//jared\n\n"
