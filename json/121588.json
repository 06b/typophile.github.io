  "content": "Hello! My name is Emy Dalsted and I am a senior at The Art Institute of Phoenix. I am pursuing a degree in graphic design with a minor in typography. I have recently just completed the design of my second typeface. And would like to know what you think abut it, What I can improve on and what you like about it.\n\nModern Glyph  \nDesigned By: Emy Dalsted\n\nThe classification of this font is a modern san serif that is based on a modular square grid with circular rules. There is nothing complicated to this font it is created to be simple and legible at any size.\n\nThe primary purpose of this font is to be used as body copy, although it can be scaled to any size and still look great. This font will be good for solving issues where there is hard to read body copy or redundant font choices. Put Modern Glyph in place of any font choice and it will give your project a sharp, clean and sophisticated look.\n\nA fun attribute of this font is that there are optional letter forms with knockouts and fun glyphs that give the font some room to play with, when it is used as a headline type. This will spice a piece up, if that’s exactly what you’re looking for.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414115932im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophile_modern_6199.jpg)\n\n",

Could be intentional, though, for all I know.\n\n"
