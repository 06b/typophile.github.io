  "content": "I am a graduating senior at Pratt in Brooklyn and am working on our yearbook (The Prattonia), in which I am using Caslon italic oldstyle numerals quite a bit. I’m not crazy about the ’1’ character (looks too much like an ’I’), so I modified it slightly.\n\nThe Issue is that now I want to apply it to every instance within a 112 page book, in multiple sizes, but that requires me to resize the new vectorized ’1’, paste it into each instance, kern it, and make sure it sits on the baseline like the original did. Anyone know of a way I can do this, whether it’s a piece of software (preferably free or something i already own) that can add the new character to the typeface, or a trick in indesign?\n\n [‹ times vs plantin](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007164344/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43369 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [¿Fun? with type pairing ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007164344/http:/www.typophile.com/node/43453 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
