  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nNew to the site, found you guys through searching for “font identification”. I tried many of the online identification systems but to no avail.\n\nWe are looking to add more buttons to our site but can’t find this font to match. The guy who developed the buttons for us is long gone, can’t contact him.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated! I will post a variety of the buttons so you can see as many characters as possible.\n\nThanks again for any help you might have.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [modify.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090615062016/http:/typophile.com/files/modify.gif) | 1.89 KB |\n| [enter.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20090615062016/http:/typophile.com/files/enter.gif) | 2.49 KB |\n\n",
