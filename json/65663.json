  "content": "The latest issue of Wired used this interesting gothic inline for their article on \"Fail.\" I've seen similar faces other places, including work for Whataburger. I know this might be just some fancy stroke work, or overlaying a thinner face on top of a heavier one, but I'm still holding out for it just being one face. I've included some samples from the magazine.\n\nThanks!\n\n[http://drp.ly/6ImeX](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202081225/http:/drp.ly/6ImeX \"http://drp.ly/6ImeX\")  \n [http://drp.ly/6In5m](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202081225/http:/drp.ly/6In5m \"http://drp.ly/6In5m\")\n\n",
