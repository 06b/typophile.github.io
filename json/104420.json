  "content": "Hi,\n\nI found these samples online and I wonder if “Berthold” and “Lessing” exist as digital fonts under different names … I have some similar fonts (Super Grotesk, Bau, Venus etc.) but couldn't find anything that would match exactly. Unfortunately the type samples are also pretty small.\n\nThanks!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130820005706im_/http:/typophile.com/files/berthold-lessing_5113.jpg)\n\n",
