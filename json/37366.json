I guess this one is quite unique.\n\nI am not sure if charachters like 'ç' or 'ã' exist in Chalet, just that.  \nI previewed some text on House Industries website, and those glyphs don't render correctly.\n\n"

      "content": "Mycorp-\n\nThe Chalet family (Chalet, Comprimé, Chalet Book) does include both the ’ç’ and the ’ã’, along with a whole host of CE characters (and Cyrillic for Chalet 1960 and 1980) for most European languages. Our lettersetter sometimes has trouble displaying some CE characters (an issue that is being resolved shortly), sorry for the confusion.
