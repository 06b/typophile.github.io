      "content": "Just to be clear here. The original design is not a font but a custom logo work. 'Journey PS3' by Hauke Petersen is a fan work, an attempt to extend a logotype into a keyable font which is clearly stated on by the author himself on DaFont page Dick refers to.\n\n> This font is based on the title card of the Video Game \"Journey\" by thatgamecompany for PlayStation 3. The 7 letters within the game's name use and original design and are not part of complete font set. Since it looks so nice, I decided to create a full-fledged font by creating the remaining characters based on the official design.\n"
