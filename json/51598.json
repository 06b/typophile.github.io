  "content": "I believe this vintage tabloid nameplate is hand-lettered, but I'm looking for a font that is similar to facilitate a replication. These very small jpgs are all the reference I can find: there is apparently no known copy of the actual newspaper extant. Does anyone have a recommendation for something that looks much the same?\n\nAny input would be much appreciated.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [NYEgraphictype.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014015459/http:/typophile.com/files/NYEgraphictype.jpg) | 65.06 KB |\n\n",
