It seems like I have seen this somewhere else, but I can’t for the life of me remember where. Thanks for any help you can give me and sorry for the small size. I don’t need this exact font, just something similar.\n\nSharon\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828002911im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/numbers_5963.jpg)\n\n [‹ (x) \"Roctakon\" stencil face - Cargo {Yves}](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828002911/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34094 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Ben Bridge logo Script ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080828002911/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35695 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
