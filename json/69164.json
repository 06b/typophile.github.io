      "content": "Khaled,\n\nAs a user of type, I'm not entirely unsympathetic your position. The problem has more to do with what all this new technology has brought.\n\nSuppose, for example, you had bought Linotype mats for a linecaster. You'd need 8 point, 9-point, and at least one of 10, 11, or 12-point. Plus some display sizes. Roman and italic (though most were duplexed). That's for \"one font,\" say Janson. The purchase price was about $2,000 in the early 1960s -- about the price of a new car.\n\nOK, you own them. But you own a shop with more than one casting machine. If you want run the magazines on more than one machine at a time, you'd have to buy another set of mats -- another new car.\n\nToday, fonts are software, not physical objects. So, what is sold is a license, not a physical object. Copying is easy; policing copying is difficult. And the price doesn't let the font designer buy a car with each purchase -- a good lunch is more like it.\n\nThe model of \"owning fonts\" is difficult with software, esp. to a collection of people use to viewing something as a physical object. But as has so often been pointed out to me, I'm old. For the younger crowd, the notion of type as a physical object is passing strange. It will take a while for all this to settle down.\n\nToday, I'm going to skip purchasing a font, so off to lunch.\n\n"

If they came from the original source, they wouln't have the problems described in the first post. These are typical problems of fonts that are extracted from PDFs or other documents.  \nAlso: If you copy digital goods, you don't LEND them. Lending means you give away something, you don't have then anymore. If you want to do that with fonts, no problem! You can transfer a license from one user to another. Just ask the font foundry.\n\n"

It has far greater ethical ramifications than any debate about the luxury business of contemporary type design (oldnick already confessed it is not a compulsory purchase).
