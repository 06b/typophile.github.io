  "content": "Hello everybody,\n\nI´m a design student from Augsburg in Germany. At school i´m in a typographic project. The students may analise a typeface (their structure, composition and so on). I decided to deal with Chaparral. But i couldn´t find much about that typeface. I also need some information about Carol Twombly who created Chaparral. Maybe one of you can help me. Any advice would further.\n\nThank you for any information  \nRegina\n\n",
