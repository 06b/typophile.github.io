Love it!\n\nHowever, since this is a digital replication of the original 'Stark Debonair' designed for press by VGC (Visual Graphics Corporation), who no longer exist as of the 80's, we are unsure as to whether we can legally use this font for a commercial magazine or branding project.\n\nThus two questions remain!\n\n1) Does anyone know of the current rights holders for the VGC's type library?  \n2) Has anyone come across this 'digital replication' grey-area before?\n\nThanks in Advance,\n\nF//W\n\n"
