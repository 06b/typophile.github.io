Copies of the monograph are available from [Peter Bain](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212218/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Peter%20Bain) and [Paul Shaw](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212218/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Paul%20Shaw).\n\nThe exhibition was held in 1998 at the Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography at [Cooper Union](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414212218/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Cooper%20Union).\n\n",
