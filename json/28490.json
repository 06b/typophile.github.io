The Novel Fonts seem to have virtually disappeared, but I think the Opti fonts can still be purchased.

For all I know it may still be included in font collections they offer. I know there are people who have these fonts, but the Castcraft folks have been generally hard to reach, and prices seem quite steep for unoriginal work.\n\nThe thread you linked mentions some fair alternatives too.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

      "content": "For what it's worth, Spoleto and Opti Sport-Script are identical in shape but they are not identical digitizations. I have both fonts and just examined them in Fontographer. The Opti font has a 1991-2 copyright from Castcraft, and Spoleto has a 1994 NovelFonts copyright. I know this information is easily changed, so proves nothing. Just as an example I copied the outline of the W from one and overlayed it on the other font's W. The outline points were different in number, and the outlines were slightly off from each other, but so marginally that I would never have been able to tell without such a detailed look.\n\nIt is easy to presume that these could be two independent digitizations taken from the same source (perhaps a film type), however, it's possible that Spoleto was copied and slightly modified from Sport-Script, if you believe the Castcraft copyright date. It's probably all academic, since neither is easily obtained any more.\n\nIt comes to how much you need to use this exact typeface. If you say the letters on the package look better, then someone apparently realized the exisiting fonts are based on a flawed hand-drawn film type (the 's' looks too light for the other letters, for example) and modified it to fix some of the imperfections.\n\nHaving said all that, I just saw a new font called [Machiarge](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218042707/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/machiarge/) from a small Japanese foundry called Flat-it. It seems quite similar in feeling, but much more nicely drawn.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
