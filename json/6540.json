I don't know what to do from here. I see there are necessary changes to be made, the 's,' for example, could use some tweaking.   \n   \nI though I'd keep it small, a six bit x-height, because that's a great strength of pixel fonts, and a challenge I thought I'd like. Is it working? Is it worth it's weight in kilobites?   \n   \n ![fractured six example](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317115350im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48267.jpg)\n\n",

(The middle of the word \"hopelessly\" emphasizes the disparity.)   \n   \nJust looking at the set, it looks like the font wants to be a bit top-heavy - you didn't rethink the o, and   \nmost of the other letters seem to be ambivalent. The word \"six\" makes it look like your s is upside-   \ndown, too. I'd keep the old c for a bit, switch to the middle e, and try to redesign the s to match them   \nas much as possible. Then let's see another sample. It's always hard to judge a letter in isolation.   \n   \nAs for your second font, maybe a second thread, just so things don't get confused?\n\n"
