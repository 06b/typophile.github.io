The closest I was able to find to the tone and general feel of your first image is Signalist by Mike Melvas:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/signalist/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803005736/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/signalist/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/signalist/\")  \nThere are also two fairly close fonts from Filmotype:  \nFilmotype Lakeside:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lakeside/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803005736/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lakeside/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lakeside/\")  \nand  \nFilmotype Lasalle:  \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lasalle/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803005736/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lasalle/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lasalle/\")  \nLasalle is also available from Scangraphic and Elsner+Flake.  \nBTW the lettering artists for Unfaithfully Yours were busy. They also produced a third version of the movie title:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803005736im_/http:/typophile.com/files/UnfaithfullyYours1948_4_4669.jpg)\n  \nDon \n"
