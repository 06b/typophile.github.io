I've never tried them on an inkjet, but the package says they're inkjet compatible. These are 1\" x 2-5/8\" address labels, but they probably come in other sizes too.\n\n"

      "content": "I've had good luck doing color laser printing on clear stickers at home. Just be SURE you only use stickers designed for laser printing in a laser, and stickers designed for inkjet printing in an inkjet.\n\nUsing the wrong stickers in a laser printer could result in the stickers melting inside your printer, potentially destroying the printer or causing a costly repair bill. Using the wrong stickers in an inkjet probably won't hurt anything, but the ink might wipe off or smear, leaving you with some expensive but useless stickers.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"
