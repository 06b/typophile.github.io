The authors are: Artur Frankowski (Warsaw)—a young generation typographer working with digital tools, Polish representative on ATypI Forum, and Henryk Sakwerda (Katowice)—classic typographer, working with calligraphy, author of many types awarded before the digital era.\n\nThe organisers are very proud of the result and hope that the project will continue. We would like to encourage Polish authorities to pay attention to typography as a part of the local culture, worth to be developed and supported. Katowice is a town in Silesia—south, industrial region of multicultural influences from Czech, Germany, and Poland. Its athmosphere is recognisable in the characters' shape, colour and light.\n\nThe conference and the opening of the exhibition of Silesiana 2006 typeface will take place on November the 15th, 2006. The main subject of the conference is the regional influence on types. The guests of honour are: Gerry Leonidas, Verena Gerlach, Filip Blazek, Adam Twardoch, Artur Frankowski, Henryk Sakwerda.\n\nStudents from Polish art and design schools, designers and teachers of design are invited for a discussion.\n\nParticipation in the conference is free for Polish and international guests. Those interested in a hotel reservation are kindly requested to contact the organisers at: [info@zamekcieszyn.pl](mailto:info@zamekcieszyn.pl)\n\nTopics of presentations\n\nArtur Frankowski  \nRegional influences in Polish typography.\n\nGerry Leonidas  \nEuropean Type Design.\n\nFilip Blazek  \nOverview of History of Czech Typefaces from 1900 to 2006.\n\nVerena Gerlach  \nKarbid And Citystreettypes.\n\nWe hope it will be a very fruitful and interesting meeting focused on how the coexistence of Polish, Czech and German culture on the Silesia territory is reflected in the shapes of types.\n\n.\n\nRead more at: [http://www.zamekcieszyn.pl](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123212219/http:/www.zamekcieszyn.pl/ \"http://www.zamekcieszyn.pl\")\n\nMy best regards,\n\nEwa Satalecka\n\n.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [pismo\\_slaskie.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150123212219/http:/typophile.com/files/pismo_slaskie.pdf) | 398.62 KB |\n\n",
