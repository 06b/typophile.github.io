  "content": "Hi\n\nI’ve been looking for this font for ages and I then came across it in a comic book! Sorry that i’ve included the whole page but couldn’t get just the panel I wanted. The particular font i’m looking for is the one in the third panel: “Carol Ferris”. It’s very retro looking and I was hoping someone might know what this font is called.\n\nAlso, does anyone know of any other 50’s or 60’s font’s or images?\n\nMany thanks in advance\n\nCliff\n\n",
