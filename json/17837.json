      "content": "Some may disagree, I think Bickham Script Pro from Adobe is a very versatile typeface, with a slew of alternates, glyphs and ornaments. Sloop from the Font Bureau is another fav, although so many designers use it incorrectly, not utilizing all three faces for Caps, ascenders and descenders. The worst faux pax is spacing or kerning out script faces.\n\nAs for an accent font stick with a traditional serif, Incognito from Fountain Type is good example, something with oldstyle figures.\n\nMy last comment, nothing shows off a well-designed invitation better than Letterpressâ€¦\n\nCongratulations!\n\n"
