  "content": "Recently I was contacted by a customer who has had little success with some Postscript Windows fonts I've generated from FOG. I've generated them several times and she installs them several times with the same unfortunate results - Being that they won't install at all in ATM.   \n   \nAfter several queries, several folks have told me it's in the way the Mac version of FOG generates this format and that I should consider generating them from FontLab.   \n   \nApparently there is some sort of 'Adobe' glitch in FOG. Any suggestions?   \n   \nStuart :D\n\n",
