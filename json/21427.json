The X in the font shown at Fontshop is backwards (now how does THAT happen?)!\n\nStephen - I can’t find the selling foundry anywhere on the page Lex that links to (we know it ain’t VGC). Just a heads up. In fact, I see now that only when you do a Search on a name and get the choices are the selling foundries shown. Beyond that they are AWOL.\n\nEdit: The Linotype and Bitstream versions have the correct X.\n\n"
