Copy the folder and give it a meaningful name  \n7. Open the vfb contained in the copied folder  \n8. Do the next step\n\nThen you have not only a protocol in the end, but backup files in the most cases. And even if you have 1000 folders in the end, disc space is not expensive.\n\nUnfortunately I actually cannot help. But maybe the FontLab people can help, if you send your vfb to them.\n\n"
