It's called \"Enter\" to discern it from \"Return\", as there were days those keys were clearly marked that way.\n\nBy the way, if you don't like that key -- perhaps you are working on a laptop? --, you can always select your own, under Edit -\\> Keyboard Shortcuts -\\> Endless browsing throught the drop lists until you find \"Column break\". If you cannot locate it, you can click \"Show Set\". This will create a simple text edit file with all possible commands and its associated keystrokes, and there you can use search to find the category \"Column Break\" falls under.\n\n"
