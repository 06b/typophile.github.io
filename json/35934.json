But we can't afford to buy this font. Are there any other more common fonts or cheaper alternatives that will give us the same look?\n\nThanks!\n\nsorry if this is the wrong place, I wasn't sure where to post :)\n\n",

Are you using PC or Mac?\n\nA very nice freeware serif is Tallys:\n\n[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/tallys.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021158/http:/www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/tallys.html \"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/tallys.html\")\n\nAlso look into a font called Gentium:\n\n[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site\\_id=nrsi&item\\_id=Gentium...](http://web.archive.org/web/20141110021158/http:/scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_design \"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site\\_id=nrsi&item\\_id=Gentium\\_design\")\n\nOtherwise, I can't believe you have a business and don't have some kind of choices that came bundled with the programs you own. (always check the CDs)\n\nIf you do a lot of non-profit work, consider the Softmaker XXL cd. It has a ton of fairly decent fonts for a relatively small sum.\n\n"
