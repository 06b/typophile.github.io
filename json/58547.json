And four weights! I never knew there was more than one! I always loved the caps in this design. There is nothing like them anywhere else.\n\nBe sure to click on the \"Concept\" link and dig the early version of the uppercase K. It's so good to see this typeface finally available. It also mentions that Noordzij's Tret is in production at TEFF and to be released in the future.\n\n",
