I would like to deal with this issue without reformatting the entire document.\n\nThanks for any suggestions.\n\n",

Your description is a bit unclear, but I think it would suffice to select the indenting paragraphs and set their left/right/first line/last line values to zero. Do this for each occurrence.\n\nNormally I'd recommend changing this in the paragraph style for your lists, but judging by your 'clear overrides' problem, these haven't been used. If you (or original file creator) had used styles, you'd only had to change it once.\n\n"
