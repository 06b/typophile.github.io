  "content": "Hi all Typophiles,\n\nHaving just released my first three commercial fonts at [Veer](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015171000/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Veer) as part fo their [Umbrella](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015171000/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Umbrella) Type Library. I thought I celebrate it (other than drinking beer) by giving a little teaser here. The fonts are Navelfluff, Trentor and Trentor Script.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015171000im_/http:/typophile.com/files/veer_releases_4378.jpg)\n\nMore of the fonts can be seen at my studio’s webpage, [Autodidakt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015171000/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Autodidakt) or at Veer.\n\n[http://www.autodidakt.se](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015171000/http:/www.autodidakt.se/ \"http://www.autodidakt.se\")\n\nCurrently I’m working on several other projects, which hopefully can be spotten in the near future aswell.\n\nThanks all you guys who helped me with all my stupid questions I had along the way, producing these fonts :)\n\nCheers\n\nGöran Söderström\n\n",
