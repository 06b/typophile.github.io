  "content": "Hi,   \n   \nHow do the seperate accent signs in the slots 246-255 function (circumflex, tilde, macron, etc.)?   \nI use them as a ghost (Copy Reference) and past them in the appropriate character. But is there also an other way to use them? Perhaps in a certain keyboard combination? I could until now never find out how they work.   \nI never use them seperately, but I see they have a certain spacing that looks like they \\*could\\* be used normally.   \n   \nWhere do you use them?   \n   \nThanx,   \nRen�\n\n",

You can access them from the Mac keyboard using with the following keys combinations (U.S. English keyboard):   \n   \ntilde = shift-option-n   \nmacron = shift-option-comma   \nbreve = shift-option-period   \ndotaccent = option-h   \nring = option-k   \ncedilla = shift-option-z   \nhungarianumlaut = shift-option-g   \nogonek = shift-option-x   \ncaron = shift-option-t   \n   \nOther accents can be accessed using the \"dead\" keys that are normally used to type standard accented characters. But, instead of typing the dead key followed by a letter, you type the dead key twice.   \n   \nBy using negative kerning or other tricks, you can make custom accented characters in standard graphics or page layout programs.\n\n"
