  "content": "Hello-\n\nThis evening I had a look at some old logos I've made, and came across a bird I've made to a friend of mine. It's fleur de lis turned into a bird; a cardinal. I wanted to use that as a fleuron, so I copied it to FontLab, and started buggering about. Soon it started to have very Caslon-like look, so I went with that.\n\nHere is what I have this far:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417183901im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cardinale_5512.png)\n\nAnd here's a pdf.\n\nLower case 'g is a bit dark, but otherwise it's not too bad in my opinion.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Cardinale1.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417183901/http:/typophile.com/files/Cardinale1.pdf) | 29.95 KB |\n\n",

I like that. wild!\n\nhowever if you ask me (but you won't) then I think the \" **r**\" is a little to fat/bold up to the right.\n\nhow about making it a little slimmer like the top left of the \" **a**\"\n\n"

      "content": "Hi, Stefan-\n\nItalics are under way. You can see them in this same Serif critique, under 'Cardinale'.\n\nAnd yes, that Fourier: I was commissioned to make a bold version of the typeface, and I made that. While doing that I noticed the state of MT Fournier; it was horrendous! Points were all over the place, and beziers pointing everywhere. I started thinking about making a revival of Fournier then.\n\nBut then I went to my library, and found a facsimile of _Fournier's Modéles des Characteres de l'Imprimerie_. It's a copy number 320 of 600 from the Printing Library of the Saint Bride Institute from 1965 with an introduction by James Mosley.\n\nThere is no bold variant there. It is a single font with sizes from larger than Gros Canon to Nonparelle with italics and small capitals and some special cuts and a huge amount of ornaments and borders.\n\nAdobe seems to be the only seller of Monotype original. This should be an interesting project with pretty steep learning curve.\n\nThis will take a while, though :·)\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Tomi,\n\nsure is, that Fournier is one of the most beautiful typefaces all over the history of printing. Not casualy early Bodoni works were (successfully) inspired by it.  \nItalic is particularly charming and unbeaten in my eyes.  \nAnd Monotype versions in the past have been weak, indeed.  \nI also found beautiful specimen of Fournier type in the university library at Hamburg, Germany,  \nthough I believe that were reprinted ones.  \nGo on with Fournier!  \nYou should also look for Fournier interpretations on this site. I belive Raph Levian did one, but I am not quite sure about. But if he did it will sure be worth looking for it.\n\nSalute  \nStefan\n\n"

      "content": "Whoah! Sorry I missed this one! Great stuff, Tomi :)  \nOnly a few little comments for the mo. Hopefully I'll call back later ithis week.  \nD looks a bit light on the right, and perhaps a bit too oval. I think O, o and Q could be somewhat darker on the heavies.  \nR is quite skinny, especially in the middle.  \nb looks a bit unresolved on its bottom spur. I'm afraid it'll look blobby in small settings.  \nI'd make the foot serifs on p and q longer I think. And probably r as well. r could be wider?  \nJoin of u looks high.  \ny looks a bit sloped.  \nThink the corners on z should be slightly rounded.  \nThe uppercase looks a bit light compared to the lowercase and I suspect the serifs would look nice a few units thicker as well as perhaps the hairlines.  \nI like the fleuron.  \nI know you're a fan of flipped quote marks but do you think they fit this font?\n\nIs this quite a display sort of font?\n\n"
