  "content": "Good day.\n\nI need assistance in developing a concise statement of why exactly typefaces cost as much as they do. I personally understand and appreciate the value of type, but I don't have enough technical knowledge of the processes involved to really help someone else appreciate it.\n\nImmediate application of this would be presenting it to my boss with a proposal to purchase a font. He doesn't see why, when fonts are everywhere, why one should have to pay $15+ for one.\n\nI wanted input from people who had been in this specific industry for an extended period of time who would be able to express, much more effectively than I could, reasoning supporting type value and how it translates to cost.\n\nAny assistance would be most helpful. Thanks!\n\n",

This particular circumstance applies to the occupation to which I am employed (prepressman).\n\nI suppose more of an answer to my question would be, \"Where would I find a collection of information explaining some of the processes and consideration when developing a commercial typeface?\" I understand that I would likely be able to find that here, but I was wondering if there was a location in specific (a thread here, for instance) that someone had explained it in-depth.\n\n"

      "content": "Font prices, like everything else, are determined by market forces.\n\nWhen Adobe began selling digital fonts in the late eighties, a two-font package (the smallest package they offered) was $145. This is $72.50 per font, or about $113 per font in 2005 dollars. Since then, font prices have dropped considerably. Today, most single fonts are sold for $20-$40 each. Purchased in multi-font packages, the price per font is even lower.\n\nIncidentally, although it does take a lot of work to create a font, that's not what determines the price. A movie costs millions of dollars to make, but you only pay $8 to see it. The reason is that millions of other people will pay to see it, too. The font market is much smaller in comparison, probably in the tens of thousands of potential customers. Everyone else just uses fonts they get for free or bundled with software or whatever happens to be installed on their computers. Everyone who has a computer uses fonts, but only a small percentage actually buy fonts. These are mainly professionals, who understand the value a unique font can add to their work and consider the cost of a font just part of doing business, like using FedEx or buying equipment. For these people, font prices are not high at all.\n\nFinally, the reason you see fonts everywhere is because, by nature, they are designed to be reproduced. There is no limit to how often a single font installed on a single computer may be seen on books, magazines, tv, movies, packages, websites, video games, etc. It just depends on the kind of work being produced on that computer. You just never know.\n\n"

It affects all forms of intellectual property that has been made readily accessible on the Internet; music, literature, motion pictures, photography, illustrations, typefaces, and the list goes on.\n\nI will make no attempt at giving an explanation to give to your boss or clients. But to put it simply AND mildly -- _readily accessible DOES NOT EQUAL available for free_!\n\nThe price of a font and the value of a typeface are two different things. What unfortunately has happened within the type industry itself, is that well-known reputable font development companies joined up with hardware/software development companies twenty years ago and began _bundling_ libraries of type with PCs, Macs, printers, software packages, etc., resulting in the proliferation of the \"fonts for free\" notion and devaluation of font software.\n\nThis all happened BEFORE type development programs became available to run on simple PC/Mac platforms... so the excuse that cheap fonts and free and pirated fonts were the original cause of the problem -- it wasn't so.\n\nThe \"bigger\" foundries initiated the proliferation of \"free fonts\" and the smaller type developers of the past ten years are almost crippled by it. The current habit of novice and hobbiest type designers releasing their designs at little to no cost keeps exacerbating the problem.\n\nI have no solution to what is already out there, but just because one particular typeface may cost $15 doesn't determine the value of ALL typefaces. Just like a pair of classic men's Gucci loafers will cost anywhere from 20 to 50 times more than loafers from Payless.\n\n"

To you, to your employer, to the client.\n\nHaving a library of non-standard fonts, and knowing how to use them, is a value that a designer/design firm brings to any client relationship. Note that Mr Cheese advertises his font library on his web site; it is a benefit of doing business with him.\n\nFonts that come bundled with applications or operating systems don't add value, because they are over-exposed.\n\nSecondly, working with fonts acquired for a specific design project helps create design synergy, which is more productive than wringing your brain for the big idea that will add life to otherwise hackneyed-looking typography. Fonts have formal qualities which can be leveraged to drive design concepts.\n\n\"Free\" fonts don't add value because they lack typographic sophistication: it's difficult to do good work with poor tools.\n\n"

When he (or she) travels on business, does he/she fly coach, or does he/she fly first class, or even business class? Is there a difference in price? Why do first class and business class cost as much as they do?\n\nIf the average businessperson were capable of writing clear, concise and forceful prose without resorting to the standard formula of **bullsh\\*t-bullsh\\*t-buzzword-bullsh\\*t--buzzword** , then the choice of the typeface used in a proposal or presentation wouldn't be such a big deal: the force of the ideas presented, not the bling used to present them, would carry the day. Unfortunately, the VAST majority of business proposals and presentations which I have seen follow the standard formula to the letter: all style and no substance. As a result, the average businessperson needs all the window dressing that he or she can get (regardless of price) to disguise his/her lack of originality, insight and content. I hope that this answer meets or exceeds your expectations.\n\n"

Your boss should understand the relationship between pricing and availability/functionality. Many fonts are free, or come with OS, Applications, or other acts of bundling, and through their wide availability, they are not likely to produce distinctive enough communications for some users. So, less widely distributed fonts may cost $1,000 or more when installed on a network in order serve the particular taste and function of a readership, and none other, and thus be disctinct from the free font crowd.\n\nIf he don't yet get it, tell him he can get free clothes at any number of locations in every city in America.

Being \"different\" is worth something, but misusing distinctive type designs will make most readers turn away from the page as much as any over-used typeface.\n- Based on the _wannabee factor_, ITC was able to set the type buying/specifying market on fire with eye applealing use of type in _U&lc_. But the truth is you can dress your date like Angelina Jolie or Brad Pitt (take your pick) and the common person will still not turn any heads when walking into a restaurant. There is something more to unique typography than just picking typefaces.\n- The \"workhorse\" typefaces are oftened malaligned based on the fact that they have so much utility and stand up under rigorous missuse no matter how many thousand users set jobs with them. But a designer/typographer with _unique skills and vision_ can make Gill Sans look like a $2000 suit.\n\nI hate to keep repeating myself, but tired old reasons to buy type isn't going to improve marketability any more than Wonder Bread's slogan _Builds bodies twelve ways_ does for white bread these days.\n\n"

I know how long writing can take and it's a pretty neat thing that you can do it at least partly in professional capacity.\n\nNorbert: _\"...but tired old reasons to buy type isn’t going to improve marketability any more than Wonder Bread’s slogan Builds bodies twelve ways does for white bread these days.\"_ Wonder Bread is really good with peanut butter banana and bacon grilled like a cheese sandwich. But that notwithstanding, tired old reasons to buy type isn't going to improve marketability is a useful standpoint.\n\nFrom a business case point-of-view type is cheaper than logos and effective logos are usually part of an ID system and using unique/appropriate type in a consistent fashion is way cheaper than an ID system. So really compared to other marketing tools, type is relatively cheap.\n\nType is ubiquitous. So keeping the business case point of view, one can argue that type is insanely economical because you can, and do, use it with relative impunity and people see way more of it than almost all of your other communications and they see it more often. So seen in this light, type is probably one of the most economical marketing expenses ever.\n\nHere's a new one: good type is a great design device, and so if you are doing print communications of any kind, type is more economical and flexible than photography and custom artwork. Present it as a design challenge to the designer in a creative brief. No photos. Just type. Type also reproduces very well in a single colour. Lower copying costs in short run office printing and lower costs in large run press publications.\n\nYou can also do object lessons: Take a business letter and remove all the spaces and cpas and punctuation and set it in Courier. Then add spaces, then punctuation, then other adjustments until you have a formatted document. The change the courier to something else like Dolly and something like Frutiger and add some nice leading and spacing. Put them all in a row and say \"That's what type can do.\"\n\nIs this the kind of thing you're talking about?\n\nJon\n\n"
