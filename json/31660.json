  "content": "2 questions.\n\n1. i am in the process of typesetting a bronze plaque and am looking for recommendations on types to use, any suggestions?\n\n2. I was wondering if you could guide me in the right direction on how to find a rough estimate to use when working with Justification.  \nI believe that I understand this much so far:  \n 1 em = 1000 units  \n 12 pt type = 12 pt em or X pt type = X pt em  \n If an em is 1000 units then:  \n em/2 = 500 units = 50%  \n em/3 = 333.3 units = 33.3%  \n em/4 = 250 units = 25%  \n em/5 = 200 units = 20%\n\n(Bringhurst, v.3.1 pg 26) “For example: the word space native to the font used here (Minion Pro) is 227 units wide, or 227 thousandths of an em. The typesetting software is instructed to allow, in the main text, a minimum word space of 85%. That is 193 units: just under a fifth of an em. The maximum word space is set to 150%, which is 340 units: just over a third of an em.”\n\nHow do I figure out the native units of a specific typeface? Are the native units based on line length of individual fonts or are they arbitrary (which I refuse to believe)?  \nI am looking for an equation of some kind that will allow me to solve for the native units of a typeface so that I can determine what minimum and maximum percentages to use in order to control my justification?\n\nHELP!\n\n",

Characters in relief or incised will require more space than etching or printing, because of the cutting process you will need more space than you would necessarily use for printing on paper.  \nThe best answer is to question the manufacturer and look at some of their samples (and to think twice about justifying).\n\nTim\n\n"

(heroic tone)\n\ni should have been more specific about the bronze plaque project. i was so into figure out my justification issues that i skipped over the details. so here they are…\n\nthe bronze company has their suggestions and such but, i am looking for a more contemporary sans-serif that could work. the brand is quite historic, dating back to the 1600’s. any suggestions from here would be great.\n\nalthough i have been a member for over a year, this is my first post.\n\n"
