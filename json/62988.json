  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI'm looking for fonts similar to :\n\n[232MKSD Round Light](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723083535/http:/www2.wind.ne.jp/maniackers/232mksd.html)\n\nIts for a military interface for a game set a decade or two in the future. 232MKSD has the right kind of aesthetic but I'm open to completely different suggestions.\n\nPlus's :\n\nIts compressed (always useful for game interfaces). The bowls are vertical, c, e etc. Its legible at small sizes and has large open counters. The stroke weight is even so it will reproduce well on screen.\n\nMinus's:\n\nNeeds to be a slightly heavier weight. It is rounded which is too friendly for a military theme. I would like to try a more angular version like a condensed :\n\n[jillican](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723083535/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/jillican/).\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions, this site is such a great resource for type.\n\n",

I found another font that was interesting on a leaflet, I'm going to post it to the Type ID board for identification, could be a contender.\n\nCheers.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks all, those are excellent recommendations. CreativeNRG, your recommendations are all spot on though I didn't shortlist any because I think they would be a little less legible at the smaller sizes, it will get compressed a lot and the quality really deteriorates in game. United is a very good contender but I have a complaint about House Industries site, its virtually impossible to sample fonts so makes it really difficult to evaluate against those from myfonts.com which have excellent sampling options.\n\nFor your interest I think we've narrowed it to Quantico, Jillican, Milibus, CA Monodon, Coupe and Baksheesh from Myfonts.com, Blender Pro from Gestalten and United from House Industries. They're mostly condensed, octagonal and I think they have a military geometric aesthetic.\n\nThanks again everyone.\n\n"
