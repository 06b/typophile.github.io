Why the jumping baseline? And why is the letter order changed in the black box?  \nI think it's very weird indeed :/ \n",

To me this looks like _three guys founded a serious-acting company together but the youngest of them is constantly acting the clown, giggling about stuff nobody else finds funny, and thinking he's so very special. The others are vaguely annoyed about him but then again, hey, he brings in \"dynamism\"._\n\nThat, or horizontal kerning was getting boring. :-\\\n\nBut LOL, I never realized the order is different in the black box. I might just start calling them PriceCaterhouseWoopers now.\n\n"
