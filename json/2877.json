Do snake-oil salesmen still exist? Or am I being too harsh. Could somebody please tell Don Hosek (a founder of the ethics-centric TypeRight...) to let his subsribers know exactly when to expect the next issue, or how to get their money back?   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

Two years later -- _nada_.   \n   \nI was willing to cut dh a break for a while -- publishing a niche magazine is not easy -- but now I'm feeling a bit peeved too.   \n   \nHe should either prioritize putting out the issue or he should refund subscriptions.   \n   \n-- K.\n\n"
