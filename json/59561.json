JULY 09. NEW RELEASE.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nHello everybody from a really cold Argentina. We are happy to announce the release of **[Theorem](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103140642/http:/www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000439#specimen)**. Its a small breath from the scripts!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103140642im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typophiletheorem_6001.jpg)\n\nTheorem is an interesting change from the usual calligraphic work of Koziupa and Paul. An art deco font with a twist in its capitals, Theoremâ€™s lowercase characters were designed to automatically achieve the best optical spacing in typesetting. To accomplish that goal, a variety of alternates were drawn for most letters, and plenty of vowel-focused ligatures were designed. The auto-magic of OpenType ties it all together to a make a very versatile typeface that is quite useful for packaging and many different applications of display typography.\n\nHave a nice month!\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\n[www.sudtipos.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100103140642/http:/www.sudtipos.com/ \"www.sudtipos.com\")\n\n",
