  "content": "_you would think the national body responsible for the promotion of the language would be aware of it_   \n   \nTo be honest, John, I've stopped thinking about national bodies responsible for languages and _nothing_ surprises me anymore. A few years ago a journalist from an Irish language newspaper went into the department of the Gaeltacht with a camera and took photos of all the spelling mistakes in the internal signage. Even non-Irish speakers were horrified. And more often than you would expect, there are fairly scary spelling mistakes in road signs.   \n   \nOccasionally you come across unidentified, incomprehensible objects like this one in the West of Ireland:   \n   \n ![weird](http://web.archive.org/web/20131109014131im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/8852.jpg)   \n   \nBut what are you doing talking about Welsh and Irish when you could be answering a juicy question about Thai??? ;-)   \n   \nMatha\n\n",
