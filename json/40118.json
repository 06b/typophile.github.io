      "content": "A, V, v, w, y are really too wide.\n\nThe b is aesthetically strange, but it probably helps legibility.  \nYou might want to try to find a way to make the descender of the g not so big.\n\nThe rest of the design is nice and solid, though I think one pixel is missing from the diagonal of the M, and the serif on the bottom of the h may be closing it too much.\n\nThe numerals are my favorite. I like that they have their own height.\n\n"
