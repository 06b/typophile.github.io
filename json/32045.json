  "content": "Hi everybody,  \nHere’s a font I can’t quite identify. It reminds me of Caslon but it seems more  \nrounded, compact, and ‘heavy’. I’ve tried using the Serif Font Identification Guide but did not find a match.  \nThe book is a 1997 reprint of a 1971 edition of Michel Foucault’s ‘Madness and Civilization’.  \nHope someone can at least give me a pointer.  \nThanks in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [1.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309184052/http:/typophile.com/files/1.JPG) | 71.27 KB |\n| [2.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309184052/http:/typophile.com/files/2.JPG) | 85.59 KB |\n| [caps.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309184052/http:/typophile.com/files/caps.JPG) | 958.48 KB |\n| [3.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309184052/http:/typophile.com/files/3.JPG) | 96.79 KB |\n| [italics.JPG](http://web.archive.org/web/20070309184052/http:/typophile.com/files/italics.JPG) | 66.91 KB |\n\n",

The chin on the G and the oddly splayed M and the drooping ‘g’ ear are Kis/Janson hallmarks, so I still don’t think this is Caslon.\n\nYou say that the book is a reprint of a 1971 book. I wonder if they used the old plates, and that this is a metal version of the type.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

I believe the italic is some sort of Caslon which I have not been able to match across the board.The italic A in your sample also has the Caslon ‘notch’ at the apex, I think.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
