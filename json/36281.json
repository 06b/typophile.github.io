I admit I am making a judgment of Glengary from onscreen samples alone, but here is what I can conclude: while the sheer number of fonts you release in a given month is impressive, the volume doesn’t bode well for their quality.\n\nI _do_ have personal experience with Paul’s fonts — Mousse Script in particular — and I can confirm that their outlines and metrics are sound. Thus the recommendation. But I certainly urge you to demonstrate your work. I’d be happy to know there are too fine digital versions of Glenmoy.\n\n"

      "content": "FYI...\n\nI have been a commercial artist for forty years, and I have been a digital artist for seventeen years. Over the course of those years, I have developed speedy work habits, despite the fact that all of my outlines are created from scratch — no sloppy scan-and-convert jobs. Additionally, I check the integrity of my outlines in Fontographer, DTL Fontmaster and FontLab Studio. I set metrics by comparing **every possible combination** of uppercase+uppercase, uppercase+lowercase and lowercase+lowercase, and occasionally adjust letterforms on the fly if I find problemmatic combinations. I also kern **every possible combination** of uppercase+uppercase, uppercase+lowercase and lowercase+lowercase, so even words like **Ljubjana, Kwanzaa** and **syzygy** look good. I might also mention that making fonts is now my full-time job, and the sole means of support for my wife and I. I put in long hours and work every day of the week. So, please do not make “recommendations” based on unfounded assumptions and/or vague notions.\n\nFinally, on the subject of revivals: while I try to capture faithfully the original type designer’s letterforms, occasionally I do not personally agree with some of the choices the original designer made, and I exercise my own judgment and make modifications to those letterforms as I see fit. If you don’t agree with my choices, that’s certainly your prerogative; but to call them “suspect” is a scurrilous and specious slam.\n\nBelow are, in no particular order, a scan from a broadside specimen sheet from Stephenson Blake of Glenmoy, the same characters in Glengary and the same characters in Mousse Script. Who wants to identify which is which (without checking outside sources)?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081202183730im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/glengary-glenmoy-mousse_5484.gif)\n\n"

They sound well-founded. Still, they cannot take the place of careful drawing and skillful (re)interpretation of the original work.\n\nThanks for the comparison graphic. Though it might be more useful if we saw upper/lowercase words since those combos and their connections are vital in judging the quality in this face.\n\nLet’s also not forget that Mousse Script comes with a set of alternates that enhance the value of the package.\n\n"

Mousse is like the subtitle and Glengary is the display. Mousse is nice, but some of the changes made to it depart from the original in ways that I’m not sure I like.\n\n"
