Some letters have a base design, i.e. excluding the horizontal spurs which can be pasted on, that resemble Concave Tuscan: T, A, K, W [if apex brought to a point], O and N. Others have a base design, again excluding the spurs, that uses slab serifs: E and D. This is almost certainly not a revival of any classic font that I have seen.  \nPerhaps it might be most effective to ask the embroidery company about its source for the letters.  \nDon\n\n"
