I found it to be a starting point and ended up doing a great deal of visual correction. For my font, I reduced the caps to 96% to get the stroke weight but this will vary with your font. There is no simple quick way to do it right. The stroke to counter ratio is different so it must be optically corrected. Even the slant angles on M and W need work. As is usual for me in all parts of type design, it is all in the eyes.\n\nChrisL\n\n"

      "content": "For what it's worth, I took a pretty close look at the way Benton did the small caps on ATF Bodoni. For the most part, the small caps are automatically derived from the regular caps, with changes consistent with the Benton optical scaling technology. They used anamorphic scaling to widen the letters slightly with respect to the overall scaling, and used stroke offset to add more weight. Perhaps most importantly, in traditional work anyway, small caps are much more loosely set than either standard lowercase or caps.\n\nEven so, a few of the glyphs appear to have been completely redrawn (as you will see from studying this [200 dpi scan](http://web.archive.org/web/20120308180522/http:/levien.com/type/atf_1912/p0075_sm.jpg) of the Bodoni Book 18. Most obviously, the \"W\" is simplified a bit, so that it is almost halfway between the lowercase 'w' (no middle serif) and the overlapping VV design of the uppercase. I don't remember exactly which glyphs were tweaked, but the serifs on the \"H\" look a little longer than on the caps, and I think a couple of letters had their widths adjusted.\n\nBest of luck. Small caps are important for typographic sophistication. Oh, and a query like this doesn't come near pinging my annoyance meter; in general, I'd say spamming involved repetitiveness, and posting without additional content. Congrats on getting distribution!\n\n"

These will be the guide not only for height, but also for internal space. So, for example, the distance between the uprights of the scaled H will be the distance, edge to edge, of the uprights in the smallcap. This will produce smallcaps that are nicely proportioned relative to each other (presuming that your caps are nicely proportioned).\n\n2. Paste in another copy of the cap outlines, and scale these uniformly for weight. I usually match the vertical stem weight of my smallcaps to my lowercase, even though the smallcaps will be taller.\n\n3. Use the FontLab 'Interpolate' function to reduce the height and width of the weight-adjusted caps to match the height and internal space of the mask. This should be done in two passes: one for the y-direction and one for the x-direction. Be careful to maintain weights.\n\n4. Test and fiddle.\n\n"

But structural differences (not the same as the issues of \"finish\" you mention) are not required (or even good all of the time).\n\n\\> italics function within other text is to make itself separate  \n\\> out enough to clue the reader yet not blast out by being so  \n\\> different as to be jarring.\n\nI agree, but \"jarring\" doesn't have to be an interruption in reading.

I think the relatively straight forward relationship between italic caps and roman caps -- compared to the _range of relationships possible_ between the respective lowercases -- can be misleading for designers. Yes, there are methods to quickly arrive at italic caps from roman caps, and there are tricks for adjusting the weight on the bowls. But speaking as someone who has made use of such methods and tricks numerous times, I'm suspicious of them. I think they lead to a kind of dull repetetiveness that tends to make italic caps the least interesting part of any type family. Recently, I've been designing a display face that has a slight slant and some cursive features, and because there is no original roman to start from I was forced to think about the caps in terms of the design as a whole, and not as something derivative. If one has the luxury of time, I think it is worthwhile to approach italic caps in a similar fashion, independent of the roman.\n\n"

I am working on this now, so I'll probably do a mix of approaches and see what comes out.\n\nThe simplest ones, which I started by slanting and narrowing the roman caps, I had to extensively redraw, but at least slanting was a start, and I got some consistency. The italic caps should have a fairly close visual relation with the roman caps, I would think--moreso than the lower case where it is a matter of getting two quite different styles to look good together, as well as go with the italic caps. Now that I think of it, we are really trying to harmonize four different alphabets with the roman and companion italic u & lc. Fun, but quite a challenge.\n\n"

      "content": "_The italic caps should have a fairly close visual relation with the roman caps..._\n\nI think that is one legitimate approach, but I think it has become too much the default treatment. The reason for this, of course, is that when the first italic types were cut they had roman capitals, and the development of italic capitals happened a bit later and the forms were typically sloped versions of the roman caps. That delay had a lasting impact, I think, because although many chancery scribes would also use roman capitals with their cursive hands, there are examples of more cursive capitals that predate the slanted capitals in italic types. But these examples had no influence on the latter because by the time people came to make slanted capitals in type they seem to have referenced their own roman types rather than chirographic models.\n\nI think one way to approach italic capital design is to consider that what really distinguishes italic lowercase from roman is _speed_.\n\nRoman lowercase letters represent the (re)formalisation of the miniscule: the introduction into the lowercase alphabet of the formal qualities of the classical capitals, as rediscovered in the renaissance. The irony, of course, is that the miniscules had developed, via the uncial, away from that formalism, over hundreds of years, only to meet up with it again right at the time when type met up with the renaissance in Italy. The various local descendents of post-carolingian miniscule letters became more upright, stiffer, and _slower to write._\n\nWhen we apply the term 'cursive' to italic letters, we should reckon what this means in terms of speed. There is a tendency -- perhaps because all type goes at the same speed -- to consider the slant of italics and the 'cursive form' of the letters as somehow two separate components of what makes an italic. But the slant and the form of the chancery writing hand on which italic type is based are _both_ the result of the cursivity, or speed, of the writing. The characteristics of fast writing are compression, slant, lack of reverse strokes (entry and exit strokes only, no double serifs), rapid transition from stem to bowl (deep cuts, again with little reversal)... in other words, all the hallmarks of traditional italic lowercase letters.\n\nWhen I'm designing italic capitals, I sometimes ask myself 'How can I add some speed to these?', even if I'm basically following the usual relationship of italic to roman caps.\n\n"
