If so, I wouldn't pay full-price for it. This book is for hardcore collectors and helvetica-fetishists. I was given a copy so the collector in me was blessedly satiated without having to hurt my pocketbook.\n\n"

The target audience seems to be graphic designers -- MdN is the publisher of a popular Japanese graphic design magazine.  \nIt has 128 pages, half in color. To me it looks great.\n\nContents  \nVisual prologue - Essay on Helvetica typography by Hiroshi (?) Sato, based on material from Haas, with designs by the author.  \n1. Information about Miedinger and Linotype's Helvetica.  \n2. History of sans serif. Features a digital redrawing of Haas Unica by the author.  \n3. Comparison of Helvetica, Univers, and Akzidenz Grotesk.  \n4. Tips and tricks from Japanese designers.\n\nThe author also designs fonts. One of them is [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120228125810/http:/fontgraphic.jp/2004/pdf/fgm_1.pdf). I like the [at] mark. The person who was asking recently about 3-sided [at] marks might want to look at it.\n\n"

Amazing. In my real life I do documentation for video kit, and I just _gotta_ show this to the engineers.\n\nYou can click the little green buttons for font samples (although the links in the popups don't work anymore).\n\n"
