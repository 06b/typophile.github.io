I even think I may have this font in my collection, which pretty much means it would be a commercial font, not freeware.   \n   \nAnybody recognize it? ![Claudes sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20051128041021im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22814.gif)\n\n",

Perhaps the original?   \n   \nThe fonts on those disks bring names like Mike Allard,   \nMarty Bee, Rick Mueller, David Rakowski, Sam Wang, and   \nothers to mind.\n\n"
