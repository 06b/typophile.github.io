  "content": "My dream is to be a lettering artist for Hallmark Cards. Unfortunatly that is all that it will be. Just a dream. My family does not want to relocate to Kansas and I am not even sure if Hallmark would even hire me. So I guess I will have to go after more realistic goals which is to become a fulltime lettering artist and Typeface designer. I designed this new typeface called “Enchanted” which is my tip of the hat to all of the lettering artists past and present at Hallmark. I sent it out to FontBros, myfonts.com, Veer and also Fonts.com. Hopefully Fontshop will pick it up also. I talked with Stuart Sandler and he should have it maybe up by tomorrow at FontBros.com :) It has seven alternates also. The word “Thanksgiving” in the samples shows the alternate k and g.\n\nHappy Holidays\n\n-Charles Borges de Oliveira\n\n[www.borgeslettering.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013032417/http:/www.borgeslettering.com/ \"www.borgeslettering.com\")\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013032417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Enchanted-Christmas-Promo_4638.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013032417im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Enchanted%20Samples%202_4274.jpg)\n\n",

Better to make the inquiry; there is a lot of work that is done remotely, since high-quality scans, bezier versions and fonts are all easily transferred digitally.\n\nI ask this because your work is excellent, and there is no reason you should not be considered seriously by Hallmark, or by other greetings companies.\n\nWhich would leave you with more regret: never trying to realize your dream, or realizing it?\n\n"
