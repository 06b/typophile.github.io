I'm looking for a font similar to the one Saul Bass uses for the Movie credits on the Vertigo poster.  \nIt's a rough, kind of hand drawn, ultra light, condensed font. A movie has used something similar lately, but I can't remember which one (and it's driving me crazy!!!)\n\nAny help would be much appreciated. Thanks\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228163312im_/http:/typophile.com/files/fontid_4786.jpg)\n\n",

I've found a font called Major Kong which is pretty close (if only there was a condensed version it would be perfect)\n\nEDIT2: Brilliant, just found this [http://type.fargoboy.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20111228163312/http:/type.fargoboy.com/ \"http://type.fargoboy.com/\") which is close enough\n\nThanks guys.\n\n"
