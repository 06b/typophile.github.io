Know what the exact font Truss uses Eats, Shoots & Leaves?\n\n",

      "content": "The irony of FF Quadraat in <cite>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</cite>, at least from my perspective, is that there is no kerning between quotation marks and periods or commas. So the many sentences with phrases enclosed in quotation marks with periods or commas outside have all these huge, unsightly, gaping holes with pitiful little points floating in them.\n\nIt's not quite as glaring when the points are contained within quotes, but kerning is still absent.\n\nOn second thought, maybe that's why you perceive the punctuation as prominent.\n\nMildly enjoyed the book, but never got over the irritation of this lack of kerning.\n\n-- K.\n\n"
