I have used ESP and POR and they work when tested in FontLab but since I am just guessing, I would like a more authoritative answer. I tried Google but get every other kind of code than the 3-letter cap used for locl feature. Anybody know the link or the answer\"\n\nChrisL\n\n",

On Wikipedia, the language is called [Dhivehi](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020191427/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhivehi) (\\* or Divehi, or Mahi) and the tag is div.

Most tools allow you to use only the three letters and add the padding automatically. There are a couple of four-letter language system codes defined though, and probably more will be defined in future.\n\n"
