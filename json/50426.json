I saw a posting .. or connection to this website.. adn I’m now trying to track him down..\n\nI believe I worked with his father, Clare Menking, many years ago at the Archbishop Sheen Center in Dallas, Texas. If that is him, it is OK to give him my email address or phone. I know his Mom well and would love to be able to talk to her again.. and to also catch up with Justin.\n\nPatricia Martin  \nMartin Media (972) 333-6722  \n [martinmm@verizon.net](mailto:martinmm@verizon.net)  \nmartinmm.com\n\n [‹ Frutiger Rip Off](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162930/http:/typophile.com/node/18262 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Lost link – FOUND!!! ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081023162930/http:/typophile.com/node/50376 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
