  "content": "From the talented artist and typographic designer, Delve Withrington:   \n   \n\"   \n I'd like to invite you all to some upcoming gallery   \n exhibits that I'm participating in. They're all around   \n the bay area so hopefully everyone will have a chance   \n to see my work at a convenient location. The dates are   \n listed below (beginning with one tomorrow night!) with   \n the details on each following. For those of you not in   \n the bay area, I'm looking for shows all over the country   \n and I'll be sure let you know if something happens near   \n you. In the meantime, you can get a sneak peek at some   \n of my new work at my site: [http://www.withrington.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142235/http:/www.withrington.com/)   \n   \n   \n Calendar at-a-glance:   \n   \n 1. Tomorrow, 6-8:30pm, Pro Arts Gallery, Oakland   \n   \n 2. 12/6/02, 7-10pm, City Art Gallery, SF   \n   \n 3. 1/3/03, 7-10pm, City Art Gallery, SF   \n   \n 4. 1/12/03, 2-4pm, Berkeley Art Center, Berkeley   \n   \n 5. 1/29/03, 6:30-8:30pm, Los Medanos College Art Gallery,   \n Pittsburg, CA   \n   \n   \n The Details:   \n   \n The first event on the calendar is the closing party   \n and final bidding opportunity in the silent auction at   \n Pro Arts Gallery in downtown Oakland. I've a new piece   \n called \"Axial Discord\" in this show and it could be   \n yours for very cheap if you place the winning bid. The   \n show (which is fantastic, by the way) is up right now   \n but closes this Saturday. Pro Arts Gallery is located   \n at: 461 9th St., in Oakland near Broadway (two blocks   \n from the 12th St BART). Refreshments served. More info   \n available at: [http://www.proartsgallery.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142235/http:/www.proartsgallery.org/)   \n   \n The next two exhibitions are show openings at the City   \n Art Gallery in the Mission district of SF. During the   \n December show, I'll have a few pieces in the back room.   \n However, for the January show, I'll have several works   \n in the front room, so you city folk shouldn't miss it.   \n And if you just can't wait for either of these shows,   \n I've actually got a few pieces of art in the back room   \n for the show currently running at City Art through the   \n month of November. The City Art Gallery is located at:   \n 828 Valencia St. between 19th and 20th Streets. Refresh-   \n ments served. More info is available at their website:   \n [http://www.cityartgallery.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142235/http:/www.cityartgallery.org/)   \n   \n Fourth on the list is a show at the Berkeley Art Center,   \n which is just a bit North of downtown Berkeley. This is   \n a fabulous members show that I'll have a piece in. It'll   \n be on exhibit from 1/12/03 to 2/15/03. The BAC is located   \n at: 1275 Walnut St. Refreshments served. Find more info   \n about BAC online at: [http://www.berkeleyartcenter.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014142235/http:/www.berkeleyartcenter.org/)   \n   \n Finally, I'm in a two-person show at the Los Medanos   \n College Art Gallery in Pittsburg, CA. I do admit, this   \n is a bit of a trek for some, but it will be well worth   \n it for those of you who can make it. I will arrange a   \n carpool so get in touch with me if you need a ride.   \n   \n   \n That's it for now. I'll be sure to keep you all updated   \n on when and where my new work can be seen. Otherwise, I   \n frequently update my website regarding my exhibitions.   \n   \n I hope to see you at one (or two) of them soon.   \n   \n Yours,   \n Delve Withrington   \n\"\n\n",
