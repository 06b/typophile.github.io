      "content": "Herkules designed by Haas. Your 1970 sample is predigital. It is likely from the lettering sold by Letraset under that name. The OPTI digitization, under the name Huk, seems to be an original work. I suspect that the Steffmann version is a clone. Needs to be checked.  \nAs for OPTI fonts, here is what I usually say. Using an \"orphan font\" like the ones from the defunct OTPI foundry raises legal issues, even where, as in the case of this one, the font seems to be an original digitization by OPTI rather than a pirated clone of digital work by another fontmaker. Probably no problem for personal use but for anything commercial I recommend consulting a lawyer.  \nDISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer. This merely a layman's opinion and does not constitute legal advice.  \nDon\n\nDon\n\n"
