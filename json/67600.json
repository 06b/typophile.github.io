So is [AG Schoolbook 2](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052944/http:/www.identifont.com/show?HG6). Monotype offers a bold version (only) that features a number of different letterforms (y, I) under the name of [Special Alphabets 10](http://web.archive.org/web/20150126052944/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/special_alphabets_10/).  \nF\n\n"
