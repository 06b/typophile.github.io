Design firms are small and tend to stay local. If you want meaningful numbers, you need to get them from someone who communicates with a lot of printers and can sift through the data on a large scale. To get real answers you need to do some real research and not just ask people for answers online.\n\n<cite>Or is there another reason people do DTP?</cite>\n\nDTP is not what designers do. It’s a tool that designers use.\n\n"
