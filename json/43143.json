Make sure you design in one colour black and white before adding any colour or gradients to make sure it will read properly. Also, I’d suggest sketching on paper first (which it doesn’t look like you did).\n\n- Lex\n\n"

The AMER makes me think it’s short for America, and MMG is a common abbreviation for “MultiMedia/Graphic Design” or “Microbiology and Molecular Genetics” at colleges. So instead of MMO Gamer, I read “Microbiology and Molecular Genetics America. That’s not what you want, obviously. I agree with Lex - start on paper.\n\n"
