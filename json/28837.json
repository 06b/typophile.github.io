They can do anything I want, including printing around the shirt. :-)\n\nI never needed a good shop when I lived in northern VA or I'd reco someone near you, but I know the Maryland Sheep & Wool Festival uses someone local and their shirts are pretty good (I know, I have a lot of them!): you could email them at [info@sheepandwool.com](mailto:info@sheepandwool.com) to see who they use.\n\nLinda\n\n"
