  "content": "Hello.  \nI've searched this forum for answers to my questions, but I haven't found any yet. So, here is my problem:\n\nI have buiit a whole font and now I have realised that the 60%-figures (as \"onesuperior\" etc.) could be a bit bolder. When I try to do this via tools/action/effects/outline (H weight: 2, V weight: 2, \"keep glyph dimensions\" enabled) , a strange thing occurs: the glyph shifts some units to the left and to the bottom. The problems seems to be in the \"V weight\", because if I leave this V to 0, the change to the H weight functions.\n\nI have tried to change the contour's direction, but it didn't solve the problem.\n\nDoes anybody has an idea? Thanks a lot. Mathilde\n\n",
