  "content": "hello,  \nafter 10.000 b.c., i wished to see a more accurate movie about the stone age,  \nand ended up seeing one million years b.c. (supline: this is the way it was)^^  \ni really enjoyed the movie, theres half-naked women, no dialogue at all,  \nan harryhausens famous stopmotion animation.\n\ni also really liked the opening credits.  \nthey used a very bold font, which i suppose is custom made,  \nand also a more normal typeface, which is perhaps widely used,  \nwell i couldn’t identify.\n\nbut anyway i am more interested in the bold font.  \ndoes anybody know anything about it, please let me know.  \nor if you got anything else to say about this font and my taste,  \nlet me know as well.\n\nps  \n10.000 bc sucked. very much. but it was still fun!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017070031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omybc01_3751.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017070031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omybc02_4419.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131017070031im_/http:/typophile.com/files/omybc03_6644.jpg)\n\n",
