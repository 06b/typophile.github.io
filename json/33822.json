  "content": "Hey Guys-\n\nWondering if anybody can lean me in the direction of any existing typefaces similar to these? I've added a few examples, obviously different but I really like the style, especially the solid serif one. They are some custom work by the fantastic crew at Non-Format. I'm wanting to find some abstract solid typefaces similar to do some experimenting for a poster design. Full credit to Non-Format love there work!!\n\nThanks for any help in advance!\n\nCheers\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Slab\\_samples.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141115000118/http:/typophile.com/files/Slab_samples.jpg) | 17.98 KB |\n\n",
