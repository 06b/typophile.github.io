I am a middlewieght typographic designer working on a corporate identity design project - I normally stick to books -, and I would like to find a fairly comprehyensive guide to setting stationary items, such as compliment slips and letters. Can anyone help?\n\nAlso, does anyone, including the man himself, know how Nick Shinn uses Em dashes in his forum entries - maybe it’s obvious, I don’t know? I guess I’ll have to stick to hyphens for know - yuck!\n\n [‹ Aligning Columns](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120063713/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35921 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Tall and skinny ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120063713/http:/www.typophile.com/node/35939 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
