  "content": "Just wondering if anyone else here has any kind of typographic tattoos here. My first tattoo just finished healing, it’s an ambigram of my last name ’bailey’ made to look like it’s embossed into my back (kind of hard to see in this photo). Mind you I did this shot on a self timer so I was trying to point to it and get in position at the same time...I had been thinking about getting a tattoo for a long time but decided that I would only get one if I designed it and if it meant something to me.\n\nThis design became significant to me because of a) I designed it myself b) John Langdon told me it was one of the best ambigrams he’s seen out of any he’s ever been sent. To be complimented to this degree by the creator/inventor of such art form it humbled me to a great extent c) most importantly it’s to commemorate my grandfather and father who do amazing carpentry wood work, when they finish a piece they brand their names into their work (initials and date usually). When I showed this to my grandfather (the ambigram) he was ecstatic and so what I did was get him a self inking stamp of it for his birthday. He has since marked all of his cherished books and such with the stamp and it was the happiest I’ve ever seen him in the 20 years I’ve been alive. I’d like to remember that moment. I’ve essentially branded myself with one of my most cherished designs.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630213957im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/myback.jpg)\n\nWhat’s yours and your story?\n\n [‹ The evolution of the alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630213957/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16810 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [AIGA has released a free contract form for small businesses ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080630213957/http:/www.typophile.com/node/16806 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Congratulations.\n\nI know a guy who has a big “calligraphic” tatoo troughout his chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It looked nice and he was so proud of it that I couldn’t bring myself to tell him that the French in it was wrong :/\n\n"

It was even the city he was from (the biker) oi...needless to say the tat artist was scared for his life, but the Hell’s Angel realized that it was his fault and my artist got out alive haha. He’s actually the guy giving the tattoo in the beginning of the show Oz on HBO if you’ve ever seen that. My friend grew up with him so I’ve been hanging out in his shop since I’ve been in Manhattan.\n\n"
