For some reason the test drives of Quay Sans Black don't look like they have the same slight flare at the top of the A. Is it just my eyes?\n\nI certainly couldn't find anything closer.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

Was about to say \"custom job adding flare serifs on some generic sans\" (and to be specific on [Helvetica Neue](http://web.archive.org/web/20140720190025/http:/myfonts.us/td-u8doza) Heavy which looks to match almost perfectly the skeleton) then refreshed the page and saw your answer. Missing only the /A top flare serifs but that looked awfully close...\n\n"
