Certain areas of type design, like newspapers, phone books, photopolymer letterpress, small sizes\\* and third-world presses benefit as noticeably from trapping as they do from good kerning for example. Especially if the design in question calls for a \"crispness\" of character.   \n   \n\\* In fact trapping isn't just about fighting gain, it's about fighting optical aberation too (which happens at small sizes, irrespective of gain).   \n   \nThe best designers do incorprate trapping (sometimes very subtly - like look at the lc \"g\" in Georgia), and sometimes its absense is completely unforgivable (like in Majoor's Telefont).   \n   \nhhp\n\n",

The ink spread is held to an absolute minimum to allow the clarity of the letterforms to show. These are much \"thinner\" that the printed specimens show in this thread. Also the baseline disturbance is more prominent in the smaller sizes and is progressively adjusted thoughout the range. The 14 point baselines are hardly disturbed. The hanging or jumping lowercase characters mentioned previously seem to have been brought in line. These are quite vivid in the 8 point though. I'm suspecting this was a means for creating a certain legibility to the smaller sizes? It is fairly characteristic of many of the Linotype text offerings.\n\n"

Francis Hutcheson, in the first book on aesthetics (1725) wrote that beauty is experienced when we are confronted with a \"compound ratio of uniformity and variety.\" He influence the neoclassical movement.   \n   \nWhen I did a google search on \"unity, variety, balance\", it came up with mainly pages from courses on design, so I'm not alone in thinking these concepts are useful.   \n   \nAs this is a thread on logic and intuition, I would suggest that questions such as 'is the design unified? is there enough variety? is it balanced?' are useful. They are a way logic can critique intuition and spur more creativity.   \n   \nWhen I read between the lines of Bringhurst, I have the feeling he thinks that a lot of the digital versions of the classics were done without enough care or thought (under commercial pressures?) and as a result are a comedown from the orginals.   \n   \nThe discussion of Electra here seems to confirm that, big time.\n\n"

And, unfortunately,   \nI don't have a copy of Big Red (yet). To be clear, however, I do not base   \nmy judgement solely on the one example of the Mergenthaler booklet.   \nIt is based on a number of encounters with both fine and trade editions   \non various papers. I am not suggesting that digital Electra be made to   \nlook like a poorly reproduced letterpress specimen. I just wish it retained   \nsome of the substance and vigor of the original.   \n   \nLet me see if I can offer a counter example:   \n   \nI feel similarly about the digital version of Caledonia (at least Linotype   \nchose to call it \"New\" Caledonia). I feel that it is too light and contrasty   \ncompared to the original metal Linotype, especially under modern   \nprinting conditions.   \n   \nHowever, Matthew Carter created a digital version of Caledonia for   \n_Time_ magazine in 1993. Now this puts some of the ink back on   \nthe bones and reinstills vigor in the face. It is no historic mimic of the   \nletterpress specimen; neither is it an anorexic specter. As could be   \nexpected of Carter, he has done a thoroughly modern job, but with an   \neye for the quality and spirit of the original design. He recently did the   \nsame thing with Linotype Monticello for the Princeton University Press.   \n   \nI wish the same might be done with Electra. It would be a great service   \nto the book publishing field.   \n   \n-- Kent.\n\n"

Very well printed, with minimum impression on a fairly receptive stock, with just the right about of ink control given to it. Representative of what they would want the market to see. The 96 point they present would most likely have been photographically scaled from the 14pt and reproduced photomechanically. My scaling of the digital type to that size indicates a very near match with only the slightest variations built in to correspond to a new printing technology.   \n   \nSo if I print the digital Electra with photopolymer plates I would expect a fairly accurate representation of the original, as a product of letterpress.   \n   \nIf the letterpress process itself is really what is giving Electra its liveliness, then it really isn't a problem with the digital rendition as much as it is a preference for the way letterpress reveals the face. But, impression and ink gain will alter any typeface.   \n   \nI've printed with letterpress for near three decades now. I obviously prefer the printing process. But I also have a great deal of respect for the work being done with digital typefaces; the impetus \"to\" revive classical faces, the concerns for optimization and legibility. I don't believe the digital version is the travesty some of the folks here wish it were.\n\n"

      "content": "Gerald, yes it may be that the digital version of Electra, if printed by letter press - assuming your photopolymer plates have similar ink spread as metal did - would correct the problems of the digital version, and get a similar superb result. My point from the start was that the digital version should have taken into account that almost all the printing would be from computer to photo to offset press, and so should get the supurb result by the current common technology. However, if Kent Lew's observations are correct - and he seems to have made a deep study of the matter - the digitizer also made the font more uniform than Dwiggins had intended, and made other adjustments. If so, I suspect that the result will still be not as good, even though the problems with the weight, particularly of the thin strokes, will have been corrected by the printing process.   \n   \nI am not saying that letter press is inherently better, only that the change in technology sometimes wasn't taken into account properly in the digitizing of old typefaces. Now letter press can get 'sock', the slight embossing of the paper, which is nice. And you tell me, is there any difference in the density of the ink in letter press vs offset? To me these advantages may be real, but aren't that big. The main problem is suiting the font to the printing method.\n\n"

It does sparkle more than does the average Garamond (given the same printing conditions).   \n   \nThe biggest problem comes with how the user \"sets\" the typeface, and second what printing conditions they will use.   \n   \nI truly think that Dwiggins would have whole-heartedly embraced the technologies of today.

If they would have emboldened it to create a faux letterpress look, would not that have been the wrong thing to do? Electra is a spindly face, it was as a metal face as well. It is just more revealed as such on digital printing devices.   \n   \nProblem with trying to replicate a metal face with inkspread \\_in sito\\_ is that the gain is not uniform and also varies considerably based on presswork, substratum, printing press, etc.   \n   \nYes there is significant difference in the inking of offset vs letterpress. Letterpress is a continual gain that must be monitored continually. Once the ink grows out beyond the letterform outline (not a significant factor in offset) it progressively gets worse as the ink is viscous and continues to draw. There is good letterpress and bad letterpress. But in any printing medium you would want the clarity of letterform to be revealed as the designer intended. In this case it would be as the revival designers intended, not Dwiggins.   \n   \nFournier said \"the letter should not be blamed for the fault of the ink.\" This in reference to the punchcutter versus the presswork of the printer. I'd suspect any type designer would like to see their creations presented in the best light, would they not?\n\n"

      "content": "Perhaps the best approach is to consider the 'spindliness' of the digital Electra independently of the metal version. I think we're too focused on whether the weight matches the letterpress, and not considering the more basic question: is the digital Electra _too_ spindly to work as a text face in typical offset printing situations? Yes, I think it often is too spindly, especially on white or very light paper stocks. If the visual sense of a typeface is that it is being overwhelmed by the paper, then that typeface it too light to be used at that size on that stock. I've seen numerous books set in 11pt Electra that I would not want to read on account of the weakness of the type. This is irrelevant on the colour of the metal type, or the digital printed letterpress via polymer: this is something that can be judged soley with reference to the digital type as printed offset. Personally, if I intended to use Electra for anything printed offset, I would probably spend a couple of days beefing up the outlines in various ways. I wouldn't do this in reference to any letterpress printed specimen: I would do this in reference to what would read best at the type size I intended.\n\n"

You can see how much difference that makes in the letterform: the body on the left is not black enough, but the contour is great; on the right the thins and the serifs get chunky, and the cusp between the stem and the arch starts filling in (long live trapping).
