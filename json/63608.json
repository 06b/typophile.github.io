My lack of knowledge about this subject makes it virtually impossible for me to be very specific, so I would just like some general estimates/guesses in response to my inadequate question.\n\nI am setting a book using InDesign. My client is undecided about self-publishing or using a publishing company. (My client has several agents who are interested in handling the book.) I need to get a rough estimate of how much it would cost to print a professional quality paperback book in standard format, (about 5\"x8\"), approximately 300 pages in length, with back and front cover in color. My question involves only printing production costs for 1000 copies. Artwork and typesetting will be provided by yours truly.\n\nI fully realize that my lack of details will result in less-than-happy responses, but all I need is a very rough approximation!\n\nThanks Much!  \nDK~\n\n",

Rough enough?  \nThe design itself should come to, well, no more than a few hundred dollars -- an hourly rate is fair _if_ you know your way around InDesign.\n\nBiggest part of the printing costs is setting up and get started; only with more than 300 or 400 copies, time and paper are going to kick in. Binding sheets into real books is mostly a flat fee, though.\n\nWhy not ask a quotation from one or more printers in your neighbourhood? They are a friendly lot, and when given the opportunity, they will tell you what to ask next time.\n\n"

I'd change that to an estimate of $5 to $8 per book, retailing for something inbetween $50 and $80.\n\nI don't think a 1,000 copy run can be done with Printing-on-Demand for that price.\n\n"
