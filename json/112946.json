  "content": "Hi everybody,\n\nI am designing a book series of utopian novels. There will be some classics of the genre and some less known books. Most of the novels are late 19th century but not all. I have to decide on the main typeface that will be used for the text. The texts will be in English with no other language requirements.  \nThe concept of an \"utopian\" book typeface intrigues me but I have not reached any conclusion yet so I would like some suggestions.\n\nI would prefer to use a relatively new typeface and so give some money to a living designer and not just Adobe. Also a kind of \"contemporary\" look (whatever that may mean) is part of the brief.\n\nFor no particular reason I am drawn to the idea of using something like Joanna...\n\n",

Whitman is the classic alternative but then again it does not relate particularly to the concept of utopia, does it?\n\nUtopia makes me think more of timelessness and perfection which clashes a bit with the \"contemporary\" idea.\n\nIowan Old Style is a possibility...\n\nOne idea was to use Hypatia Sans for titles so the solution could be a serif that works well with Hypatia.\n\n"

AFAIK Robert Slimbach, the designer of Utopia -- born in 1956 -- is still a \"living designer.\" I hope he still gets something from his work other than a payment long ago for completing his design for Adobe. But the font business seems to lack anything like the music business system of a levy for every time the song is broadcast.  \n2. Should a utopian image be a contemporary fad, or a reflection of timeless perfection? I would see contemporary fads as being more appropriate for dystopian visions than utopian ones.  \nDon\n\n"

That's why I think of Whitman-Joanna.\n\nBut you seem to think Slimbach's Utopia is a good idea... It is suspiciously obvious...\n\n"

Also a kind of \"contemporary\" look (whatever that may mean) is part of the brief.\n\nIf by \"contemporary\" you mean letterforms that aren't classical, take a look at Skolar. It's reasonable without being too abysmally clunky\n\n(See [http://media.caranddriver.com/images/12q4/492040/2014-gmc-sierra-1500-al...](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416005835/http:/media.caranddriver.com/images/12q4/492040/2014-gmc-sierra-1500-all-terrain-photo-497174-s-1280x782.jpg \"http://media.caranddriver.com/images/12q4/492040/2014-gmc-sierra-1500-all-terrain-photo-497174-s-1280x782.jpg\") for an ostensive definition of \"abysmally clunky\")\n\nHuronia has a similar contemporary look, vis a vis letterforms. (Rosetta distributes Huronia, but it is a Tiro Typeworks design.) Both families have Greek, though I'm not competent to judge how good any contemporary Greek font is -- and Huronia had, as of 2012, Greek in the roman only.\n\n[http://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416005835/http:/www.rosettatype.com/Skolar \"http://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar\")  \n [http://www.rosettatype.com/Huronia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416005835/http:/www.rosettatype.com/Huronia \"http://www.rosettatype.com/Huronia\")\n\nBy the way, be careful of fonts with newish letterforms -- IMSLTHO letterforms are less than half of what an effective font is about, unless you're selling a product and need brand identity or some such. General spacing and the way letters fit together is far more important. Of the \"contemporary\" fonts, the two above at least meet that test.\n\n> For no particular reason I am drawn to the idea of using something like Joanna...\n\nWell, except for the fact that it's been described as \"so 1990s,\" Scala is quite reminiscent of Joanna. This, as with so many fonts designed for printing from repro-negative-plate, comes out a bit light with current direct-to-plate printing.\n\nMany examples of this effect, one I'm reading right now (set in Scala) -- <cite>Mountains Beyond Mountains</cite>, Tracy Kidder's book about Paul Farmer, which any library should have. (See a Random House first edition, any printing.)\n\n<cite>Edit</cite> -- if the publisher is planing an ebook in a pdf version (unlikely) stick with Adobe fonts, or do some serious checking on EULAs. Aside from Adobe, almost everyone else charges extra for embedding fonts for commercial use, such as a pdf ebook. Been there, got the T-shirt...\n\n"
