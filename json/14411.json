Does any one of a progrom (or method) of calculating the length of a string of text given the string of text, the font size, and the font style? Assume that Kerning is on, and tracking is off, but if it can be done with kerning off then that’s no problem.  \nI know that beggers can not be choosers, but if could be done in java or C++ then that would be just ducky.  \n Thanks in advace to anyone that can help!\n\n",

Most people cop out and just use the font height multiplied by the number of characters..\n\n"
