      "content": "Thank you Stephen, and well spotted Bald Condensed. I've been working for a few years on a reappraisal of Rudolf Koch's Prisma, together with Alex Rich and Rafael Koch. We've made a new lower case (referencing old Kabel drawings -- Prisma was caps only), digitised the upper case and turned the entire font into a modular set of varying weights, fills and lines: \"Prismaset\".\n\nLance Wyman made an obvious nod to Prisma and beautifully moved it on for Mexico '68 and more recently Mevis & Van Deursen referenced and deconstructed Mexico for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen identity in Rotterdam. We take it full circle back to Koch's visionary 1931 original. Hoping to deliver it to Lineto for release late this year.\n\n"
