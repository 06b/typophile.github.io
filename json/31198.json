They concluded that it was 'not a font' on the shirts (supposedly based on a statement from L.I.G. folks). However, I think the site that Conor linked shows that a similar styled font was generated to make the site captions.\n\nI have no doubt it would be proprietary, since that is a big part of their brand 'look'.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
