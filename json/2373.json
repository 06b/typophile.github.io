  "content": "I just thought we could discuss a bit about monolined since it's still a contemporary type trend. We know some people love it and others just think it's too easy. This thread is open to all opinions.   \n   \nWhat about if we also try to create a list of the best types in this movement?   \n   \nIs Lineto a reference with their Gravur Condensed and simple? And about MM Paris?   \n   \nDrop us your opinion here.   \n   \nthank you   \nHelder   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019062944im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/22236.gif)   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019062944im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/22237.gif)\n\n",
