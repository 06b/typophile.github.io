That is Helvetica, though we are switching to Meta Design’s Transit.\n\nA little less facetiously than my own “Handwriting” ‡¬), I am a big fan of older type faces. While more recent designs are more appropriate for today’s technology, and in many instances are more readable and versatile, I like the look of a classic type with idiosyncratic characters, non lining numerals and a little bit of ink squishing out around the edges. Maybe a Bodini - but hand tooled, and where the ’s’s look like ’f’s. If I’m living in a world with but one typographic note, I’ll choose a warm, sensual and aesthetically pleasing one over an efficient, practical, higly readable font.\n\nAs a signage designer, whose been around for a long time, I’m also fond of the look of a hand drawn, cut or painted letter in signage and display type. I may be a tad anachronistic, but I like to see the hand of the person who made it evident in the execution. These days when it is so easy to reproduce perefectly formed letters, it is often a relief to see hand drawn lettering, even if slighlty amaturish.\n\n"
