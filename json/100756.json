  "content": "Dear all,\n\ni've done a new font with font forge in which a ligature happens -\\> e.g. \"12\" is substituted with \"3\".  \nWhen i test the font in Adobe indesign anything works fine, if you enter \"12\" you get \"3\" - as expected.\n\nBut when i try it in visual studio, word pad or word 2002 it get a blank space after the substituted glyph -\\> \"3 \".  \nIt seems to me, that windows always occpuies the space which was instantly in used by the entered origin glyphs 1 and 2.\n\nPerhaps anyone can give me a hint, what i have to configure to fix this behaviour.\n\nHINT: the glyphs are of course done without brackets -\\> \"3\" means 3. I used brackets to make clear, that i get  \na space after the 3 -\\> \"3 \" ;-)\n\nhope for a hint\n\nOliwan\n\n...may the source be with you\n\n",
