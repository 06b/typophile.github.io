  "content": "LinoLetter 9/05 – Charming Fonts, Western and Arabic\n\nIntroduction:  \nOur main focus this month is on Linotype’s enhanced Arabic Type Collection. But we have some great Latin script faces to introduce you to as well; take ITC Grimshaw Hand, for instance. This gem of a handwriting font comes out of our “grunge script” category. More western fonts can be found in three of our newest basic-user value packs; this month we are proud to present a trio of Value Packs that all aid in the design of professional-quality menu design. Closing out this issue is a link to Typeradio.org, a website featuring downloadable podcasts with some of the leading figures in typography today.\n\nDon’t miss a special “Coming Soon” announcement at the end of this issue!\n\nThe full text of this issue of the LinoLetter may be read at: [http://www.linotype.com/8-38-8-18881/issue200509.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20060329210646/http:/www.linotype.com/8-38-8-18881/issue200509.html)\n\nHave fonts of fun!\n\n",
