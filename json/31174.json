  "content": "Hello typofriends.\n\nSince the first days of 2007 i decide to come back to the field of type.  \nI like to share the first font from my re-starting new effort to become a typedesigner.  \nPicara is a sanserif organic font, with local vernacular references, a little condensed proportions, dark color, roman humanist model(Jenson)and open counterforms.\n\nI want to keep armonic rithm of vernacular letters, without distracting too much the attention of the reader. The propose for this font is to work from 7 to 12 pts, in magazines and books, with a family of the 4 classic weights: Roman, SmallCaps, Italic and Bold.\n\nThe end strokes follow a strong left-right \"italic rithm\" in the lowercases; Do you see the same in the uppercases?\n\nThere are some characteristics that i want to follow, for example, the monetary lowercase signs aligned to the x weight old style figure numbers.¿is this weird for commercial standard requirements?\n\nMore details to look at in this first complete version of the roman, in the character set attached in the pdf.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nmh.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ltt Picara Spec Typophile.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414115523/http:/typophile.com/files/Ltt%20Picara%20Spec%20Typophile.pdf) | 39.51 KB |\n| [Ltt Picara Specimen.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414115523/http:/typophile.com/files/Ltt%20Picara%20Specimen.gif) | 219.39 KB |\n\n",

This warm, organic finish will be a hit, especially in these days of soft'n'cozy, but Picara doesn't feel trendy.\n\nThe bowl of the 'a' might be just a tad too small for text sizes. It's the only counter in danger of clogging.\n\n\\> There are some characteristics that i want to follow, for example, the monetary lowercase signs aligned to the x weight old style figure numbers.\n\nNo reason not to do both. Make a Lining Figures version of the font with punctuation and monetary symbols that match the uppercase.\n\n"

The S & s both seem to be rolling foreward to me a little. I see how the font holds together with the top being where is is so maybe rather than pulling the top back the rest of the form could change. Does the lc eth bend over to far? The lc o feels a little heavy to me compaed to the e & a. I like the dimunation of the dollar sign. The upper case Thorn is super nice!\n\n"

And its lower bowl too small (don't use the s for that).  \nRe the florin: maybe you should line up the horizontal strike thru with the one in the sterling etc. And do elongate it and maybe give it a bit of a cursive slant (that's common usage in the Low Countries).  \nThe ampersand is a bit unbalanced. Maybe the lower bowl a bit larger and the upper smaller?  \nThe cedille needs to beef up.\n\nSounds like a lot — but I do like this design. Makes me wish I could do something like it ; )\n\n"

Maybe it could benefit to slat it very very little to the right.\n\nMay I ask you: do you know when Alejandro Lo Celso's Australis will be made finally available to license?\n\n"
