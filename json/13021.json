This is a Romanian knockoff of their Radio series which was available in chiara, corsiva, corsiva nera, nera, litografica styles. This looks quite like Radio Nera (black) to me. Hard to forget that lowercase t. The chiara and corsiva companion are quite nice. The Romanian seems to differ only in that the bowls of the uppercase are slightly condensed and thus range a bit higher throughout.\n\nGerald Lange\n\n"

I’ve got a blog where I will put it up (temporarily) in the next day or so. I don’t recall that there are full character sets though.\n\n[http://TypeRoad.blogspot.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20071024010601/http:/typeroad.blogspot.com/ \"http://TypeRoad.blogspot.com\")\n\nI also noticed, belatedly, that the Romanians had caned the lowercase f. A bit odd. It certainly funks it up a bit. Wonder if that was just a nationalistic thing.\n\nGerald\n\n"
