I agree with Mark.   \n   \nFor comparison, there are three other commercial fonts that have a strong stylistic resemblance to Spumoni (none of them match the samples):   \n [Elroy](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125540/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=SD10101) by Christian Schwartz;   \n [Heatwave](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125540/http:/www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm?sku=PN10131) by Panache Graphics;   \nand Sniff by Joan Barjau of Type-O-Tones (sample follows). Sniff has the most 'embellishment', but has the same sort of casual feel that I get from Spumoni.   \n   \nThe Nick Curtis font is all caps and is based (apparently) on Goudy Stout, which it resembles, with added bounce.   \n   \n ![Sniff sample](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125540im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42310.gif)\n\n"

Is there perhaps another Spumoni knockoff floating around somewhere?   \n   \nHere's the full cover, BTW.   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125540im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/42336.jpg)\n\n"

According to [Luc's free fonts page](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518125540/http:/cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/originalfonts.html), Bright Ideas fonts came bundled with a magazine.
