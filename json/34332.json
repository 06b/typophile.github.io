  "content": "I’m using Centaur as body text in a brochure. Client likes Centaur but hates the “1” glyph. (Says it looks too much like a capital “I”.) Could anyone suggest a typeface that’s similar enough to Centaur that I could just swap out the 1s...? Or if that sounds unlikely, any recommendations for something Centaur-like to switch to entirely? Thanks in advance.\n\n [‹ Sans companion for Galliard?](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905042801/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34318 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Japanese display fonts ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905042801/http:/www.typophile.com/node/34334 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
