  "content": "Hey there, I've been searching for sans and serif pairs for a while now.  \nI give great thanks to Crossgrove, hrant and anyone else I may have missed for all the help. You've been great.\n\nSo now, I'd really like to find a sans to pair with Adobe Garamond.\n\nor...\n\nIf anyone knows of a serif similar to Adobe Garamond that might pair well with Futura or Akzidenz Grotesk...by all means, please let me know.\n\nI feel as though I'm making a Christmas Wish-List. Ok, for all who may lend a hand, godspeed...  \nsee you later,  \nJaz\n\nThe samples below are Futura and Adobe Garamond.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224074723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/01f7badabd4122af48f05d481649b0d1_4649.png)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224074723im_/http:/typophile.com/files/adobe-garamond_5243.gif)\n\n",

Something about the simplicity and hardness of Galliard and the proportions of Futura keep them in harmony.\n\nBut if you really want Adobe Garamond, which is much softer, you could look at Cronos, or one of OurType's sans designs might be right: Eva (new), Fresco Sans or Versa Sans.\n\n"

And two of them that has worked the best for me, believe it or not, are Scala and Quadraat Sans.\n\nFor a less common alternative, try Fontfarm's [Kofired](http://web.archive.org/web/20130224074723/http:/fontfarm.de/themes/fonts/kofired/index.php) or John Sans.\n\nFor an alternative to Futura, try an architectural sans (how do we come up with such term anyway?) like Verlag or Neutraface.\n\n"

Combining it with the Bauhaus style of Futura does not make sense for me.\n\nIf Futura with an antiqua, I'ld look for e.g. Memphis, Beton or a Monotype Rockwell.\n\nGeorg\n\n"

Ok, well, here's what I've chosen to do ( I may be breaking rules here, well I most definitely am at the looks of the posts here) I have chosen to use ITC Garamond and Futura.  \nSomeone suggested to me yesterday (Avant Garde to go with ITC G.)\n\nSince they are both geometric sans, Avant G. and Futura that is, (excuse my limited typographic vocab is somewhat limited) I thought Futura could work as well. They seem to fit together quite nicely for my purposes (and time constraints).\n\nWell, I hope I do not disappoint anyone. I've got to do my own thing I guess, but this info you've given me is also priceless, and thank you for the support; again priceless, thank you very much,  \nJaz\n\n"
