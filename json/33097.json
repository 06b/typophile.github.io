  "content": "Can any of you type geeks give me an example, or several examples, of a _good_ type superfamily with the primary design serif (better Old-Style) and the companion design slab-serif. I only know of two such superfamilies: Erik Spiekermann’s and Christian Schwartz’s [DB Serif / DB News](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103957/http:/christianschwartz.com/dbnews.shtml), or Jean-François Porchez’s [Le Monde Livre](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103957/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeLivre) / [Le Monde Courrier](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103957/http:/www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/LeMondeCourrier). I know there are more styles to either family, but I am primarily interested in the serif/slab-serif relationship. I suspect there should be more similar designs out there. Thank you in advance.\n\n [‹ Nick in the Toronto Star](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103957/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33062 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [+&-=X Exhibition ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080408103957/http:/www.typophile.com/node/33101 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
