The closest I could find to this one was [Monolith Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20090615052256/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/abctypes/monolith-sans/) from ABCtypes.\n\nAnother idea is [Y2k Neophyte](http://web.archive.org/web/20090615052256/http:/www.dafont.com/y2k-neophyte.font) if you flip the m for your w.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
