Those of you who produce OpenType fonts: how do you inform users about the available glyph substitutions?   \n   \nIs there a utility that will list and illustrate the substitutions that occur when the user chooses \"contextual alternates,\" \"stylistic alternates,\" etc.?   \n   \n-- Eric\n\n",

The test files contain samples of regular text to which users can apply the relevant features and see the results, and there are specific instructions for how to apply each feature.   \n   \nDavid Perry\n\n"
