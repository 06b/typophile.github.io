Samples here:  \n [http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091419/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic \"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GriffithGothic\")\n\nThis is a history book “for dummies”, on the history of Israel, with a slightly more sophisticated bent than the actual “for dummies” book series. The application might carry over onto a companion website.\n\nThanks for your input\n\n/\\/\\  \nMeir Deutsch\n\n [‹ Grid systems](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091419/http:/www.typophile.com/node/7401 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Creating design briefs ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081006091419/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37084 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
