I believe the engraving reduces the amount of contrast between the main title and sub-title. He suggested Trajan which I may accept as we are far behind schedule to get this out the door but I would like your opinion. For reference here are the typefaces I just mentioned.\n\n[http://planetlag.com/files/typo\\_goudy.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20110812182700/http:/planetlag.com/files/typo_goudy.png \"http://planetlag.com/files/typo\\_goudy.png\")  \n [http://planetlag.com/files/typo\\_castellar.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20110812182700/http:/planetlag.com/files/typo_castellar.png \"http://planetlag.com/files/typo\\_castellar.png\")  \n [http://planetlag.com/files/typo\\_trajan.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20110812182700/http:/planetlag.com/files/typo_trajan.png \"http://planetlag.com/files/typo\\_trajan.png\")\n\nYou have to excuse my lack of refined typographical knowledge. I'm new and my typography instructor back in school was rubbish.\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Vince, It's quite difficult to make a suggestion because I don't know the context you're using the typeface in - are you typesetting a book, magazine or what exactly?... my gut reaction would be to avoid pairing it with the serifs you mentioned, especially Castellar with it's 'engraved' appearance - because it looks visually very similar and would fight with your blackletter. I'd be tempted to look at pairing it with a sans-serif such as Akzidenz Grotesk, because of the immediate visual difference between the two.\n\nIt might be a good idea not to overthink this and just see what works on paper - print out different sample pages so you can compare them - pinned up next to each other on the wall, table or whatever. Try a sans like I suggested. Try various serifs - I think when you see everything together on paper, you'll be able to see at a glance what works and what doesn't - and so will your boss.\n\nI'm afraid I've never used blackletter faces on any of my own projects, so I can't recommend a pairing straight off, I'm afraid; I don't actually mind the blackletter typeface, I've had my opinion changed many times when I've seen a typeface that I personally didn't like used really well!\n\nHope this helps.\n\nSi\n\n"
