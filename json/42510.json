      "content": "This is a logo for an expansion program for a church. The underlying message is the power of \"one\" or unity. Bringing a bunch of people together to accomplish a common goal or make an impact on:\n\nIndividuals who impact  \nFamilies who impact  \nCommunities who impact  \nCulture ... etc\n\nSub-text is: The power of one ... Life ... Family ... Culture ... etc\n\nThe mark is derived from a glass tower that stands in the courtyard of the property. The courtyard is kind of a central meeting place (tables, chairs, etc.) so we thought it would serve as a nice inspiration for the mark.\n\nI chose Dax as the typeface as I felt it had a calm, inviting feel to it's shapes. Not a huge fan of the \"c\" and I had to merge the \"I\" and a \"1\" for the first letter as well as elongate the \"p\" to allow for better framing.\n\nThoughts?\n\n"
