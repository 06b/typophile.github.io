  "content": "I'm currently designing a logo for a solar car racing team. The mark is pretty much solidified at this point, but I'm looking for type to complement it. Attached is the b/w version (since the colours aren't finalized yet).\n\nI suggested Proxima Nova for the type, but the client said it was \"too blocky\". Their old logo used Eras Bold, and they want something \"like that\". So the requirements are:\n\n-Italic  \n-Shapes that complement the sun's rays from the image  \n-Not \"too blocky\"  \n-Budget-conscious\n\nThanks a bunch in advance,\n\n- Lex\n\n<cite>EDIT: I removed the images because I'm paranoid about people stealing my ideas :P<cite></cite></cite>\n\n",

I like Cocon, but its letterforms are a bit too... techno, if that makes sense.\n\nAlso (I should have mentioned this) the client really likes my logo for [Moncur Groundwater](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415090223/http:/apartment32.com/portfolio/portfolio03.html) because it looks \"clean\" and \"fresh\". So, I'm guessing they want something in a humanist face, and not too dark.\n\nThanks for the help, and keep the suggestions coming.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
