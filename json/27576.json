  "content": "I am currently updating the look of the Columbia Chronicle, my school's newspaper. It's not the most beautiful newspaper but I would like to improve the look a bit. I would like to see what anyone has as far as type suggestions, for the header especially.\n\nAt the moment Trajan is used for the Nameplate as well as the head of each section. We use Times New Roman and Franklin gothic for the content. So far I have tried a few different things but none I have been happy with, the closest I have been was to set it in Times bold. Do the section heads warrant bringing a new typeface into the mix, or should I just stick to the the three we are using?\n\nbelow is the current look and a quick re-design.\n\nThanks,\n\nJoshua\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [citybeat.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125007/http:/typophile.com/files/citybeat.pdf) | 80.8 KB |\n| [recitybeat.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131022125007/http:/typophile.com/files/recitybeat.pdf) | 75.8 KB |\n\n",
