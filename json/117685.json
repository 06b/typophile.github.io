I've tried identifont and whatthefont with no success.\n\nThe closest I've found is Coptek regular, but that is a lot more blocky.\n\nAny help would be appreciated, even finding something that's really close but not perfect.\n\nThank you!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140829001915im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Logo_5934.jpg)\n\n",
