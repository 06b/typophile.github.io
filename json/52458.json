Anybody have any inside info on who \"Stephani Mercatoris\" could be? He seems to be credited with having either designed or set the type I can't tell which just yet. I am looking forward to showing it to James Mosley.\n\nThe University of Scranton has this to say about it:\n\nIoannis Maldonati Societatis Iesu Theologi : Commentarii in Qvatvor Evangelistas, 1596 is a first edition of an important commentary on the Vulgate Gospels. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, Maldonado was \"superior to most exegetes of his time and inferior to none.\"\n\n",

According to a library record for what I think is the same edition, this Mercator's printing shop is listed as the publisher, at Pont-à-Mousson in Lorraine.\n\n"
