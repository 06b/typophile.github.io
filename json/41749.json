Plus I’m wondering, if it’s an expensive font, if you guys know of any similar ones that are free.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\n [‹ Titling font ID please](http://web.archive.org/web/20080210013742/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41704 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Firefly logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080210013742/http:/www.typophile.com/node/41711 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
