I do understand that this cover predates computer-based design, but I'm curious if someone else has developed a font simiar to this, or seeing if someone used it as a basis for one. I did discover that the \"powered by\" lettering looks to be a heavily slanted Haettenschweiler font. The \"Ford\" lettering is stumping me a bit, but with all the published fonts out there, I'm only looking for one that is close.\n\n"
