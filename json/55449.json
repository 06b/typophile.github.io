I believe he is offering to license you a Windows version of Gadget (known inside Font Bureau as Zenobia). So, if you're serious about wanting/needing a Windows version, you should e-mail him directly.\n\nExcept . . . the Contact feature on his profile page doesn't seem to be enabled, and he hasn't given his e-mail address. I won't presume to do so for him. So I suggest you contact \\< [info@fontbureau.com](mailto:info@fontbureau.com) \\> and reference this thread, if you decide to pursue this further.\n\nHTH\n\n"

Where it gets hazy is when people ask for recommendations for a particular style. In that case I feel it's still appropriate but you may want to make it clear that you designed the font and/or have a relationship with the seller of such a font. And it might be nice to add alternatives to your own just to be \"fair\". That's my 2 cents in regards to David's marketing question.\n\n"
