  "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just wanted to promote my brand new type portfolio: DIEU ET MON DROIT.\n\nIt's gathering some fonts that I've drawn, redrawn, customized or tweaked. You might have seen them in a magazine or a corporate identity and wondered what the hell was the font!? Otherwise, you'll discover my creations and feel free to leave your feedback down there.\n\nURL: [www.dieuetmondroit.co.cc](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819155754/http:/www.dieuetmondroit.co.cc/ \"www.dieuetmondroit.co.cc\")\n\nEnjoy your visit!\n\n",

      "content": "Hi,\n\nJust why do you present the type samples on a grey background? And why against math paper simulation? It difficults the visualization on those thin type strokes.. But I'm just giving my opinion. No grid, grey background optional... I would use white to be honest.  \n Good work :)\n\n"
