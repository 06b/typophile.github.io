  "content": "Some would say space before and after a paragraph is a \"you say tomato, I say tomato\" kind of thing.\n\nI run into situations where we have added space before and space after that accumulates and gets very confusing especially when one is designing a template of a complex document.\n\nBullets and numbered bullets are the worst.\n\nGenerally speaking is there a \"proper use\" for before spacing and for after spacing? I imagine if only one was needed, only one would have been provided.\n\nJW\n\n",

      "content": "One important use of paired space before and after is to maintain perfecting text in running texts which include headings and sub-headings as it allows even fractional line spacings to be matched so that the first line of the subsequent paragraph falls perfectly on the standard text grid.\n\nYou might for instance drop 5 lines of standard text for an A heading - use two of the line spaces for the enlarged heading itself with two and half lines of space above and half a line below to ensure that the main text restarts on the grid and the pages of running text continue to perfect.\n\nMaintaining perfecting of running text with a variety of inserted materials and absolute control of proportions of space around elements would seem to me to be the primary practical justification for this feature.\n\n"

      "content": "I typically use space before because that is how I was trained in the days of minicomputer typesetting so that's how my mind continues to work. However one does it, today it is very important to maintain consistency of use because different apps may treat before and after differently. That could really mess up a job if for some reason the job was moved between apps and there was a mixture of the two ways in the job.\n\n"
