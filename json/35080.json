It is a digitization of an old Art Nouveau era script typeface, so the time period is a good match for Carpenter.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"

The drawback of these two is that they are more casual than Carpenter. If you want to maintain a more formal feeling, have a look at [Voluta Script](http://web.archive.org/web/20141201200949/http:/www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/voluta_script_pro_ot/).\n\n"
