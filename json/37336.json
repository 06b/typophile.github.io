It seems this is not avaliable for purchase- Im wondering if there is something similar avaliable?\n\nThanks so much for your help!\n\nBest from New Zealand!\n\nCheers\n\n [‹ Wanama logo slab serif / typewritter font](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016160434/http:/typophile.com/node/38041 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Federal Gov't letterhead/envelopes 1980 vintage ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071016160434/http:/typophile.com/node/37936 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
