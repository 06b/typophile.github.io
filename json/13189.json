  "content": "Happpy Fathers Day to those it applies to.\n\nNeeding help with another. I have something similar but I have no idea where I got it. Its called Village Square, but if I search for it I cant find its family. If you have any ideas and can steer me to the correct family, I’d appreciate it. What I have is regular and I really need bold... or ideas on what the actual font is.\n\nUsually I can find a font family with no troubles. If I aquired something down the line that isnt legit I’d like to know so I can pitch it.\n\nThanks\n\nJill\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [OneKicksFont.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122726/http:/typophile.com/files/OneKicksFont.jpg) | 89.48 KB |\n\n [‹ (x) Nutrition facts on food product labels - (generally) Helvetica {Lex}](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122726/http:/www.typophile.com/node/12618 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [(x) CB2 Clock - Cholla {Yves} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071215122726/http:/www.typophile.com/node/13178 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
