At the risk of sounding somewhat Seinfeldish, what’s up with that?\n\n [‹ InMath vs MathMagic vs MathType](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201213559/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21155 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [pencil drawings in illustrator? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071201213559/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20954 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
