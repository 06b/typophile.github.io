For example, the baselines of the 'A' and 'r' are at different angles. Do graphic designers hang in hell for these kinds of problems?\n\nI'm open to any other comments regarding colors/layout/whatever.  \nKeep in mind this poster is far from done... yes, I'm well aware of the major kerning issues :)\n\nFWIW, the instructor and other students seem to like the \"curved\" version, but since it's not a type class they may not know any better.\n\nPDF, if you want a closer look: [http://udesign.org/poster/aawposter.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20100528184048/http:/udesign.org/poster/aawposter.pdf \"http://udesign.org/poster/aawposter.pdf\")\n\n",

Sometimes type on a curve can be an elegant solution for spice to an otherwise bland design. On the other hand, sometimes it is just one more spice which isn't needed. It is about moderation.\n\n"
