I designed my typeface by modifying a few san-serif typefaces. Also, I am trying to incorporate pensil sketch with vector to create this typeface. I experimented with two different colors, yellow and light brown.\n\nChriswong\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020085515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/u_5339.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020085515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/u1_4587.jpg)\n\n",

For experimental purposes or for reference to learn something out of it, fine, but if you are going to create your own typeface, create it from scratch. That's when you really learn a lot and become a better type designer from that. Also, it gives your face something that is a necessity: _originality_.\n\n"

I am trying to give more originality to my design now. The attached sketch is my original initial idea. Anyway thanks again for all the comments.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131020085515im_/http:/typophile.com/files/h_6364.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "The thing that seems to stand out that could use some tweaking is the scribbled lines that are part of curves, like in the C, D and G. I wish they would follow the curve better, they seem a little stiff, especially for scribbles. I might also suggest instead of the scribbling, you try hatchmarks and cross-hatchmarks, something a little more refined and consistent.\n\nI agree with Stephen; tis a fine poster.\n\n"
