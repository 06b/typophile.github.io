  "content": "This font has been bugging me since I first saw the new HP ads. It feels very Tim Burtonesque, but after looking at the cover of \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" that definitely isn't the font. It may have been specially created for the campaign, but I really doubt it. Identifont gave a few comparable fonts, but nothing really close and What the Font didn't really help either. Any ideas?  \nI zoomed in on the flash to grab this screenshot from:  \nhttp://www.hp.com/personalagain/us/en/index.html\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124153848im_/http:/typophile.com/files/hp-personalagain_4968.gif)\n\n",

Since the personal systems group is all I come up with when searching for PSG within HPs website, I'm guessing you're right about it being custom face. I like it when novelty fonts are readable and this one certainly is more streamlined than the 3 you posted...although who could resist a font with a name like \"Uncle Stinky\"? Thanks Spire.\n\n"

[Jester](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124153848/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/drewfonts/jester/) from Drewfonts is kinda goofy, and [MVB Hotsy Totsy](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124153848/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mvb-hotsy-totsy/) is wacky but clear.\n\nThere are others from Bitstream and House, but some are seen rather often, Like House's Randumhouse.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
