So, you could call me a conservative poster.\n\nRecently a posting of mine went into the ether (due to the website upgrade) and I felt a little like I had wasted my time. The dialogue is often sparkling, the topics often worthy and challenging, but overall I think I feel the need to moderate my participation in order to keep other things moving along. I have an easy time being distracted anyway.\n\nThe moderators could consider requiring registration in order to read. Not a bad way to encourage participation, or at least transparency.

But I realize now that I guess I don't really know the difference between a registered user and a \"guest\"... I thought a guest is somebody who has never registered, but that can't be it, since you've been registered for almost two years. So I guess a guest is anybody who simply hasn't logged in - and maybe that depends on the given browser (and browser settings), as well as on the habits of the individual. Like on my end (Firefox on Win-XP) I have to manually log out, otherwise I'm transparently logged in whenever I visit the site (even after a cold boot\\*). So I guess those numbers don't mean much - they certainly don't indicate of how many of the lurkers are registered.\n\n\\* Do people still use that term? :-/\n\n\\> The moderators could consider requiring registration in order to read.\n\nI think it's hard to predict if that would help or hinder things.

Because I'm not a type designer I don't have anything to say in a lot of threads but that doesn't mean I don't learn from them…  \nFor example, I recently was reading the threads on Blackletter and it's condemnation due to the connection to a certain period of German history. There was a comment about how the Nazis made everything in their society into an ideological symbol, including fonts. It started me thinking about Political Correctness (here in California it's abundant) and the similarity between the two ways of thought. We have a \"feminist\" neighbor who doesn't cook. Unfortunately she needs to turn that into a political statement. She doesn't clean house or garden she \"does all the interior and exterior work\". She's basically a frustrated housewife who has become an idealogue as a defense mechanism.

On the opposite end of the collaborative spectrum, if you watch Emeril, there's very little collaboration going on.. maybe between him and one other chef. Let's call these participants. The rest of the audience doesn't contribute much or at all (especially those out in TV-land), so let's call them spectators. I think the assumption behind the concern over the ratio between participants to spectators (whew! could i have used any more prepositions?) is that the discussion could be so much more interesting and enlightening if we heard more perspectives and opinions from people who are obviouly interested in issues typographic. Spectators on typophile most likely view it as a wonderful resource (or why would they be \"lurking\" here).

To contribute my two cents — as someone with very little experience —&nbsp;I would bet that the biggest factors to the \"users to guests\" ratios are most guests are casual viewers, language is somewhat of a barrier, and they don't feel they have the experience or insight to make a worthy contribution.\n\nI started hanging out at Typophile a year and a half ago, but didn't register for 3 or 4 months. After that I don't think I posted for another 6 or 9 months. I have learned so much from here and all these discussions have inspired me and changed the course of my life. I was interested in typography and type design before Typophile, but it was here that added the gasoline to the fire... I can actually credit/blame these forums for getting me to change my career and state I live in (possibly the country, in not so distant future).\n\nHowever, one of the most exceptional things I have gotten from Typophile is the realization of how incredibly stupid, ignorant is probably more appropriate, I am regarding type design. It is such an immense field with it's history, technology, science, etc. As with any field, the key players in the type world are geniuses with so much knowledge and experience behind them. Several of those people frequent Typophile, so while that is incredible for discussion and learning, it is intimidating to jump in and find something to add yourself.\n\nThis is one other reason I don't post often: personally, I don't edit well, I say too much at times... long winded... better listener than speaker.\n\nHail Typophile.\n\nr.k\n\n\\* for mac users at least\n\n"

There is not too much psittacine shrieking, but most threads produce some discussion. I would certainly encourage everyone who wants to do so to participate actively, but I would trust people's judgment.\n\nBesides, on usenet (which the forums, in effect, are) it has always been thought good practice to lurk for a fair while, in order to avoid asking silly questions, spot the trolls (happily absent here), avoid inadvertently starting a flame war ... etc. That's still good sense.\n\nNow, as a new member, I've read somewhere about this thing called a bouma, which is obviously rubbish anyway, but what I really want to know is: where can I get a great free ;-) version of some font I saw called Wittman or something that will go great with Arial and Comic Sans for this book I'm about to publish called \"Fraktur: The Nazi Type\" ...\n\nLurking has its point.\n\n"

It can mean, e.g., to simply get a short glimpse of the discussions going on here, which is nice and fast and can be accomplished in a few minutes (and, when getting hooked, which is very likely to happen, for lots of more time).\n\n\"Lurking\" here, for me, is like reading a book (where, at least until now, I don't have to log in), but with extended possibilities, which means I can participate in a discussion directly, if I wish, which is great, takes considerably more time (writing, consulting the dictionary now and then, sometimes rewriting) and if I have that much time at the given moment to do this, I'd log in.\n\nGenerally, I can't see what could be negative about giving people lots of time for just reading and happily broadening one's knowledge which might lead to, hopefully, better thought-out postings? Posting, I think, is a question of temper. Some people join in after 2 seconds, some others after 2 years of \"lurking\" to contribute something interesting.

I find it is a very satisfying hobby, though it can be rather too absorbing. One design is a monospaced bitmap at 24 pixels, for use on my X console when using a high resolution. The current project is a humanist sans-serif designed for general text; e.g. reports, parts lists, and other documents I produce as an engineer. I currently use a sensible serif face for this, e.g. Century Schoolbook.\n\nPerhaps there are alot of other font-tweakers out there who visit these forums just out of interest, but do not feel the need to post.\n\n"
