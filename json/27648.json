I think it was produced by Hoefler & Frere Jones, but seemingly no longer available ( [http://typophile.com/node/13735](http://web.archive.org/web/20081102221822/http:/typophile.com/node/13735 \"http://typophile.com/node/13735\")).\n\nAlso the old Grotesque Condensed No.77 (Monotype, Stephenson Blake) which, like the Agency Gothic, has a high square bowl on the ’R’ and a stepped (almost horizontal) spine on the ’S’. Also (like Agency) it has an ’M’ in which the centre strokes descend to the baseline – which is unlike your example from Prague. However it may not be available as a digital face.\n\nI think Neville Brody’s [Industria](http://web.archive.org/web/20081102221822/http:/www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=LH.108002.0.0) does the same thing with the stepped midsection of the ’S’ and it does have a high centrepoint in the ’M’.\n\nStephen - while you’re mentioning Bee, do you know what is the relation between URW Bee and Binder Style (which might have been by Joseph Binder 1959 for D Stempel AG)?\n\nI thought they were the same face... but I could be wrooong : 0\n\n"

I should have twigged that connection the moment Stephen posted ’Herald Gothic’.\n\nBTW, I should have been referring to a Josef Binder in my earlier post - and I’m pretty sure that there’s a version of URW Bee going by the name of Gallileo.

The URW Bee fonts correspond to VGC’s B-1, B-2, B-3 and B-4. There were heavier weights up through, I think, B-11. I know of no digital version of the heavier weights.\n\nThese VGC types were themselves copies of someone else’s type (I wish I knew what foundry) - which had ’G’ names like, respectively, Galaxy, Gable, Garfield, and Gamma (and so on for heavier weights).\n\nNote that these are NOT the same as Binder Style/Binderstile. Just take a look at the “corners” of any rounded character and you’ll see that Binderstile is considerably more squared off.\n\n"

As far as similarity to the street signage goes, Binderstile would be closer and is available digitally in two weights both from [Castcraft/Opti](http://web.archive.org/web/20081102221822/http:/www.castcraft-software.com/homepage.html) (I’m told) and from QBF as the old Brendel fonts Report Light and [Report Bold](http://web.archive.org/web/20081102221822/http:/www.qbf.de/cart/cart.exe?gif=dc.gif/Sdc02529.gif). As you can sort of make out from the crappy showing, Binderstile still has lots of differences, including that R and an M that is, like all the other fonts mentioned, nowhere close.\n\nThe only thing I find in predigital catalogs that was quite close to the signage (based though on a very limited showing - but that R is there) is something called Enge Wotan - and I know of no digital version. Anyone have a decent showing?\n\n"

In that the street signs are all caps, this might work for Thomas.\n\nMy reference (Jaspert’s Encyclopedia of Typefaces 1958) for Wotan Bold Condensed (and perhaps _not_ the same as Enge Wotan) shows a face that is similar to the ’R’ only; the ’A’ and the ’M’ are quite different to the Prague street signage.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081102221822im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Wotan_ref_4824.jpg)\n\n"
