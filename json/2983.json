When the Illustrator eps of the Fortune logo was opened in Photoshop the bottoms of the \"O\" and \"U\" were cut off. It is interesting to see that the same thing happened [here](%20http://www.carnase.com/flash.html), (look in the portfolio section) to the man who designed the logo.   \n   \n(OK, is there a way to link to the Fortune page? That url is the same as the home page.)\n\n"

I manually typed in a space and the url and after a very short time the space disappeared and the site came up. I will be more careful the next time around. BTW, I wondered what that little letter icon was for. Thanks.\n\n"
