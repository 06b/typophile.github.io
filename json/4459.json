  "content": "Hi all,   \n   \nThere was a previous thread posted on this forum in February ( [http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27380.html?1078774045](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122245/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/27380.html?1078774045))   \n regarding the typefaces used in Kill Bill.   \n   \nWhat I am particularly interested in is the typeface used for the end credits of the \\*second\\* movie.   \n   \nJustin Callaghan identified the type \"Busorama\" as one used in the film, and indeed it is very similar to the one I am looking for. However, there are distinct differences between Busorama and the actual type used in the film - note for example the serifs at the top of the \"A\" characters!   \n   \nCan anyone shed some light on this for me?   \n   \nMuch appreciated,   \n   \n ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122245im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif) Adam\n\n [‹ &#39;Tabak&#39; &#40; Tobacco sign &#41;..](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122245/http:/typophile.com/node/4466 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [&#40;x&#41; Real Estate Investing and - Harrington/Hermosa {Mark S, Mike Y} ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070908122245/http:/typophile.com/node/4373 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
