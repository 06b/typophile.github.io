There HAS to be some typeface based off of the Leroy set. I have a broken set laying around my house, I’ve always wanted to use it.\n\nIt leaves a little to be imagined. For those who haven’t seen one of these, when you scribe these letters, the “reverse italic” look is corrected with the tool (this isn’t my set):\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007003704im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/3245-15L_04_3879.JPG)\n\n"

I suppose that the “Leroy set” or the “standard draftsman’s hand lettering” that you mentioned aren’t digital vectorised fonts that i could use.. I don’t seem to know a lot about these font issues anyway :) Thanks all again for your help.\n\nolho: I have a CPC 464 too. Lots of dust and scratches but I never thought to dump it :)\n\n"
