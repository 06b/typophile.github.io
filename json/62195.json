Or was it perhaps issued by [Lanston](http://web.archive.org/web/20100201123137/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Lanston%2520Monotype)?\n\n(Pfeh, if I had unpacked my copy of McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\" since the move, I could figure this out in a jiffy, but I can't find it right now.)\n\nT\n\n",
