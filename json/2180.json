It's making he space inside the U sort of swell the area it is taking up. It's such an oddball I want to read it as an icon rather than a letterform, but no visual references come to mind.   \n   \nIs the U saying something different than the other letters? If not, i'd go ahead and straighten the sides...or bring some of the characteristics of the U you have into the D maybe (might set up some nice rhythm).   \n   \nWhat's the connection you're working at between the logo you have and the nightclub? Just wondering   \n   \n-JT\n\n"

What do you think, should the top whitespace of the s be like 60% and the bottom whitespace of the s be like %40? Or is more of a 55/45 ratio?   \n   \nJT,   \nI styled the S after the U and thought I had the D close enough to make it relavent to the other letters, but perhaps the D should not flatten out like it is....I will look into what you are suggesting.   \n   \nThe U is styled after a glass, a thick bottem tumblers glass that the club will incoorporate into it's glassware. The U will also be used as part of an icon set. But the U will have an olive or a straw or some icecubes in it.   \n   \nI had the same feeling about the counterform of the U as well, but I think if I straighten up those curves this logotype will loose much of it's character.   \n   \nThanks for your thoughts, fellas. Would like to hear back from you now that you have some more info.   \n   \nHere's a bigger version:   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20051110033828im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21137.gif)\n\n"

Rather than morphing the \"U\" into the other letters I would go the opposite direction. The \"U\" has the most character of all the letters, so why not let it set the trend. Do as JT suggested and as I have so poorly illustrated�mold the \"D\" to follow suit.   \n   \nI am seeng the same spacing in the crossbars as Randy, so I flipped the \"E\"s and rotated the \"S\" 180 degrees. I'm not sure how you're measuring them, but there seems to be a pretty clear distinction between the flipped/rotated letter forms and the originals. Also, I wonder if the crossbar on the \"E\"s is long enough. Like I said, I have limited time, so I couldn't try that one.   \n   \nI started to mess with the kerning also, but it still needs a little more caressing. I hope this helps with some further exploration.   \n   \nAloha!   \nScott\n\n"

For this purpose, I don't know that it is necessary to duplicate that element of the other letter forms.   \n   \nHave you tried applying Loren's suggestions and adding some sort of liquid to the \"U\". I believe you also mentioned previously that you would be adding \"�an olive or straw or some ice cubes�\" If you've illustrated any of these treatments, it may be helpful for this critique to see some of it.   \n   \nIt's looking great!
