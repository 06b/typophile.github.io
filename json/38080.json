  "content": "So my friend has a joke band called Ded Bundee, and he asked me to do an album cover for him. He has the aim of making his band appear mysterious and enigmatic, although the songs are less that than silly songs about robots. And they wear fake mullets.\n\nSo anyway, here are two ideas I came up with. Let me know what you think. Do they appear mysterious and enigmatic enough. And how would YOU make something appear so?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074522im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ded-bundee-web_4601.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018074522im_/http:/typophile.com/files/ded-bundee-2-web_4429.jpg)\n\n",

Basic color, small or no text.\n\nAfter the Beatles and Metallica, is there room for another plain colored album with nothing on it? Thinking about it, Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here was hidden by a brown paper slip case on top of the artwork with the burning man. Some people to this day don't know what the cover looks like. THAT's mysterious.\n\n"
