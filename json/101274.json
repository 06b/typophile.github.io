  "content": "Just finished a redesign of Pixilate, my small foundry with mostly handwritten/handdrawn fonts. It is now mobile and tablet friendly and uses a friendlier system for purchases. I also released [Bellota](http://web.archive.org/web/20150415034643/http:/www.pixilate.com/font/bellota/), an open source (OFL) display sans.\n\nFeedback is welcome on both site & fonts. :)\n\n",
