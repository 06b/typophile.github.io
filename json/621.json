  "content": "I have a friend who has given his old Mac with OS 9.2 on it to his mother. He's trying to track down a Latvian font to put on there so his mother can type letters in Latvian. Since I am lost in the world of foreign encodings, I now turn to the experts. Anyone here have some suggestions to point my buddy in the right direction?\n\n",

      "content": "Latvian can be typed on a Mac using any font with a Mac Central European encoding, which also covers the Baltic languages (note that for Windows there is a separate Baltic codepage). Look online for Mac CE fonts, or check out Linotype, ParaType or any other font retailers with a significant European presence. Adobe and other North American companies also develop and sell some CE fonts.\n\n"
