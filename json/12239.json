That would require explaining the root of the symbol and how the Nazis changed/misused it. By the time I get halfway through that lecture most people have stopped listening.

They don’t know what it’s called, but they describe it as “fancy” and “sophisticated”. I know this is in part because they think ambigrams have to look like the ones in Angels & Demons, but more importantly, I think they see _value_, and therefore _class_, in the decorative appearance of blackletter.\n\nI think this accounts for the rapper usage too. Look at street culture’s “bling” fixation. My guess is that their intention is not so much to choose an “evil-looking” font to look badass, but to choose a “fancy” font to indicate their wealth, just like all the gold chains, Cadillacs, and those flamboyant pimp clothes.\n\n"

Partly from my own experience (with “bouma” and “notan”) my impression is that you can make quite a lot of headway -even all the way into the mainstream- simply by bullishly using a new term (especially if it’s not really totally new) but spending a good deal of time explaining. Here’s what I think would be a typical exchange:\n\nYou: The Nazis ... blah blah blah ... using the Hakenkreuz to ... blah blah blah.  \nLayman: What’s a Hakenkreuz?  \nYou: It’s the Nazi version of the swastika.  \nLayman, version 1: Huh.\n\nLayman, version 2: Why not just call it a swastika?  \nYou version 1: A few reasons. One is that the swastika was actually an ancient symbol for <cite>good</cite> in many cultures, and we should try to clarify the difference. It’s just good terminological practice. (Optional: And we should try to fix every single thing the Nazis ruined.)\n\nLayman, version 1: You’re trying to minimize the Holocaust aren’t you?!  \nYou: NEXT!\n\nLayman, version 2: Huh.  \nYou: Tell you what, let me show you some fraktur type...  \nLayman: Huh?\n\nhhp\n\n"
