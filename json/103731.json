      "content": "Morris Fuller Benton's Othello was released by American Type Founders after the 1934 cataog was issued. The design was popularized in 1967 by the cover of Andy Warhol's The Velvet Underground album. In additions to the two versions mentioned by Ryuk there is an outline version in [24 Outline Display Fonts CD-ROM & Book by Dover/Dan Solo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018211701/http:/web1.doverpublications.com/cgi-bin/toc.pl/0486995038). Somewhat similar [PL Fiorello Condensed](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018211701/http:/www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/pl-fiorello/condensed) by Photolettering. For a similar font decorated with spikes see [Macbeth](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018211701/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/macbeth/fonts/).  \nDon  \nEDIT: Corrected ATF release date which Jaspert stated as 1896.\n\n"
