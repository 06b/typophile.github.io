  "content": "I was trying to use the AFDKO's checkOutlines and AutoHint, but it didn't work because the Python version was 2.5 in MacOSX 10.4. I got an error message that \"This script supports only Python versions 2.3 and 2.4. The current version is 2.5.\"  \nSo I would like to replace ver.2.5 to ver.2.4 or ver.2.3 but I didn't know how should I replace the python program. Or is there any way to solve this problem?\n\n",

You should now have the .profile file opened in pico, and see some lines that look like this:  \n`PATH=${PATH}:\"/Users/your_username/bin/\"`\n\n3. Select those lines, copy them, and close the file (Ctrl+X)\n\n4. Type `pico .bash_profile`\n\n5. Paste the lines copied in step 3\n\n6. Close the file (Ctrl+X), answering \"Y\" to save the changes\n\n7. Close the Terminal window\n\n8. Open a new Terminal window. Typing `tx -h` should now work, as well as all the other AFDKO command line tools\n\nHope this helps.\n\n"
