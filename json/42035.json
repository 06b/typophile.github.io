  "content": "[BluePhoneElite](http://web.archive.org/web/20080821153942/http:/mirasoftware.com/BPE2/) allows you to use your Mac’s speakers and microphones as a “wireless headset” for your cell phone.\n\nI just got mine set up, and it’s pretty cool. I can open a panel and send a txt message without having to use AIM or any other tomfoolery like the keypad on my phone. That means I can copy and paste something from my mac, straight to a txt message. Pretty cool.\n\nMy roommate was annoyed as I was testing the voice capabilities. It’s basically a speakerphone setup. You can initiate and end calls from the program, so you never really have to pick up your phone at all.\n\nI like, I like.\n\n",
