  "content": "I was shopping at the Half Price Books on Ford Parkway in St. Paul on Saturday and saw they had a stack of Sebastian Carter's \"Twentieth Century Type Designers\" in hardcover, New Edition, 1995. I checked Norton's website and it says the book is out-of-print. Amazon has only five copies available. I bought me a copy, but there are more available for you Twin Cities typophiles to snatch up.\n\n",
