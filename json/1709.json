It's interesting the way our cultural memory of the 1950s is changing. Presently, I would say that most people ignore the modernism of the 1950s, and think of it as a very retro, scripty era, or perhaps wonky (that's for you, Tom) and beat-mod, as in the \"Saul Bass\" lettering style (done for him by lettering artists such as Art Goodman). Fontesque is usually described as \"fifties style\", which really pisses me off -- I guess I'll have to wait a while for it to be called \"90s style\".   \n   \n\\>Eurostile looks modern   \n   \nThere is definitely something very space-age and futuristic about the CRT-derived \"supercurve\" (Zapf's term?) that characterizes Novarese's Eurostile -- making it a favorite for data displays and signage in sci-fi movies.   \n   \nSans serif typefaces have been described as \"modern\" since the 1840s, so it's a pretty meaningless term -- particularly when one considers that the Didone class of types is also called \"modern\"!   \n   \nHowever, Richard is right. We should encourage designers to not just fudge things by using typefaces that are merely \"modern\" in appearance, but to specify ones that are actually of the present day.   \n   \nIf not something more hard-core techno, Foundry Monoline or Paralucent should certainly be preferred over Eurostile, which has been used as the corporate style of a gazillion engineering firms over the past 40 years.   \n   \nIf EDF wants to position itself as a conservative, run-of-the-mill engineering company, Eurostile may be a good choice, but this is not the rationale proferred in the style guide.\n\n"

A lazy, cheap designer (and by extension, design profession) ain't worth . What are clients going to pay you for if you add no value to your work, if your typography could be done by anyone with generic software?   \n   \nThe old stuff is not \"perfectly good\". It doesn't express the culture here and now. Or if it does, it's all about a bland, generic, world dominated by corporations that have no use for local idiosyncracies.   \n   \nAs David Jury wrote in Eye, Summer 2001, \"Total, independent control of typography has been dropped in the lap of every graphic designer, yet the same technology sits on desks in every business and commercial organisation. The question will be asked more and more: \"Should I employ a graphic designer, or 'design' it myself?\" Put another way; if the finer points of typography are not addressed, then what will be the difference between a graphic designer and an administratvie assistant, paid perhaps ten times as less for doing the same job just as badly?\"   \n   \nI would say that carefully choosing a contemporary typeface, and working with it (learning how to \"play\" it), is one of those finer points that needs to be addressed.   \n   \nAnd if a UK company accepts Eurostile (Italy, 1960s) for its typestyle, rather than the local, contemporary Paralucent or Foundry Monoline, that's not representing for its own people, that's an insult to the culture of its customers.   \n   \nAnd with bland, generic design such as an ID that's a big off-the-shelf \"e\" + Eurostile, used by a major corporation, hey, the message is clear, Who needs a designer, anybody can do that crap.\n\n"

One that would be far more appropriate in some instances than any other font, and one that, though it is getting on in years, is still quite relevant aesthetically.   \n   \nI look at Foundry Monoline and see a typeface that imitates what Eurostyle was designed for. Paralucent has a unique look to it, but again, to me it looks like an imitation.   \n   \nIf a 50 year old font works for a specific project, use it. Just because it is getting on in years does not mean that it is not still useful. Especially considering that it is impossible to make a font today that does not have a \"feeling\" of a font from yesterday. Consider this Paralucent which says it was inspired by Univers Helvetica, fonts just as old as Monostyle.   \n   \nEurostyle is still a completely valid font despite it's age. Using it does not mean the person who does so is a lazy or cheap designer. And when you consider that that logo is for a large corporation, you should take into account the fact that large corporations work through committee. Chances are the \"designer\" had barely any say in the final decision anyway.\n\n"

It is imported, usually bought from multi-nationals who have driven down the fee that (all but a few) creatives can charge.   \n   \nWalmart-ization.   \n   \nNow you may say, even with generic materials, designers can create work of unique personality.

People (ie the Client) see that what we do is not very special: we choose pictures (they can do that too at gettyone.com), we set type on computers (they do that too), we use old familiar fonts. This kind of work isn't worth much, and will soon be replaced by expensive software operated by low-paid drones.   \n   \nErik Spiekermann commented on the use of DIN for highway signage in South Africa.
