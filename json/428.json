I've just created all the other new weights shown in the sample, including all the new true-cut italics.   \n   \nTF Arrow has been one of the more popular display and display-sized text series of the past several decades. But it never had an italic.   \n   \nAnd so over the years, all kinds of designers, including those who should know better, have taken to skewing the romans (making an 'oblique'; an artificial computer-made skewing) when an 'italic' form of the letter was called for.   \n   \nNot a good solution, although truth be told, the letter skews 'pleasantly'.   \n   \nNow, however, designers that know better have a real choice.   \n   \nA complete pricing schedule is shown below this letter. All these fonts are immediately available.   \n   \nExisting customers of our TF Arrow will notice that because of the sheer number of new weights, we have re-broken our former 5-weight sets into 4-weight sets. This will make it even easier for new customers to buy, and for returning customers to add more TF Arrow weights.   \n   \nAs always, the Treacyfaces commitment to true graphic arts quality lives on, as it has since 1984!   \n   \nThe TF Arrow fonts all ship with fine quality, consistently drawn letterforms, excellent spacing and exquisite, comprehensive kerning.   \n   \nAdd all these new additions to TF Arrow to your font menu now, by purchasing at treacyfaces.com for fast delivery today.   \n   \nOrder toll-free now at 800 800-6805,   \nor online securely at   \n [https://www.treacyfaces.com/orders1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084007/https:/www.treacyfaces.com/orders1.html)   \n   \nThanks very much for your interest in Treacyfaces true graphic arts quality types!   \n   \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*   \n   \nThe new TF Arrow A B C D & E series (20 fonts!)   \nReleased June 18, 2003   \n   \nTreacyfaces, Inc.   \ntreacyfaces.com   \nPhone 800 800-6805   \n   \nYou can easily purchase with your Visa, MasterCard or   \nAmex card, at our quick, 1-page SSL-Secure online order form,   \n [https://www.treacyfaces.com/orders1.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014084007/https:/www.treacyfaces.com/orders1.html)   \n   \nAll prices and volume groups are right in the order form!   \n   \nDelivery to your e-mail address is rapid,   \nusually in 30 minutes.   \n   \nAvailable for Mac or Win, in PS Type 1 or TrueType.   \n(We recommend the PS Type 1 format.)   \n   \nIndividual weights:   \n   \nTF Arrow 0055001 Extralight, US$29.   \nTF Arrow 005501 Light, $29.   \nTF Arrow 00550002 Book, $29.   \nTF Arrow 005502 Medium, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055003 Demi, $29.   \nTF Arrow 005503 Bold, $29.   \nTF Arrow 005504 Extrabold, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055004 Heavy, $29.   \nTF Arrow 005505 Black, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055005 Ultra, $29.   \n   \nTF Arrow 00550011 Extralight Italic, US$29.   \nTF Arrow 0055012 Light Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 005500023 Book Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055024 Medium Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 00550035 Demi Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055036 Bold Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055047 Extrabold Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 00550048 Heavy Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 0055059 Black Italic, $29.   \nTF Arrow 005500510 Ultra Italic, $29.   \n   \nPre-grouped volumes are arranged thus:   \n   \nAll-New 4-weight volume definitions:   \n   \nTF Arrow A 005500111 Weights: 4; US$98.   \nExtralight, Extralight Italic, Bold, Bold Italic   \n   \nTF Arrow B 005500112 Weights: 4; US$98.   \nLight, Light Italic, Extrabold, Extrabold Italic   \n   \nTF Arrow C 005500112 Weights: 4; US$98.   \nBook, Book Italic, Heavy, Heavy Italic   \n   \nTF Arrow D 005500113 Weights: 4; US$98.   \nMedium, Medium Italic, Black, Black Italic   \n   \nTF Arrow E 005500114 Weights: 4; US$98.   \nDemi, Demi Italic, Ultra, Ultra Italic   \n   \n   \nNew 10- and 20-weight Bundles:   \n   \nNew TF Arrow A, B, C, D & E   \n(all 20 fonts); US$343.
