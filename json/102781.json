As always for this kind of font, I'd say it is deeply rooted in \" [Bauhaus](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620200529/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus/)\" (. Many freebies (an endless list actually) share the same backbone ( [Vomzom](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620200529/http:/www.dafont.com/vomzom.font) is one of them). Having a look to [Techno \\> Sci-fi](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620200529/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303), [Techno \\> Various](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620200529/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304) and [Basic \\> Sans serif](http://web.archive.org/web/20130620200529/http:/www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501) sections at DaFont could be helpful to spot either an alternative or a match. Good luck!\n\n"
