  "content": "hello,\n\nwhen i was testing my new font, i discovered a funny phenomenon:  \nthe printing shows some of the glyphs more bold than others, but in fontlab they are all equal.  \nalso at certain sizes it’s certain letters (image: E, M, Q etc), at other sizes it’s other letters that look bold.\n\ni thought maybe the printers just can't handle the amount of curves.\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nbest,  \nmarcus\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019022317im_/http:/typophile.com/files/trouble_5054.gif)\n\n",
