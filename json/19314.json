  "content": "Greetings: I’m looking for type suggestions for a variety of projects. I perform desktop publishing for local Virginia businesses, Clients including a realtor, developer, builder, photographer, equine non-profit, and others. I write/design ads and promos that appear in local papers and weekly publications (newsprint); as well as newsletters; flyers; brochures; and business cards/letterhead.  \nBack in the dinosaur days when we purchased type on floppy disks, I had TONS of Adobe stuff, but found I generally used three or four faces regularly. Now, after a long hiatus from this type of work, my floppy versions are gone, and I’d like to purchase some new type.  \nAs much as I try to “expand” my tastes, I usually choose type with the same characteristics: large x-height and tight letter spacing. Also, I often like condensed versions in headers. Lately, my type of choice has been ITC Century Std, in the past it has been Garamond. I like Utopia, but have never tried it. “Regulars” include Bookman and Palatino, and for sans serif, Helvetica (although I never like the way it looks; I got used to it when I worked for a corp. that used it as their official typeface). As you can see, my choices are all pretty mainstream.  \nThese days, I’m looking to find about half a dozen typefaces that work together in a variety of print materials. I’d like to try something new, fresh, more modern, that will work with/compliment the style I like (and will continue to use, no doubt) and I’d hope to find a sans serif, as well as something more casual. Please, any creative suggestions for a collection of type would be greatly appreciated! I’m hoping you’ll all get me to think outside the box a bit...\n\n [‹ Looking for Typesetter for Volume of Tibetan Poetry](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907163417/http:/typophile.com/node/48803 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Duke University D ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907163417/http:/typophile.com/node/48973 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Perhaps you could send along some further clues of likes and dislikes so that I may make a better suggestion.... As you know I’m an architect, so I prefer, and continue to use, a more relaxed typeface that allows for a little flexibility in interpretation. Feel free to contact me directly at [architeradesign@yahoo.com](mailto:architeradesign@yahoo.com) if you wish. Hans\n\n"

I can tell you that some of the favorites around campus among designers are: Helvetica Neue LT Std —lots of typeface choices and glyphs, Century Gothic, Avenir, a new favorite of mine currently is Hypatia Sans Pro.\n\nJust today, I ordered a copy of Vetren from [http://www.fonteaminternational.com/fonthome.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907163417/http:/www.fonteaminternational.com/fonthome.html \"http://www.fonteaminternational.com/fonthome.html\"). I needed a casual looking sans serif.\n\nFor what it is worth, I often reach back in time and pull out Bodoni, Goudy Old Style, and Weiss for contrast.\n\nHope this is helpful. Let me know if you come across a sans serif that you are particulary attracted to. I recently worked on an annual report for a marine related hardware corporation and set body copy in Apollo MT. It worked out great—at least I was pleased with the result. Good luck.\n\nSam\n\n"
