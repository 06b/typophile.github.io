  "content": "Hey!  \nI need some help with a poster I’m doing at typography, uni. I’m supposed to create a poster from 1920’s about a Jazz/Charleston dance festival. It’s about making people of today getting involved and passionated.\n\nSo I’m looking for a good font that might be from that era or maybe inspired from it. Also if anyone’s good with coming up with names, I would be very pleased with name suggestions of this festival.\n\nThanks!!\n\n/Anna Maria\n\n [‹ constructing tangent in Illustrator (geometric glyphs)](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704192904/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45417 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Building Signage to \"Match\" with Historical Lettering ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080704192904/http:/www.typophile.com/node/45293 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
