He was one of design's first critical voices. One of his common critiques was that type foundries were not making type that was appropriate enough. He disliked European moderns, like [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Futura), [Kabel](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Kabel), and [Erbar](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Erbar). [Mergenthaler Linotype](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Mergenthaler%20Linotype) charged him to do better, and he did, creating [Metro](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Metro), his first typeface.\n\nHe would go on to work with [Chauncey H. Griffith](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Chauncey%20H.%20Griffith) at Mergenthaler Linotype to create [Electra](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Electra) and [Caledonia](http://web.archive.org/web/20150318051854/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Caledonia), as well as several other designs that unfortunately were not published.\n\nTypefaces designed by William Addison Dwiggins, including his experiments.
