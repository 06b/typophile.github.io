[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-sans-n/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181519/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-sans-n/ \"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-sans-n/\")\n\nThe description says \"ne0-grotesque\" but to me it feels a lot like Frutiger of Myriad, except for a few characters like the 'y.' A few of the terminals are almost vertical, but most end at a bit of an angle, especially in the heavier weights.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317181519im_/http:/typophile.com/files/temp_3548.jpg)\n\n",
