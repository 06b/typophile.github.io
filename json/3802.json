      "content": "I remember the \"Expresiv Fonts\" collections from the mid-90s. They were at least two, and perhaps three or more, all of pretty poor quality as I recall (and certainly this one bears that out). I have a vague recollection of examining them for a project I was considering in late 1994 or early 1995 involving cataloging knockoffs. (Which I abandoned for several reasons, including that such information could be used for evil as well as good.)\n\nA little checking shows that FontChameleon 1.0 was getting reviewed in May 1994, so dates seem about right. However, in the sample shown above, the lack of overshoot, the exaggerated serif length, the serif shapes, and the \"jiggly\" tops of certain letters are all inconsistent with the results of using FontChameleon in the process of creating the font. Remember, FontChameleon would blend \\*all\\* the features at the elemental/particulate level, not just take some features from each of the two fonts. This is much more like the latter approach.\n\nSome of the features could have been done by taking something output from FontChameleon and then doing lots of editing... but you wouldn't likely lose the overshoots of the rounds that way. So, I think it's just a badly executed font. (Not that the concept was necessarily bad... can't remember if this sort of thing had already been done to death back then.)\n\nI must get to sleep now.\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n"

I wish we could all play with Chameleon again, I shall have to set up a Win95/98 machine or something. It's amazing how tasteful the results are -- and how ultimately useless. Does anyone remember if Chameleon 2 was ever released, with ascender/descender control? I don't think I ever had that version. So could this be the result of a simple PS blend? Perpetua and Modern? (grasping at straws) -- or what about some of the neat built-in and programmable effects in Fontlab 2/2.5?\n\n"

But neither David nor I remembers a later version of the retail product being on the market.\n\n(Side note: internally in the Chameleon editor the way the italics worked was kinda whack. They were actually edited in upright form, and then slanted at the last minute. This was pretty workable for trying to make an italic that imitated an existing \"normal\" font because you'd start by unslanting it and sticking it in the background. But if you wanted to use Chameleon as a means of creating a new design, well, it was a pretty bizarre way to work with your italics.)\n\nT\n\n"
