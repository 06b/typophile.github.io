      "content": "@Kent & Ingrid...\n\nWell, there are still a few people in the U.S. setting Linotype, and if they have the Georgian mats, could set copy. If this is an art book, there might not be that much copy. With \"modern\" technology, repro could be pulled from the metal type, so the printing could be offset, whatever.\n\nThe type \"size\" could be changed slightly in camera -- no different than with a digital setting. You have to pay attention to the measure and word space values with this trick...\n\nYou could certainly wind up with a different look from the slick architectural productions common today, which may or may not be what you're after....\n\nIf you want to go with PostScript/OpenType fonts, Carter's digital version of Monticello might also fit the need.\n\nEdit:\n\nYou might get up with some of the designers at the University of Georgia press -- Athens isn't too far from Atlanta. There is a guy who just retired who is pretty knowledgeable about type & typesetting. He set many of the Press' books that were done in house, and this during the days of transition of photocomp-PostScript-OpenType. He's on the young side for retirement, & might just be looking for a project.\n\n"

I doubt there is anyone in the U.S. with mats. Jones designed Georgian for British Linotype, and as far as I recall it was never big in the U.S. — in fact may not have even been distributed here (certainly no promotion or inclusion in any American specimens that I’ve seen).\n\nLike I said, a rare bird.\n\n"

      "content": "There was a graphic quality to the Adam style (e.g. walls decorated with panels of low-relief molded frames) which informed a lot of early twentieth century typography, in particular involving layouts structured with decorative borders and type ornaments. The 1923 Linotype manual shows fine distinctions between different historical typefaces and the kind of ornaments, borders and decorations appropriate to each. That manual is online.\n\n"
