  "content": "Over at Extensis we've just yesterday shipped an update to Suitcase Fusion 2 for Mac OS X. The new version 13.2 update is a free update to existing Suitcase Fusion 2 customers which adds full Snow Leopard compatibility, including full support for TrueType Collection TTC fonts (such as the updated Mac system fonts).\n\nThere are a few other new features, including import/export of font sets, and the auto-activation plug-in suite expanded to cover InDesign and Illustrator CS2 (as well as CS3 and CS4, of course).\n\nCheers,\n\nT\n\n",
