  "content": "Hey! this is my first post! I have already searched to find a specific discussion on typographic 'Niceties' however came up a bit short. Everyone knows typography is one of the designer's core tools. The designer uses type to communicate appropriately, to suggest a mood and a character and to contribute to page and layout dynamics, for both printed and screen based formats such as a tablet or smart phone. its obvious understanding the rules and key facts of typographic detailing will create better communication with the read/viewer.\n\nGood typography should be invisible, yet typography should grab the reader's attention using imaginative solutions.\n\nI am trying to find examples that explore this through the application of different formats (print or digital), layout, hierarchy and color ways and how the correct use of typographic detailing, aids communication and readability. I would greatly appreciate your opinions here and would also like to discuss and know why you think that your example is successful.\n\n",
