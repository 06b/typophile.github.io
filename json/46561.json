  "content": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am doing a project at uni where I need to hand carve the Arabic words ’halal’ and ’haraam’. I do not speak or write the language, but appreciate the beauty of the script. Unfortunately I cannot seem find to any examples of these words written by hand on the internet, and I would much rather use a hand-written type specimen rather than a digitally typeset one because I feel it conveys the beauty and fluidity of the language far better.\n\nI was hoping someone could point me in the right direction of some specimens, or even if someone knew Arabic themselves it would be amazingly generous if they could provide a basic specimen and be showered in thanks for the rest of eternity?\n\nHuge thanks,\n\nRafe\n\n [‹ How to access all characters of a font](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011012141/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46574 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [FB ITC Franklin ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011012141/http:/www.typophile.com/node/46289 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

Next one — the 3rd from the _right_, that is — seems to be an alef, ending with a Final form Meem.\n\nThen again, I wouldn’t take Times New Roman as the norm. There is a dedicated [Arabic Typesetting forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20081011012141/http:/www.typophile.com/forum/366) elsewhere on this site. Perhaps better moved over there.\n\n"
