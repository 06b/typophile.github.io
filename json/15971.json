  "content": "Hello!  \nI tried a bunch of the suggestions and here's the next draft. Personally I like the new \"S\" and the \"ong\", but Goudy for \"Enriching Life through\", really bugs me. The clients typeface is Goudy Old Style, so I cannot change that one. Does anyone have any suggestions on the clumping of the title. Its just not working.  \nThanks very much,  \nKate\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [05-06Season Prgrm COVER.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130310063739/http:/typophile.com/files/05-06Season%20Prgrm%20COVER_0.pdf) | 35.89 KB |\n\n",
