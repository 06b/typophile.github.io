It’s hard to pin down.\n\nI did draw the logo from scratch. The “R” is my doing.\n\nI’m currently putting together my portfolio and resume’s grid and the next step’ll be to slap the information down. I’m currently fontless, though. It’s always much easier when you’re making these decisions for someone else!\n\nEdit: I apologize if this would better go into the _Critique_ subforums.\n\n"

It’ll mean a pay cut, likely, but I need a place with upward mobility. You could say I was as high up in my current company as was possible.\n\nWhile doing that, I’ve done freelance for novels, comics, games, etc.\n\nI’m thinking that my online portfolio will be very cleanly laid out so as to bring some order to the chaos that is “samples in a slew of categories.” My physical portfolio for interviewing for the next graphic design job will be, and rightly so, focused on design.\n\nI’m a stronger illustrator than designer. I’d say proper font useage is my weakest area. I’m constantly reading books on the subject and am eager to improve.\n\n"
