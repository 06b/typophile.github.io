      "content": "Well, if you know this is from the 60's that should tell you why finding similar fonts could be hard. Many pre-digital fonts never made it into digital form.\n\nThe most similar font I could think of is called [Arbiter](http://web.archive.org/web/20130313112540/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/arbiter-bq/), by Aldo Novarese.\n\nI have scoured the Solotype Catalog, Rookledge's Typefinder and some of my Photo-Lettering books. It has a familiar look, so it's driving me nuts. I think Mark Simonson has a pretty good collection of older type books, and might recognize this.\n\nI am still looking.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
