      "content": "These are good shapes. I think your main trouble is deciding where to put the little double barbs:  \nLeft side of the first vertical of most letters: normal.  \nMaking diamonds on the N: clever.  \nOne on the thins of V and X: okay.  \nRight side of M and W: unusual, unnecessary, but potentially defensible as a sort of bracketing device.  \nRight side of other letters: hmm, no.  \nClustered all over the middle of W: what, no.  \nZ: It's more of a tail than a structural vertical, so still a weird place for them.\n\nMoving on to overall letter form, Y is where you seem to have lost the plot. It's cut and pasted together a bit hastily as if you have no historical references for the letter Y. The inline element is reversed. Then with Z, you reverse the stroke angle on the bottom, which is sort of interesting but makes the thin line look even more out of place. Keep drawing.\n\n"

Maybe an overlapping swath, such as appears at the bottom of many of your vertical stems (like at the bottom of B)?\n\n"
