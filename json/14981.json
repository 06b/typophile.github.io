From my quick inspection of the book, it looked like it was divided into a bunch of different case studies with the font, its designer and application. But don't take my word for it, I just had a quick glance, but it looked like a really cool book, something I'd buy.\n\n(Hrant, it's the Borders on Sunset across from Arclight, if you're in the area.)\n\n"

We go there all the time.\n\nI haven't been to the bakery, but I'll check it out. From what I read online it looks like a great place, and I'm always game for trying new foods. I'm usually in the Little Armenia/Thai Town area once a week.\n\n"
