Now that I have a complete alphabet, though, I find myself wondering whether it might be worth expanding this into a full character set. Unfortunately, I'm not the most objective critic, so I was hoping for some feedback. I'm worried that the uppercase is slightly too heavy for the lowercase and may need to be redrawn.\n\nAny feedback would be appreciated.\n\nTIA,  \nAndré\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Alice2010MR16.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417120936/http:/typophile.com/files/Alice2010MR16_0.pdf) | 92.39 KB |\n\n",

I can read the alphabet lines, but couldn't read the paragraph because the letter are intertwine with each other, look like Thai script/ language. Or some kind of scifi out of space language in a movie. I think this is a fun experimental typeface to explore more.\n\nYou said you didn't begin with any serious goal of creating this typeface, do you have any goal now? I'm just curious. If you create another typeface, what would you do differently based on what you have learned? (My instructors asked me that all the time?)\n\n"

I'm not a designer, simply someone interested in the more technical details of fonts, and had originally created glyphs as little more than placeholders to allow me to explore a variety of opentype coding issues (hence the very uniform and simple geometric forms). However, I liked the effect created by the uniform internal spacing created by the letters I had, so I completed the alphabet. It actually works better IMHO for the condensed version, but I didn't post a sample of that since I'm still working on the glyph variants and calt code necessary to create the intertwining. I'll likely post a sample of that, though, in the next few weeks.\n\nIf I were to create another typeface, I'd want to spend more time trying to conceptualise what I wanted from the overall alphabet before I started actually drawing glyphs. When I did opt to complete the basic alphabet here, I had to rethink lots of things to get the glyphs to work together. I'm not really sure though if that is what you are asking.\n\nAndré\n\n"

So if you have plenty of free time, just continue :)\n\nOnly some comments:  \n\"lover\"case: looks nearly finished. the small caps forms of f, g and q are bothering me a little. You can keep these as backup and try some true lowercase variants.  \nlook at k and x, maybe there is a way to make them fit the rest of letters better. maybe disconnect the shapes?\n\nuppercase: i only like the normal version (i am not sure if the alt version makes much sense with this typeface, because it makes the typeface a little boring). So i recommend you to work much more with the upper row. You can try to use the same principle as in the lowercase and look at the letters like B, D and try to disconnect them. K and X fits here more than in lowercase. Work also on R, probably the version from the second row will be more clear. But anyway, lowercase looks much more complete than uppercase, so you can play more to make the uppercase some sort of mixed upper-lowercase.\n\nligatures - are quite hard to read, but i dont like some of \"a with something\" ligatures.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJano\n\n"

One major problem I was facing earlier was that I wasn't really thinking ahead when I developed the earlier version and had rather foolishly added fairly comprehensive international support before I'd actually finalized the basic letterforms and the calt routine. The result: changes to the calt routine were both time consuming and error-prone since because of the large number of glyphs in all of the classes which I'm using. Adding and removing glyphs from classes would often result in classes with the wrong number of members, or with members which were misaligned, and tracking down these problems was becoming rather time consuming (plus the fact that FontLab's error-reporting isn't usually very informative wasn't making things any easier).\n\nI've created a new version without any accented characters and want to focus on just getting the basic algorithm down before adding the accented characters back.\n\nI've uploaded a new .pdf file which contains some samples (the text is the first paragraph of Alice in Wonderland which contains all 26 letters). Note that this is still very much a rough draft. The connected samples represent the 'raw' output of my current joining algorithm, and there are many joins which are somewhat ugly as things stand.\n\nMy current goal is to come up with a general algorithm which produces as few problematic forms as possible before I start adding code to deal with specific exceptions (I suspect there will be quite a few of these even once I finalize the basic algorithm, but hopefully I can arrive at an algorithm which minimizes the number of special cases needed).\n\nThe new font includes both the interleaving joins found in the previous version, as well as more 'script-like' connections. I'm not 100% sure how well the latter work though, and would appreciate feedback. It clearly needs refinement, but that refinement is only worth the effort if it actually 'fits', so to speak.\n\nCurrently, I think that there are far more problems with the lowercase joins than the uppercase ones. There are quite a few lowercase joins which I am not comfortable with. I'm curious to see if people here dislike the same one that I do.\n\nI'm also rethinking what the basic uppercase should be -- Currently, the font has a 'biform' uppercase with a more standard majuscule one available as a titling alternate. I think the biform works well in all-caps settings, but less well in mixed-case settings. I'm debating between two options here: (i) simply swap the two sets of caps so the biform becomes the titling form, or (ii) make the biforms accessible via the 'case' feature so it becomes the default in all-caps settings, and then using the 'titl' feature to restore the standard majuscules, but only in all-caps settings.\n\nTIA,\n\nAndré\n\n"

The one I've labelled 'Connected III' is intended to be a stylistic alternate. I'm debating between 'Connected I' and 'Connected II' as the basic 'calt' algorithm. The other will likely also end up as a stylistic alternate.\n\nConnected I favours interleaving joins over fully connected ones.  \nConnected II favours fully connected joins over interleaving ones.  \nConnected III favours interleaving in the opposite direction from Connected I.\n\nThere's also a stylistic set which allows one to 'tweak' the results by mapping numerals onto non-printing 'joining directives'. I haven't used this, though, to correct any problematic cases in the attached .pdf.\n\nThe reason I'm using full paragraphs to illustrate something which clearly isn't intended for text is simply because it illustrates a greater number of character combinations than a single word or pangram does.

In the meantime, though, I sketched out some ideas for expanding this into an actual family with additional weights. Unfortunately, if I want to maintain the same sorts of behaviours across weights, the design imposes some rather severe restrictions on the weight of horizontal stems, so in trying to make bolder weights, I've ended up with a situation where the contrast increases with the weight. I'm not sure how unnatural that is. Anyways, I've just done basic alphabets, but here's what I have so far.\n\nregular weight (for comparison sake -- this is the one I've been working on all along)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417120936im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AGIEngRTest_5657.jpg)\n\nmedium weight:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417120936im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AGIEngMTest_6077.jpg)\n\nbold weight:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417120936im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AGIEngBTest_6311.jpg)\n\nThe black departs a bit from the progression above:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417120936im_/http:/typophile.com/files/AGIEngUTest_5036.jpg)\n\nAndré\n\n"
