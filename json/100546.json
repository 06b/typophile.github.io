  "content": "Hi!\n\nI need to find fonts that a similar to this script font. This one is probably a custom designed logotype, but it doesn't have to be exactly like this. Just something which is tasting a little \"vintage, 50s and pin-up\".\n\nProbably a weird description — but any suggestions are welcome!\n\nThanks\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cfcdc4fb6a303d4bfe34132bc6c40830.jpeg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019131056/http:/typophile.com/files/cfcdc4fb6a303d4bfe34132bc6c40830.jpeg) | 43.79 KB |\n\n",
