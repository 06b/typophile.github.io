Maybe...   \n   \nAm I crazy? Periods are really common within a range of numbers.   \nFor example:   \n4545.094598   \n3458394.9084   \n   \nAnd as shown above, would throw off the tabular setting.   \nIs this reasonable with OT?\n\n [‹ OpenType font naming conventions](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120222744/http:/typophile.com/node/637 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Pixar Typestry ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081120222744/http:/typophile.com/node/6209 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

In such setting, it is expected that the numbers will be aligned on the decimal (a period in English, a comma in many other languages). So the width of that alignment character becomes irrelevant. Any separator characters will then also line up, so as long as one is consistent in their use (spaces, thin spaces, commas, periods, whatever one uses to do numbers like \"1,000,000\")   \n   \nNow, that's the question of necessity. A tabular period and comma would put more space around them in setting numbers. I am curious to hear folks' opinions about whether this would be aesthetically pleasing.   \n   \nRegards,   \n   \nT\n\n"

Best left for a real monospaced typeface.   \n  \nHowever, I could see working up a mono period and space that only activate   \nwhen surrounded by numbers...   \n(this relates to the \\*can\\* mentioned above)\n\n"
