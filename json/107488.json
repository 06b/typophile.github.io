I'm trying to track down something as close to this typeface as possible.  \nI'm aware it may be custom as it appears to be replicating a type of vintage European sign-writing style.  \nThe low crossbar in the A and the unusual S and C stand out the most.\n\nAny help is appreciated.  \nCheers\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117150246im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cc_5804.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [cc.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20141117150246/http:/typophile.com/files/cc_2.jpg) | 208.27 KB |\n\n",
