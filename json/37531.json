  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m working on a type specimen and the chosen theme is Corporate BS, that hollow language used by corporations worldwide.  \nI’ve found generators [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001226/http:/members.aol.com/matt999h/bullshit.htm) and [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001226/http:/www.atrixnet.com/bs-generator.html). But as specimens go, some of the sentences are too long, and maybe not as annoying as I want them to be.\n\nSome examples:  \nredefine integrated users  \nreinvent seamless content  \norchestrate compelling channels  \nexpedite holistic platforms  \nenable impactful relationships  \nredefine world-class content  \nincentivise holistic synergies  \ncompetently extend cutting-edge interfaces  \nenergistically maximize 24/7 interfaces\n\nIt could be just two words, somehow infected, like _synergy effect_.\n\nWhat expressions trigger your contempt? Would you be so kind to share? It’ll be fun, it’ll be a **win-win situation!**\n\nCheers,\n\nFredrik\n\n [‹ Portland Typophile](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001226/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37219 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Systematic typedesigns for display ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001226/http:/www.typophile.com/node/37673 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I did google “Corporate statements” though and found some pretty interesting stuff.\n\n\\> Orwell...\n\nNow wouldn’t that be interesting, mixing quotes from Orwell with management language? Nicely intertwined. If it’s going to be funny it can’t be too obvious of course.\n\n\\> [http://denisdutton.com/bad\\_writing.htm](http://web.archive.org/web/20080907001226/http:/denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm \"http://denisdutton.com/bad\\_writing.htm\")\n\nRegarding bad writing, I did use Edward Bulwer-Lyttons immortal “It was a dark and stormy night” in a previous specimen I made.\n\n"
