I suspect it's still around somewhere on the Disney site.   \n   \nI'm not so sure that the font they were talking about is the one used for the movie title though, because there was also an Atlantean language and alphabet developed for the movie. It may be the font was the new [imagined alphabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150403064351/http:/www.omniglot.com/writing/atlantean.htm) of the Atlanteans.   \n   \nSomething to amuse your friends with, I suppose. Sounds like the guy who invented Klingon, was the one who came up with Atlantean for the film.\n\n"
