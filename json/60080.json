I was going to use the name \"Red Door Design\" until it came to my attention that there are a handful of existing agencies with the same name.\n\nSo I decided to use my last name instead — \"Aranda Design\" — and developed a logo. Interested to hear anything that anyone has to say.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014021301im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture4_3430.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014021301im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Picture5_5564.jpg)\n\n",

I'm not sure about your choice of typo, sure the style make it somehow personal designer but there is maybe too much difference about the A of the typo and the A of the logo.  \nThat said about details, IMO your mark is great.\n\n"

That was the only way I could make all three “levels” work. I think if I ditch the curves at the ends of the D, the A should be more apparent. I rather like the typeface, but I see what you mean about the A's not being similar enough. The letters in the mark are based on Gill Sans. Maybe I should try that for the type.\n\n"

      "content": "Yep, A is kind of hard to see, and without seeing it the mark looks kind of busy, because of the element count. Secondly, the mark has too much whitespace; basically the positive parts are way too thin and neg/pos balance is not there. Also, the concept is interesting, the bent pencil looks quite a bit unconventional and geometrically forced. Lastly, placing the mark between the words is not working for me personally. All in all, the mark has a lot of promise, but needs more tinkering with.\n\n"

I would consider using just your initial “A” and the word “Design” in a classic font like Helvetica or Bodoni. Maybe the A in red and Design in Black or Grey. It could be a nice play on your name and a statement of precisely what you do ... A Design.\n\nJames Tocco  \nDesigner, Detroit, Michigan USA\n\n"

You're right that it's not working, but I think it may simply not be working \\*yet\\*. Also, I strongly recommend not flanking the mark with type. It's too noisy and disruptive to the flow. Also, I think the mark needs room to read, as it is trying to use angular relationships to create an implied formal relationship.\n\nDon't give up!\n\n"
