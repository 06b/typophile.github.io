  "content": "Hi folks! I've been a lurker for a while and have just gotten around to registering! Anyway, I'm getting married in September, so of course I've been a busy bee getting the wedding invites and whatnot all sorted out. One thing I'm still stuck on is the monogram I've done up...I can't get it to feel right/balanced the way I want it to. I'm using Gotham Light paired with Aphrodite Pro for the script portion, and have based my sketches on Aphrodite as a starting point. I'd appreciate some honest critique from those who know much more than I. It's just very hard to get some distance on a project so close to home, y'know? :D I'm especially concerned with the balance of positive/negative space and line weights. Please help, Typophiles!  \n-Alex\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Ligature-Rework.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150419210318/http:/typophile.com/files/Ligature-Rework.jpg) | 100.67 KB |\n\n",
