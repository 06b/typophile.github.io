  "content": "I'm working on a poster for a party.. The idea is \"Tacky Holly Golightly.\" Pink champagne/Cigarette holders/Virginia Slims/Bubblegum cigarettes will be given out at the party.\n\nI used Candy Script and really felt good about it, but this is the response I got: \"The 'champagne Jam' typeface isnt blowing  \nme away... Blingy and bubbilicous. The font should give me the feeling of girlies with luscious lipstick drinking tacky pink drinks by the pool in too-short shorts.\"\n\nNow.. that's the feel I am getting from the Candy Script. Granted, when I think \"tacky type\" I think Curlz and Eurostile. I've never had to make something look both good and \"tacky\" before so I would \\*highly\\* appreciate some suggestions from you guys to help get me out of this box!\n\nAw heck, I'll post the image so you can see the context I'm working with:\n\n[Champagne Jam poster](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018053319/http:/img142.imageshack.us/my.php?image=birdsaug9id2.gif)\n\n",

The capital \"C\" and \"J\" are just too clumsy. I think a more delicate, slightly more refined font would better suit your needs.\n\nHope that helps in some way.\n\n"

In my mind, a failed attempt at refinement is the very definition of tacky, but this leaves me at a loss as far as typeface options to consider. Besides, you know.. Papyrus.\n\nCandy Script, to me, at least had both playfulness and a suggestion of elegance combined.\n\n"
