If you know what i'm talking about and know the name of the font, lemme know. If no one else got the flyer, i'll try to post a sample tomorrow.\n\n",

When I saw it, I knew it was Stuart's, but then I couldn't find it on his site, then had to search Google, where I finally found it on Chank's. Interestingly, it's not even listed in the Chank A-Z catalog, but its own page is still there on the site.   \n   \nStu? Chank? Anyone have any insights on this?\n\n"
