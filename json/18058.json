  "content": "Hello,\n\nI'm a new member to the site. I would like to enlist help in IDing the logotype for Victoria's Secret. I usually go to [www.brandsoftheworld.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20121219013703/http:/www.brandsoftheworld.com/ \"www.brandsoftheworld.com\") for the logo eps files. But VS isn't listed on that site. My friends thought VS logotype is in Trajan but it's not. If anyone can shed light on this, I'd appreciate your help!\n\nAlso, by any chance, does anyone know the typeface used for Banana Republic's logotype?\n\nThanks a bunch!\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [logo.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20121219013703/http:/typophile.com/files/logo_15.gif) | 1.61 KB |\n\n",

Tiffany suggested that [Font Bureau’s Garamond](http://web.archive.org/web/20121219013703/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/GaramondFB) would be a nice substitute and I have to say I agree. :)\n\n"

Does anyone have the font, FS Rome though, or could someone be kind enough to type out Victoria's Secret and outline the type in Illustrator to send to me? I'll fix the kerning myself. I just need the logo for some spec campaign for my book. Thanks much!\n\nAnd thanks again, everyone, for helping a new member out :\\>\n\n"
