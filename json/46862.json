Here's a [review over at Typographica.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20130516080604/http:/typographica.org/001156.php)\n\nI have one of his books and it is amazing.

      "content": "It is incredible. I own all of his books and find them very useful, esp Fonts and Logos although all of them are great. I really like Dangerous Curves because it is pretty much all sketches of his custom logo work. I love seeing his process and his sketches, his work is amazing. He attends the Y Conference down here in San Diego fairly frequently, if you can make it out he is a fascinating person to speak with and will even sign your book.\n\n"
