The original idea was a simple display font, composed by geomeric modules, the regularity on some gliphs proves that it can be work on pixels, generating gray smoth pixels too at 8 points.

Nice work.   \n   \nMy experimenting has been done with bold pixel fonts though, where the contrast between the black and the gray portions of each letterform are much more pronounced.   \n   \nI really think that \"gray\" pixel fonts are great additions to the pixel font world, but what are your thoughts on their useability?   \n   \nWhat I mean to say is, the letterforms break down when not used at their intended point size. Before anyone yells foul, I'm not talking about setting the type at 10pt when the font should be set at 8. I'm talking about setting the type at 16pt or 24.   \n   \nGranted, not many pixel font owners actually set the type this way, but it is one definate advantage that non aliased pixel fonts have over their \"gray\" cousins: wider useage possibilities.   \n   \nEach has its own strengths, I think, and am glad to see more energy going into pixel font development.\n\n"

      "content": "There's huge development in pixelfonts, at the garage level, and it is awesome. Big digital type companies so far have seemed to ignore it, which is dumb cause cheap devices are sprouting screens all the time.   \n   \nLuciano asked:   \n\\> Hello Christopher, How is the TiD patented   \n\\> method? Can you explain here to compare? Thanks   \n   \nA year ago, there were no greyscale pixelfonts. I had a brainstorm, did some tests, and came up with a reliable method. TiD applied for and got a provisional patent on the use of subpixel forms \"partial fills\" in outline type. Outline type is the key - there are embedded bitmap fonts on Win, Mac and Unix but they are not compatible.   \n   \nPartly this was to make me rich, partly it was to prevent other companies from patenting it for one platform or the other. Currently outline pixelfonts (grayscale and otherwise) are the ONLY crossplatform compatible pixel fonts.   \n   \nIt's a little ironic that the outline format, in a way the opposite of pixels, is the bridge.   \n   \ntyler asked:   \n\\> I really think that \"gray\" pixel fonts are   \n\\> great additions to the pixel font world,   \n\\> but what are your thoughts on their useability?   \n   \nIt's a compromise. They can be MORE usable at their intended size, cause grey helps humans read, especially when the pixels are painted by another human. But they do fall apart at other sizes. I think we'll need every kind of type in the future.\n\n"

One reason automatic-from-outlines rendering sucks is that you seldom get solid black where you should.   \n   \nYou certainly have room for more subtlety with grayscale than you do with b&w bitmap fonts, but there's still a tight limit.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
