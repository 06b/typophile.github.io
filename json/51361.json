  "content": "Hello everyone. I was wondering yesterday and came to a thought: is it more difficult, aiming to design a typeface family, to design a sans serif typeface from the serif version?  \nI'm thinking that the sans is more rationalist and closest to the skeleton shape of the character, with less contrast of the strokes, and more affected by geometry. The serif design is more organic and implies modulation. Could I design the serif version just by \"chopping off\" the sans version?  \nDon´t take this literally, because I'm aware that are many ways of thinking about this and there are a lot of variables to think of, like the ideia of a humanist sans, but let's forget the gray areas and keep it simple. Does this make any sense?\n\n",
