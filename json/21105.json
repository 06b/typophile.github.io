  "content": "**Building Letters III  \nCall for participation**\n\nThe [Building Letters](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Building%20Letters) project continues! An international team of typographers, designers, and editors vivified the idea to publish this magazine. The Building Letters 3 would raise money to help those affected by the Asian Tsunami in 2004, an event which dominated the news for such a short time, but where people still need our help, long after the cameras have gone home.\n\nThe integral part of the magazine is a CD containing free fonts. The main reason to include a CD is to make the magazine more attractive for those who buy it. Not only they receive a magazine, but also some added value they can use in their own projects.\n\nThe last issue of Building Letters, published by [Jim Richardson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Jim%20Richardson), contained a CD with 30 fonts by various designers ( [Max Kisman](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Max%20Kisman), [Neville Brody](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Neville%20Brody), [Emigre](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Emigre), etc.).\n\nPlease help us to make BL3 project successful. We need to create a valuable collection of fonts. If you wish to participate, please contact me at [filip@designiq.cz](mailto:filip@designiq.cz). Every participating designer will have his/her own folder on the CD; the folder should contain PC and Mac version of a font (OT fonts preferred) and it could also contain EULA and/or catalog in PDF.\n\nThank you for helping us, and the victims.\n\n[Filip Blazek](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Filip%20Blazek)  \n [http://www.buildingletters.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/www.buildingletters.org/ \"http://www.buildingletters.org\")  \n [http://www.designiq.eu](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/www.designiq.eu/ \"http://www.designiq.eu\")\n\n(Typophile discussion at [http://typophile.com/node/8461](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024/http:/typophile.com/node/8461 \"http://typophile.com/node/8461\"))\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131013211024im_/http:/typophile.com/files/cover.jpg)\n\n",
