  "content": "So I’m a young designer hired on by an IT staffing company to do there marketing and design in-house. I’m working in the corporate environment for the first time and am getting accustomed to meshing High Design and Corporate Ideals. I’m working on a logo for a website that is being launched and need some guidance. Here’s what we’ve come up with.\n\n[http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q275/sthartl/erplogo.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706175202/http:/i138.photobucket.com/albums/q275/sthartl/erplogo.jpg \"http://i138.photobucket.com/albums/q275/sthartl/erplogo.jpg\")\n\nHere are my challenges:  \nThe colors are set  \nThe hexagon shape is required  \nThe web address (with the hyphen) was to easily discernable, i.e. there has to be continuity throughout ’erp-consulting’  \nNeeds to maintain high-end corporate look  \nThe general council is comprised of non-creative so anything over stylized doesn’t fly.\n\nIn general what’s a good way to manage lots of type in a logo?  \nAny advice on doing creative work in non-creative environments? How do I stay inspired and how so I integrate design into the corporate mindset\n\n [‹ Looking for similarities...](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706175202/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44462 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Magazine Logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706175202/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44825 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I’ve learned that working in a non-creative environment requires a different strategy on how to present/sell a concept. What will not work is describing how ’pretty’ a color is or how the idea came to you in a dream. Metaphors don’t really cut it in this environment. What does work is a mix of creative and business lingo. Their about numbers. You’re about creativity. Find the happy medium and you’ll have success. Just keeping pushing design on them. They too want to see what you see. They’re just afraid of making a decision that could ultimately decrease their revenue/stock/professionalism. Gaining their trust take time and patience. So hang in there.\n\n"

      "content": "Tre, since you are stuck with the cube and colors, why not establish the identity through the type? I feel now it ALL looks a little tired and generic, whereas if you take the cube as a starting point and work on typographic treatments that mirror the curves and angles I feel you will get something a little more memorable.\n\nSharon is correct about the kerning at the end. Way too tight visually compared with the start.\n\nAlso - what would the .com look like at small sizes. The weight seems so thin I imagine you may have issues.\n\nWork out a black and white version too.\n\nJay\n\n"
