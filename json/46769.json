  "content": "When I bring up characters with diacritics in Fontlab (5.04 on OS X 10.4) using their keyboard commands Fontlab often crashes. For example, if I use Opt+` followed by e to bring up egrave, Fontlab crashes. It seems to happen after I’ve already entered other diacritic characters. I‘ve tried removing my preferences and uninstalling/reinstalling Fontlab with no luck. Is this a common problem?\n\n",

I've not yet encountered the crashing condition you describe, but then I don't use shortcut keys like that to enter accented characters. I learned to spell out the glyph names, eg: /acircumflex, ccedilla etc. I find that easier than remembering shortcut keys, but then writing is something I actually enjoy doing so it's not for everyone.\n\nSave your file often. I hit command + s after every edit or at least every ten edits. You just never know when Fotnlab is going to crash.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"
