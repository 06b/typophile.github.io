Seems like all the necessary info is there.\n\nI think the only thing you can't do with FontLab is put more than the basic four-font family into one suitcase. But I'm pretty sure that Family builder couldn't do that either. To do that in the olden days I used the Finder, which let you open suitcases as if they were folders and move fonts in and out of them. Not possible anymore with the OS X Finder, unfortunately.\n\n"

I will need three separate suitcases. With all the naming conventions and Fond IDs and ATR compatible stuff set up properly.\n\nI'm sorry for whining... but dang this all seems SO complicated!!!\n\nBut I will buckle down and read through everything three or four more times and try and make sense of it...\n\nThanks for your help!\n\n"

      "content": "Technically, you could make a Mac font family with up to 48 styles with Family Builder, but that was only because Outline, Shadow, Condensed, and Extended were available besides Italic and Bold. Practically no fonts were shipped with anything but families comprised of the basic four-font scheme (R/I/B/BI). So you still had to break multi-weight families into subfamilies back then.\n\nBuilding Mac Type 1 fonts isn't really any different now, it's just that FontLab is designed for so many more possibilities.\n\n"
