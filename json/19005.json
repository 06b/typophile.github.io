  "content": "This is the first article in my school's architecture magazine. I've posted here before regarding the cover, but this time I need some help with the layout - essentially I'd like it to be more interesting than it was before, and I'm having some issues regarding the font choice for the body.\n\nThe budget is tight, so I'm deciding to stick to fonts I already have (Myriad, Trebuchet, Bell, etc). I used Trebuchet as the body font in the first issue and I didn't quite like the result, so I'm moving to a serif font. I still like Trebuchet for the headlines, so I'm pretty much sticking to that unless someone can offer a better replacement.\n\nPlease look at this spread and let me know what you think. Any comment would be much appreciated.\n\nthanks,  \nmacgirl\n\nP.S. I am not a graphic designer. Just an architecture student who is addicted to fonts.\n\n",

      "content": "A couple of initial thoughts for you. Your grid is going to be quite flexible for you and work to your advantage in allowing for creative and interesting compositions, however I do think this could be adjusted slightly.\n\nI think you could allow for slightly more room in the outside margins – don’t forget we have thumbs and a generous space for mine is always appreciated.\n\nDoes the grid allow for or require space for page markers and general navigation indicators? For example have you developed a system for section marking, page numbering etc? If this is to be a requirement, now or in the future, perhaps either the top or bottom margin will benefit form extra space also.\n\nLooking at this grid it actually allows for 4 col not just 2? You do not always have to confine yourself to only two col. Experiment with combinations of wide and thin column where appropriate.\n\nDoes your grid indicate a specified height at which article headings, sub heads, and intro paragraphs fall? Dictating this may allow for more consistency from article to article, issue to issue.\n\nHave you considered a method for pull quotes, and their usage? For example size, typeface choice, emphasis etc.\n\nWhat is your chosen serif for body copy at this stage?\n\nHope these ideas help. Good luck.\n\nBest.  \n-nic\n\n"

      "content": "I see your point about the margins... however, the margins are already set at 1/2\" and I lose 1/4 of that during trimming (the printer told me that). I don;t know if I can afford to lose more paper space, as the mag is tiny as it is.\n\nAs for general navigation, I will place the page numbers at the bottom center of the page. I tried top right and it didn't work too well. ONce I place those in, I'll upload again.\n\nAs for section markers, I'm still debating that. I was thinking of something running down the right side of the page, in three shades of green (one for each section of the mag) and in three locations (top, center, bottom) which would correspond to that section. It should be easy to navigate, I think, once I include these section markers.\n\nI will look into wide/thin columns, as well as a 4-column layout for the second section of the mag, which is the student work. I'll post that once ready.\n\nFinally, for articles the headline always falls either directly above or directly on the middle third of the grid, but always around that center area. That allows me to have some wiggle room for headlines that are too long (I can break them to two lines, like the example) or headlines that are too short (which can have a larger font size).\n\nThe pull quotes are being dealt with in the same manner as the headlines: Trebuchet at a small point size.\n\nMy big, big question is about the serif. Do Trebuchet and Bell (my chosen serif for now) play well together? Sometimes I think they do, sometimes I think they don't. Maybe I need an extra set of eyes to choose this.\n\nIf Bell is not a good option, then which other serif can I use?\n\nthanks a bunch,\n\nmacgirl\n\n"

I've noticed a number of justified word spacing on the text column that are approximately the same width as your gutter.\n\n3) Also in the article title page and the picture page, your paragraphs are divided by a space with the start of the next paragraph set justified left. In the text page pdfs, there is a space and paragraph indention. I think paragraph treatments should be consistent?\n\nHope this helps. Thanks\n\nJoseph\n\n"

      "content": "I prefer the Minion choice, but a few points:  \nYour indent seems excessive especially when you have a line space I think you could bring it back to an em (the height of your leading).  \nI would try to make the body copy sit on a baseline grid, so that when you break it with a picture or pull quote the two columns still align because you have a narrow gutter it is more noticeable.  \nThe pull quotes should probably be ranged left and ragged right with as few hyphens (if any) as you can get away with and should either really intrude into a column or not at all (your Minion pdf is really too small an intrusion) the space at top at bottom should ideally appear the same, try to keep at least three lines together when breaking a paragraph with either a column break or pull quote – you need to be flexible with your grid.  \nDepending on the number of pages you could steal some space from the centre of your grid to add to the outside margins.  \nWhere you mention creep (the loss of up to a quarter of your margin during trimming) you should also note this will affect any sidebar section markers, although you could apply them to the top or bottom of the page.  \nHope some of this helps.  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "Hi, Susana,\n\nI agree with some of the comments already posted here. I think that you are off to a good start by having used a grid to organize the page layout, but maybe it could use some adjusting.\n\nAs **juki** says, at 1/8 of an inch your gutter is too narrow to keep the columns separated visually. The gutter should be at least 1 pica wide (12 points, or 0.166 inches), just to be on the safe side.\n\nIf you modify the gutter width, you may also want to consider modifying the amount of columns within the page grid. May I suggest having an uneven number of columns rather than an even number? This might give you more flexibility to play around with different column widths (for example, you could have two wide columns for the main text and a thinner column reserved for photo captions, but otherwise kept blank -- this would give your pages some much-needed white space, as well).\n\nLast but not least, using a grid does not mean that you have to fill up every last space with text... Things might start to look \"boxy.\" Try using a left-only justification (i.e., ragged right), as **timd** suggests, even for the main body copy, and compare that with the current justified spread.\n\nHope this is helpful!\n\n"

I mistakenly applied the same paragraph style to the pull quotes as I did for the rest of the text, so I will correct that soon. One thing I was thinking for the pull quotes (which I will post in the next PDF'd version) is to justify them to whatever side they happen to touch the body text (e.g., if the pull quote is on a left page, then it would be justified to the right because the pull quote's right side will \"touch\" the body text and its left side will \"float\" towards the margin). Makes any sense? I will fix and show when I'm done.\n\ntimd:\n\nI agree with the Nathan's mysterious dark strip to the right. It will be cropped out. I knew there was something bothering me about that and I couldn't quite put my finger to it. Also, I hadn't picked up on the \"populism\" thing.
