  "content": "On my visit to Seattle’s [Space Needle](http://web.archive.org/web/20060411093412/http:/www.spaceneedle.com/) I found a rather interesting sign. It said, _Please wait on the other side of the glass partition_. Obviously, it was not the message that called my attention, but the typeface it was set on. Well, actually I should more accurately say, what struck me was **how the** (well known) **typeface was rendered**. The letters, cut in vinyl, were so badly\\* done that I wouldn’t been able to identify the typeface, if some of the shapes weren’t so ubiquitous.\n\nSo, here’s the deal: I’ll post one letter at a time, and you type-freaks (grin) try to guess the typeface. Here’s the first:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/system/files?file=ms_o.png)\n\n\\* They are so, so bad, that makes them good\n\n",
