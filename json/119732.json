  "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI'm a Graphic Designer learning new skills in typography and type design. Actually I'm about to design my first typeface. I have a rough idea. But I'm stuck at making decision on the character set that I want to cover. What character set should I cover? I'm pretty confident I want to cover all (ALL) Latin scripts. Nothing non-latin for starters. And no specials such as phonetics etc. But I would like say SmallCaps etc. I'm just confused. Can someone tell me how to go about it? How to choose which character ranges I need to include?\n\n(I have FontLab Studio 5.1.2 on Mac)\n\nThanks a lot for help!\n\n",

If it is a display font, Small Caps may not be appropriate whereas with a text face, they likely would be. Having said that, it is not an ironclad rule because some display faces would merit having Small Caps.\n\nExamine current designs done by others that are similar and use those as a starting point.\n\n"

I'm working on a rather decorative display type. I've been thinking and you're right, I will actually skip the small caps for this typeface. Also no weight or width variants, it wouldn't suit this typeface.\n\nIf I may, I have one more question. How to approach the combing characters, there are some in the Latin 4 set. What do they do? Is this some kind of automatic combining of say diacritics with base glyph, or one can do so manually when using the font? I don't understand the purpose, what combining characters are and do.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n"

The term Spacing modifier letters confuses me, I don't understand it (I'm not a native English speaker, so maybe that's why :-).\n\nMany thanks!\n\n"
