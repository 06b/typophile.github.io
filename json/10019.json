Basically, it uses the whole language of Postscript\n\n",

(At least, some of Adobe's documentation says so.)   \n   \nPrevious versions of Mac OS supported Type 3 fonts to some degree. They were not WYSIWYG because ATM couldn't render them for the screen - so the OS relied on scaled bitmaps from the font suitcase for screen display. This also meant that the fonts would only print properly to a PostScript device - otherwise you'd just get low-res bitmaps.   \n   \nT\n\n"
