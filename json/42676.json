      "content": "The _tool_ for signing fonts is free (provided by Microsoft; see [http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/dsig/default.aspx](http://web.archive.org/web/20130311172533/http:/www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/dsig/default.aspx \"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/dsig/default.aspx\") for more information). But I don't know of any free Certificates, and that is the critical bit required for applying a digital signature to fonts.\n\nDo a search for Authenticode Class III Code Signing Certificate; that is the specific variety required for signing fonts (this type of Certificate is not limited to use on fonts, but other types will not work). There are several vendors (known as Certificate Authorities), including Thawte and Verisign.\n\nI'm not sure what you consider \"reasonable\"; my experience with this tells me to be prepared to spend around $100/year or so, maybe more, maybe less depending upon the specific vendor. Generally Certificate Authorities will offer discounts for multi-year purchases so if you're in it for the long haul it may be worth doing that. Again, be sure you are getting a Class III Code Signing Certificate and not an SSL Cert or some other type.\n\nIt is possible to create a self-signed Certificate for free; the tool set provided by Microsoft allows you to do this and there are instructions in the DSIG toolkit for doing this. A self-signed certificate behaves more or less the same as a regular Certificate, but since it is not issued by a Certificate Authority, it will not be considered \"trusted\", even if it is valid. But it is a good way to learn about the process of signing fonts, do dry runs, etc.\n\nJosh\n\n"

As far as I know, the only difference today (even under Vista) between signed fonts versus unsigned is the font file icon (and extra information in Properties). But it's not hard to imagine it becoming more restrictive and invasive, much in the way applications have become.\n\nAndreas, thanks for the link...looks like TUCOWS (reselling Comodo) is pretty much the cheapest way to go.\n\n"
