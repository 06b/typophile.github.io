      "content": "Thanks. This is fascinating - one more instance of what I think of as an international trend for all scripts to evolve what, for want of a better term, may be called a 'san-serif' style:\n\nStrokes historically made by a stylus, brush, pen etc. become simplified. Extra decorative flourishes and artefacts specific to the technique used to produce the line are deleted (serifs in Latin script, the extra stroke on top of verticals in Arabic, the fuzzy ending of a brush-stroke in Japanese and Chinese script). More importantly a generic form of any given letter is adopted distilled from the many calligraphic or decorative script styles in use. A 'hidden' requirement may be to make each glyph visibly different from the rest, whilst retaining a unified harmonious style for the font as a whole. Unfortunately most modern Arabic \"Sans\" fonts mimic Latin lettering for no good reason, and ignore their own splendid traditions, in that many font letters now use the same design element, creating a regimented look and are often illegible.\n\nI first learned about all this in the 1960's from Eric Gill's book \"Typography\". It inspired me start a project (almost finished now 50 years later, my AlQuds font) to convert Arabic into Gill Sans style type. I corresponded with the late Hiromo Hara the Japanese designer and there he had developed such a Sans style. Early non-European Sans-Serif adopters were Thai scripts... and now we learn about the trend on the subcontinent. Best of luck.\n\n"
