The user has the option of retrieving one of the sentences in the corpus using from one to three words, or lemmata or grammatical constructions. In addition the user can determine the maximum distance between required words, as well as the subset of texts to which the search is limited. Lastly, there are some statistical data available on the linguistic content of the corpus, as well as the potential to return tables with [paraemeters] for a word defined by the user.'   \nI gave it a spin, and quickly selected:   \nMagazines/Information/Arts/Books+Letters/   \nWas then faced with a selection from two of the major periodocal pubslishers, a list of authors, and a string of dates (Feb 93 to Dec 99). Hit OK, got a confirmation of my selections, and was then faced with a series of webforms for selecting up to three words, with grammatical qualifications. did that, but their database spits out non-Unicode text (aaaaaarrggh!) so got gibberish.   \n\\< [http://hnc.ilsp.gr/statistics.asp](http://web.archive.org/web/20131019144738/http:/hnc.ilsp.gr/statistics.asp)\\> has some interesting stats: most frequent words and lemmata, plus the possibility to return a frequency for any string you provide (within the corpus, of course).   \nI cannot tell you off the cuff how representative of a wider body of written work this corpus is, but the fact that the three most frequent words are the masculine article, the word 'me' and the word 'mine', there might be some bias due to the sample (newspapers, high circulation books, etc.).   \nThere seems to be a lot of stuff there, but the non-Unicode output and the lack of an English version limits its functionality.   \nG/\n\n"

And I guess the next set is for lemmas - but what's a lemma? And at the bottom, I guess it allows for the searching of phrases - but what's the difference between those two large fields?   \n   \nIn case anybody's wondering, I need this stuff because I'm about to design my first (original) Greek face, and I need to know what the language is doing first.   \n   \n\\> the fact that the three most frequent words ....   \n   \nGood observation. It reminds me of the major difference I once found in English word frequencies between adult versus children's material. In the latter \"you\" is the 8th word, but it's 33rd in the former. Otherwise they're surprisingly close.   \n   \n\\> the non-Unicode output and the lack of an English version limits its functionality.   \n   \nYes.   \nBTW, are there any automated online Greek-to-English dictionaries?   \n   \n--   \n   \n\\> Moneikos   \n   \nMaybe it means \"Monaco\"?

There is an increasing demand for polytonic Greek fonts within Greece, to the degree that major software developers are being told 'Don't bother shipping anything to Greece unless it supports polytonic'.   \n   \nI'm currently developing a set of Greek kerning documents based on the Septuagint and NT.

Everybody (take this literally) can read polytonic perfectly well; spelling competence varies (but then again so do polytonic orthography, depending on period of source, rogour of transcription, and editorial style). apart from any work from antiquity to 1982, all texts by self-respecting authors outside newspaper and periodical journalism writes in polytonic.   \n   \n\\> Septuagint   \ntranslation of the Old Testament from Jewish to Greek c. 300--200 BC by, unsuprisingly, seventy scholars.
