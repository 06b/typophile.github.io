  "content": "Hello Typophiles!\n\nCallimachos - not Kallimachos :) -is a title font for jobs that need a hand-drawn, bold feel.\n\nMy main problem is that I can't speak Russian nor I am familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet.\n\nI'm trying to achieve the Cyrillic version looking at other font structures and apply the style of the others glyphs - bet it has many inconsistencies or/and bug.\n\nWould anyone help me, please, to correct the Cyrillic glyphs?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416063447im_/http:/typophile.com/files/callimachos_test_02_5_4145.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [callimachos\\_test\\_02.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416063447/http:/typophile.com/files/callimachos_test_02.pdf) | 188.77 KB |\n\n",
