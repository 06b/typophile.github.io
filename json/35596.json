To resolve widows and orphans I will normally tighten tracking to indesign at the most +20 or -20 (sometimes -25 but that's just between you and me) sometimes this might require going back or forward a few pages until you get rid of the problem on your page. If it is ragged right you can manually alter the right hand rag with disc. hyphens or soft returns. Sorry I haven't gone into technical detail but this stuff seems a bit elementary so I'm worried that it's not what you mean, I will happily explain terms and stuff if you want to know this stuff.\n\nRunning heads are good for complex works but for simple stuff, yeah maybe it's overkill but if that's a common style I say go for it -- seems like you can go either way  \ncheers\n\n--N\n\n"

Of course then you need to make sure that applying tracking to other paragraphs doesn't give you more widows or orphans!\n\nI reckon 1 whole page with three lines will look a bit strange, so I would try and tighten up the tracking on pages 18/19 to bring back the entire paragraph to page 19 although this would necessitate deleting a page.\n\n"

I normally have my minimum word spacing set at 85% for justified text. For a paragraph I want to contract to see if I can shorten it by a line, I'll apply a minimum word space of 80% for that. Of course pick paragraphs with a short last line. If the author or editor doesn't mind, I'll make minor text edits to help with copy fitting too.\n\nAnother way of fixing widows/orphans is to let both pages of a spread run one line short at the bottom. You'll see this done often.\n\nI avoid having a last line of a paragraph at the top of a page unless it fills the entire measure, but I consider it fine to have one line at the beginning of a paragraph at the bottom of a page. The process of balancing is easier if you only have to worry about those top guys.\n\nSometimes a chapter can drive me batty trying to get everything balanced and no paragraph ends hanging at the top. Often it takes several techiques to get a chapter right: tightenng paragraphs (or expanding them), taking off the bottom line on a spread, editing, and tracking.\n\n"

If that doesn't work, you go to line short on the prior set(s), if you can. If this fails, you try pages a line long (45 lines). But you never go from a short spread to a long spread in one step.\n\nIf the page has a lot of subheads, space around these can be pulled, you can sometimes save a line by knocking out a few points before and after each subhead. A problem at the start of the chapter (when you can't go back for long/short pages) can often be corrected by stealing from or adding a line to the drop space at the top of the page. If there are illustrations, you can usually add an extra line of space around the illustration.\n\nOnly when those things fail would I start mess with H&J or tracking. Look for a long paragraph with only one word on the last line, and try to pull that back, or a long paragraph with a nearly full last line, and try to force a full word onto a new line.\n\n"

      "content": "In the book world, there are several methods used. One is to not balance pages; to let spreads misalign by one line. This is uncommon.\n\nIf you are going to align spreads, you have three basic tools. The first is to allow facing pages to run up to 1 line long or short of the \"nominal\" page. Sometimes a designer will specify \"short but not long,\" or \"long but not short.\"\n\nA second method, which seems to be the basis of your question, is \"to make a line\" or \"lose a line.\" Usually it is easier to make a line; look for a paragraph that ends almost at the right margin, & try to bring down a word -- bring down at least as much as the following paragraph indent.\n\nThe third method is to allow carding. I know that there is a convention that carding is never to be done, but is does work, and had a proponent in Richard Eckersley, a reasonably famous book designer who is even in Wikipedia.\n\nSomething else to consider is to banish widows, but not worry about orphans (short last lines on a page). This is pretty standard in the University Press world. You still have to adjust pages, but there are fewer \"problems.\"\n\nAs to running heads, their purpose is to be useful to a reader. Repeating the author name on every page is simply a graphic device, of no use. Using the author's name is useful in an edited volume, which has multiple authors. Using the chapter title can also be useful. Using the subhead can be useful, but is a lot of trouble. Much depends on how the book will be read; if you anticipate a reader starting at the front & moving to the end a page at a time, running heads aren't too useful. But if you think of a guide book, obviously, running head selection is quite important.\n\nFWIW\n\nCharles Ellertson\n\n"

      "content": "Carding is where you vary the leading (the same amount on each line of a page), so that one page may have 38 lines and the next 37, but the first and last lines of a page always adhere to the grid.\n\nFor example, if your page depth is 40 picas (baseline, first text line to baseline, last text line) and your leading (linefeed) is 13 points, you will get 38 lines per page. To set to the same depth with 37 lines, you need a leading of 13.36 points. The same depth with 39 lines would use a leading of about 12.66 points.\n\nThe idea is that a difference of .35 points in leading is not noticeable, even on facing pages. Having set a number of books this way, I'd allow that the difference in spacing is not really noticeable, but that the difference in color is.\n\nRichard Eckersley tended to use a leading of around 13.5 points, with a fairly small type size -- 9.5 (Galliard) to 10 point (with a slightly condensed version of Minion from Multiple Masters), and fairly narrow measure. Under these conditions, the difference is space between the lines wasn't really noticeable -- but as I said, the difference in color was.\n\nBut one thing to remember about \"color\" is that a difference in word spacing also affects color. A paragraph with looser word spaces, as you would get if you have to \"make a line\" will appear lighter than a paragraph with the words tightly set. That being the case, much of the argument against carding seems wrong.\n\nOn balance, carding does work if you pay attention to its effects when you design the page.\n\n"

I don't agree with this either. I'm also a stickler for consistent spacing around heads and would rather (in an art book, not a novel) rag the bottom then cheat the spacing around heads to justify the page. But I know other designers to whom aligning the bottom of the type is more important.\n\nYour sample is definitely tricky because of all the short paragraphs. As important as design is, if it's a reading book then readability should trump design. Splitting up a short paragraph should probably be avoided.\n\nI wonder if carding is allowed by the Geneva Conventions...\n\n"

This technique unfortunately resulted in a couple of left-over g's and some funny typos, and the biggest editorial sin: errors of commission.\n\nAlso, I was not allowed to modify the white space between paragraphs or sections.

Tell him/her you can only it with metal type.

I could be wrong about this of course, and I don't mean to belittle either him or the dicta against carding pages. Carding has an effect, and unless you've tried it, looked at the pluses and minuses, decrying it is just to report a current fashion.\n\nTake a look at Margaret Olin's <cite>The Nation without Art: Examining Modern Discourses on Jewish Art</cite>. (University of Nebraska Press, 2001). Can you really tell that carding was used? Don't you appreciate that all the pages go to the same depth (except for mis-folding, of course)?\n\nThe point is always to look at what you are trying to achieve. Describe what is important about the page, what you are willing to give up, and in what order as the situation gets more complicated.

I'm not a stickler for aligning text on the bottom unless it really looks bad not to, but I do try to align the body copy to the baseline grid. My MO is to keep the spacing as consistent as possible (as I said in my earlier post) and do my best to create a balanced spread. You can design your heads not to disrupt grid alignment by building in the right amount of space above and below them (and often creating separate style sheets for one-line heads and two-line heads). You also obviously never want to run a head at the bottom of a page with fewer than 3 or 4 lines below it.\n\nWhen it comes to straight running text though, it looks best to align it. You don't want to distract the reader, and anything that breaks the flow - anything at all - will take his/her mind from the content.

Works best I think when there's nothing at the bottom, okay if a page number only. I've seen some books where they've moved the bottom elements to keep the same spacing between them and the bottom of the text.\n\nRe: last line of paragraph at top of page okay if it can be run all the way to the right margin. I do this in a pinch, but I'm not really happy with the indent of the next paragraph having only one flush left line above it. Doesn't look quite right.\n\nI never run pages longer than the normal maximum number of lines, but go one short when necessary. In InDesign I do this by putting a rectangular box (set for text runaround) over the last line rather than adjusting the text box, which is usually a master page element I don't want to tamper with. I just delete the added box if I decide that page doesn't need to run short. This is probably a hack: anyone have more elegant ways of handling this?\n\n"
