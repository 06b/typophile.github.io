The web-designer just enters some sort of key that lets the page load the font off the vendor-hosted server. Perhaps the system would only use sub-sets of the font, so it would be much more difficut for people to devise a way to steal the faces. Remember, iTunes doesn't make it impossible to steal music, it just makes buying it much more convenient.  \nThe trick has always been that there has to be a way for everyone to make money.\n\nFor this crazy scheme to work, you'ld also have to get broad adoption of the plug-in. That could be tricky, because it would have to be something that IE/Firefox/Safari could include without licensing entanglements.\n\nWeb designers could pay by buying a key for a certain number of hits on a particular font. Of course, piracy would be rampant, but everyone would still be making more money, which is the important thing. Some users would buy fonts from legit sources for the same reasons they do now for print.\n\n"

Yes, we allow embedding and make no restriction regarding technology or Web use.  \nB. Yes, we allow embedding in Web content but only when the mechanism is considered secure.  \nC. No, we do not allow embedding of fonts within Web content.  \nD. We don’t have a policy on this.  \nE. Other. Specify…\n\n4.

It would be illegal for people to use it.\n\nAnalogies to other industries, other media, are red herrings. We are having to reinvent things for the internet. Fonts are software. In print they are no longer software, easy. On the computer, they remain in their original state. We need to think of this as a new problem, not a re-staging of an old story.\n\nPHP right now can render a (rasterized) image using any font you want. That's how a lot of type testers work. I don't see why a similar technology can't be used to make fonts work more generally on the web. It's secure since it's server side, making us fonties happy and it gives the web designer what he/she wants. I could see this just being a back-end function, something like settype (fontfilelocation, size, style); and it could even be used with CSS somehow. I know this could be done, it would just take work. They could resolve many issues, but it has to be a function of back-end programming, not user and OS and browser based.\n\nNow how this would relate to a EULA is beyond me, perhaps a license for web use specifically.\n\nAaron.\n\n"

It’s the encapsulation of a font (or derivative thereof) in a document file – PDF, .DOC, .PPT etc.,\n\nWhat the W3C is talking about is not embedding – it’s the linking of loose or zipped up font files to Web pages which are downloaded and temporarily installed to render content. This is not embedding, so the embedding provisions of the specs and EULAs can not apply.\n\nThis is not “embedding”, this is “redistribution.” The EULAs attached to commercial fonts do not allow redistribution. Hakon and co. realize that this means that most fonts will not be legally usable under this scheme. However, they point to the large number of freeware fonts out there as being usable under the scheme, arguing that although not perfect they are better than nothing.\n\nI think the bottom line is as follows...\n\n  \n- For font makers the fear has to be that if adopted and implemented web designers will not limit themselves to legitimate freeware fonts. \n\n- For web developers the complaint should be that the scheme limits their creativity to freeware fonts.  \nThere are other problems with the proposals, but I think focusing on these two issues, might be the best approach.\n\n"

It's easy enough to create a  \ndummy document which \"embeds\" the font -- I could even argue that a  \nzip file provides a level of embedding. So, if a TrueType level 4 font  \nfamily is being served on the web, I think it's reasonable to use it  \nto display documents.

I deliberately didn't take an alarmist tone, but I think that there's a good chance something like this will go through unless the voices of type designers are heard. I think when it does become part of CSS it will be adopted by browser makers quite quickly considering their stated support of Web standards.\n\n"
