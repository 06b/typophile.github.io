      "content": "\\> **avenier**   \n   \nAvenir is really more of a geometric face in the vein of Futura, thus the name (which of course means \"future\" in French).   \n   \nKristin, if you are including American Gothic faces such as the ones you mentioned by MF Benton, you could also look at [Lightline Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141942/http:/www.identifont.com/show?3OO) and [Clearface Gothic](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141942/http:/www.identifont.com/show?HV). Personally, I like to think of American Gothic faces as a separate (sub-)category to the mainly European Realist Grotesks, not least because most of the American cuts have an old-style three-storey \"g\". ALso, FontBureau have recently released [Benton Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516141942/http:/www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?fontname=BentonSans), a revival of this period. In fact, half the FB catalogue is derived from roughly this period, so you may have some luck there for some of the modern interpretations.\n\n"

There are now over 750 families classified by letterform features of 7 key letters (a, e, g, G, M, R and y).   \n   \nI will leave the genre classification to others (Grotesk/Grotesque, and such terms are too vague and often misused) and try to use a scheme that doesn't depend on such judgments. Look at how much difficulty experts in this group are having agreeing about which are which. In my opinion a classification scheme should be independent of such labeling attempts, because there are too many 'grey' areas in the digital era fonts.\n\n"

It can be a great help in making educated judgements about a particular typeface's suitability for the requirements and context of a given job.   \n   \nMy own research, therefore, was simply a way for me to see what is out there from foundry catalogues both online and offline and to find my favourites in each of the categories. Of course, the standard type classification systems are not very useful, so I had to devise my own system of classification by combining, modifying and extending what is out there. I'm happy with the results, but I have yet to devise a way to share my findings. Perhaps I'll get it together one day...   \n   \nWhat about you?

Even framing my question in this thread required me to expand on the labeling somewhat. Outside of venues such as this, the terms are relatively meaningless   \n   \nThe value in type classifications became clearer to me when I studied more about the history of typography. Bill Moran of Blinc Publishing in St. Paul taught a class at the Minnesota Center for Book Arts that opened my eyes to the technological bases for many developments in typeface design. It was very helpful in understanding type design up until the digital age. Since we are still using those classic designs in digital form, the labels continue to be useful for me.   \n   \nAlso, Mike, I have looked at the Bowfin pages. I find his san serif guide baffling.
