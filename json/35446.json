  "content": "I am proposing a single weight typeface for an identity I have designed and have drawn the alphabet in illustrator.\n\nThe intention is to learn fontographer (very quickly) to allow us to use the typeface for the project.\n\nThe question is then, how difficult is fontographer to get going without any help or time to understand the ins and outs of the program. I realise this is in some respects a silly question. I just need someone to be honest with me with regards to whether this is going to work out. I’ve got about a week before something goes to print.\n\nCheers,\n\nMarc\n\n [‹ Text flow?

      "content": "I have jumped into fontographer and managed the basics, a tip – when transferring the glyphs from illustrator to fontographer is to have a box of the same size around each character (probably based on cap M with ascender and descender heights and slightly larger), otherwise fontographer will scale each character, remember to delete the boxes after importing. Good luck, I’m sure that more qualified users will be able to help with most problems, especially in the Build forum.\n\nTim\n\n"

      "content": "If the initial item going to press doesn’t require a lot of text using this font (a couple of short lines, maybe), you could just place the Illustrator images of the necessary letters in your layout and kern by shifting their boxes. Of course you’ll still want to make a proper font of it, but this might be a quickie method to meet your press deadline for the moment.\n\n"
