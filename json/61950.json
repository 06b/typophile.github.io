  "content": "Dear Typophiles,\n\nI am looking for fonts for character charts like [http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018064025/http:/www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0370.pdf) (only the grid/table on page 2 is relevant). More precisely, I need (1) a font suitable for fairly large glyphs in isolation, and (2) a font to use for small hexadecimal numbers of up to 6 digits (0-9, A-F).\n\n(1) Many of the charts will contain both Latin and Greek or Cyrillic characters, so these should all come from the same font. My current favourite is [ParaType’s ITC Bodoni 72](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018064025/http:/www.paratype.com/pstore/fonts/ITC-Bodoni-72.htm) for Latin and Cyrillic. Do you think the lowercase Greek letters from [GTS Bodoni](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018064025/http:/www.greekfontsociety.gr/pages/en_typefaces20th.html) would work? (Most of the Greek uppercase letters are identical to Latin or Cyrillic letters, and many of the remaining can easily be constructed from similar Latin/Cyrillic letters.)\n\n(1) Other alphabets are also needed, most importantly Hebrew and Arabic, but fonts for those will obviously differ from the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic. Suggestions are welcome.\n\n(2) The hexadecimal numbers must be readable in a small size, and the font design should go well with the Latin/Greek/Cyrillic (possibly ITC Bodoni) as well as with letters from other alphabets. I was thinking of London Underground, but I am not at all sure about that. Part of the reason for using a sans serif rather than ITC Bodoni 6 is that it would presumably be more difficult to find fonts for Hebrew, Arabic and Asian scripts matching the latter.\n\nThanks in advance for any help and ideas.\n\n",
