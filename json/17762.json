However, it’s been developed for Unix and hence non-trivial to run under Windows. But if you feel technically inclined, you should give it a try.\n\n"

If you can find any of these issues, you can get TypeTool 1.3 with them and then upgrade to TypeTool 2.0 at US$39.95.\n\nTypeTool for Windows supports PC Type 1 (.pfb) and PC TrueType / OpenType TT (.ttf) fonts. TypeTool for Mac also supports Mac Type 1 (LWFN/FFIL) and Mac TrueType fonts.\n\nFont Creator 5.0 from [http://www.high-logic.com/fontcreator.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20090925023635/http:/www.high-logic.com/fontcreator.html \"http://www.high-logic.com/fontcreator.html\") is available at US$65 (Home Edition) and US$99 (Pro Edition). It supports PC TrueType (.ttf) fonts and is able to open but not generate OpenType PS (.otf) fonts.\n\nFontForge ( [http://fontforge.sf.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20090925023635/http:/fontforge.sf.net/ \"http://fontforge.sf.net\") ) is the cheapest (free) and supports practically all major font formats but is rather awkward to use. I believe that it requires more knowledge of font format specifics than the two above.\n\nRegards,  \nAdam Twardoch  \nFontlab Ltd.\n\n"

The system contains a couple of graphical editors, but most modules work via the command line or via command files. The syntax used for the command files is fairly simple.\n\nA lot of the batch functionality found in the Ikarus V4 system has been ported to DTL FontMaster and is much more user friendly. For several batch functions the same Ikarus command language can be used. There is no external scripting module necessary in FM for things like the exchange of data between multiple glyph databases, placing of accents, replacement of composites, consistency checking, improving, et cetera. For many of these functions also command files can be used. The separation of the glyph data at one hand and the character naming, Unicode numbering, metrics and naming information at the other hand, which finds its origin in the Ikarus system, is a necessity for handling and controlling font data on a professional level. OpenType layout features can be easily generated for multiple fonts at once by simply selecting a Features file.\n\nIn the new FM 2.5 version font importing and exporting can be done now directly in the Bezier and Ikarus editors. The drawing capabilities have been enhanced and more batch functionality has been added. For those who can manage without an updated manual and have no problem with the AGL 1.2 compatible Character Layout files, a pre-release version of DTL FontMaster 2.5 Light can be downloaded from [http://www.fontmaster.nl/Temporary/FM2.5\\_Light\\_PR.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20090925023635/http:/www.fontmaster.nl/Temporary/FM2.5_Light_PR.html \"http://www.fontmaster.nl/Temporary/FM2.5\\_Light\\_PR.html\")\n\n"
