And then  \nman spoke and there was noise. And man called this noise language and said  \n“This is my Language in which I am well pleased, and I shall have no other  \nlanguages before it.” But Language went forth and multiplied.  \nAnd so it was that Proto-Indo-European begat Balto-Slavic, Germanic, Celtic,  \nItalic, Illyrian,Albanian, Thracian, Hellenic, Armenian, Phrygian, Anatolian,  \nIndo-Iranian and Tocharian and then died of exhaustion & was forgotten.  \nAnd it came to pass that Balto-Slavic subdivided and became Baltic and Slavic  \nand the number of their begating was three .... but  \nthe languages of Slavic were fruitful and multiplied, went condo and ate up  \nthe languages of Baltic.\n\nHellenic begat Greek and Italic begat Latin and had many other languages and  \nwas eaten by its off-spring. Latin begat and begat and begat which was all  \nvery Romantic.\n\nAnd Germanic Begat Anglo-Saxon which had an illicit relationship with Norman  \nFrench, the illegitimate off-spring of Old French and a Northern Dialect of  \nGermanic, & begat Middle English. And Middle English became vague and begat  \nEnglish, a language which even its own speakers do not speak. And so Language  \nmultiplied until the peoples of the earth could not understand themselves, and  \nthere was no understanding.\n\nThere were in that same land Calligraphers and Scribes, and they said “Let  \nthere be an Alphabet that we may grow and prosper.” and so there was an  \nAlphabet. Now in that Alphabet there were letters and unto each letter there was one  \nsound, or two sounds, or three sounds, or two letters for one sound and this  \ngreatly pleased the Calligraphers and Scribes for no others could read it. And  \nso they grew and prospered.\n\nNow each Language took unto itself an Alphabet except Latin. Latin took unto  \nitself the Greek alphabet, and after changing a few letters for copyright  \nprotection, called it Roman and inflicted unto the far reaches of the world, even  \nunto Cleveland in the far west.\n\nAnd the Calligraphers and Scribes conspired together and said “Now there is  \nan Alphabet there must be something to write.” and so they invented Literature.  \nNow those among the Calligraphers and Scribes who produced Literature called  \nthemselves Authors. And the Authors waxed powerful among the Calligraphers and  \nScribes for their writings were as numerous as the forms of the IRS and about  \nas understandable. And those who could not express themselves in their native  \nlanguage quoted important passages in foreign languages and when pressed to  \nexplain their eccentricities exclaimed “I know how to write, let others learn  \nto read.” And those amongst the Calligraphers and Scribes who were not Authors  \ngrew sore afraid; so they invented Critics.\n\nThen arose Joyce, a great one amongst the authors, who spoke for many hours  \nof many things and many were there among those present that drifted off to  \nsleep. There was one present who, after sleeping for many hours, awoke and found  \nthat Joyce was still speaking and this so greatly disturbed his waking thoughts  \nthat he emitted a piercing shriek and ran from the chamber. And thus it was  \nthat the Scream of Consciousness became an integral part of Joyce’s style.\n\nBut there were those amongst the Calligraphers and Scribes who could speak  \nbut plainly. And they, wishing to share in rich spoils of confused thinking  \narose early in the afternoon worked for many minutes and invented Statistics, and  \nMarketing Surveys, and after a three martini dinner did they invent jargon.  \nAnd thus did “Method” become “Methodology” and even the paradigm of “paradigm”  \nshifted and so did plain speaking become confused and plain speakers became  \ngreat by proving whatever they willed. And they called themselves Bureaucrats  \nand worshiped at the Bottom Line.\n\nThen came forth out of this wilderness a prophet unto the Elders among the  \nCalligraphers and Scribes, even unto the High Author and Chief Bureaucrat, and  \ndemanded of them explanations of their deeds. And the Elders answered him in  \nword both wise and wonderful and almost entirely content free. And the prophet  \nsaid unto them “Speak not to me in words of flowing rhetoric for I come from  \nthe wilderness where I was Illuminating the Letters of the Law and yea, I can  \nrecognize the droppings of male bovines when they are displayed before me.” And  \nthey Answered him speaking such words as are not to be recorded in Holy Books.\n\nAnd again he spoke, saying “Lo, it is written, for I have written it, that  \none shall come forth from the wilderness and found a new order amongst the  \nscribes. Behold, here am I.”\n\nAnd these be the words of the Prophet: “Yea, though I speak the words of  \nangels or the words of corruption yet shall they be considered wise; and yea,  \nthough I walk uprightly amongst men or wind sideways through the sand on my belly,  \nyet shall I be respected, and yea, though my ancestry be of noble kin or that  \nof the barracuda and shark yet shall I be honored above all; for I am a  \nLawyer.”\n\nAnd so it came to pass that there was much wailing, and an outcry was  \nheard throughout the world, and there was much litigation, but there was still  \nno understanding.  \nAuthor Unknown\n\n [‹ Show us your NEW Typophile T-shirt!](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119074409/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48766 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Type in South India ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119074409/http:/www.typophile.com/node/48933 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": " **Sum up:** Potted history of letters condenses the history of language and writing into a mind-tickling 864 words using mock biblical tone and quasi-ecclesiastical parlance. Writing style lives life on the Deuterocanonical side of the Old Testament, relying heavily on capitalized key words and the kind of atrophied orthography begat by the changeover from Indo-Germanic to Latin, verifying that ancient scholars made a golden turkey of an error when they swapped the “Th” fuþark rune for the Latin “Y” glyph, merely because the latter looked just like the “Th” fuþark rune. If only pre-Latin-speaking peoples had gone about saying, “Yea”. Except they didn’t. In reality they went about saying “The”, but their scholars let them down with that slip-shod glyph substitution, creating the enduring falsehood of “Yea”.  \nSorry, where was I? Oh yeah, the review. Narrative thread makes out a case for the history of language being convoluted and rather corrupt. The author is correct, it really did develop that way. Humankind starts off bereft of understanding, invents language, then languages, writing, literature, and finally bureaucrats, ad men and lawyers. Humankind winds up bereft of understanding in the end. The author has a point. Language sets out to demystify the human condition, only to obfuscate it. More people need to read this stuff.  \n**For:** Veracity of story, endearing cast of characters.  \n**Against:** Not entirely convincing ecclesiastical linguistic aspiration.  \n**Spec notes:** Hyphenation and comma omissions compromise rhythm and pacing, but not too seriously. Numerous references to U.S place names and culture give away the writer as being in all likelihood a U.S citizen.  \n**Rivals:** No, sorry, nothing springs to mind unless you count works by Coolhand McLuhan.  \n**Also Try:** The [Wikipedia Literature portal](http://web.archive.org/web/20081119074409/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Literature) because the articles are really very good.  \n**Rating:** Three and a half stars.  \n**My choice:** Yes please. I enjoyed it.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

Something that doesn’t happen much around here._  \nI do my best to inject humour into Typophile, and at least half of Typophile’s regular contributors crack jokes whenever they can, but the punchlines aren’t always obvious. Probably many of Typophile’s readers have a good laugh offline, but in cyberspace nobody can hear you laugh.\n\nOh no it’s half past one in the morning again. I have to get some sleep. Goodnight :^)\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "Does it betray my incurable lack of humour when I confess that of all the things, my attention was drawn to the reference to Balto-Slavic and Michael’s subsequent comment on the ’unexplained disappearance of Baltic’? Balto-Slavic is a hypothetical grouping and there is no compelling evidence that they ever formed a single group. Also, the demise of the Baltic languages has been somewhat exaggerated, as Latvian and Lithuanian at least are very much alive.\n\nThat and the fact that the invention of language in this history apparently concerns only those of the Indo-European family.\n\n"
