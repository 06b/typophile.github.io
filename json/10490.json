It kinda jumped out at me when I was looking through my grandma's old photos and stuff, and I haven't been able to figure it out.   \n   \nYour help is appreciated.\n\n",

      "content": "By far the most common Newspaper sans of the pre-digital era was Spartan. What you have here is an exceptionally poor cut of it, with the two-storey 'a' standing out as particularly badly done (I'm not sure which alternates were available, but Jaspert has just the one-storey). It will be hard to track down exactly which manufacturer was responsible for this butchery, but perhaps your curiosity doesn't extend quite that far.\n\n"

But then again, I don't really know what I'm talking about/looking at most of the time.   \n   \nSpartan's a Futura knockoff, but this looks like a much more faithful knockoff, and maybe someone got bored and decided to mess with it a little more? I don't know if things like that happen much.   \n   \nThat two-story 'a' is what caught my eye especially. Otherwise I probably would have just assumed it was Futura. Is your \"particularly bad\" subjective or is there some specific crappiness I'm not noticing?   \n   \nThe 'g' I notice though.   \n   \nI've got some more samples, if they're of any help:   \n   \n ![globedemocratclipping2](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723035821im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70499.jpg)   \n   \nThanks some more.\n\n"

Dwiggins. A sans serif of geometric style. For use for text and display typography.\"   \n   \nNow the question is; does anyone here have links to any specimens on Erbar-Grotesk (1929) ?   \nDwiggins' Metro #2 is familiar, but how does the #1 look like?\n\n"

      "content": "A bit more about Tempo:   \n   \nIt was very popular headline face for newspapers before \"cold type\" took over in the 1970s. As Raph points out, it looks similar to Spartan. Both were modeled on Futura--Spartan to a greater degree and Tempo to a lesser degree.   \n   \nTempo, like some other contemporary geometric sans, had alternate characters so you could make it look like Kabel, Erbar, Vogue, or Futura (with a one-storey a). The reason for this was undoubtably pragmatic. Most of their customers (newspapers) used other manufacturers' equipment (Linotype mainly) for setting text. Ludlow was used for headlines. By offering these alternate characters, they could offer reasonably close matches to the smaller faces set with the other equipment.   \n   \n ![tempo1](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723035821im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70511.gif)   \n   \nThe Light Italic and Medium Italic were very unusual in that they had tails on some of the lowercase characters (m, n, i, u) and other somewhat calligraphic features--even a set of swash caps. The closest I've seen to this is [Neutraface Italic](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723035821/http:/www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfontspecimens). Tempo Italic was definitely in the back of my mind when I dreamed up [Coquette](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723035821/http:/www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/coquette.html).   \n   \n ![tempo2](http://web.archive.org/web/20140723035821im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70512.gif)\n\n"
