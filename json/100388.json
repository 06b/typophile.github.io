      "content": "There's an alternate 'G' in Bello Script (at Unicode 0122, gcommaaccent) that would fit better. The short leading stroke on the subsequent 'r' is awkward to deal with, but can be moved closer to the alternate G. I tried connecting the G to the r, unaesthetically!\n\nThe gcommaaccent alternate would have to be modfied to remove the accent; for some reason that's the ONLY glyph with that alternate 'G'\n\n- Herb\n\n"

But really you want to also alter something to make it more unique and 'say' more about the brand.\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks all. Had an issue with the relationship between the d and h, which we've resolved by creating a ligature. Also made the G bigger which allowed us to move the r in closer and make it more like a vapour which adds the character - it is for a coffee shop after all.\n\nStill a work in progress but hopefully this is moving in the right direction. What do you think?\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819215555im_/http:/typophile.com/files/grindhouse_logo_new2_4785.jpg)\n\n"
