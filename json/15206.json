  "content": "Simple question, can I do a one-to-many substitution in an AAT font?  \nI tried doing an insertion followed by a contextual one-to-one substitution, but the insertion didn't work. In fact I couldn't figure out how to make Insertion work at all.\n\nReason:  \nI want to split up some Indic compound vowel signs (which have unicode codepoints) into the base parts so that I can insert other glyphs (vattus) in between.\n\n- Nicholas\n\n",
