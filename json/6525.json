I really dislike some of his trademark curves and design details, and never use any of his fonts, although I own a nice selection of licenses through the Bitstream Full Library CD-ROM. I must admit I never had the chance to play around with Zapfino, though, maybe that could change my mind.\n\n"

I've put together some photos of vernacular type/lettering that I took in Hong Kong three years ago, and planning a gallery of the Cooper type (excuse me, but I think it's actually a beautiful type... ). Hopefully I'll get those finished by the start of next week. Watch this space!\n\n"

Apparently Zapf is working with Kobayashi on it. Guss what they are doing to it? Rounded corners (in the counters)! And oblique-cut terminals! Sheared corners! If you already have problems with the original Optima (which I don't really), how about this cute and cuddly version, eh?\n\n"

      "content": "I'm only warming up to Python scripting myself. It's basically a way to \"algorithmize\" tasks.   \n   \nLike for the shearing you might say:   \n1. Go around the outline point by point.   \n2. When you find an acute angle of less than 30 degrees\\*: put two new points on either side of the point in question, 2 ems away; dump the original point and connect the two new ones.   \n   \n\\* The shear threshold recommended by Doyald Young.   \n   \nSo you run the script and BAM! in a second you've done the work of a full day. Both RoboFog and FontLab support Python scripting, although I don't think the code is portable. BTW, now that FontLab is so powerful, I don't see much room left for RoboFog.   \n   \n\\> how does he explain that Hz spacing stuff?!   \n   \nYou mean in terms of doing it without a computer? I guess the same way he explains Optima Next: he sits there and talks, and somebody else \"codifies\" things. Either that or he's got a next-generation voice-command system...   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

Oh yes, a lot of CJK fonts are unmistakably calligraphic, but I think it is awkward to combine Western and Eastern calligraphic type like that, because they are based on fundamentally distinct principles and traditions.   \n   \nI'm cooking up some articles on Chinese typography at the moment...
