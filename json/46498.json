It has been altered as well._\n\nAssuming Zapf did it. What if it isn't altered Zapfino, but merely a few glyphs that look like altered Zapfino?\n\n_You were just pulling my leg, right?_\n\nNot really. I just think it's wise not to jump to obvious conclusions based on visual evidence alone. We don't know the Zapfino theory is true, we only assume it is. It's one thing to overlay a sample on top of glyphs from a particular font and say \"it was made out of this but modified\" on account of the similarities, and it's another thing to acquire and provide proof that that is indeed what actually happened.\n\n@Nick Cooke: _I think you’re wrong James - Michael is right; Zapfino is the starting point._\n\nThis is done with outset paths, a bit of skewing here and there and no other manipulation.\n\nA bit more refinement and you’re there.\n\nYour overlay drawing proves nothing other than the similarities between the glyphs in the I.D sample and Zapfino 1. It does not prove Zapfino was the starting point. I looked at Zapfino 1 as well, compared the sample, and concluded it may have been derived from Zapfino, or maybe not. Either way, all you've got is speculation based on what you want to believe, what you want reality to be.\n\nWhoever made the sample glyphs could have drawn them that way by eye using a sample of Zapfino. I could have done it by eye with a sample on-screen or printed and taped to the shadow mask of the screen. Any competent bezier wrangler could have done it by eye.\n\nI'm not saying it wasn't made out of Zapfino. All I'm saying is we don't _know_ it was with certainty. The overwhelming similarities could be coincidental.\n\nAnd I'm playing devil's advocate too. Somebody has to.\n\nj a m e s\n\n"

      "content": "I just tried playing around with Zapfino Forte and Zapfino One, and adding stroke thickness approaches the sample, but the stroke details are wrong, as are the angles. When I tried adding negative shear the M was too skewed if I got close with the I's. I also tried using path offsets with the outlines, and that was closer in some respects, but still had the wrong calligraphic stroke details.\n\nMy inclination, based on my crude attempts, is to say that someone skilled in calligraphy might quite easily imitate the forms of Zapfino, but not without imparting their own signature technique. That's what I suspect we are seeing.\n\nIf your goal is to approximately replicate this, then I agree with using Zapfino as a starting point, unless you have the calligraphic skill to imitate it. Unless you match them side by side, I think it would be hard to describe the differences.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
