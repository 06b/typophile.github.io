  "content": "Hello everyone,\n\ni am currently working on a logo for a cell phone/web-based dating application. After some client feedback, I am now looking for some alternatives to the current font (Linear by E + F). The logomark has been approved, but the current type choice is lacking the ’speed’ element which should be reflected in the type. I’ve tried various light italic sans serifs (with Neutraface being the best match i’ve got so far), but i think that i need something with a lower x-height and shorter extender length (like Linear).\n\nI am grateful for any suggestions,\n\nSeb\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007102632im_/http:/typophile.com/files/speedflirt_4623.png)\n\n [‹ Herb Lubalin, Mother & Child](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007102632/http:/typophile.com/node/29716 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [typeface development ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081007102632/http:/typophile.com/node/29709 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
