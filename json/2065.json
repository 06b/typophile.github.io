      "content": "Jason,   \nJust a quick note and I gues this may be deliberate? but it reads FUS not FYs? which could have both negative and posative implications. Too much fuss. I like the almost hand drawn approach to the three atoms and the way you have ballanced the coffee lettering with some heavy posative kerning, demonstrating some mature typogrphical consideration. Not into the FUZ, not liking the F and Z and I'm not even sure the futuristic look you where going for works with the rest of the sytle. Although there is something appealing about the U, sorry Y?\n\n"

      "content": "jason --- i'd take a look at the F U and S ...   \nThey are legible forms, but odd and uninviting.   \nPutting them on different baselines might not be helping.   \n   \nSeems like the letter U could be a coffee cup with   \nthe atoms above it, where normally steam   \nwould be rising off?   \n   \nOr, maybe not. Forcing a cup into a coffee logo might be cliche.   \n   \nYou could also put a line over the u to indicate   \na Long U perhaps.   \n   \nbj\n\n"

      "content": "So I gather then their is some phonetical reason for the umlaut?   \nAllthough it doesn't seem to connect with the brief you have set yourself or am I missing something?   \n   \nLong ü Short ü   \nSpelling: üh, ü Spelling: ü, y   \nPronunciation: No similar sound in English, but the same as the vowel in French rue. To produce it, say the German long i, then round the lips as for long u. Do not allow your tongue to move toward the back of your mouth as you round your lips. Note the difference between the long rounded back vowel u, and the long rounded front vowel ü. Pronunciation: A shorter version of German long ü. To produce it, say the German short i, then round the lips as for short u. Do not allow your tongue to move toward the back of your mouth as you round your lips. Note the difference between the short rounded back vowel u, and the short rounded front vowel ü.\n\n"

It would be like a line of juice drinks here called \"Sir Real\" they use campy fake Surrealist Images on their products (and some of the worst type treatments I've ever seen).

Ill give the beans thing a shot and work on the type.   \n   \nSorry about not being able to scan my sketches tiffany, my scanner is not being very nice to me lately ![:-(](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018085620im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif)   \n   \npaul-   \ni might not be using the umlaut correctly. the company was originally called fuze. i had experimented with different ways of spelling the same word... fuse and f\n\n"

      "content": "Jason, don't let the logo dictate the marketing. The marketing is the cream sugar and coffee all in one. I think you should simplify the mark and let the packaging tell the marketing story. So concentrate on a mark that creates an umbrella for the coffee company. What if they came out with a coffee that after you drank it you'd have a mint after taste in your mouth. Ask yourself does the mark allow the coffee company to grow. Dan\n\n"

The circulating rings get lost on the transparent package, but are still subtly there which is kind of nice.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018085620im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/21076.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "Jason think in terms of the entire line of coffees. What is the color scheme for Decafe for instance? I also would like the background of the logo to be a richer warmer color. Also think about possibly printing on a metalic foil label. That way you could use white as a color to print and the background of regular blend could have a yellow printed over a silver foil and a white regular blend printed over that. That way you could let the silver knock out from your richer brown color for your logo. It would be a rich label. In the case I propose you'd need to include the \"All in one coffee filters\" into the single label.\n\n"
