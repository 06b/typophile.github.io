  "content": "Hi all,\n\nI am in the market for a new typeface, its for my own business, I own a web design company.\n\nI have some shapes in my head, I know I will probably get slated for this, but at the minute, the closest I can find is actually the logo for a bank:\n\n[http://www.barclaycard.co.uk/\\_images/header/logo\\_alt.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023213202/http:/www.barclaycard.co.uk/_images/header/logo_alt.gif \"http://www.barclaycard.co.uk/\\_images/header/logo\\_alt.gif\")\n\nI believe the type is a custom font, by the bloke who made Arial of all people. Anyway, what I like about it is that it is both curvy, yet not too playful, gets that's the sort of thing I am looking for.\n\nCan anyone make any suggestions?\n\nThanks\n\n",
