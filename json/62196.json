Like Centaur, it is a revival of the work of [Nicolas Jenson](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018095246/http:/typophile.com/wiki/Nicolas%20Jenson) – and it has a sans companion!  \nFurthermore, I can imagine [Today Sans](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018095246/http:/new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/today-sans/) to work quite well.\n\nRelated thread: [Sans Companion for Bembo Book](http://web.archive.org/web/20131018095246/http:/typophile.com/node/31046)  \nF\n\n"

Unfortunately, quite incomplete, so, while it might be usable for some display work, it's nowhere near ready for being a text face for a book.\n\n"
