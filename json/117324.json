I assume the font on the top line has been modified and the squiggle lines at either end have been added. Any help is appreciated.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725033958im_/http:/typophile.com/files/end-of-the-line-pub_4050.jpg)\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [end-of-the-line-pub.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20140725033958/http:/typophile.com/files/end-of-the-line-pub.jpg) | 15.3 KB |\n\n",

The centre spurs are similar to some of the Tuscan fonts and to Old or Wild West fonts, but the curls on the P, B and E are different. Now I am driven to find out what this font is ;) It certainly is handsome.\n\n"
