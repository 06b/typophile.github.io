Looks like they mixed [Avenir](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804112421/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/avenir) (mainly because of /C and /R) and [Futura](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804112421/http:/www.myfonts.com/search/futura) (/S looks pretty dead on) then beveled it. This [PDF](http://web.archive.org/web/20140804112421/http:/www.carltonsw1.com/downloads/CarltonSW1_Brochure.pdf) embeds the original woodmark as vector, no font.\n\n"
