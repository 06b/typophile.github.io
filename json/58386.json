The \"nearly\" qualifier is because Acrobat _also_ is able to antialias monochrome bitmaps of sufficiently high resolution (one can guess that to be \\> 1.5 x physical screen dpi).\n\nIf you _have_ a real pixel (bitmap) font that you can use in InDesign, that will be passed on to the PDF unchanged; i.e., as pixels.\n\nHowever, I'm pretty sure you cannot use real bitmap fonts in InDesign--it's way too smart to allow that. Perhaps you have a simulated pixel font instead ( [Press Start](http://web.archive.org/web/20111211234414/http:/www.zone38.net/font/) comes first to mind). Those fonts are vector fonts, just like anything else, and just like other vector fonts it will be antialiased for screen in Acrobat.\n\nIf you really _really_ want a pixel font, create the text as image in Photoshop and place that into InDesign.\n\nAlternatively, you can do it the other way around: read your InDesign created PDF into Photoshop and rasterize; then save that as PDF again.\n\n"
