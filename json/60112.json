      "content": "Hey Chung,\n\nIt's probably a typeface they designed themselves, I'm study type design and typography in holland the Hague and the system used for this face is what's teached nowadays. The repetition of forms: if you look at the shape of the \"u\" this is simply a rotated \"n\" and the \"n\" is the left side of the \"m\". This system works in the beginning of type design but is not as sophisticated as typefaces that are constructed for the best optical effect.\n\nFor these reasons I think it's something done by this academy.  \nI do think it's a nice typeface for headings though.\n\ngood luck,  \nSidney\n\n"
