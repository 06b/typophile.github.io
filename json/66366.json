I try not to over-do the diagonal stress, so it'd work through the weights with fairly egual strength, even though in thin weights there is only so much one can do. That is why tried to damp the heavier weights.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Tip1_3867.png)\n  \nand italics:  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161912im_/http:/typophile.com/files/tip2_6100.png)\n\nI now try to attach pdf's:\n\ntwo(2) pdf's are attached succesfully.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Tip Italic-sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161912/http:/typophile.com/files/Tip%20Italic-sample_3.pdf) | 225.12 KB |\n| [Tip-weights-sample.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150414161912/http:/typophile.com/files/Tip-weights-sample_3.pdf) | 112.76 KB |\n\n",
