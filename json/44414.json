  "content": "Greetings everyone. This surely is a very basic question. I’m usíng MS Word for making the pdfs for my PhD thesis (yes, I know, but it’s all text). I use Adobe Garamond in Postscript 1 format (it’s the university’s standard font so I don’t have much choice). ¨  \nNow, the two basic ligatures (i.e. fl and fi) do not show up in the symbol window but I found that they can be got by using another font first, insert the ligature and then change back to AGaramond. The problem is that while it looks perfect on screen it won’t transfer to pdf with any application of several I’ve used (neither will it print). There’s simply an error symbol of different kinds.  \nIs there any way of avoiding to have to buy the expert set? My deadline for the printing office is in two days so I may have to do this (and it’s not a lot of money) but it irritates me - and I don’t understand why it looks perfect on screen, the definition files must surely be in there somewhere(?).  \nAny help with this surely obviously amateur problem would be greatly appreciated. Thank you...\n\n [‹ so called 'Customized Typefaces'](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905090422/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44425 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [need some help identifying a program ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080905090422/http:/www.typophile.com/node/44401 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
