So I'm sticking it up for you guys to tear into.  \nI have thick skin - so don't hold back.\n\nI would like to create a really solid, corporate, sans serif, and i guess this is the boldish weight.\n\nany thoughts? like / don't like .. stuff i need to look at..\n\nfor me the 'h' 'm' and 'n' aren't working yet, and the 'e' is close but not quite.\n\nI'd hugely appreciate any input.\n\nMany thanks in advance.\n\nJamie\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [gallagher.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20130819202030/http:/typophile.com/files/gallagher.pdf) | 59.65 KB |\n\n",

      "content": "The first thing that I notice is the unevenness of visual weight between characters. It looks like you're relying too much on making sure the measurement is the same rather than making sure the visual weight is the same. Like in the last line, \"forever\", the r's and v look much heavier than the o and e's. The same thing is happening with the letter sizes -- the o, because it doesn't have any decoration, looks smaller than the other letters. It looks like you do have the curves overhanging the median and baseline a bit, but you just need to balance that out more for each letter so that the positive and negative space optically balance out to look the same size.\n\nThere is a lot of indecision going on between mechanical shapes and more tapered humanist forms -- the letter h really stands out in \"together\" because it's so mechanical, but you said you're still figuring out some of the letters. But on the letter t, for example, it looks very top-heavy because the top is so mechanical, but the bottom is more soft and tapered. I would expect that t to fall over if I left it alone :)\n\n"

      "content": "The bottoms of the g (descender) and the e don't feel like they match the rest of the typeface, as well as the descender of the j (maybe closer to the t?) The curves on the top of the m feel a little uneven to me. It may be an optical issue. They seem a little flat on the upper right, and the stroke looks a little thick on the upper left. The stems of the g, b, q, p, d look thick in comparison to the bowls, or maybe the issue is vice versa. Overall, I like the simplicity and the short height of all the ascenders (i, l, f, d, etc all the same height). The proportions seem well balanced to me.\n\n"

      "content": "great feedback.\n\nre weights - im looking at that first, i think ill lighten the whole thing slightly, adn try to balance that r/v/e/ weighting issue.\n\non a design / style issue.. I am wrestling with the balance of mechanical vs the more 'humanist tapered' forms. my objective is to create something very 'neutral' and with the simplicity of quite geometric shapes - almost removing any 'decoration' but i don't want it to have that look of a mac cut font, with copy and pasted flipped shapes.\n\nI think chipmans comment about the e and g is spot on, but it highlights my dilemma.. i had cut the g to match the j, but it made the font too individual and gave it too much of a visual hook.  \nI like the cheeky friendly look that the g ad e give the font, but am reluctant to cut other letters more in this vein as i'm worried ill lose the simple neutrality of the a/b/d/f/i/j/k/l..(which cature more of the real character im aiming for)\n\nill try pushing it both ways and post another pdf in a day or so.\n\nthanks again for your time looking at this for me.\n\nJamie\n\n"

Don't go to number and UC yet because your lc is still far from being finished.\n\nYour last revision is better when it comes to even stroke width but you're still having problems. Stroke joins are not ok. \"a\" and \"r\" have problematic joins. Some double storey letters have too heavy stems: p, t, h, k... k is also too heavy.\n\nAnd what's up with \"q\"'s slant cut stem? No other letter has it and if it does have a slanted cut it doesn't have it up to this extent.\n\n\"f\", \"t\", \"j\", \"g\", \"r\", \"y\" have different style. Theri termination is too different.\n\nSo please don't hurry to numbers and UC.\n\n"

      "content": "I like what you've done with the t, though perhaps make the crossbar a bit wider, and the tail the same. I think k's waist needs to slide down the stem a bit more.  \nLook at your c and f. The stroke ends at a different angle. They need to harmonise more.  \nYou have a nice tilt on the top of the ascenders, try repeating this at the bottom of the p and q.  \nm and n look the right kind of width. v looks narrow though.\n\nOne thing to remember is that the letters need to be read together, so it's useful to have a preview window open showing words whilst you're moving nodes around.\n\nIf you want to start on numbers or uppercase, i don't think that's a bad idea...it might help you firm up which direction the font is going in, and allow you to come back to the lowercase a bit fresher. On the other hand, it could be too difficult until you know what shapes are likely to be involved and just be confusing! People like to work in different ways.\n\n"
