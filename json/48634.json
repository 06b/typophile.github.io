      "content": "I am starting to think this might have been custom work, but I found some intriguing similarities in some of the late Bob Alonso's work, especially [Alonso Flair](http://web.archive.org/web/20110417082142/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/alonso-flair/), which has a similar M and A among other letters. Several other fonts by him include details similar to this lettering. Reading his [profile](http://web.archive.org/web/20110417082142/http:/www.myfonts.com/person/alonso/bob/), it was apparent that he did a lot of lettering and font design in his career, and it may be possible he did the lettering for this film's credits.\n\nThe only references I could find in earlier threads had to do with the movie's web site back in 2004 (now gone), and Yves said they used a customized Trajan for that. I don't think it could have been the same lettering that you are asking about.\n\n- Mike Yanega\n\n"
