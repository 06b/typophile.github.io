It reminds me a little bit of Pertsov Skoropis (which won at the Kyrillitsa '99 awards).   \n   \nhhp\n\n"

It's really quite lovely, and   \nfor some reason, [PsyOps](http://web.archive.org/web/20150423153419/http:/www.psyops.com/html/services.html) comes to mind if you're   \nconsidering distribution. RXC doesn't just run a   \nfoundry, I hear he acts as a mentor for designers   \nwith potential to produce some premium final   \nproducts. Give it some thought.   \n   \nI like the raised period for added handwritten   \nfeel, but maybe it's just a tad too high.   \n   \nHrant is right, we need to see a full character   \nset and maybe a bit larger to make up for the   \nlow-res of the Web.   \n   \nGreat work, Andrij. There is a real shortage of   \nmodern handwritten scripts that really look like   \nthey were made by hand and not a computer.   \nKeep working toward that end and you'll have   \nsomething unique.\n\n"
