  "content": "I've been using Tribute a lot lately and found a character I didn't recognize. It's in the Italic face and is the Nr. character. I assume it's an abbreviation for \"number\" (like No.), but I wanted to consult with the experts.\n\nYou know what happens when people assume. Thanks for taking a look.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Character.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417051054/http:/typophile.com/files/Character.png) | 14.96 KB |\n\n",

See this [wiki article about \"No.\"](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417051054/http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No.).\n\nThis is the second [German-specific](http://web.archive.org/web/20150417051054/http:/typophile.com/node/62727) font feature I've seen posted about today.\n\n"
