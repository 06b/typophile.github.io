The letterform indicates it doesn't know whether it's serif or sans-serif; it looks more like it belongs to something like Didot than to other characters in the Helvetica set. The lowercase \"a\" seems to have the same problem. Please see my examples below.\n\nI would have to say Gotham or Trade Gothic are much more beautiful than Helvetica and are true sans-serif typefaces…even Futura has more consistent letterforms…but it's a gutsy tattoo nonetheless!\n\nCory Lasser  \nParsons School Of Design  \nDegree Candidate\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20141109221147im_/http:/typophile.com/files/HELL_6142.jpg)\n\n"

A font is an industrial product, a tool for making an infinite number of letters the same way every time. Tattooing is a hand process, perhaps the last imaging art to defy automation. For those who find tattoos beautiful, the beauty is that each stroke is unique, as organic as the body it's inked on.\n\n"

Still if it were called Adobe Robert Slimbach Pro it would still be beautiful.\n\nI consider Adobe fonts to be of a good quality.\n\nPS - As your skin changes with age the counters and the kerning will all warp. Luckily its on your back. Otherwise it would become a bad obsession you could never correct.\n\nPPS - Its still pretty awesome you went through with it.\n\n"
