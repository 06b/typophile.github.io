The solution is designed to help OEMs, independent software vendors and developers build software products and connected devices that deliver the best user experiences.\n\nEnfocus, a leading provider of tools that control the quality of PDF files for print during the document workflow process, is the first partner to implement Monotype Baseline capabilities. The company today announced the Enfocus PitStop 12 series of PDF preflight tools, which introduce the ability to replace missing or corrupted fonts in PDF files – a scenario that has plagued printers and publishers since the advent of digital publishing – by sourcing the correct fonts from the cloud. Using Monotype’s technology, PitStop 12 enables the automatic detection of missing or corrupted fonts, as well as the ability to automatically search to find the right ones to update the PDF with the correct fonts before it’s printed.\n\nThe Monotype Baseline platform debuts with secure, programmatic access to a searchable catalog of approximately 30,000 fonts via documented and licensed APIs. The fonts support more than 40 Latin-based and non-Latin languages, with more fonts expected to be available over time. The platform also includes functionality for user administration, authentication, billing and usage reporting of fonts used within partners’ products or services.\n\n",
