  "content": "Hello!\n\nI’m looking for a bitmap typeface with a construction similar to these ones:  \nScreen Matrix, Knit map and Folk art.  \nI would like it to be more neutral then folk art but more gentle and delicate then Screen Matrix.  \nDo you have any suggestions that might help me?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [folk art.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009143437/http:/typophile.com/files/folk%20art.jpg) | 38.81 KB |\n| [screen matrix.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009143437/http:/typophile.com/files/screen%20matrix.jpg) | 40.63 KB |\n| [knitmap.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009143437/http:/typophile.com/files/knitmap.jpg) | 44.41 KB |\n\n [‹ Canadian ad campaign inspired by unfortunate video store sign](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009143437/http:/typophile.com/node/33365 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Help finding a good sans serif face for media magazine ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071009143437/http:/typophile.com/node/33316 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",
