Jodie is right, Arete Mono is definitely the closest you could get. As Matt Willey is well-known for his work in editorial type design (Port Magazine, Wired, Elephant Magazine, New York Times Magazine...), it could easily be a custom job based on Arete Mono, adjusting and redrawing some letters.\n\n"
