  "content": "The Goudy International Center for Font Technology and Aesthetics is the first worldwide independent resource center for dissemination of information about type, its history, development, and its use in documents, and is housed in the School of Printing Management and Sciences at [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922070017/http:/typophile.com/wiki/RIT). The Center offers courses addressing a broad range of technical, aesthetic, historic, and legal aspects of alphabets and typefaces, including those from both Western and non-Western cultures, as well as offering courses focused on the typography and design of documents. A major area of concern in the Center's courses and research is the development of multicultural document creation skills.\n\n[http://www.rit.edu/~goudyctr/](http://web.archive.org/web/20130922070017/http:/www.rit.edu/~goudyctr/ \"http://www.rit.edu/~goudyctr/\")\n\n",
