  "content": "Hi everyone\n\nAny sugestions to what would be the best font to use in a Bible. The format will be pocket size so the size of the font will have to be small, probably between 6 and 7. Traditionally bibles have two columns, but i might use one since its quite a small format.\n\nSo far have experimented with\n\nWarnock Pro (I like its optical font)\n\nFrutiger (a fresh and youth feel to it)\n\nKepler\n\nAny more suggestions...\n\nThanks\n\nSorry, if i have post this in the wrong place, I am new to this forum...\n\n",

It is optimized for print in small text sizes (between 6 and 10 point). Yet, some of its features prove to be interesting characteristics at larger sizes also: such as the ‘dug-out’ shoulder junctions of h, n, m etc, and the thin midriff of lowercase g (designed to avoid filling in at small sizes).\n\nParable has low stroke contrast, making it robust and adaptable to many circumstances, and it has a proportionally large x-height for optimum legibility in text. The italic provides a strong, cursive contrast to the roman, and attention has been paid to giving it a distinct identity, with quite different forms for certain characters of punctuation (see margin). With small capitals, and bold & extra bold weights, Parable is equipped for all kinds of complex typography.\"\n\n"
