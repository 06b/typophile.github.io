  "content": "Hi\n\nI’m running the new dual intel G5 with Creative Suite 2 (version 4.04), with 2Gb of ram. I’m experiencing regular crashes, when I go to export, print, click on the gradient box, select different tools etc. By process of elimination I’ve worked out that the font Optima (given a clean bill of health by Font Doctor) is causing crashes. In all probability other fonts are causing problems as well.\n\nHas anyone experience the same problems? And is there a fix??\n\nWe’re considering buying in the adobe font library and deleting all our fonts but it’s not certain to fix the problem?\n\nCan anyone help?\n\nAlso I can’t seem to post this on the adobe site, even though I’m registered - I’m denied access. Could someone explain how I post? or do it for me??\n\nThanks for any help on this matter.\n\n [‹ PS OpenType to Windows Type 1 conversion](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200136/http:/typophile.com/node/31699 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Proper policy in font naming for PS1 production ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200136/http:/typophile.com/node/31681 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If your time is worth anything, it would likely be cheaper to re-purchase the fonts. And to do such a conversion, you need some software. Trans-Type or FontLab cost some money, but can make the process easier, once you figure them out.\n\nAs a for-instance, I had long ago made database fonts of all out Type 1 fonts — we ran TeX out of a DOS-box, and could encode fonts on the fly. I often had more glyphs in a font than are available in the “new” OpenType versions, so repackaging them in an OpenType wrapper saves both money and time. This is an odd situation, & if something similar isn’t at play (or your time is worth nothing), better to rebuy.\n\n"

The only solution I’ve found so far is to make sure I’m only running one flavour — either T1 or TT, doesn’t matter which, although TT is easier — and not try to mix them.\n\n(On the flip side, I’ve been having strangeness with Futura and Word 2004 Mac: when double-clicking a Word document and Word firing up, I get a message that Futura is corrupt and that I need to disable it. Then Word promptly hangs, and I can’t delete the offending document because it is “busy” — even though I have no applications open.\n\nRebooting lets me drop-open the Word doc with TextEdit, but there are a few things, such as documents from clients, for example that I really do want to fire up Word with.\n\nThoughts?)\n\n"

(At least it booted up this time, which was an improvement.) Clicking OK turned them off: well, that’s not a reasonable option!\n\nJust for laughs, I ran the most recent update for Office 2004.\n\nTurned the fonts all back on, tried opening Word again. Got the message again, and did a Cmd-. so it skipped to the next font. Only had to do it for maybe ten fonts, and then it opened properly, with all my fonts listed, but not in their style. OK, that’s a compromise I can live with.\n\n"

Even though it checked out fine I’m pretty sure that this was actually font corruption as it was from a collection of six TT fonts and was the only one of the six causing the problem.\n\nTry nuking the OS install and start over, this time managing fonts from a software-created library and only load what you need for projects you’re using. If it keeps happening, it could be that your fonts are just old and cruddy and you’ll have to buy them again. But this time make a backup disc and keep the original where it can’t get lost!\n\n"

One set of outlines is chosen according to the resolution of the device on which the font is being used. Hybrid font programs are typically used for typeface designs with subtle curves that are beyond the Flex mechanism’s capabilities. At high resolutions a set of outlines with full fidelity to the design is used; at low resolutions a set of outlines with straighter edges is used. An example of a hybrid font program in the Adobe Type Library is Optima.”\n\nIn [Adobe Type 1 Font Format](http://web.archive.org/web/20070911200136/http:/partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/font/T1_SPEC.PDF) (PDF file)\n\n"
