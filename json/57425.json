It is so cool. No complex calculations. Writing a standards manual can get complicated real quite. Basic usage guidelines are good, but don't create a standards manual unless you charged for it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[_...from the Fontry_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129061154/http:/www.thefontry.com/)\n\n"

I imagine Pantone process uncoated is standard?\n\nI will convert text to outlines, but how do you convert strokes to objects? I've always wondered how to avoid scaling stroke issues, but didnt know there was a successful solution. And thanks for reminding me to include versions without shading!\n\nAs for providing rasterised version, I thought EPS' were vector based? Maybe not. Is it best then to include the vectored logo as a pdf? Good point on providing rasterized logos at different sizes.\n\nAs for providing any guidelines, I didn't plan on doing anything too lengthy because the client isn't matching my original quote for the job so I don't intend to bend over backwards for them. I was going to include basic colour, font, information, etc...\n\nThanks again for your replies! I feel like I've learnt a lot in the space of a few minutes! (junior designer at work here...)\n\n"

Then I design a specifications sheet that shows the file names/formats so the user can understand: \"logoc.tif\" would be color, .tif format. If I'm ambitious I'll design more detailed guidelines that show how to use/not use the logo.\n\n"

Routers and plotters only see vectors.\n\n_I thought EPS’ were vector based?_\n\nAn eps file can have embedded bitmaps. And, since your logo may have to cross platforms, sometimes fountain fills are converted to ugly bitmaps in some software conversions.\n\n_Is it best then to include the vectored logo as a pdf?_\n\nPDFs cross platforms and software boundries best with the least problems.\n\n_...but how do you convert strokes to objects?_\n\nThat depends on your software. Illustrator has a feature under path, I think, outline stroke.\n\nI also can't stress enough, test all formats and make everything backwards compatible. Not everyone has the software budget they would like to have. Some of us would like to have a software budget.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n[_...from the Fontry_](http://web.archive.org/web/20150129061154/http:/www.thefontry.com/)\n\n"

Having been on the receiving end of corporate standards manuals in the past, the bigger and more detailed they are, the less likely they are to be followed. A one- or two-page list of basic dos and don'ts should suffice.\n\nIf you do want to specify a minimum amount of space round the logo, it may be worth­while actually including that space in the files you create, so that any awkward so-and-so who wants to break the guidelines will have to resort to a \"sin of commission\" (intentionally cropping the image) rather than the merely ignorant \"sin of omission\" (just sticking another logo or some text right next to it).  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \nEver since I chose to block pop-ups, my toaster's stopped working.\n\n"
