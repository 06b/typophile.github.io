  "content": "My attempts of setting and printing a page (really just a snippet of a page) of Latin Vulgate the old-fashioned way. The captions are in Russian , but there's nothing new in them for seasoned typophiles :)\n\n[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ndfi73kNbI](http://web.archive.org/web/20131015061110/http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ndfi73kNbI \"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ndfi73kNbI\")\n\nA few notes:\n\nSadly, my fount does not contain a set of ligatures, long s's, half r's and other fraktur niceties.\n\nI am printing with just a single roller, as the other one swelled up and needs replacing (actually, both of them do, but triple-inking with just the one works for now).\n\nOur eagle-eyed masters will undoubtedly notice that the sorts are added to the composing stick from the wrong end. This is because the matter is already set at this point, and I am just correcting the mistakes.\n\nMissing from the video, are steps for creating hand-made paper, painting of the floral borders and illumination of the hand-drawn initials.\n\nHope you enjoy it!\n\n",
