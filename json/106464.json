It's like a mix of Ando and Trump Gothic – with Eurostile. But with rounded caps and ultracondensed. The pincher is that I swear I have it and have used it before. Hoping someone will look at it and say \"It's \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Dummy, you know this.\"\n\n[RefrigeratorDeluxe is close](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054852/http:/fontdeck.com/typeface/refrigeratordeluxe)\n\nFont:&nbsp;\n\n Arvil \n\nSolved By:&nbsp;\n\n [Ryuk](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054852/http:/typophile.com/user/22675 \"View user profile.\")\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [per.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054852/http:/typophile.com/files/per.jpg) | 8.7 KB |\n| [likeurostile.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317054852/http:/typophile.com/files/likeurostile.jpg) | 26.87 KB |\n\n",
