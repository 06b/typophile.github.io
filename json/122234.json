  "content": "Please share your thoughts on the pairing of the following as a serif (text type) and sans serif (display and caption type) combination for a small book of photo-graphic/typographic images:  \n1 Sirba and Soliel  \n2 Sirba and Myriad Pro\n\nMy initial interest is in the complementary relationship of Sirba and Myriad Pro in terms of ascender height, x-height, character width, friendliness and readability. However, Soliel \"feels\" like a hybrid of Myriad Pro and Avenir that may be a bit more complementary.\n\nI appreciate any feedback based on your experiences with these typefaces.\n\nThank you,  \nJudy\n\nPS: Attached sample is Myriad Pro and Avenir for Display and Constantia for Text to come as close as possible to the intended type pairing ... until I purchase Sirba and/or Soliel.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [YesBob\\_sample.png](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317175711/http:/typophile.com/files/YesBob_sample_0.png) | 15.6 KB |\n\n",
