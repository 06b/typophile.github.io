  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to put together a nice presentation template for my new department at work. Unfortunately, I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to my talks, and so I'm not happy to putting a pixelated PNG in my talk as the department logo.\n\nUnfortunately, the person who put this image together is no longer working here, I'm told, so noone knows what font was used. I'm trying to recreate this logo in high quality.\n\nI'd like to request an ID on this font, and ideally, a free font that is as close to this one as possible, such that I may recreate it.\n\nI think I've IDed the font as Scylla, although confirmation would be fantastic. It's not free, so I can't try it. I've attached the logo, and look forward to your opinions and suggstions.\n\nThanks,  \nQuentin\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [eeb.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20131011212819/http:/typophile.com/files/eeb.jpg) | 34.58 KB |\n\n",
