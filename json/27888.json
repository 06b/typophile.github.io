I am starting to think of things, but am curious to know if you were offered this opportunity, what would you do? thanks! —Dan\n\n",

Perhaps something there will ping you in the right way. Click on **Research** and then **Past Theses**.\n\nIn addition, you could check out [TypeCulture.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20131021181625/http:/www.typeculture.com/) which has an amazing collection of materials for research.\n\n"
