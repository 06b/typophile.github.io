      "content": "SF Fedora is a decent font, but there are issues that you should be aware of. You can compare the Fedora font (and also a font called \"Adventure\" by Neale Davidson) on my website. Yes, I know this is a shameless plug, but my Safari font really is the best Indiana Jones font out there.\n\nDesigning a typeface based on the \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Indiana Jones) poster is much trickier than one might guess. It's not a matter of simply tracing the artwork on the poster. Try tracing the letters in \"Raiders\" and then spelling the word \"ideas.\" It will look bad -- real bad. In order to get the font to work you have to redraw every glyph and make all kinds of adjustments so that when you use the font, and type out a word, it looks presentable.\n\nI've spent a lot of time making \"Safari\" look good. I hope you'll compare it to the others.\n\n[http://davidocchino.com/portfolio/typography/safari.html#compare](http://web.archive.org/web/20150315094542/http:/davidocchino.com/portfolio/typography/safari.html#compare \"http://davidocchino.com/portfolio/typography/safari.html#compare\")\n\nAnd if you can give me any feedback on how to make the font even better, I'd love to hear it. Thanks!\n\nDavid Occhino  \nDavid Occhino Design\n\n"
