I've been tasked with recreating it as a vector, in all it's glory :). And, as is often the way of the world, they haven't given me all the info. Thanks!\n\nMorgan\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Voga Salon Logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20131014220739/http:/typophile.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-03%20at%2012.50.16%20PM.png) | 62.52 KB |\n\n",
