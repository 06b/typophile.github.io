Specifically, I'm looking for examples of Tony DiSpigna's work and his Spencerian Scripts such as this:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131116164740im_/http:/typophile.com/files/herb_lubalin_063.jpg)\n\nCan anyone point me to a website or PDF that I can study multiple examples of his work?\n\n",
