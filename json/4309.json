For authenticity's sake I'm trying to use all the pronunciation symbols (&#601; [schwa], &#331; [ng], etc.) and finding a font that has full support is frustrating. Right now I'm just using Times New Roman, but it's not quite right, though it has support for some of the symbols. Anyone know any better fonts out there to make a good Oxford English Dictionary spoof?\n\n",
