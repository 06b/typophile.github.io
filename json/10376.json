      "content": "In the book \\_Counter punch\\_ there is a reference to the earliest cutting of very small text size faces.   \n   \nSince book work is determined by conventional parent paper sizes, today and to some extent, always, there is only a certain range of point sizes that are appropriate. Early paper sizes were regulated in regard to size based on previous formats, which were based on the size of animal skins, e.g., goats, calves. An elephant folio sheet was one entire animal. Uterine calf was used for miniatures (both mother and unborn were sacrificed). The monestaries dedicated to scribal work were mass slaughterhouses, but set the standard that we still abide by.   \n   \n14-point is hardly an extremely large size however. The fine printer-publisher William Everson, who worked in larger format, recommended 16-pt as the ideal size for bookwork. Victor Hammer often worked at the larger end of the spectrum as well. There is some validity in this as most faces do seem to show their form best at larger sizes. This may be more a fine press/letterpress thing though. Fairly large text sizes are much more friendlier in regard to presswork. And, then there is the market as well; larger format books tend to have a higher selling price and are more likely to attract collectors.\n\n"

Especially in the context of religion, I take an etymological stance on tradition: always remembering that it is from the Latin verb _traditio,_ to hand on. Tradition is all about passing on of something of inherent value from one generation to another. Conversely, old-fashioned implies simply doing something superficially in the way it used to be done, without critically considering whether the thing has inherent value. The kind of ultramodernism to which you refer is similarly uncritical, in that it tends to treat all tradition as if it were merely a matter of fashion and taste, and not of inherent value. Some traditionalists, of course, make the opposite mistake, and in their fervour to defend tradition against modernist or post-modernist assault will adopt a reactionary position that clings to anything old-fashioned as a kind of reassurance. It seems to me that the only healthy position in all these options is that of true tradition: which requires a critical consideration of both past and present, but with dutiful acceptance of what is handed to us, maintaining it and handing it on in our turn, _and erring on the side of this_ traditio _if we are uncertain about or unable to understand the value of what we have been handed._\n\n"
