That's because, typically, a web page gets laid out in pixel-sized boxes without explicit heights and without regard to font metrics and text just gets poured into it. When the text re-wraps, the bottom of the box moves upwards or downwards, depending. This can also happen at different Zoom levels, as well.  \nThis kind of design is made possible only because the page can scroll endlessly downward to accomodate however much text you throw into the box or boxes. An escape hatch of sorts.\n\nChristopher, (or anybody, please), do you know of any studies about the effect of scrolling on reading?\n\nBTW - The effect you've described on Zoom can be mitigated greatly by sizing the containing HTML element not in pixels, but in em units. If done precisely, yes, the character count will change a bit but the number of lines can remain unchanged so the height of the \"golden rectangle\" remains the same.  \nYou rarely see pages designed this way for at least two reasons:\n\n1) Until recently, support for the em unit was uneven from browser to browser.\n\n2) It's so much less work to just let the text flow downward.\n\nNow that fonts can be linked to web pages, and almost all new browsers support the soft hyphen, maybe there will be a bit more attention paid to onscreen typesetting. We shall see. Certainly with static content of importance it makes some sense to take the time.\n\nAlso, as of Firefox 3.6, Firefox has followed the lead of IE8 and given web developers a JavaScript property with which to measure the Zoom level. So at least on the initial loading of the page, there does not necessarily have to be a change in character count at all - it can be rigged programmatically to be the same at every Zoom level.  \nHowever, the text actually looks better if you let it reflow a bit and settle in.  \nI'll be trying to talk browser makers into giving web developers an **onzoom** and (in IE) an **ontextsizechange** _event_ so that user-changes to Zoom and Text Size can be detected programmatically. With those tools the issue of line length and column width at any Zoom can be solved completely and permanently.\n\n@hrant\n\n\\>I will even change the words and/or the line measure to  \n\\>get a good rag.\n\nYeah, so will I. But few people bother. (I assume you're talking onscreen?)  \nAnd did you ever wonder why most printed text (in English, at least) is justified and hyphenated and almost nothing on the web is?  \nDoesn't have to be that way anymore. All new browsers support the soft-hyphen and the means to massage and tweak the text to avoid widows, orphans, rivers, etc... exist.\n\nIMHO - scrolling interferes with a smooth reading experience much more than most people realize. We've just had to accept it.\n\n(Sorry for going on about this. An area of special interest to me.)\n\n[rich](http://web.archive.org/web/20150121023817/http:/readableweb.com/)\n\n"

A typographer with poor eyesight. How ironic). Even my supervisor who is 30 years my seniour thinks it's funny how big I like my screen type. I tend to increase the size of type as big as I can without inducing a horizontal scroll or to ~65 cpl. Whichever comes first.\n\nRe: forcing line-breaks and accessibility software, an old friend of mine who was seriously visually impaired used accessibility software (I do not remember the name and this was some time ago) which increased the size of the type of whatever he looked at to letters that were literally over one inch in x-height which auto-reflowed everything to fit on his screen so he didn't need to scroll horizontally. If there were forced line breaks in the text, as I once saw, they created big unnatural gaps in the text as they didn't allow for a clean re-flowing. He commented on this very fact. Years later this may be moot.\n\nThanks for the tip to the [Droid](http://web.archive.org/web/20150121023817/http:/phones.verizonwireless.com/motorola/droid/#/home) and [HTC devices](http://web.archive.org/web/20150121023817/http:/www.htcpda.co.uk/product_category_page.htm).

Koreans of my generation generally have varying reading knowledge of basic Chinese characters, and unless we study Chinese or Japanese as a foreign language we have very few occasions ever to write in Chinese characters.\n\nInterestingly, there are differences between the Chinese and Japanese norms in the stroke order for some characters.

I thought you were trying to get your son to use the right stroke order, and the Leapfrog device was the opposite.\n\nI remember the old Palm Pilot Graffiti input method, although I didn't use it myself, so I understand why something like stroke order is used there. It is not stroke order for writing; instead, letters are entered with a gestural code, and the correspondence between the gestures and letter shapes is... a mnemonic device.\n\nSo this is cybercrud, not fascism: since handwriting recognition is not accurate enough, or requires too many CPU cycles, text is entered in a sub-writing fashion.
