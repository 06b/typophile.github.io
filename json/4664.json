      "content": "Andy you have the same problem your classmates have. Ask your self: Why would anyone know this word/place is a restaurant? The name looks like it could be a night club, plus you gave no explaination of the type of restaurant it is. Is it McDonalds or Le Cirque, is it French or Asian. The logo means nothing without brand idenity. So make it painfully clear its about food and the kind of place it is.\n\n"

Unfortunate for his/her students, but regardless, the students can still do the quality work for themselves regardless of how low the standards the teacher places on passing or even good grades.   \n   \n   \nHere is am example of some work I did a few years ago. that I think is nice and well though out. Exterior circular logo was not designed by me . My task was to improve and build upon what was existing-at the lowest cost possible.   \n   \nI would expect you can tell a lot about this place (price point, atmosphere, services/products, etc...) without any written explanation.   \n   \nIt is a hip coffeebar, they show art, they serve great coffee,   \nthey offer crepes and waffles for breakfast. Neighbor hood is   \nBelltown, just north of Seattles' downtown business district, urban, somewhat stylish clients. Simple.   \n   \n ![lux](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124823im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35445.jpg)   \n   \nboxed \"X\" is closed sign, Lux logo was re-created as interior identity/art with flourescent lights-simple, cheap post modern.   \nFood icons were placed on windows in vinyl by entrance.Top image was postcard.

Of course the identity package you create must match the style and intended use of the restaurant, but 'overdesigning' risks appearing contrived.\n\n"

      "content": "Hi Roh. I read your critique.My reply- The Lux work is supposed to look minimalist (or generic as you described it). Lux is located between upscale independent clothing stores and restaurants. It is not supposed to look expensive (nor inexpensive). The prices are a bit higher than most cafes ( as well as quality), but it was not owners desire to specifically express the aspect. This is Seattle and most people do not care if it costs a bit more. People wanting Starbucks or Tullys can walk a block in any direction and find either (again this is Seattle). Lux is different from both of these large Espresso mega chains. Lux venue is sometimes host to a variety of events from Dj music nights, poetry, art openings, etc. But none of these events are on regular schedules, nor part of Lux's core business.   \nThe identity has served the client well for the last few years. Besides, it's businesscard (which features logo) was recently published in a graphic design book \" Best of Businesscards 6\" from Rockport Publishing, so I guess at least some industry folks find it is attractive and functional sincve it was picked over 1000's of other entries. Their older logo is shown below. At the time this logo was used, furniture was mostly handmade wrought iron, and place had more of a casual \"artsy\" feeling. This was partially changed because people would hang out all day and buy less. New identity and interior changes improved sales and brought profits up to help owner sell business which was her desire with the changes.   \n   \n ![old lux](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124823im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35521.jpg)\n\n"

I wanted to show something simple, and should have done something with subject at hand instead of dragging up my old work to illustrate my point.   \n   \nback on track...   \nWith regard to Jive 89. Perhaps looking into to roots of the word Jive and the culture in started in may be a good direction to take. I looked up the word in dictionary and came up with   \n   \n1. Jazz or swing music.   \n   \n2.The jargon of jazz musicians and enthusiasts.   \n   \n3.Slang. Deceptive, nonsensical, or glib talk: �the sexist, locker-room jive of men boasting and bonding� (Trip Gabriel).   \n   \nAs for the work you have shown, it is a bit cryptic for most, although I am personally a sucker for numeric looking type design. The numeric thing has been done a lot, especially in magazine design (David Carson/Raygun for example), but is it dead ?-not sure. On it's way out-properly. Maybe to be on the safe side try to stick with just the inverted 3, and drop the rest of the numeric characters. The inverted 3 is properly the least cryptic of the batch. You can style it a several ways to make it more or less \"3\" like. example.   \n ![3](http://web.archive.org/web/20050518124823im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35536.jpg)\n\n"

Why would you write   \n'jive89' when the logotype spells out   \nmore or less 318HTY9183? It looks like   \na hip accountancy firm, at this stage,   \nmore than a restaurant. I think that it   \nwould be wide to listen to all forms of   \ncritique, even if negative. Work with   \nthe word jive. It has such potential.   \nMore than just flipping numbers around.   \nGood Luck.   \n   \nkris.\n\n"
