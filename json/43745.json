  "content": "Considering the fact that Linotype and Berthold waged innumerable legal wars against each other, it is bizarre that Linotype now sells Berthold fonts.\n\nsee [http://www.linotype.com/de/264710/bertholdtypesltd-library.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124085840/http:/www.linotype.com/de/264710/bertholdtypesltd-library.html \"http://www.linotype.com/de/264710/bertholdtypesltd-library.html\")\n\n\"Who touches pitch, shall be defiled\", they say in the Hebrew Bible, but Linotype alias Monotype prefers the Roman proverb \"Money does not smell\".\n\nChris Lozos asked in another thread: \"If you can’t sue them, join them? :-)\"\n\nFor addicts of knock-off clones, this bizarre new \"mariage d'amour\" between Linotype and Berthold has a big thrill: Now, for the first time at the Linotype website, knock-off clone addicts may buy BOTH \"the nefarious evil knock-off clone\" (Bruno Steinert's famous words concerning Arial) of the Helvetica font, called \"AG Book\", AND the knock-off clone of Akzidenz-Grotesk, called \"Basic Commercial\". I suggest that Linotype offers a \"combination discount\" to addicts of these knock-off clones in order to boost the sales figures.\n\nThere may be another reason, why Harvey Hunt now married his enemy Linotype: Since his law-cognizant wife Melissa decided to quit him, he now has nobody who can prepare new cease-and-desist letters and lawsuits against Linotype for him.\n\nsee also [www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/berthold.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150124085840/http:/www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/berthold.pdf \"www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/berthold.pdf\")\n\n",

I certainly have been at the receiving end of many documents written on behalf of her husband. I certainly hope she has quit the type business for good, as that may put an end to a lot of arbitrary legal actions that have cost a lot of us time, money and sleep.\n\n"

One email claims that Melissa quit Harvey, and the other email claims that Melissa did not quit Harvey. Since both persons who sent me emails are members of Typophile, it is up to them to corroborate their claims.\n\n"
