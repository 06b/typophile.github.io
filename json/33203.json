I have attached a quick .gif preview and a .pdf for more detailed examination. I think I have a few issues with the weights on the n, m and r. Please ignore the preliminary spacing for now.

      "content": "Hi Jeremy\n\nI like the ideas of most of your fonts, but you really have to spend much more time on the outlines. They are all very bulky and unshaped. Furthermore I think that you get stuck on your sketches. You should try to experiment a bit with the shapes.\n\nGreetings: Steven\n\n"

      "content": "Stephen,\n\nThank you for your comment. I agree that I tend to get stuck on my inital sketches, and I feel I am a in a bit of a rut as far as some of the shapes I have been using recently. Thank you for challenging me in that area.\n\nI must admit I am having difficulty locating the bulkiness you mentioned, with the exception of a few characters that need work (the Q, n m). I've touched up the Q, K, u z g and s, and I will post those revisions shortly. The letterforms are deliberately extended more than most. Is that what you are referring to?\n\nThanks,\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418231316/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n"

      "content": "It seems like one of the biggest hurdles in Unicase fonts is the spacing since you will be making unusual combinations like 'eP' all the time. Overall it feels too tight. I would look at some small cap spacing & see what they are doing to make that work ( as opposed to regular caps which often look clunky without intervention ). Also, how do you see this being used? That's important.\n\n"

      "content": "The intended use is logotypes, headlines, etc. It's a display type. I doubt too many people would want to set text in a unicase font, especially one this wide.\n\nI agree that the spacing will be difficult, but I've started on it.\n\nI agree with Hrant about the usefulness of a unicase. Really, as far as pure usefulness and unicase isn't very versatile, with my apologies to the Bauhaus crew. Despite the fact that it’s a unicase, I tried out the g, and felt it worked pretty well, so yes, there are a few characters with decenders. Honestly, I understand why quite a few people don’t care for unicase typefaces, but part of the charm of a unicase font is its inherent inconstancies. But why can’t it be successful from a retail point of view? Filosofia is widely used, I would say largely because of its unicase weight.\n\nI've made a number of updates. The latest is posted here.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418231316im_/http:/typophile.com/files/unicase2_6284.gif)\n\n[http://ftp.insignedesign.com/files/unicase2.pdf](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418231316/http:/ftp.insignedesign.com/files/unicase2.pdf \"http://ftp.insignedesign.com/files/unicase2.pdf\")\n\nJeremy Dooley  \n [www.insignedesign.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150418231316/http:/www.insignedesign.com/ \"www.insignedesign.com\")\n\n"
