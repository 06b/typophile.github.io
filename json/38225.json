Sure, you can find a cheaper car, but the only resemblance will be that it also has four wheels and a steering wheel. You want a free alternative for Trinité No. 2? You will find a serif face that has an ’a’ and a ’b’ and a ’c’ and so on, but that’ll be the only thing similar.\n\nIf you need free fonts, there definitely is no room to be picky. Just use whatever you can find.\n\n"
