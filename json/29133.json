I chose the name because it is defined as firmness, courage and boldness. This is the direction I’m trying to take my free lance work. I want to make very bold statements that move away from corporate look and feel (I do enough corporate design at work ...). I’m a young designer and wish to appeal to a younger audience at this time.\n\nMy goal was to keep the mark unique but simple. I wanted something simple that I could expand on in the future ...something that can evolve into different trends (Think Mtv logo. You know, the way it can change its appearance from ad to ad, but still be recongnized?)\n\nI’m looking forward to the feedback. Even the negative.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [nurve.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210001436/http:/typophile.com/files/nurve.jpg) | 10.9 KB |\n\n [‹ athletics logo](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210001436/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29135 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Golf Logo Critique ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210001436/http:/www.typophile.com/node/29002 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If i squint my eyes - it is the darkest spot of the logo. What if...what if ’u’ is not black?\n\nBTW-\n\nHello!\n\n"

      "content": "Thanks for the feedback, keep it coming!\n\nSatya, is there something in particular you don’t like about the font choice for “DESIGN”? I’m pretty set on that font and plan to incorporate into my identity as my primary font. One reason I’m keeping it semple is to allow it to be easily replaced in the future with words like “CREATIVE” or “MEDIA”. If it is removed from its current position it leaves a visual hole on the letter E. If I extend the leter E however, it creates too much weight on the end of the logo. I’m not saying your critique is wrong, I’m just giving you my logic for the font choice and placement. I will be toying around with the letter U though because I agree there is a bit of a visual tension there.\n\nReka, for now I am designing the mark in black only. The next step once of finalize the structure will be color. Thanks for the tips!\n\nbrent.\n\n"

      "content": "Hey Brent,  \nThanks for showing us the logo, it’s stong, few thoughts\n\nI reckon the darkest spot is B/W the v & the e, just seem to be a lot going on in that corner, is there a way to get more white space inside the ’e’? It wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if ’design’ was put on a new line either above or below the logo, to let the strength of the black lines have their space.\n\nalso, overall there seems to be an unsettling mix of flowy stuff and square edges, perhaps it verges on the busy side of town? Is there a way to simplify things by making it a bit more human, less geometric? Maybe a bit of humanity would input a bit of personality too.  \nhope this is useful,  \ncheers\n\n—N\n\n"

      "content": "My opinion is that the rv separation is in the wrong place, I would look at a nearer to vertical separation or a curved terminal rather than straight, as Satya mentions the u needs to come down but also the topright horizontal terminal of the v needs to move down to allow the overshoot to do the job of creating a (to the eye, not mathematically) smooth horizontal at the top of the logo. I would also look at the lefthand vertical of the v being closer to vertical to assist with the large open area under the r.  \nI think you are barking up the wrong tree if you think your logo can evolve like the MTV logo, it is saturation coverage that allows the MTV logo to change and still remain recognisable, something which yours won’t ever get. I also don’t think it is unique, however that doesn’t make it a failure as a logo – it does have potential. Another thought, why do you want to appeal to a younger audience?  \nTim\n\n"

      "content": "I’m not saying I’m trying to become the new Mtv, LoL, it was just an example. I want my logo to be a basic foundation that has the potential to be very versatile. If I want to add a few things to it here and there on different pieces of promotion, the foundation needs to be simple ...not overly detailed.\n\nMy goal is to get involved into the design side of the music industry, wether it be event promos, Web site design, logos or packaging. I want to be able to dirty up my logo to give a more hardcore/metal feel or to tone it back in nuetral colors and add patterns inside the letter forms to match more of and indie label style band. Does that make since? May sound like big aspirations, I know, but I can try. I currently work at a very corporate oriented design studio and feel the need to get into the more free and expressive side of design outside of work. I shouldn’t have said I wanted to appeal to younger audiences. I really do want to appeal to all.\n\nWith that all said, I have considered all of the feedback received so far and applied it to the logo. One version with DESIGN and one without.\n\nbrent.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210001436im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/nurve_2a_5092.jpg)\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210001436im_/http:/www.typophile.com/files/nurve_2b_4897.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "You still haven’t added any overshoot to your curves as Satya recommended. Check out his latest post for a great example. The curves should extend slightly below the baseline and above the x-height to make the design more visually balanced.\n\nHaving said that, I like this treatment of “rv” better. The “ve” area is still dark - maybe do something like [Bauhaus’](http://web.archive.org/web/20071210001436/http:/www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.6733.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=e&sampleSize=48) ’e’ where the bowl is open. I think that the ’e’ could work both flat like you have shown it, or angled as Satya has shown.\n\n- Lex\n\n"
