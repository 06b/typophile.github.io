Unfortunatly I can't remember where I found it / downloaded it from to check licensing restrictions etc.   \n   \nI was wondering if it looked familiar to anyone or if you knew where it came from / who made it etc.   \n   \n(The font file is called ' flava ' and the download file was named ' Macintosh TrueType.sit ' if that helps at all!?)   \n   \nThanks for your help!   \nCheers,\n\n",
