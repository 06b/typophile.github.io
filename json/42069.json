      "content": "My first reaction was, \"Wow, I didn't expect something called 'Town Center Wine & Spirits' to have such a nice logo!\" A minute later, I do have some criticisms:\n\nThe whole thing seems a bit too wide - the \"Town\" and \"Center\" bugs me for being so loosely tracked. The wine bottle seems pixelated on the edge, and the white label flattens it out unpleasantly - perhaps get rid of the label or making it 20% transparency? The sections of type below could both move a bit towards the grape vine, allowing the town and center to have slightly tighter spacing without ruining the balance.\n\nGood luck!\n\n"

There are many, many issues with the complexities of this design for a logo, and a small business will not appreciate how expensive this logo will become to reproduce legibly, if they can reproduce it at all.  \nHere it is at three inches long:\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131108143349im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Town-Center-3inches_3808.jpg)\n\n"

      "content": "^ start in black & white, and look at it small. The spacing on town should better match center. Maybe grape leaves and vine could be simplified to work in the same way and still read at a smaller size. The text at the bottom should be optional and maybe not part of the mark development.\n\n"

It's something that the client requested, but I think it will only be used at legible sizes, i.e. on their site, signs, shirts, etc.\n\nThe whole thing started in black (how I usually approach logo development). The shading, etc, came about after a suitable black version.\n\nThanks for the reminders to look at it small.\n\n"

This far in though, I can't imagine it's time for a whole new concept. If it was me I would look for a way to tie up the elements that would meet these two demands.\n\n"

Pull the N & E slightly closer to the T in center.\n\nWhat if the a in Massachusetts was a bit closer to the M.\n\nThe shade on the label was a very very good idea.\n\n"
