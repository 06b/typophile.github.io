  "content": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to identify (as close as possible) the typefaces used in the attached visuals. I understand that these may be custom but the closest equivalent would be very helpful.\n\nLooking to identify the \"DETROIT\" on the front of the jersey, numbers on the back, \"player name - DATSYUK\" and \"C\" and \"A\" on the sleeves.\n\nThanks for any assistance with this.\n\nJosh\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140329070345im_/http:/typophile.com/files/0407-det14wc-jersey_4705.png)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140329070345im_/http:/typophile.com/files/wc2014zetterberg_5836.jpg)\n  \n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20140329070345im_/http:/typophile.com/files/Redwings4_3569.jpg)\n\n",
