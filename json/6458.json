  "content": "Hi,   \nI am looking to create a ficticious airline called \"DebonAir\" - which has a strong reference to the 60s air travel aesthetic (Pan Am etc). I was hoping for some suggestions for a typeface to base a logotype from. My main goal is to create something that hints of that era, whilst still maintaining a contemporary edge.   \nI understand the highly subjective nature of my request, but some stepping stones to get me on my way would be \\*greatly\\* appreciated.   \n   \nThanks in advance!\n\n",
