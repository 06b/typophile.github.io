  "content": "ok OpenType sages, I have ran into a speedbump in trying to solve something with random contextual alternates and trying to 'un-random' them at very specific times.\n\nI posted a comment on a previous thread earlier tonight ( [http://typophile.com/node/19625](http://web.archive.org/web/20131101085355/http:/typophile.com/node/19625 \"http://typophile.com/node/19625\")), but realized it might be best to create a new one (someone slap me if I need to go back to the old one)\n\nMy question is: given that mentioned randomization approaches with the calt feature, what happens if I want to ignore certain letter combinations in lieu of something more specific to the typeface in order to avoid pairing a one and two story 'a' together or a standard or binocular 'g' together for instance?\n\nI only want to 'control' this pairing if the letters are next to each other?\n\nhow can I correctly ignore a pairing but keep the rest of the randomization intact?\n\n",
