  "content": "Hello,   \n   \nthis is my first typeface and it's based on the idea of cutting one shape out of another. I thought it would be a fairly simple typeface to start-off with because of this simplicity and I'm fairly happy with the results so far. I wanted the typeface to have a futuristic funk (a la Parliament, George Clinton, P-Funk etc) vibe to it. Something that would be displayed on the side of their Interstellar Time-Travellin' Funkmobile in the year 3030 (hence the name).   \n   \nI've found the typeface starts lookin pretty  once you have more than 4 letters in the word which kinda sucks. I may just be paranoid though ![:-)](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023082738im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif)   \n   \n ![Mothership Connection 3030](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023082738im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11560.gif)\n\n",

      "content": "Hi Tim   \n   \nHave a look at this font, Phucy. You'll see that the designer has done a regular, but also positive, regular and shaded. I'd look at doing a shaded and ouline version of your font. Also apply it to some stuff to get the motivation back.   \n   \n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20131023082738im_/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15169.gif)\n\n"

      "content": "Q bothers me, the neg/pos thing - I think there could be a better solution for it that is in keeping with the rest of your forms.   \n   \nthe anti-serif thing (what would you call it?) on the top left corners is fun but I figure it needs to be consistant in shape,size and depth throughout.   \n   \nI also feel that your pill shape that makes most of the counters should be the same in width, and then you could play with the positioning to make up contrast. Looking at the neg space of U,V,W makes it confusing to see what kind of transition in going on there:   \n   \ni.e.   \nU,O,D,T don't seem to have any.   \nH,R,X,V,K seem to have it.   \n   \nwhy e?\n\n"
