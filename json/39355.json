  "content": "hey everyone,\n\nWell, i took a shot at making a typeface. I am still working on it, specifically the numbers. I don't know if anyone on here skateboards, but the typeface is sort of inspired by a skateboard company called Krooked. Tell me what you think.\n\nAlso, this typeface so far has been made entirely in Illustrator, and i have no idea how to turn it into an actual font. Does anyone have any links or info i could read up on how to combine my characters in Illustrator into a font?\n\nthanks!  \njosh\n\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v79/guccipingpong/typeface.jpg\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170016im_/http:/typophile.com/files/typeface_5316.jpg)\n\n",

C M N T U V A\n\nSo in addition to evening the typographic color continue to refine your numerals. Then you'll have something really groovy.\n\nAll my best you,\n\nMike Diaz :-)\n\n"

Typophilers can tell if a font has been derived from another font and for sure its not the case with you.\n\nI just mentioned Potato Cut because if you plan on selling the font one day to the public or to a client you have to be aware of the possibility there maybe competing designs. That means you have to be extra special. Just looking out for you.\n\n:-) Mikey\n\n"

Do you think they look better a little bit more rounded like the 1-6 or blocky like the 8 and 9?\n\njosh\n\n"

Does anyone have any links or info i could read up on how to combine my characters in Illustrator into a font?_\n\nHi. You need to get a font creation program ( [Fontographer and FontLab](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170016/http:/www.fontlab.com/) are two, but there are others) and bring your Illustrator drawings into it. Check out the [How-To](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170016/http:/typophile.com/node/12369) section of the TypoWiki for more info on the practical aspects. Check out the [Books](http://web.archive.org/web/20150416170016/http:/typophile.com/node/12157) section to find literature on the subject of designing or creating a typeface. Also, a Google search will probably get you some online tutorials on the basics.\n\n"
