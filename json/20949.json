To cut a long story short, which I am sure many of you are aware of, projects can easily become more about the politics and strategic grounding behind a project which can sometimes lead to the creative part becomming less important.\n\nI am now thinking of trying to set up something of my own and although I know what this entails and what hard work, but worth while work it can be there is one thing that I am a little unsure of.\n\nI have always been employed by someone and although I have done many freelance projects along the way, most of my work has been done whilst employed.\n\nMy question is, is when I create my folio for my future company is it ok to use the work I have done whilst employed, as long as I credit it to the company I was with at the time.\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation in the past whilst setting their own company up and if so how did you go about it?\n\nMatt\n\n [‹ It was a long time ago](http://web.archive.org/web/20081021101629/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20918 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Projector for a Mac laptop. ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20081021101629/http:/www.typophile.com/node/20933 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

If I have a meeting with a potential client I show in addition of work for my own clients, some of the subcontracted work (unless forbidden, like with medical companies), and always state both my client and their client and what my part in the project was. I also try to avoid any conflict with my agency clients, i.e. I won’t steal their customers.\n\nIf you were to look for a new job, you would show work you’ve done whilst working for your current employer. I don’t think setting up your own company is much different a situation.\n\n"

I had to work around this at every turn because I’ve been stuck under one client for sooo long. It took me a long time to work it out, and I had to be very careful with the language and presentation.\n\nI started a thread, just like you have done. Had some help from Norbert, and some unexpected scepticism as well (see the thread).\n\n[http://typophile.com/node/13993](http://web.archive.org/web/20081021101629/http:/typophile.com/node/13993 \"http://typophile.com/node/13993\")\n\nThat was almost as humiliating as being referred to as an <cite>artiste</cite> by Hrant.  \nlol\n\n"

Meaning it’s safe to show publically without ruining any marketing plans or strategies.\n\nWith that said, you should be okay to use work you’ve produced even if it’s from another company you worked for. So long as you provide credits to the company and the creative/art director, you should probably be safe.\n\nLike others have said, oftentimes it’s a good idea to consult a lawyer about these things.\n\n+  \nRyan Ford\n\n"

I guess it is always useful to have these projects in the folio as it shows the clients where you have come from and the experience you have gained.\n\nI think talking to someone like a lawyer could be a good idea, just to be on the safe side.\n\nThnks for all the advice guys.\n\n"

I’m in book publishing and it’s totally ok to take credit for books designed - in fact the books carry a credit. But I know that isn’t the case with other types of clients.\n\nGood luck with your own business. Striking out on my own was the best decision I’ve ever made for myself but I gotta warn you, while you may not have to deal with interoffice powerplays and politics you get a whole other set of issues and you have to make nicey nice to a lot of people you wish you could tell to eat s\\*\\*t. Unless you hire an assistant for that...\n\n"
