I downloaded it onto my Mac (Mac OS X 10.3.x) and ran it, no problems.   \n   \nOkay, if you are used to your present vector drawing tools, and say you like the pen tool a lot (and you do, right?), the way this thing draws WILL MAKE YOUR HEAD CAVE IN.   \n   \nAfter you recover, if you figure out the secret magic trick, drawing curves kind of makes sense.

Double-click the doubletype.jar file in the /bin folder.   \n   \nI look forward to Mr. Blokland's review. (and Typographica).   \n   \nJon\n\n"
