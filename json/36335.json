  "content": "Jul 25, 2007: Ordered RTR Albertan for $101.36. Have trouble downloading fonts. (Connection with server was lost after 50% download. Six times!)\n\nJul 26, 2007: Try downloading fonts the next day: “”Your allotted download time for this softgood has run out.” Emailed P22. They email me the fonts.\n\nJul 27, 2007: I emailed them and told them that FOURTEEN of the PS font files are ZERO byte files! They email me the correct files. I had a problem installing the PS fonts until I deleted all the \\*.INF files. I email them with screenshots. I then discover one of the small cap fonts is mislabeled. (My word processing program showed RTF AlbertanSC [bold] and RTF Albertan SC [regular]. The bold font should have been labeled RTF Albertan SC with a space between Albertan and SC.) I correct it with a font program that I have, but the PFM file is reduced from 12,614 bytes to 5,246. I ask for a corrected replacement. A total of six emails to/from exchanged today.\n\nJuly 30, 2007: from an email from P22: “We will be examining the Albertan data ASAP, but I am afraid that an explanation might not be possible until next week. At this point, I do offer a full refund.” I erroneously construe that “offer” as rhetorical and that they gave me a credit.\n\nAugust 17, 2007: 15 business days later I email P22 again and ask about the refund and the corrected font. They said, “due to other projects already in progress, Albertan was not the first on the list. However, it will be fixed in about a week or two. If you do not want to wait that long for a replacement file, I will need to send you a quick form to fill out for the refund. “\n\nAugust 18, 2007: I let them know I’ll accept a 50% refund without a form otherwise send me a form for a full refund.\n\nAugust 20, 2007: The “refund” was not for my doing their beta testing, or for my time or aggravation, or their delay, or just for “good will.” In an email they advise me that the refund is conditional, based on my deleting the fonts. They further said “any file renaming is not possible before Sept. 1st, if deemed necessary.”\n\nIn the meantime, what happens to anyone else who orders RTR Albertan from P22?\n\nI have ordered fonts from P22 for more than a decade, but never with fonts or service like this.\n\nIt happened once. Shame on them. But it won’t happen twice!\n\nAm I expecting too much?\n\nDid P22 act honorably?\n\n [‹ Flipped, Zipped and Shipped](http://web.archive.org/web/20080430120138/http:/www.typophile.com/node/36315 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [How do you develop hand lettering aesthetics? ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20080430120138/http:/www.typophile.com/node/21090 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

I can’t even remember the name of the company I bought it - but they would save their printer fonts with the letter “P” before it - like PAlbertanTit and PAlbertanLin with Italic counterparts. They were all Type 3 fonts - and made my Mac back then crash out. When I needed it again back in - oh, about 2004 - I just converted it to Type 1 (for MAC) and it was fine. I don’t remember my printer having any trouble with them either. (He had a lot of trouble with a Sudtipos font I had bought a while ago...)\n\nSo all I’m saying is Albertan itself has always been a problem. So were most of the fonts that were out then that started with a P - I can’t seen them in my library anymore — I’d really have to go digging through floppy discs! I think they were like PFlash and maybe PBoy and stuff like that.\n\n"

But it is the equivalent of having a font named ABCRegular and ABCBold, requiring you to select a different font every time you want to use bold instead of selecting the bold attribute.\n\nHow can anyone possibly explain a mistake like 14 zero byte files?\n\nThe few other foundries that have made mistakes have given me a free font or otherwise compensated me for my trouble. I don’t think a font purchase should be riddled with problems requirings dozens of emails over several weeks.\n\nI really feel like I did their beta testing for them. That sucks.

The only longer gap was caused by a misunderstanding as regards the refund. Sh\\*t happens.\n\nFonts are software. One can test many aspects and conditions, but the ultimate test is the real world. There are bugs in every piece of software and they will come to light sooner or later or (with luck) never. But they are there. My realistic (call it pessimistic) point of view.\n\n[I don’t mean you with this:]  \nSometimes I am surprised that users of software <cite>do not even dare</cite> ask the producer if problems occur.

I think Mr. Marsten has been respectful here and tossing sarcastic quips is not acceptable. Mr. Giampa is apart of the P22 company and should have said nothing of the sort.

I certainly feel the same way especially when you don’t want to pay overseas charges etc. In fact I started a thread about Dalton Maag because of the same reason. I thought it would be tacky to discuss money when I’m just window shopping. If you absolutely needed to say something about that thread Mr. Marsten was inflexible in not wanting to upgrade his browser.

Us mac-heads live in Utopia [-kinda].\n\n“Unprofessional Fonts from Professional Designers” This was Mr. Marsten polling other users regarding problems they have had with incorrectly built fonts. He did not name names. In fact he said he did not want to alienate anyone. When you lay out the cash and get something sub standard and you don’t know how to go about it getting it rectified ask people who know- Typophilers. However, it does show someone at the beginnings of frustration.\n\nThe real “horror” is your spurious distortion of facts attempting to pigeonhole Mr. Karsten as an ’over-the-top griper’ saying “he routinely attacked organizations” when in fact he hasn’t. Not even p22- he is a paying customer with a ’horrible’ experience. And you can’t be serious in including Typophile- there’s more crap here from beloved members than novices like Mr. Marsten.

I thought one thing we had in common was the pursuit of perfection in everything from the minutest details of type design to the minutest details of typographic practice. But let a non-pro lover of type, who puts out a newsletter with a mailing list of 30, who spends too much of his own money on fonts merely because he knows a good font when he sees one, complain about a vendor who sends out files that include mislabeled fonts and zero byte files, and the vendor-defenders come out of the woodwork to attack the messenger, the pursuit of perfection be damned.\n\nZero byte files are “a very common problem .” Not in my experience.  \nMislabeling a font “was a minor failure.” Not in my experience.\n\nOne of the unmentioned vendors in the “Unprofessional Fonts from Professional Designers” thread was PsyOps. I mention that now, only because the difficulty I had was resolved AND they offered me an additional font at NO cost for my troubles. That kind of consideration should be applauded, and that kind of consideration is in stark contrast to P22.\n\nI became interested in type when Font Bureau was publishing X-height and ITC was publishing U&lc, and I still have those copies. I am SO glad I was around when type-for-print had printed samples and catalogs that you didn’t have to pay for.\n\nFor those who are keeping track of my computer proclivities, I now have the latest version of Firefox as my browser.\n\nLeft out of this conversation is Jim Rimmer, the designer of Albertan. I wonder what he thinks of how his fonts are marketed by P22.\n\nIn spite of the repeated misspelling of my name, I appreciate the posts of Mike Diaz. Although Mike took some of my threads to refute the accusations of vendor representatives (who are also some of the most prolific posters), I also believe he was being a consumer advocate. When I first put my foot into professional typographic waters (no longer satisfied with 1000 fonts on CD for $9.95) my first purchases were Stone Serif (purchased directly from Sumner Stone) and Remedy from Emigre over a decade ago. For most of the decade from 1995-2005, I did NOT run into the problem of mislabeled fonts or zero byte files.\n\nThe hostile attitude of so many “professionals” and “professional vendors” toward me is as understandable as is their hostile attitude toward “free fonts.” As you can see, I do BUY good quality fronts from respected vendors, but some vendors who only sell their fonts in mega-bundles, or who overprice their fonts only invite rip-offs. Pardon me if I don’t sympthasize.\n\nMy loyalty lies with quality. And to a lesser extent with price. I bought Goodchild at Fonts.com because they price the TT version at $99 and the PS version at $129 (to this day), which according to Nick, is a mistake. That’s the kind of mistake I can live with. I only hope that it’s Fonts.com and not Nick that gets screwed out of $30.\n\nWhen the high-and-mighty types decide to opt for quality over attacking non-pros for not accepting unprofessional quality, please do let me know.\n\n"

Your download failed and you blame the foundry (you didn’t say if you had dialup or high speed internet). They sent you files upon notification. You repeatedly complain about “zero byte files”, which is a common problem with files corrupted during transmission or cross platform files. Again the foundry got you working files very quickly. You have no complaint against the font but rather the menu naming of the files having an extra space in one of the fonts. The foundry offered you a full refund or a fix in a reasonable amount of time in this minor naming issue. Now you are grousing about wanting a partial refund (which it seems you received when you bought the fonts). If restaurants give full refunds when a menu item is spelled wrong, we could all eat for free for life. P22 did more than most software companies would ever do to make things right. Some people just like to complain until they get their way. Let us trim the fat and end this thread.\n\n"

But excuse me if I expect type designers and type (re)sellers to know more about fonts than I do. But “stuff” does happen, in spite of our best efforts, whether we’re selling cars, or toys from China, or fonts.\n\nI’m grateful for P22’s response. In spite of their vastly expanded library, a much larger selection of fonts than when I first ordered from them more than a decade ago, they still like to claim they’re “not a big company.”\n\nWhatever. Their resolution of the problem satisfied me. Thank God I’m not a professional who had a deadline. And what about all those people who ordered this font before I did?\n\nBottom Line: Thanks, P22.\n\n"
