  "content": "Hello,\n\nI’m looking for some help in reversing some bitmap fonts (see attached image). I don’t do any font editing myself which is why I’m looking for help :)\n\nIf anyone has bitmap font editing experience and can reverse some bitmap fonts for me for usage in Flash, please reply privately by clicking my user name and sending me an email through the contact tab. Please send your contact info including phone number and an estimate for your services or any questions you may have.\n\n1. I have the fonts on Mac & PC.  \n2. Initially I’d like to do a test of reversing a font (Regular and Bold) for mac.  \n3. If it works, I’d like to proceed with about 2-3 font families for both Mac & PC.\n\nThanks,  \nmmdev23\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [desired\\_result.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215540/http:/typophile.com/files/desired_result.jpg) | 11.32 KB |\n\n [‹ Female Type Designers – “is there anybody out there?”](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215540/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38754 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Amsterdam & Antwerpen ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071108215540/http:/www.typophile.com/node/38708 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

      "content": "I’m not sure if this is what you man by format but on a Mac, when we examine the existing font in the finder, for king it says “Font Suitcase”. When I look at it in Fontbook on a Mac, the type is listed as TrueType.\n\nIn terms of off-the-shelf tools, we tried Bitfonter from Fontlab. It has a feature where you can select characters and invert them which is exactly what we want to do. Unfortunately, when we save out the font and try to use it, none of the characters work - they show up as a solid block of colors or just “.”s.\n\nFrom speaking with Fontlab:  \n1. They don’t do any presales support  \n2. Their forums are broken (we applied, were told we needed approval, but tech support says no approval is needed so forums must be broken)\n\nIf anyone knows of off the shelf solutions or how to get Bitfonter to work, that’d be great too :)\n\nThanks,  \nMMDev\n\n"

      "content": "TrueType fonts can include “embedded bitmaps” - but in general for Flash use, most fonts are “outline” fonts made to look like bitmap fonts - so Bitfonter is a dead-end here. Reversing outline fonts is possible in FontLab - but as noted no-one would normally bother as every app would let you define font and background colors and that’s how you’d normally reverse things.\n\nCheers, Si\n\n"
