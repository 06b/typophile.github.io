There is no such thing as a right to a continuing ROI.   \n   \nEric Gill is long gone. Let's support contemporary type culture, as an expression of the present day and age, by licensing contemporary fonts.   \n   \nI'm not saying there isn't a place for the classics, but they should not dominate the scene the way they do.   \n   \nInteresting that you mention Gill Sans, as this was one of the typefaces that Adobe gave away on an Illustrator CD in the mid 90s. Millions (I assume) of free copies. Well, that's one way to prime a market. But it kind of pulled the rug out from underneath Cronos.   \n   \nGill Sans is a 1930s typeface. The bowl of the a has the bulbous look of the baby carriages of that era. To me, it looks totally incongruous today. However, it made a valuable contribution to the living tradition of type design: if art directors want to choose a typeface that, because of its structure and proportions, works in a similar manner, they should use the present day \"equivalents\", such as Cronos, Scala/Seria Sans, Bliss (good choice, m-ga), Agenda, Eureka Sans, etc. That would make our business more vital and sophisticated than if everyone just uses poor old Gill.\n\n"

I myself prefer a good typeface over a new typeface. Among the designs you listed, I can't find a single one that would be superior to Gill Sans. To me, the first sanserif for years that can stand up against Gill Sans is Frantisek Storm's Sebastian:   \n [http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian/](http://web.archive.org/web/20150218043852/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/sebastian/)   \n   \nIt's similarly sophisticated without being artificially elaborate.   \n   \nIf I were to choose between Gill and Cronos, I'd choose Gill -- even if both were designed at the same time. The same for Agenda vs. Gill etc. I won't even compare Scala Sans, Bliss or Eureka Sans. They're nice but have by no means the touch of eternity and universality that Gill Sans has. I'd say, Gill Sans is still better.   \n   \nAdam\n\n"

We need new types because we keep producing new texts, and new kinds of text. This has always been the case, and it is worthwhile to map major developments in the history of type design to developments in literature. 'Mood' may be one of the factors that makes a typeface appropriate to a text, but it is certainly not the only one.   \n   \nOf course, there is also the question of whether one needs to justify the making of new type -- or a new chair design, or a new piece of architecture -- other than by variety and by the human need to create new forms.\n\n"
