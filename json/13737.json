  "content": "I've got to redraw a logo (attached), the vector art for which is lost or never existed, and it's not worth my time to redraw the type.\n\nI did my usual battery of research on this one, but I'm sure it's something so obvious I just went right past it. It's also possible it was a bundled font. I've checked out [Carlos](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217130240/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/carlos/familytree.html), [Newport Land](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217130240/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/newport-land/), [Romeo](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217130240/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/romeo/), and [Casablanca](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217130240/http:/www.identifont.com/show?5ZR). I've scrolled through 975 fonts on My Fonts after searching 'art deco condensed'. It's definitely coming from the same inspirational source as the others: Carlos Winkow's Electra from around 1940 ( [according to Font Bureau](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217130240/http:/fontbureau.com/fonts/Romeo)). However, every time I get close, some aspect is off. Few are condensed enough or thick enough. I wonder whether it's been modified by the previous designer, but I can't tell either way.\n\nSo, I turn to all of you.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [bmore\\_identify.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20150217130240/http:/typophile.com/files/bmore_identify.gif) | 14.14 KB |\n\n",
