  "content": "Hi folks,\n\nJust wondering if there have been any revivals closely or loosely based on Caslon or Baskerville that include text, deck and display weights suitable for modern editorial design (print and digital)?\n\nI can think of Mrs. Eaves and Big Caslon but they are not robust enough in terms of weights.\n\nI think the answer is no but just want to make sure I am not missing something...\n\nThanks!\n\n",
