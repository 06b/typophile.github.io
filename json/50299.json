I lived in this beloved community for a number of years and itâ€™s where I first began my study of calligraphy and lettering.\n\nWhile most brush scripts take their cue from mid-twentieth century samples, Montague Script is a fresh, contemporary alternative. It comes directly from lettering written with a #3 sable brush on smooth vellum and is digitized with the same sensibility a lettering artist writes with. Montague reflects a dynamic interplay between form and rhythm not usually associated with type. Words suggest a baseline, yet are not bound by it. Letters vary in size, connect smoothly, yet break that connection purposefully as the scribe does intuitively. Beginnings, endings, alternates and ligatures come in as needed while you type. Many more alternates are available in the glyph palette of most current graphic software. Exuberant swash versions of upper and lowercase letters, as well as ligatures can be accessed through both the type and glyph palettes.\n\n| Attachment | Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [UMT0000367\\_P-1.gif](http://web.archive.org/web/20081121111515/http:/typophile.com/files/UMT0000367_P-1.gif) | 32.2 KB |\n\n",
