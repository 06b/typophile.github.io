However, it will also contain new features, and hence new bugs. Some designers are only recently switching to CS 2. InDesign 4.0.4 is going to be as good as it gets for a while....\n\n"

Based on past announcements, it would be 6 to 8 weeks to ship date. But things are different this time. There never was a pre-announcement 1 year early, as Chizen did last year, and there was never a public beta before.\n\n\\> I wonder if there will be any mention of typography, or even OpenType?\n\nI suspect we will see a glyphs palette like ID has in Photoshop (or is that already in CS2 ... I skipped that one).\n\n"

This seems to imply that Flash will now support OpenType. If not, then I'm not sure how this could work. The question is, if this is true, what is the extent that Flash users will have to OT features, etc.?\n\nAlso, I noticed on the [feature list](http://web.archive.org/web/20140803015151/http:/www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/features/allfeatures/) for Illustrator CS3 a bullet point that says \"Advanced typography.\" It has a little plus sign disclosure box, which usually means more information hidden below, but it doesn't do anything if you click on it.\n\n"
