Bad font (I honestly mean this).   \n   \nThat said, it is prolifically used, but have you _ever_ seen it used in a   \nnon-amateur (read: paying-for-fonts) application. I haven't. Ergo, my   \nEmigre non-issue stance. Ergo, why make it an issue here?   \n   \nBy the way, who was that Mike **E** credited with the ID in [this thread](http://web.archive.org/web/20050516054657/http:/www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68615.html?1112740084).\n\n"
