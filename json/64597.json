The .txt files use production glyph naming for use in FontLab metrics window. The .doc files contain the words Unicode-encoded.\n\nThese files are good for kerning letter-to-letter. Combinations of letters plus marks also need to be kerned, particularly when adjacent to some caps and ascending letters.\n\n"
