But the problem is that Quark is more widely used in the design field as far as I know. Is there a trend where more and more designers are using InDesign? I would appreciate some feedback on this issue.   \n   \nIM\n\n",

As for service bureaus, Adobe is very active in teaching service bureaus how to handle InDesign documents. Having said that I'm from New York City and Adobe might not be as active in your area.
