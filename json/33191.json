  "content": "Hello masters,\n\nI’m designing a little brochure in 2 colors : black and yellow.  \nthe layout is really grid based, and FF DIN has been obvious since day 1.\n\nI really like the german look of DIN, but I feel it is a bit overused these days.  \nI would love to use a font slightly different. The same, but different (like coke/ pepsi).\n\nFor a moment, I thought about modifying DIN, but I’m not skilled enough to touch such a beauty.\n\nI was wondering if one of you type experts could suggest a substitute for DIN.\n\nthanks in advance for anyhelp you could give.\n\nAnd thanks anyway for the amazing quality of the content of this website.\n\nCheers,\n\nJ.\n\n",
