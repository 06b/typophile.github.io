The S and G would both need tweaking, but it could work, if a better match doesn't show up. Another was [http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/flyer/|Flyer]], which would need work to close the G.\n\nI have not checked freebie fonts, but that might be another possibility. MyFonts was hard to find the combination of a similar G with an open S like this. The 'i' looks like it was flattened to be the same height, hence the flat dot.\n\nMike Yanega\n\n"
