I would really appreciate your critiques about it.\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119051255im_/http:/typophile.com/files/mycorp-logo-20070912-01_4744.png)\n\n [‹ Logo for winery](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119051255/http:/typophile.com/node/36714 \"Go to previous forum topic\") [Critique Please....The saga continues - Profile1Design logo ›](http://web.archive.org/web/20071119051255/http:/typophile.com/node/36840 \"Go to next forum topic\")\n\n",

You have somehow “my” as a symbol of the logo, but then you are playing with “corp”. I don’t like this logo at all and I don’t think it will become a decent logo anyway.\n\nI’m really sorry but I thought I may be too late if I stay quiet.

Two weeks is more than adequate time to develop a good logo.\n\nSometimes the hardest decision to make for a designer (or anyone designing something) is to kill what they are working on. However, all the time spent on noodling this particular direction could be much better spent on finding something better. And by better, I’m not suggesting you need to invent a new typeface or re-invent the graphic wheel. Many design firms both huge and tiny use a very well set typeface with little modification. If you need a crisp, professional appearance, and you need it quick, that is the best way to go.\n\nLike Litera, I hate to sound harsh and overly critical, but sometimes we need a creative director to straighten us out. I’ve had it done to me, and have had to do similar to others before. Please realize it’s not about you personally, but an honest attempt to help you get the best results for your agency.\n\n"

I’m not a designer, I work in the commercial and administrative area, but since I’m alone and I really think this can be a successful company, I don’t want to abandon it as well.\n\nI need some kind of logo just for bureaucratic stuff, to have the company registered and so. Then I will have to find a decent solution for the identity of MyCorp.\n\nI really thank you and everyone for all critiques, and specially for being honest and telling me what you really think.\n\n"
