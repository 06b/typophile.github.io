It is actually based on a moderately stylized adaptation of our chief designer’s handwriting. Use it to give a handwritten touch to your work. Paveline works well as small handwriting or large scale poster captions. You can see some more samples of Paveline in action on our [blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202211538/http:/gatf.wordpress.com/).\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20100202211538im_/http:/typophile.com/files/31234_5327.png)\n\n",

This is at least the third time I’ve seen a promotional image that suggests you don’t know how to design type or how to use Photoshop. Maybe it’s time to stop focusing on volume and start fixing all those bad overlaps and giant gaps.\n\n"
