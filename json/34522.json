A good friend suggested that I should finish up the basic character set and give it away free. I am happy to do this, but wonder if anyone would actually want it. Would you?\n\n—K\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20150322223927im_/http:/typophile.com/files/takirua_5659.gif)\n\n",

My interest in koru fonts is mostly intrigue; but I have one immediate practical application: I need a \"Private\" sign over my double driveway in Whangarei. Such a sign in a stencil koru font would be nice and less offensive. With your permission, I might try your font.  \nI think your font could be used as a stencil font, where signs would be cut from metal sheet or plate (e.g. aluminium, copper, bronze, stainless steel, steel then galvanized) using a computer controlled plasma cutter, or better still a computer controlled laser cutter. The korus would remain attached to the plate, so they might be fattened a little for strength. Stencil font signs in metal plate are the only truly indestructible signs, being unaffected by rain, UV, moulds, fire, graffiti and vandalism. As such, I feel there is a huge untapped market for metal stencil font signs. You need to find someone fluent in Autocad and a fabricator with a laser cutting machine. DOC and NZ Tourism Dept would be two potential customers.  \nCaterpillar's Technical Center in Mossville, Illinois has many everlasting laser cut stainless steel stencil signs on out buildings, and services; as well as \"Prairie\" signs with a birdsfoot violet flower as the dot over the \"i's\". These have been through many prairie burns and still look new.\n\n"
