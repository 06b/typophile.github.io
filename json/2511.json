In fact some people (including me a few years ago) would have counted one pixel of \"internal leading\" as part of any bitmap font (so Micromorph would be a 9), but then I realized that:   \n1) The \"big boys\" (like the MS core fonts) measure it flush.   \n2) It's rare for the descenders of a line to run into the ascenders of the following line, so it's not worth \"wasting\" the measure.   \n   \nhhp\n\n"
