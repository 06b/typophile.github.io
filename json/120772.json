I've looked through all default fonts in LibreOffice Writer, and I've tried the standard automatic font detectors like whatfontis and What the Font, but none of the automated systems have produced anything useful. I'm sure it is a simple font, but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

I like also [National Champion](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063054/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/kyle-wayne-benson/national-champion), better designed but some earmarks of your sample are absent and it doesn't have this vintage/amateur (inconsistent x-width + absence of kerning/spacing). [Player](http://web.archive.org/web/20150317063054/http:/www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/player) Bold (to get serifed /E crossbar) is another alternative but less convincing.\n\n"
