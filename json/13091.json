I didn't really noticed\n\nbut the way they colored it and stuff I figured they could switch it up a bit to make it look more hand written but it might be a font \\*shrug\\*\n\nthanks for pointing that out :) know of anything similar? more so of the S.. I love the S...\n\n"

I like Dav's suggested fonts a lot better, though. Endor is just trying to mimic the lettering off of the Charmed TV series.\n\n"
