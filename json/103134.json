And Bebas might have other problems (like in its kerning) that don't show up as quickly, but could end up ruining a project after it's too late to change the font. Then you need a font editor (and the expertise to use it) or you need to pay somebody to fix it. So in the end, not at all free.\n\nOf course not all free fonts are bad. But pretending commercial fonts have a comparable degree of problems is not realistic. You need to be able to trust your tools.\n\nhhp\n\n"

Run a FontAudit on many commercial fonts and it makes suggestions on some curves, not all that are very critical or even really worthy of being marked. That being said, I really do not think anyone would say that commercial fonts have as many problems as free fonts. A commercial foundry would not stay in business very long if they became known for problem fonts. It is said on Typophile often enough that you are safer with professional commercial fonts.\n\n"

The elements in `BlueValues` were `-320 5 -76 707`, which just makes no sense. After changing `BlueValues`, the font was working without problem.\n\nInterestingly, Fontforge complains about the elements in BlueValues/OtherBlues of Bebas neue. Maybe the distortion on dafont also comes from there.\n\n"
