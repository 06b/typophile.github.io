Malabar grew out of Martel, a multi-script design that I initially created in 2008 on the MA Typeface Design course at the University of Reading. The Latin component of the family is distributed by Linotype, and you can buy it here.\n\nThe design’s success was announced on Sunday, 17 May 2009, at the ED-Festival in Zürich. Malabar received the silver award in the original typeface category. This isn’t Malabar’s first distinction; its six Latin fonts received a Certificate of Typographic Excellence in Type Design at the Type Directors Club of New York TDC² competition in January 2009. “\n\n\\<\\<\\<\n\nIt is available for sale through Linotype at:  \n [http://www.linotype.com/5831/malabar.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20090525143804/http:/www.linotype.com/5831/malabar.html \"http://www.linotype.com/5831/malabar.html\")\n\nGreat Stuff, Dan! We are all proud!!!\n\nChrisL\n\n",

But the winners of Bronze prizes are as follows:\n\nBree, from TypeTogether  \nFC Autobahn, from Autobahn  \nPlaneta, from Dani Klauser Graphic Design  \nNabil, from Emanuela Conidi  \nKina, from Francesca Bolognini  \nTexteron, from Cape Arcona Type Foundry  \nFedra Hindi, from Typotheque\\*\n\nThe real props should go over to the folks at Suitcase Typefoundry, who won not only the typeface competition’s gold medal, but also won the Jury Prize for the whole ED-Awards 2009 competition! Maybe this shows that good type is more important than logos or posters or brochures or anything else ;-D\n\n\\*Again, the site doesn’t have details up for this, but Fedra Hindi is what Vinu is talking about. Go Satya!\n\n"
