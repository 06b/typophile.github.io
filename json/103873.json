Adobe says you can hire someone to do it for you. On the other hand, they (the hiree?) can't \"distribute\" their work. I suppose it needs to be done afresh each time? Who knows the minds of lawyers?\n\n& \"part pilfering\" is a good way to put it.\n\n"

Open the Preflight panel. (Exact location in the menus depends on version and sub-version of your Acrobat.)  \n2. Wait for Preflight panel to load.  \n3. Wait for Preflight panel to initialize.  \n4. Wait for Preflight panel to display.  \n5. Click \"Options\" in the right hand corner.  \n6. Select \"Create Inventory\" from the menu.  \n7. Switch off any items you are not immediately interested in.  \n8. Click OK, then wait some more while a detailed PDF is created.\n\nThe plus point is that this PDF is _extremely_ detailed ... except, after all this waiting, I see it displays lots of font information except the Notice. Hmmm ... Second attempt:\n\n1. Open the Preflight panel (then wait, etc.)  \n2. Click \"Options\" in the right hand corner.  \n3. Select \"Browse Internal Structure of all Document Fonts\" -- a treeview dialog opens  \n4. Open the sub-tree \"MinionPhoneticPro\"  \n5. Open the sub-tree \"Internal Structure\"  \n6. Open the sub-tree \"Font\" (!) -- and there is the Notice.\n\n"

I am forgetting the name, but I know they have a website. The name is on the first pages of the dictionary.\n\n"
