The main type will be set with JFRingmaster and the flyer will resemble an old circus poster, with portraits of the four artists. I'm really keen to find some graphics or a font with oval ornament frames for the portraits (they're all dressed up too), but I'm having trouble doing so. Can anyone help me?\n\nThanks from Louise\n\n ![](http://web.archive.org/web/20120119050156im_/http:/typophile.com/files/sideshow_6054.gif)\n\n",
